00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.823
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>

2
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.013
<v Speaker 2>My name is Barbara Ferrari and I am the </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial director at students in </v>

3
00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 2>support of free speech at York </v>
<v Speaker 2>University.</v>

4
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.373
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep all the insurance for tonight </v>
<v Speaker 2>short cause we really don't have any </v>

5
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:23.450
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.333
<v Speaker 2>if you're ever traveling downtown on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday night around seven o'clock and </v>

7
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you pass by the Isabelle Theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Isabel Bader theater,</v>

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.630
<v Speaker 2>you'll see hundreds of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 500 people lined up outside.</v>

9
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.170
<v Speaker 2>And you'll ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are there these older people,</v>

10
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.004
<v Speaker 2>younger people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is everyone just outside waiting in </v>

11
00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:42.730
<v Speaker 2>a line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's confusing.</v>

12
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.920
<v Speaker 2>You think maybe there's a celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

13
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out it's professor Peterson </v>

14
00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 2>discussing the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of the biblical stories.</v>

15
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds</v>

16
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

17
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Speaker 2>hundreds and hundreds of people sold out</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowds every single week.</v>

18
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 2>And I often ask myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it about Professor Peterson that</v>

19
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 2>just attract such a large audience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me personally,</v>

20
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.083
<v Speaker 2>it's how genuine he is when he speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many times you'll see them get on stage </v>

21
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:23.480
<v Speaker 2>and be emotional and you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>get that from many speakers.</v>

22
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Also the professors command of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>English language is,</v>

23
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 2>it's so eloquent and yet so simple to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand which use.</v>

24
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.024
<v Speaker 2>It's really unfound nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really amazing to have professor </v>

25
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:36.794
<v Speaker 2>Peterson here cause he was the initial </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiration behind students and support </v>

26
00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 2>a free speech.</v>

27
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.130
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

28
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.110
<v Speaker 2>on that note,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is my pleasure to introduce professor</v>

29
00:01:59.111 --> 00:01:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson.</v>

30
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

31
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to talk to you a bit briefly </v>
<v Speaker 3>about why postmodernism is wrong.</v>

32
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.543
<v Speaker 3>And I actually mean technically wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apart from ethically wrong and morally </v>

33
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 3>wrong and intellectually and emotionally</v>
<v Speaker 3>rolling practically wrong.</v>

34
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.190
<v Speaker 3>But I'll give the devil his due to begin</v>
<v Speaker 3>with because they are actually wrestling</v>

35
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 3>with quite a difficult problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the founders of postmodernism,</v>

36
00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:52.384
<v Speaker 3>we're by no means I'm unintelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals and they actually put their </v>

37
00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:57.484
<v Speaker 3>finger on quite an important problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The important problem that they put </v>

38
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.413
<v Speaker 3>their finger on was the fact that any </v>
<v Speaker 3>set of phenomena has a near infinite </v>

39
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.054
<v Speaker 3>number of potential interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that actually happens to be the </v>

40
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

41
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.150
<v Speaker 3>that that fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

42
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 3>was discovered simultaneously in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of different disciplines.</v>

43
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.373
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most surprising it was </v>

44
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:21.994
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence people ran into </v>

45
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:24.994
<v Speaker 3>that conundrum when they learned that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was much more difficult to make a </v>

46
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 3>machine that could perceive the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>that had originally been supposed,</v>

47
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to have autonomous robots</v>

48
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.221
<v Speaker 3>and or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

49
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 3>and functional artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>backed by the late sixties.</v>

50
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 3>And of course that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of the reason for that was that</v>

51
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:40.024
<v Speaker 3>the artificial intelligence researchers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were starting to instantiate </v>

52
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 3>perception into their machines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learned that charting your course in the</v>

53
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:48.634
<v Speaker 3>world might be a trivial problem in </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparison to determining how to </v>

54
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:52.984
<v Speaker 3>perceive the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is that there's </v>

55
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 3>a very large number of ways to perceive </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

56
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.713
<v Speaker 3>And the postmodernist actually caught </v>
<v Speaker 3>onto this and one of the claims they </v>

57
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 3>made was that while there's a near </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of ways to interpret any</v>

58
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 3>given text,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that actually also happens to be the</v>

59
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they said,</v>

60
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.724
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since there's a near infinite number of </v>

61
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:11.494
<v Speaker 3>ways to interpret any texts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know that any given </v>

62
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:13.984
<v Speaker 3>interpretation should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should take precedence over any other </v>

63
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:17.074
<v Speaker 3>interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also a perfectly reasonable </v>

64
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.980
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

65
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.913
<v Speaker 3>they went off the rails very rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 3>after putting forward that set of </v>

66
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 3>propositions.</v>

67
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly why they also kept </v>
<v Speaker 3>their alliance with Marxism.</v>

68
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Because the problem with postmodernism </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally is that if you,</v>

69
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.473
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with the proposition that all </v>

70
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 3>interpretations of all phenomena are of </v>
<v Speaker 3>equal value or lack of value,</v>

71
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:38.194
<v Speaker 3>then you can't act in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with that is that if </v>

72
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:41.104
<v Speaker 3>you're a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to act in the world because </v>

73
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

74
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 3>you suffer miserably and then you die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to be,</v>

75
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 3>that seems to be an unacceptable outcome</v>
<v Speaker 3>for most people.</v>

76
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.270
<v Speaker 3>So the issue with postmodernism isn't so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much the,</v>

77
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.323
<v Speaker 3>the erroneous claim that there are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>large number of interpretations for any </v>

78
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 3>given phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the meaning of a text.</v>

79
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.773
<v Speaker 3>The error in postmodernism is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>failure to recognize that there are a </v>

80
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 3>finite number of credible </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretations of phenomena.</v>

81
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.453
<v Speaker 3>And also a refusal to engage with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual problem that determining </v>

82
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 3>what that finite set might actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>consist of.</v>

83
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.190
<v Speaker 3>And I will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just give you a very brief overview</v>

84
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 3>of how it is that we happen to solve </v>
<v Speaker 3>this problem as human beings.</v>

85
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 3>And we do it partly biologically because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we inhabit a biological framework that's</v>

86
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 3>been developed over the course of about </v>
<v Speaker 3>3.5 million years.</v>

87
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 3>That severely constrains the manner in </v>
<v Speaker 3>which we interpret the world.</v>

88
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 3>And it constrains it such that we tend </v>
<v Speaker 3>to only manifests,</v>

89
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.044
<v Speaker 3>spontaneously manifest interpretations </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world that don't result in undue </v>

90
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:42.004
<v Speaker 3>suffering and our demise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's plenty of ways to be stupid </v>

91
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:45.754
<v Speaker 3>enough to parish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's plenty of ways to be stupid </v>

92
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:48.184
<v Speaker 3>enough to suffer without meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there aren't very many ways to live </v>

93
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:51.844
<v Speaker 3>properly and carefully for a long period</v>
<v Speaker 3>of time in a manner that doesn't also </v>

94
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 3>similar caneously do harm to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

95
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.063
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the second set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>constraints is that you have biological </v>

96
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 3>constraints on your perception.</v>

97
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Then they're built in as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a Darwinian process.</v>

98
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.234
<v Speaker 3>And the second part is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>forced to interact with yourself now in </v>

99
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:10.814
<v Speaker 3>this week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next week and the week after and the </v>

100
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 3>month after and the year after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to conduct yourself in a way</v>

101
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't interfere with your future </v>
<v Speaker 3>life as you're living now.</v>

102
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:20.414
<v Speaker 3>And simultaneously you have to conduct </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in a way that makes all the </v>

103
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:24.044
<v Speaker 3>other people around you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperate with you and compete with you </v>

104
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.620
<v Speaker 3>and maintain their relationship with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do that today and next week and next</v>

105
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 3>month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next year and so on into the future.</v>

106
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:34.094
<v Speaker 3>So there are sip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although there are very large number of </v>

107
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:37.034
<v Speaker 3>interpretations of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are unbelievably severe </v>

108
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 3>constraints on the number of functional </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretations there are in the world.</v>

109
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:43.844
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanities was supposed to be educating </v>

110
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:47.054
<v Speaker 3>people with regards towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding was what the universe of </v>

111
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 3>those finite functional interpretations </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be.</v>

112
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.043
<v Speaker 3>And that's been more or less abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the universities under the guise of </v>

113
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

114
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.503
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the postmodernist is dare </v>

115
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 3>to be Marxist is also something that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>find,</v>

116
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 3>I would say not so much intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 3>reprehensible,</v>

117
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 3>as morally repugnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that,</v>

118
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists postmodern,</v>

119
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Neo Marxists continually claim is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have nothing but compassion for the</v>

120
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:16.034
<v Speaker 3>downtrodden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say that anybody with more </v>

121
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:18.944
<v Speaker 3>than a cursory knowledge of 20th century</v>
<v Speaker 3>history who dares to claim </v>

122
00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:22.944
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously that they have compassion</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the downtrodden and that they're </v>

123
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:26.564
<v Speaker 3>marxists are revealing either their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignorance of history that is so </v>

124
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 3>astounding that it's actually a form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>miracle or a kind of</v>

125
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.013
<v Speaker 3>aura kind of malevolence that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>reprehensible that it's almost </v>

126
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 3>unspeakable because we already ran the </v>
<v Speaker 3>equity experiment over the course of the</v>

127
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:45.250
<v Speaker 3>20th century and we already know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

128
00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 3>the Marxist doctrines have done for all </v>
<v Speaker 3>press people all around the world.</v>

129
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.030
<v Speaker 3>And the answer that mostly was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison,</v>

130
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 3>in slave imprisoned them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enslaved them,</v>

131
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 3>work them to death or execute them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as far as I can tell,</v>

132
00:07:57.321 --> 00:08:00.350
<v Speaker 3>that's not precisely commensurate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>any message of compassion.</v>

133
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.633
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't think that the postmodern</v>
<v Speaker 3>neo Marxist have a leg to stand on </v>

134
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 3>ethically or intellectually or </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally or,</v>

135
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.423
<v Speaker 3>and I think that they should be gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>after as hard as possible from an </v>

136
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 3>intellectual perspective and informed </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual perspective.</v>

137
00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 3>And this is fundamentally a war of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

138
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.313
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the level of analysis that it </v>

139
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:19.940
<v Speaker 3>should be thought upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not only is it a war of ideas,</v>

140
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one that can be one because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the,</v>

141
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 3>especially the French intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists or a pack of,</v>

142
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call them?</v>

143
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we could start with charlatans.</v>

144
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one.</v>

145
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 3>So pseudo intellectual would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Resentful would be another.</v>

146
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 3>And then I would also consider them </v>
<v Speaker 3>highly,</v>

147
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.083
<v Speaker 3>they're highly deceptive in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual strategies because almost </v>

148
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 3>all of them were Marxists student </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals.</v>

149
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:45.650
<v Speaker 3>And they knew by the time the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 3>archipelago came out.</v>

150
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 3>And even before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

151
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:47.960
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

152
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 3>the nightmares of the Soviet Union and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Maoist China were of such magnitude that</v>

153
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:53.024
<v Speaker 3>they had completely invalidated any </v>
<v Speaker 3>claim to ethical justification that the </v>

154
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:58.690
<v Speaker 3>fundamental Marxist doctrines had ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>managed to manage,</v>

155
00:08:58.691 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 3>to mount accessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's an,</v>

156
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.970
<v Speaker 3>it's a no go zone as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned.</v>

157
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 3>Intellectually the game's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've already figured out that there are</v>

158
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.194
<v Speaker 3>finite constraints on interpretation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we also understand why those exist and </v>

159
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:11.544
<v Speaker 3>how they evolved in from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the perspective of of political </v>

160
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.513
<v Speaker 3>argumentation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's absolutely no excuse whatsoever </v>

161
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:21.120
<v Speaker 3>in the 21st century to put forth Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrines as if they're the,</v>

162
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 3>the bomb that's needed by the compassion</v>
<v Speaker 3>to then buy the bomb that's administered</v>

163
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 3>by the Compassionate to the downtrodden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

164
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 3>tried that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't work.</v>

165
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 3>We got 100 million corpses to prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's plenty for me.</v>

166
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:33.894
<v Speaker 3>And if it's not enough for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then you should do some serious </v>

167
00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 3>thinking either about your historical </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge or about your moral character.</v>

168
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.433
<v Speaker 3>So that's the first.</v>

169
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

170
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.993
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the next thing is what to do about </v>

171
00:09:54.111 --> 00:09:54.944
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think I thought about a lot of </v>

172
00:09:56.391 --> 00:09:57.224
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what might be done about it apart </v>

173
00:09:58.251 --> 00:10:01.100
<v Speaker 3>from just talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which seems to be reasonably effective,</v>

174
00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:01.934
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought for awhile that it would be </v>

175
00:10:04.641 --> 00:10:06.140
<v Speaker 3>useful for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>

176
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.281
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

177
00:10:07.281 --> 00:10:09.020
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the political systems,</v>

178
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.720
<v Speaker 3>people who are running the political </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems to consider doing something like</v>

179
00:10:11.721 --> 00:10:12.554
<v Speaker 3>cutting the funding of universities by </v>
<v Speaker 3>25% and letting them fight over the </v>

180
00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:17.270
<v Speaker 3>remains and hopefully what that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>

181
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.513
<v Speaker 3>hopefully that would mean that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pseudo disciplines such as women's </v>

182
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:26.784
<v Speaker 3>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which never had a methodology to </v>

183
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 3>methodology that was credible to begin </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

184
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:34.560
<v Speaker 3>And I would put in the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>classification all the ethnic and racial</v>

185
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 3>studies groups that are popping up on </v>
<v Speaker 3>campuses like mad under the guise of,</v>

186
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.330
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of true disciplines,</v>

187
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.400
<v Speaker 3>which the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in any sense of the imagination,</v>

188
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.593
<v Speaker 3>but also or any sets of the word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also increasingly the social </v>

189
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:46.254
<v Speaker 3>sciences and the general humanities that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been corrupted quite terribly by </v>

190
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 3>the postmodern doctrines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

191
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.173
<v Speaker 3>well maybe it would be good to see if </v>
<v Speaker 3>the funding could be cut for them </v>

192
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.533
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's no reason that the </v>

193
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 3>public at large should be funding a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifth column whose aim is to disrupt the</v>

194
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:02.394
<v Speaker 3>fundamental structures of Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization with tax money that's </v>

195
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 3>devoted to supporting people while </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it.</v>

196
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd</v>

197
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:18.933
<v Speaker 3>like to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be nice if that was a paranoid </v>

198
00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:23.620
<v Speaker 3>delusion and of course when I first </v>
<v Speaker 3>started talking about this,</v>

199
00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:24.454
<v Speaker 3>the first thing that people thought and </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite rightly was who the hell is this </v>

200
00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:30.010
<v Speaker 3>crazy professor and how many things </v>
<v Speaker 3>might there be wrong with him?</v>

201
00:11:30.011 --> 00:11:30.844
<v Speaker 3>Which is exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what you should think </v>

202
00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:34.420
<v Speaker 3>when someone stands up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

203
00:11:34.421 --> 00:11:35.254
<v Speaker 3>you know this system that you guys all </v>
<v Speaker 3>think is going really well and that's </v>

204
00:11:37.481 --> 00:11:40.630
<v Speaker 3>been going wrong well for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something seriously rotten about</v>

205
00:11:40.631 --> 00:11:42.070
<v Speaker 3>it that you should be paying attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

206
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.010
<v Speaker 3>The first thing you should think of is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

207
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.863
<v Speaker 3>what makes you think you're not insane?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because that is the right that is </v>

208
00:11:48.251 --> 00:11:50.140
<v Speaker 3>the right answer under those </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances.</v>

209
00:11:50.141 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 3>But it turned out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least as far as I can tell,</v>

210
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 3>that I'm not actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that the things that,</v>

211
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 3>and if the things that I were pointing </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

212
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 3>we're actually factual and what happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Canada at least,</v>

213
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 3>and I would say to some degree around </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

214
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:02.644
<v Speaker 3>was that as journalists who actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to be concerned about free </v>

215
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:06.460
<v Speaker 3>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally speaking,</v>

216
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:07.294
<v Speaker 3>started to look into the claims that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was making about such things as the </v>

217
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:10.444
<v Speaker 3>legislative policies surrounding bill c </v>
<v Speaker 3>16 they realized that I was actually </v>

218
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:14.554
<v Speaker 3>just reading what was written on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>page and understanding it instead of </v>

219
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 3>trying to blow something out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>proportion,</v>

220
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 3>which I had absolutely no motivation </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever to do.</v>

221
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:23.861
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

222
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:25.870
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

223
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

224
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:28.204
<v Speaker 3>you can't have political interference </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the universities because what </v>

225
00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:32.140
<v Speaker 3>happens is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

226
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:32.974
<v Speaker 3>you think what happens is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>arm the politicians so that they can </v>

227
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 3>start telling the universities what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can and cannot teach,</v>

228
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:39.214
<v Speaker 3>even with regards to funding is then </v>
<v Speaker 3>that goes seriously sideways very </v>

229
00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:42.694
<v Speaker 3>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you don't end up with a result that </v>

230
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:45.850
<v Speaker 3>you wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you end up with some other result?</v>

231
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Because you know how it is when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>allow one organization to interfere with</v>

232
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:51.184
<v Speaker 3>the autonomous function of another is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it isn't the people that you want </v>

233
00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 3>to do with the regulating that end up </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the regulating and the things that</v>

234
00:12:56.831 --> 00:12:59.560
<v Speaker 3>you end up getting regulated aren't the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you want to stop.</v>

235
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:00.394
<v Speaker 3>So that's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think I have a better idea and I </v>

236
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:08.551
<v Speaker 3>think better idea is that the postmodern</v>
<v Speaker 3>or should be starved at their source.</v>

237
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

238
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.343
<v Speaker 3>I don't use that terminology lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what needs to happen is </v>

239
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:17.500
<v Speaker 3>that freshmen and second year university</v>
<v Speaker 3>students and,</v>

240
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.393
<v Speaker 3>and students coming into university from</v>
<v Speaker 3>high school and need to be educated </v>

241
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:22.144
<v Speaker 3>about the postmodern cult and they need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be encouraged to not take the </v>

242
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 3>courses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just drop the courses,</v>

243
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:29.890
<v Speaker 3>to just stay the hell away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the humanities enrollments have been</v>

244
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:33.520
<v Speaker 3>declining precipitously since the 1960s </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a big part of that is that,</v>

245
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.743
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why in the world would you go as a half </v>

246
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:39.930
<v Speaker 3>confused high school student into </v>
<v Speaker 3>university and get whatever shreds of,</v>

247
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.003
<v Speaker 3>of culture that you're still clinging to</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep your poor head above water in </v>

248
00:13:43.631 --> 00:13:45.820
<v Speaker 3>the sea of chaos that threatens to </v>
<v Speaker 3>surround you,</v>

249
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.713
<v Speaker 3>taken away by your professors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're stripped bare of anything but </v>

250
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:50.224
<v Speaker 3>some vague sense that maybe you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible racist unconsciously in some </v>

251
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:56.110
<v Speaker 3>manner that you can't detect and then be</v>
<v Speaker 3>left with nothing that,</v>

252
00:13:56.111 --> 00:13:56.944
<v Speaker 3>that for your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your hundred thousand dollar </v>

253
00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:00.160
<v Speaker 3>investment in your bloody student loan.</v>

254
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Speaker 3>So people are smart enough maybe not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to enroll in that sort of thing</v>

255
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:05.734
<v Speaker 3>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the humanities have been being </v>

256
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:09.430
<v Speaker 3>decimated since the 1960s as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence.</v>

257
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.740
<v Speaker 3>But it's time for that process to </v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerate.</v>

258
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 3>And so here's something cool that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened this week,</v>

259
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:15.650
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

260
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.073
<v Speaker 3>I decided a couple of weeks ago to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>a postmodern lexicon and I started </v>

261
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.423
<v Speaker 3>analyzing word use in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was gathering abstracts from this </v>

262
00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 3>twitter site called new real peer </v>
<v Speaker 3>review,</v>

263
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 3>which is something that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists really hate</v>

264
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.510
<v Speaker 3>because of course what new real peer </v>
<v Speaker 3>reviewed does this take actual published</v>

265
00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:38.440
<v Speaker 3>abstracts from postmodern humanities </v>
<v Speaker 3>journals,</v>

266
00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:39.274
<v Speaker 3>which by the way have a zero citation </v>
<v Speaker 3>rate of 80% and merely and merely </v>

267
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:44.434
<v Speaker 3>republish them and the abstracts are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>reprehensible and so incoherent and so </v>

268
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.163
<v Speaker 3>cult like an ideologically addled that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who wrote them get irritated </v>

269
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 3>when other people read them.</v>

270
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 3>I know which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a good,</v>

271
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 3>because the original,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real peer review,</v>

272
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:04.880
<v Speaker 3>which was the first one was shut down by</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are irritated that the people</v>

273
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:05.714
<v Speaker 3>who ran the twitter site had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unmitigated gall to actually publicize </v>

274
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.230
<v Speaker 3>writing that was written to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>publicized.</v>

275
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:13.064
<v Speaker 3>It was like the only situation I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen were authors were actually </v>

276
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:19.490
<v Speaker 3>embarrassed that someone did what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could to publicize what they'd written.</v>

277
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.743
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new real peer review picked up where </v>

278
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:22.844
<v Speaker 3>they stopped and has been publishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstracts like mad from these crazy </v>

279
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:27.270
<v Speaker 3>postmodern journals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

280
00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:28.104
<v Speaker 3>what's your journal is only a name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I started to pull out key key </v>

281
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.053
<v Speaker 3>words were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you a little bit about that </v>

282
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:34.340
<v Speaker 3>game in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

283
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.100
<v Speaker 3>I started to pull out key words that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were emblematic of the,</v>

284
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 3>let's call it the postmodern cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I thought,</v>

285
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I generated questionnaire that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents of university students and,</v>

286
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.013
<v Speaker 3>and late stage high school students and </v>
<v Speaker 3>freshman in university and maybe second </v>

287
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:49.004
<v Speaker 3>year students could use as a guideline </v>
<v Speaker 3>so they could look at the course </v>

288
00:15:51.441 --> 00:15:56.390
<v Speaker 3>descriptions and checkoff word frequency</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the postmodern list and decide that</v>

289
00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:57.224
<v Speaker 3>if the course was part of the postmodern</v>
<v Speaker 3>cult that they should maybe just not </v>

290
00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:00.560
<v Speaker 3>take it.</v>

291
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.950
<v Speaker 3>But then I got um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real interesting email from a guy,</v>

292
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 3>I won't tell you his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who's a computer programmer.</v>

293
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:10.370
<v Speaker 3>And he put together an AI system to </v>
<v Speaker 3>parse apart postmodern,</v>

294
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:11.563
<v Speaker 3>the postmodern lexicon automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he set up a website now where </v>

295
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:19.031
<v Speaker 3>students can feed in course descriptions</v>
<v Speaker 3>of any sort and it will spit out whether</v>

296
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.440
<v Speaker 3>or not they're postmodern and he's,</v>

297
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.800
<v Speaker 3>we're developing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the point is to get the,</v>

298
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.640
<v Speaker 3>to get the program up to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can automatically distinguish between</v>

299
00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:37.474
<v Speaker 3>postmodern and non postmodern content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then students will be able to cut </v>

300
00:16:40.661 --> 00:16:41.494
<v Speaker 3>and paste a course description and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and paste it into the analysis box on </v>

301
00:16:44.861 --> 00:16:45.694
<v Speaker 3>this website along with the professor's </v>
<v Speaker 3>name and the course's name and the </v>

302
00:16:48.581 --> 00:16:49.414
<v Speaker 3>discipline and the university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we should be able to produce a </v>

303
00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:52.744
<v Speaker 3>listing of every university in every </v>
<v Speaker 3>course that people are willing to </v>

304
00:16:55.571 --> 00:16:59.800
<v Speaker 3>participate in analyzing across North </v>
<v Speaker 3>America and set up a list of courses and</v>

305
00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:02.020
<v Speaker 3>professors and disciplines that should </v>
<v Speaker 3>be avoided.</v>

306
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.233
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so maybe we can start them out at </v>

307
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:04.960
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

308
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.310
<v Speaker 1>source and that's what should happen.</v>

309
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:14.853
<v Speaker 3>So it has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be bottom up as far as I can </v>

310
00:17:17.381 --> 00:17:20.590
<v Speaker 3>tell for this to come to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it should come to an end because the</v>

311
00:17:20.591 --> 00:17:23.470
<v Speaker 3>postmodern neo Marxist doctrine is </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing but a cult,</v>

312
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.363
<v Speaker 3>except that it's the sort of cult that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have enough economic sense to </v>

313
00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:29.920
<v Speaker 3>run itself out of profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not only is it a cult,</v>

314
00:17:29.921 --> 00:17:31.420
<v Speaker 3>it's a failed cult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if it was so,</v>

315
00:17:31.421 --> 00:17:32.254
<v Speaker 3>it's a cult that has to be subsidized by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the public purse in order to exist at </v>

316
00:17:34.901 --> 00:17:35.734
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like you'll have some pretty </v>

317
00:17:36.551 --> 00:17:39.610
<v Speaker 3>damn pathetic cult because normally if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a decent cult leader,</v>

318
00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:42.160
<v Speaker 3>you can at least figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick the pockets of your,</v>

319
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.500
<v Speaker 3>of your victims in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 3>enriches you.</v>

320
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.800
<v Speaker 3>So I can't even manage to get that </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

321
00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:48.634
<v Speaker 3>which I think accounts for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>anticapitalist biased because they </v>

322
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:51.864
<v Speaker 3>haven't been able to transform their </v>
<v Speaker 3>radiological doctrine into some way of </v>

323
00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 3>making themselves spontaneously rich.</v>

324
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.833
<v Speaker 3>Although it certainly seems to have done</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great job of late ladling students </v>

325
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:01.464
<v Speaker 3>with observed levels of student loans in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States is exactly the point </v>

326
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:05.094
<v Speaker 3>in their life where they should be free </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make entrepreneurial decisions and </v>

327
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 3>take some risks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also something that I regard as</v>

328
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:10.314
<v Speaker 3>absolutely reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So universities have figured out how to </v>

329
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:13.884
<v Speaker 3>conspire in some sense to pick the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future pockets of the students that </v>

330
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:19.620
<v Speaker 3>they're purporting to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to educate.</v>

331
00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:21.700
<v Speaker 3>And they're not educating them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're indoctrinating them,</v>

332
00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:24.480
<v Speaker 3>they're not teaching them how to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not teaching them how to debate.</v>

333
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:25.314
<v Speaker 3>They're not teaching them how to write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not introducing them to the </v>

334
00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:29.910
<v Speaker 3>classical wisdom of the western Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian tradition.</v>

335
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 3>And that's an absent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely appalling.</v>

336
00:18:32.281 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's what the bloody institution</v>
<v Speaker 3>was there for to begin with.</v>

337
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:35.790
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it's supposed to be.</v>

338
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

339
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what else do I have to tell you about</v>

340
00:18:52.641 --> 00:18:53.474
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

341
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just have one more thing.</v>

343
00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:03.970
<v Speaker 3>I guess that one of the things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite was quite curious about was,</v>

344
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.833
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

345
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:05.780
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

346
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.613
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you about two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I was quite curious </v>

347
00:19:08.331 --> 00:19:09.164
<v Speaker 3>about is the postmodern say neo Marxists</v>
<v Speaker 3>insistence that the only true human </v>

348
00:19:13.281 --> 00:19:14.114
<v Speaker 3>motivation is power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I've been thinking about that in a </v>

349
00:19:16.011 --> 00:19:16.844
<v Speaker 3>couple of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was actually Marxist </v>

350
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:19.463
<v Speaker 3>sleight of hand at the end of the 1960s </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the original Marxist </v>

351
00:19:22.041 --> 00:19:26.360
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary doctrine was that Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>

352
00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:29.630
<v Speaker 3>let's say capitalist society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can think about it more broadly.</v>

353
00:19:29.631 --> 00:19:30.464
<v Speaker 3>A society in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's basically best conceptualized as a </v>

354
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.793
<v Speaker 3>zero sum zero sum game fought to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>death between the oppressors and the </v>

355
00:19:38.451 --> 00:19:41.180
<v Speaker 3>oppressed and be the proletariat and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bourgeoisie let's say.</v>

356
00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:42.014
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we as we know playing that game in </v>

357
00:19:43.971 --> 00:19:45.860
<v Speaker 3>places like Soviet Union and mouse </v>
<v Speaker 3>charring,</v>

358
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.690
<v Speaker 3>it didn't work out so well for every one</v>
<v Speaker 3>sold.</v>

359
00:19:47.691 --> 00:19:50.330
<v Speaker 3>There were seem to be a fundamental flaw</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the conceptualization.</v>

360
00:19:50.331 --> 00:19:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Although people could always excuse that</v>
<v Speaker 3>by saying,</v>

361
00:19:52.431 --> 00:19:53.264
<v Speaker 3>well that's not real communism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the sort of statement that </v>

362
00:19:55.371 --> 00:19:58.320
<v Speaker 3>should immediately get you punched in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nose hard enough to knock you out</v>

363
00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.273
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned.</v>

364
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.950
<v Speaker 3>So because the statement like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>reveals only one thing,</v>

365
00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:08.784
<v Speaker 3>and what it reveals is that if you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been fortunate enough to be in the </v>

366
00:20:10.801 --> 00:20:11.634
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the position of Joseph's tell him that </v>

367
00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:13.674
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't have been quite the </v>
<v Speaker 3>murderous monster that he was because </v>

368
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:16.254
<v Speaker 3>your moral character is such that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have been swayed by access to </v>

369
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Speaker 3>that kind of extreme power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're,</v>

370
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.983
<v Speaker 3>if you dare to make that claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's some things about yourself </v>

371
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.940
<v Speaker 3>and humanity that you should learn and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you should learn them rapidly before you</v>

372
00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:30.240
<v Speaker 3>pose more of a danger to yourself then </v>
<v Speaker 3>and others then you already post.</v>

373
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.910
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then,</v>

374
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:37.860
<v Speaker 3>so part of it is the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned the Marxist emphasis on economics</v>

375
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:40.130
<v Speaker 3>into an emphasis on power in the 1970 </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

376
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.003
<v Speaker 3>And I think they did that as a form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleight of hand because by the late </v>

377
00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:44.304
<v Speaker 3>1960s and early 1970s it was obvious </v>
<v Speaker 3>even to people as intransigent as </v>

378
00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:48.964
<v Speaker 3>someone as Saint John Paul Sartre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one who refused to denounce the </v>

379
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 3>communist party until that late in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that progression of the 20th century,</v>

380
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 3>it became obvious even to people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

381
00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:58.324
<v Speaker 3>that there was just no way that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could maintain your intellectual and </v>

382
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:04.720
<v Speaker 3>moral credibility and remain a supporter</v>
<v Speaker 3>of standard communist doctrine.</v>

383
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 3>And also it seemed to be the case that </v>
<v Speaker 3>strangely enough,</v>

384
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:08.614
<v Speaker 3>contrary to Marxists prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the working class in the West was </v>

385
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:13.450
<v Speaker 3>getting richer and richer than people </v>
<v Speaker 3>had ever got in history,</v>

386
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:16.150
<v Speaker 3>rather than being increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 3>downtrodden by the brute.</v>

387
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.440
<v Speaker 3>He'll of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

388
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:18.274
<v Speaker 3>of the corporate and capitalist elite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was not a revolution that was </v>

389
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:24.640
<v Speaker 3>particularly easy to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of the sleight of hand was,</v>

390
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.770
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about economic power,</v>

391
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 3>it's about oppression and oppressed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressor on a broader sense.</v>

392
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 3>And that's where we got the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation into identity politics,</v>

393
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 3>which is just the Marxist oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressed doctrine.</v>

394
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:38.044
<v Speaker 3>Under a new guys and I think it's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendously reprehensible for people </v>

395
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:42.484
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be conducting themselves </v>

396
00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:44.944
<v Speaker 3>intellectually in a manner that insists </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the most important element of any </v>

397
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 3>student or any person for that matter is</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever racial,</v>

398
00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:55.840
<v Speaker 3>gender and sex identity happens to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>flavor of the month.</v>

399
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.673
<v Speaker 3>And I think the problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally is first of all that that </v>

400
00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:00.964
<v Speaker 3>those categories systems are </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily loose and there </v>

401
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.990
<v Speaker 3>indefinitely multiply bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

402
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:07.060
<v Speaker 3>because if you take any given </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>

403
00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 3>there's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's the postmodern problem.</v>

404
00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:10.240
<v Speaker 3>Ha Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>

405
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.283
<v Speaker 3>It's the postmodern problem that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost an infinite number of ways to </v>

406
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:14.194
<v Speaker 3>categories any given individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how the hell you figure out which </v>

407
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:19.960
<v Speaker 3>group they belong to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually a major problem.</v>

408
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:23.200
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're one eighth black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that make you exactly?</v>

409
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:24.880
<v Speaker 3>Are you black?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you white?</v>

410
00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Are you oppressed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you oppressor?</v>

411
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.030
<v Speaker 3>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you,</v>

412
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.780
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one half is oppressed as someone who's a</v>

413
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.613
<v Speaker 3>quarter black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it work out arithmetically that </v>

414
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:34.301
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

415
00:22:34.301 --> 00:22:36.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm dead serious about this man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

416
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.990
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to play this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>

417
00:22:37.991 --> 00:22:40.180
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly the question that has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be asked,</v>

418
00:22:40.181 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then how do you,</v>

419
00:22:41.681 --> 00:22:44.680
<v Speaker 3>how do you multiply up you're oppressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>identities and then again,</v>

420
00:22:44.681 --> 00:22:45.514
<v Speaker 3>who decides who gets to decide exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>which identity you should manifest and </v>

421
00:22:48.461 --> 00:22:49.294
<v Speaker 3>then how do we rank order those </v>
<v Speaker 3>identities and then how do we equate </v>

422
00:22:51.611 --> 00:22:52.444
<v Speaker 3>between them and what measurement </v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques do we use to determine who's </v>

423
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.013
<v Speaker 3>who's oppressed and who isn't and how do</v>
<v Speaker 3>we assess equality and on what </v>

424
00:22:58.661 --> 00:22:59.494
<v Speaker 3>dimensions are we going to assess </v>
<v Speaker 3>equality and who's going to enforce it </v>

425
00:23:01.811 --> 00:23:03.220
<v Speaker 3>and who's going to make the decisions?</v>

426
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:03.821
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

427
00:23:03.821 --> 00:23:05.530
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll figure that out as we go along.</v>

428
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:06.281
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

429
00:23:06.281 --> 00:23:08.440
<v Speaker 3>we certainly will and the results won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be pretty.</v>

430
00:23:08.441 --> 00:23:09.274
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the problem is actually </v>

431
00:23:11.321 --> 00:23:13.690
<v Speaker 3>unsolvable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all it'll mean is that those,</v>

432
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.553
<v Speaker 3>those categories will be made at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whim of the people who are making the </v>

433
00:23:17.171 --> 00:23:18.004
<v Speaker 3>categories and since as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing they believe in power is </v>

434
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:22.324
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the only thing they believe in his </v>

435
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:24.874
<v Speaker 3>power is that you can be absolutely sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they will have absolutely no </v>

436
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:28.204
<v Speaker 3>hesitancy whatsoever to use power in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeking of their aims and I think the </v>

437
00:23:31.991 --> 00:23:32.824
<v Speaker 3>other reason that all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernist new Marxists ever do is </v>

438
00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:35.974
<v Speaker 3>talk about power is because they want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>justify their use of power to get </v>

439
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:39.850
<v Speaker 3>exactly what they want when they want </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

440
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.650
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing but power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

441
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.510
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's nothing but power,</v>

442
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:46.290
<v Speaker 3>that means we're at more power and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

443
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.510
<v Speaker 3>that's the claim that you make.</v>

444
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.343
<v Speaker 3>Then you can justify the use of power </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there isn't anything else to </v>

445
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 3>turn to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no logic,</v>

446
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:54.260
<v Speaker 3>there's no dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no consensus,</v>

447
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:56.600
<v Speaker 3>there's no discussion between well </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning people,</v>

448
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:57.643
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing but divisions between </v>
<v Speaker 3>power groups and identity groups and </v>

449
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.600
<v Speaker 3>hobbsy in state of war between all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

450
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I look at people aiming at that,</v>

451
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.773
<v Speaker 3>they're not then my proclivity as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalyst just to think that that's </v>

452
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:12.410
<v Speaker 3>exactly what they want and to divide us </v>
<v Speaker 3>off all by race and ethnicity and sexual</v>

453
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:13.244
<v Speaker 3>identity and sexual preference and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual expression and gender identity </v>

454
00:24:16.491 --> 00:24:17.324
<v Speaker 3>and all of these multiplying forces of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of group identities seems to be nothing </v>

455
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:24.440
<v Speaker 3>but an invitation to chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what I see looming.</v>

456
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.543
<v Speaker 3>And it needs to come to a stop and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to come to a stop as fast as </v>

457
00:24:27.801 --> 00:24:29.870
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one way of doing that is to stop the</v>

458
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:33.740
<v Speaker 3>universities from continuing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>indoctrinate young people who really,</v>

459
00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:36.350
<v Speaker 3>at least two at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know any better into play in these</v>

460
00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:37.184
<v Speaker 3>absolutely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say bordering on murderous </v>

461
00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:42.650
<v Speaker 3>intellectual games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

462
00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.860
<v Speaker 3>so then I'm going to set up this website</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe some other wasn't slight it.</v>

463
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.233
<v Speaker 3>And I'm going to do a series of videos </v>
<v Speaker 3>for young university students and for </v>

464
00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:04.864
<v Speaker 3>high school students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm going to tell them that perhaps </v>

465
00:25:06.911 --> 00:25:09.190
<v Speaker 3>they don't need to go to university to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be indoctrinated.</v>

466
00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:11.020
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps they could go to university to </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn.</v>

467
00:25:11.021 --> 00:25:11.854
<v Speaker 3>And if they want to know the difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between an educator and someone who's </v>

468
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.310
<v Speaker 3>merely interested in indoctrination and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the production of the next generation of</v>

469
00:25:18.311 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 3>pathetic wining radicals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they can use the,</v>

470
00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.283
<v Speaker 3>then they can use the website to </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinguish between people who are </v>

471
00:25:25.481 --> 00:25:26.314
<v Speaker 3>credible and people who aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe we can drop the damn </v>

472
00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:28.924
<v Speaker 3>enrollment in those horrible courses by </v>
<v Speaker 3>75% over the next three years and just </v>

473
00:25:31.991 --> 00:25:33.010
<v Speaker 3>stop it in its tracks.</v>

474
00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.360
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a part of the plan.</v>

475
00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:52.194
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

476
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.443
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something that's actually </v>

477
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.603
<v Speaker 3>implementable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things can turn around fast and </v>

478
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.473
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways that they'll turn around</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if people just stop taking the </v>

479
00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:04.294
<v Speaker 3>courses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what people need to do in order </v>

480
00:26:06.881 --> 00:26:11.881
<v Speaker 3>to know that they should stop taking the</v>
<v Speaker 3>courses is to know that these is to know</v>

481
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:15.010
<v Speaker 3>what it is that these courses are aiming</v>
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>

482
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.630
<v Speaker 3>So that needs to be explained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they need to know what language the</v>

483
00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:23.680
<v Speaker 3>people who teach these courses are using</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to fulfill those aims.</v>

484
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Then they need to know how to identify </v>
<v Speaker 3>the courses.</v>

485
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Then they need to know that it's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their best interest.</v>

486
00:26:29.771 --> 00:26:30.604
<v Speaker 3>Both I would say spiritually and </v>
<v Speaker 3>economically to avoid those courses and </v>

487
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:35.134
<v Speaker 3>those disciplines like the plague.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then maybe we can get the </v>

488
00:26:37.211 --> 00:26:38.044
<v Speaker 3>disciplines that have become entirely </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt and the ones that started that </v>

489
00:26:42.131 --> 00:26:42.964
<v Speaker 3>way to put themselves back together </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they run themselves out of </v>

490
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:47.490
<v Speaker 3>existence completely.</v>

491
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.323
<v Speaker 3>And I might as well name a few of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>disciplines that I think are </v>

492
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 3>particularly reprehensible to begin </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

493
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.423
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm painting this with a very broad </v>

494
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:55.494
<v Speaker 3>brush and I'm not making the claim that </v>
<v Speaker 3>every single person who engages in </v>

495
00:26:58.531 --> 00:26:59.364
<v Speaker 3>activity within all of these disciplines</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been corrupted beyond comprehension </v>

496
00:27:03.211 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 3>by the postmodernist neo Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's close enough.</v>

497
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 3>First pass approximation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

498
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said already,</v>

499
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:13.470
<v Speaker 3>women's studies and all the ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies in racial studies groups mad,</v>

500
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 3>those things have to go in that faster </v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

501
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:20.661
<v Speaker 3>the better they should never be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have been better had they never</v>

502
00:27:26.031 --> 00:27:27.590
<v Speaker 3>been part of the university to begin </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

503
00:27:27.591 --> 00:27:30.950
<v Speaker 3>As far as I can tell a sociology that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt,</v>

504
00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.650
<v Speaker 3>anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropology,</v>

505
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:37.110
<v Speaker 3>that's corrupt English literature that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt.</v>

506
00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:38.163
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the worst offender or the </v>

507
00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:41.820
<v Speaker 3>faculties of education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say,</v>

508
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.583
<v Speaker 3>I read the recent poll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read the recent policy documents have </v>

509
00:27:51.321 --> 00:27:53.300
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elementary teachers,</v>

510
00:27:53.301 --> 00:27:55.340
<v Speaker 3>Federation of Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can tell you,</v>

511
00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:57.110
<v Speaker 3>you can go read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right on your website.</v>

512
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.450
<v Speaker 3>Is that their plan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just say it,</v>

513
00:27:59.451 --> 00:28:01.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need any inferences.</v>

514
00:28:01.821 --> 00:28:02.654
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing implicit about it is to </v>

515
00:28:04.281 --> 00:28:05.114
<v Speaker 3>reorganize the curriculums from </v>
<v Speaker 3>kindergarten to grade eight so that </v>

516
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.233
<v Speaker 3>children are taught to be social justice</v>
<v Speaker 3>warriors from the moment they step foot </v>

517
00:28:10.701 --> 00:28:13.670
<v Speaker 3>in the public education system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what they're doing.</v>

518
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.420
<v Speaker 3>They're making that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're making this look.</v>

519
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean we have social justice tribunals </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Ontario.</v>

520
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.553
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not subtle in case you didn't </v>

521
00:28:22.881 --> 00:28:26.150
<v Speaker 3>notice to name them social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribunals,</v>

522
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.270
<v Speaker 3>that's not subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you see the same sort of language</v>

523
00:28:29.271 --> 00:28:30.081
<v Speaker 3>in the ETF.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

524
00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:33.080
<v Speaker 3>documents is that social justice is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right way to go.</v>

525
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:33.913
<v Speaker 3>The appropriate thing to do is to train </v>
<v Speaker 3>children to follow precisely that </v>

526
00:28:36.231 --> 00:28:37.910
<v Speaker 3>pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the best way to do it is to get them</v>

527
00:28:37.911 --> 00:28:39.480
<v Speaker 3>as young as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

528
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.420
<v Speaker 3>and that's the faculties of education </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

529
00:28:41.421 --> 00:28:44.660
<v Speaker 3>And they're not producing people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in educating children at all.</v>

530
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:45.973
<v Speaker 3>And they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking the easy route and what </v>

531
00:28:47.451 --> 00:28:48.284
<v Speaker 3>they're doing is training people who who</v>
<v Speaker 3>can memorize and then spew forth a one </v>

532
00:28:52.341 --> 00:28:55.010
<v Speaker 3>dimensional view of humanity and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the gall,</v>

533
00:28:55.011 --> 00:28:55.844
<v Speaker 3>the unmitigated gall to presume that </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they should be doing with children </v>

534
00:28:58.131 --> 00:28:58.964
<v Speaker 3>is indoctrinating them into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular line of thinking from his </v>

535
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:04.520
<v Speaker 3>early an age as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so faculties of education,</v>

536
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.890
<v Speaker 3>they need to be fixed and they need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be fixed fast.</v>

537
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.240
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where I'll stop,</v>

538
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.550
<v Speaker 3>one of the most shocking things I </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned this year,</v>

539
00:29:19.551 --> 00:29:20.880
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't really know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

540
00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:24.300
<v Speaker 3>I didn't learn this till I went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Queens University cause I went to Queens</v>

541
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.133
<v Speaker 3>University.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was invited there by a group of law </v>

542
00:29:25.891 --> 00:29:26.724
<v Speaker 3>students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

543
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 3>and I was their hope hypothetically to </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate bill see 16 and the students went</v>

544
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:34.800
<v Speaker 3>to all the law professors and asked them</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they would debate me and none of them</v>

545
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:36.600
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

546
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.381
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

547
00:29:37.381 --> 00:29:39.180
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that figures first of all,</v>

548
00:29:39.181 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>that's what I thought because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

549
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:43.000
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I thought,</v>

550
00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:43.834
<v Speaker 3>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty absurd because I'm a </v>

551
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:46.450
<v Speaker 3>psychology professor and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>law lawyers,</v>

552
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:49.300
<v Speaker 3>one thing lawyers are pretty good at is </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing if they're good lawyers.</v>

553
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.323
<v Speaker 3>I mean that in a complementary manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what you learned to do </v>

554
00:29:52.781 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 3>when you're a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn to speak,</v>

555
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:57.720
<v Speaker 3>you learn to formulate an argument and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn to forgive me,</v>

556
00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.073
<v Speaker 3>formulate an argument on virtually any </v>
<v Speaker 3>set of principles because you know </v>

557
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.160
<v Speaker 3>you're acting as defense or you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>acting as prosecution and you need to be</v>

558
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:06.994
<v Speaker 3>flexible on your feet and put forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best possible argument given the </v>

559
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:10.900
<v Speaker 3>facts at hand.</v>

560
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.730
<v Speaker 3>And they couldn't find anybody to debate</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

561
00:30:12.731 --> 00:30:13.564
<v Speaker 3>So Bruce Party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a professor there had to act as </v>

562
00:30:15.221 --> 00:30:17.110
<v Speaker 3>devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he did quite nicely,</v>

563
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 3>but I thought that was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty appalling to say the least,</v>

564
00:30:20.771 --> 00:30:25.250
<v Speaker 3>that they were either so ideologically </v>
<v Speaker 3>rigid that they wouldn't confront me on,</v>

565
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.000
<v Speaker 3>on their bloody territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if,</v>

566
00:30:28.001 --> 00:30:29.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the NFL,</v>

567
00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:33.700
<v Speaker 3>if a law professor from Queens wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>come and debate me about psychology,</v>

568
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:34.534
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be no problem with that because </v>

569
00:30:35.381 --> 00:30:36.214
<v Speaker 3>that after all is my field of expertise </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that a law professor </v>

570
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't come forward and debate me on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal matter.</v>

571
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:42.454
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know what to think about </v>

572
00:30:44.231 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things I did learn,</v>

573
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:47.134
<v Speaker 3>and I've really learned this more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that law has actually become corrupt </v>

574
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.880
<v Speaker 3>as well as a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not so much,</v>

575
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of lawyers and I've worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a lot,</v>

576
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:56.740
<v Speaker 3>but most of them have been more on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporate and business end of things.</v>

577
00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.080
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all the human rights law,</v>

578
00:30:59.081 --> 00:30:59.914
<v Speaker 3>all the law that doesn't seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>attached in some sense to business </v>

579
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 3>concerns has also become corrupt and </v>
<v Speaker 3>social justice oriented beyond belief.</v>

580
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:08.103
<v Speaker 3>And the students had queens were </v>
<v Speaker 3>complaining to me that they weren't </v>

581
00:31:10.031 --> 00:31:10.864
<v Speaker 3>lending any law in their courses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they were learning with social </v>

582
00:31:12.491 --> 00:31:13.324
<v Speaker 3>justice propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you bloody well better watch out </v>

583
00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:15.904
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you because the people who </v>

584
00:31:16.631 --> 00:31:17.464
<v Speaker 3>make your legislation or lawyers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're making plenty of legislation </v>

585
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 3>that is not in your best interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even worse than that,</v>

586
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.793
<v Speaker 3>perhaps it's not even in the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest of the people for whom the </v>

587
00:31:27.131 --> 00:31:27.964
<v Speaker 3>legislation purports to protect because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bloody legislation and the policies </v>

588
00:31:31.301 --> 00:31:34.860
<v Speaker 3>are so incoherent and so badly written </v>
<v Speaker 3>like bill [inaudible].</v>

589
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.913
<v Speaker 3>Here's one of the things it did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knows this and I can't believe </v>

590
00:31:38.051 --> 00:31:38.884
<v Speaker 3>they haven't noticed.</v>

591
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:39.963
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the strongest argument that gay people </v>

592
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:42.034
<v Speaker 3>have had for the last 50 years for being</v>
<v Speaker 3>included in broader society and let's </v>

593
00:31:44.921 --> 00:31:48.040
<v Speaker 3>say tolerated so to speak or welcomed </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that matter,</v>

594
00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:50.950
<v Speaker 3>is that it was a biological phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

595
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 3>and I'd say the evidence for that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming,</v>

596
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly suggestive.</v>

597
00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:55.624
<v Speaker 3>It's like bill see 16 is eradicated that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's predicated on the </v>

598
00:31:58.571 --> 00:32:01.120
<v Speaker 3>presupposition that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>

599
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:03.280
<v Speaker 3>that the relationship between biological</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>

600
00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:05.050
<v Speaker 3>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender expression,</v>

601
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.340
<v Speaker 3>and sexual proclivity is independent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They blew out the structure that enabled</v>

602
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:10.174
<v Speaker 3>them to make the argument for including </v>
<v Speaker 3>the written for pursuing the rights to </v>

603
00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:14.500
<v Speaker 3>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if I was a good,</v>

604
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:15.363
<v Speaker 3>hateful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing radical and feeling rather </v>

605
00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:19.360
<v Speaker 3>anti in my orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

606
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.980
<v Speaker 3>I might say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

607
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just something you learned,</v>

608
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:23.741
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

609
00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:26.500
<v Speaker 3>how bout you unlearn it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it's just your whim,</v>

610
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 3>well then why should I put up with it at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all?</v>

611
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually written into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>damned legislation now.</v>

612
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:32.263
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so watch the lawyers because they're </v>

613
00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:38.200
<v Speaker 3>being trained as social justice warriors</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're producing incoherent bits of</v>

614
00:32:38.201 --> 00:32:39.034
<v Speaker 3>legislation that are going to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of problems as they </v>

615
00:32:41.421 --> 00:32:43.940
<v Speaker 3>roll through the legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

616
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:46.550
<v Speaker 3>in closing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the closing is,</v>

617
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.200
<v Speaker 3>it's a war of ideas and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>educational problem.</v>

618
00:32:58.201 --> 00:33:01.140
<v Speaker 3>And what we're going to try to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>educate students well enough.</v>

619
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're making their course decisions so</v>

620
00:33:03.421 --> 00:33:04.254
<v Speaker 3>that they can stop being indoctrinated </v>
<v Speaker 3>by people who should have known better </v>

621
00:33:06.661 --> 00:33:07.494
<v Speaker 3>than to do that to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the plan for the next </v>

622
00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.070
<v Speaker 3>couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully it will be effective.</v>

623
00:33:11.071 --> 00:33:12.330
<v Speaker 3>So thank you.</v>
