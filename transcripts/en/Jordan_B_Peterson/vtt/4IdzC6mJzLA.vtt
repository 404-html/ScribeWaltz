1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.153
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm making an announcement today and </v>

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.003
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you might regard it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertisement so I'm warning you to </v>

3
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>begin with because I don't want you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>waste your time if you're not interested</v>

4
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>in listening to a description of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>newest thing that we've created.</v>

5
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.064
<v Speaker 1>So we just put up a website called </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand myself.com and it's a </v>

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.913
<v Speaker 1>personality assessment for individuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's based on a personality model </v>

7
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:31.254
<v Speaker 1>that was developed in my lab about 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago by Dr Colin De Young and a </v>

8
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.633
<v Speaker 1>Lien Dr Lena quilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Young is now a professor at the </v>

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>University of Minnesota and it was based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on some ideas that I had been developing</v>

10
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>with another former student of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Daniel Higgins,</v>

11
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>who's a partner with me in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise along with my former graduate</v>

12
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>supervisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Robert Peel from Mcgill University.</v>

13
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>It's based on the big five personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>model which measures extroversion,</v>

14
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.803
<v Speaker 1>which is a positive emotion dimension on</v>
<v Speaker 1>is associated with gregariousness and </v>

15
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm and assertiveness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociability and that sort of thing.</v>

16
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>a trait called neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically negative emotionality</v>

18
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>which is associated with a proclivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards anxiety and emotional pain,</v>

19
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is compassion and politeness.</v>

20
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 1>And so agreeable people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

21
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather maternal and their orientation,</v>

22
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>they tend to care more for others than </v>
<v Speaker 1>for themselves.</v>

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>They're more cooperative than </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>

24
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.134
<v Speaker 1>whereas so-called disagreeable people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more competitive and more Bruce Guy </v>

25
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:39.534
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps more straightforward and </v>

26
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>more able to stand up for themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

27
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.593
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness is another one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions that's orderliness and </v>

28
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.374
<v Speaker 1>industriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last dimension is openness to </v>

29
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:53.094
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a combination of interest and </v>

30
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>ideas which is often known as intellect </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a interest in aesthetics,</v>

31
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and which is associated,</v>

32
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:02.124
<v Speaker 1>let's say with creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the dimension that's also </v>

33
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:04.764
<v Speaker 1>most highly correlated with Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We developed the big five aspect scale </v>

34
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>in an attempt to take the big five.</v>

35
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>So that's extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

36
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.164
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and openness to </v>

37
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>experience which are the canonical </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of personality.</v>

38
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.193
<v Speaker 1>We developed the big five aspects scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to break down those big five </v>

39
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.663
<v Speaker 1>traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of them into their two most </v>

40
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:26.304
<v Speaker 1>statistically robust subcomponents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we call those aspects and that's </v>

41
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>actually become a pretty popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality model.</v>

42
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:33.624
<v Speaker 1>The scientific paper which announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a statistical division has accrued </v>

43
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.903
<v Speaker 1>about 750 citations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an awful lot of citations by </v>

44
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a scientific paper.</v>

45
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>It makes it into a kind of classic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.273
<v Speaker 1>especially because it's only also only </v>
<v Speaker 1>had 10 years to accrue citations and </v>

47
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.923
<v Speaker 1>citation is when some other scientists a</v>
<v Speaker 1>refers to the paper in one of their </v>

48
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

49
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.173
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working over the last couple </v>

50
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.153
<v Speaker 1>of years to generate really detailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality reports on each of the big </v>

51
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.144
<v Speaker 1>five traits and the 10 aspects at about </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven different levels of specificity </v>

52
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>ranging from extremely low to extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

53
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.333
<v Speaker 1>And we think we've produced what might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the most comprehensive and accurate </v>

54
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>personality reports that are currently </v>
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>

55
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>You answer 100 questions in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete the personality survey.</v>

56
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>The questions themselves are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>public access,</v>

57
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:27.244
<v Speaker 1>or you could call them open source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were derived from Lou Goldberg's </v>

58
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Ip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ip,</v>

59
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>international personality item,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool there the consequences of many,</v>

60
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:40.711
<v Speaker 1>many decades of attempts to define a set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of phrases that most comprehensively and</v>

61
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:43.624
<v Speaker 1>also most concisely captures the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation in human personality and so </v>

62
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>you can find those questions many places</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the line,</v>

63
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:51.064
<v Speaker 1>but the reports themselves and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison sample of approximately </v>

64
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:54.484
<v Speaker 1>10,000 people are proprietary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute the essential element of </v>

65
00:03:58.331 --> 00:03:59.164
<v Speaker 1>value in in our offering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially what we're hoping is that </v>

66
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:03.034
<v Speaker 1>people can use this personality test </v>
<v Speaker 1>site to develop a much deeper </v>

67
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>understanding of themselves so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what their light,</v>

68
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.323
<v Speaker 1>especially compared to others and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can also compare themselves to </v>

69
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>anyone else.</v>

70
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who might have taken the test and see.</v>

71
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.203
<v Speaker 1>The thing about personality is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between people actually run </v>

72
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>quite deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of individual variability,</v>

73
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>so there are people who are extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted and they want to spend every</v>

74
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:29.164
<v Speaker 1>moment of their time socializing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and there are people who </v>

75
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:32.554
<v Speaker 1>are very introverted and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work alone and they find interactions </v>

76
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.114
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With large groups of people or even </v>

77
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.184
<v Speaker 1>small group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes quite tiring and they have to </v>

78
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>spend a lot of time recovering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to be much more quiet,</v>

79
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.783
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily shy because that shyness</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more a consequence of variation on </v>

80
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:50.314
<v Speaker 1>the second dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and so people are high in </v>

81
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our field,</v>

82
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:54.454
<v Speaker 1>much more anxiety and emotional pain per</v>
<v Speaker 1>unit of uncertainty and stress than </v>

83
00:04:58.451 --> 00:04:59.284
<v Speaker 1>people who are very low in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are often known as emotionally </v>

84
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>stable and who tend to be quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperturbability.</v>

85
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Agreeable people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned before,</v>

86
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:08.044
<v Speaker 1>are warm and compassionate and and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much care for other people but are also </v>

87
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>likely to be taken advantage of and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel a certain amount of resentment.</v>

88
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.814
<v Speaker 1>Whereas disagreeable people are tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>and straightforward and competitive and </v>

89
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.623
<v Speaker 1>out for victory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can also be somewhat self centered </v>

90
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:26.040
<v Speaker 1>and harsh and then conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are hardworking and beautiful.</v>

91
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness is a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor of longterm life success,</v>

92
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:30.004
<v Speaker 1>especially in academic attainment where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's second only to icu and also in </v>

93
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:34.594
<v Speaker 1>managerial and administrative jobs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>require attention to detail and a fair </v>

94
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>bit of responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

95
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>and routine work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness to experience.</v>

96
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the creativity dimension and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are extremely high in openness to</v>

97
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:48.364
<v Speaker 1>experience and they want to do nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>but discuss ideas and and spend their </v>

98
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:52.414
<v Speaker 1>time in creative and artistic pursuits </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people are more conservative </v>

99
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:56.284
<v Speaker 1>because low openness is with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism and they're not really </v>

100
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>interested novel ideas and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think abstractly that often and they're.</v>

101
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.263
<v Speaker 1>They're not out for new experiences or </v>
<v Speaker 1>flights of fantasy or imaginative </v>

102
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:09.074
<v Speaker 1>exercises or any of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot more concrete and </v>

103
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

104
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:12.764
<v Speaker 1>The reports that we've prepared not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide you with information about all </v>

105
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:17.174
<v Speaker 1>of the aforementioned big five traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also break each one down into its </v>

106
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>dual aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's actually 15 different sources</v>

107
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>of information that are contained in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reports and so for extroversion,</v>

108
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>you get a description of the degree to </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you are assertive,</v>

109
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 1>which means forthcoming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

110
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 1>in public and and willing to put your </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions forward and enthusiasm,</v>

111
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>which is a more pure marker of positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and the capacity to look forward</v>

112
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 1>to and enjoy events and situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously.</v>

113
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>And with neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn about the trait aspects,</v>

114
00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.730
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal and volatility and withdrawal</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the tendency to be stymied or,</v>

115
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 1>or stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

116
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 1>by fear to be frozen in some sense like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a prey animal.</v>

117
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 1>And volatility is an aspect that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with irritability.</v>

118
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.290
<v Speaker 1>And the tendency to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.410
<v Speaker 1>be easily rubbed the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

120
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 1>And to react emotionally to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then for agreeableness,</v>

121
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:21.020
<v Speaker 1>there's two aspects and one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>

122
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:21.854
<v Speaker 1>which means pretty much what it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the ability to embody the feelings </v>

123
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 1>of others and to react in a caring </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner to that and politeness,</v>

124
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be something like respect</v>
<v Speaker 1>for authority and social conventions.</v>

125
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

126
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:36.824
<v Speaker 1>is that liberals are higher in </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and conservatives are higher </v>

127
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:39.824
<v Speaker 1>and politeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're both aspects of </v>

128
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.793
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness conscientiousness breaks </v>

129
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>down into two aspects as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are quite interesting.</v>

130
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 1>One of them is industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is associated with diligent,</v>

131
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:51.644
<v Speaker 1>hard work and the ability to stay task </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused without distraction and to work </v>

132
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:56.774
<v Speaker 1>hard and orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be associated with </v>

133
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:00.284
<v Speaker 1>disgust sensitivity and which is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good predictor of conservative </v>

134
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.363
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

135
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.203
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it turns out that some elements of </v>

136
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:07.214
<v Speaker 1>conservative belief are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than normal levels of or higher </v>

137
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 1>than average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

138
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.493
<v Speaker 1>levels of disgust sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the final trait division into </v>

139
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>aspects is that of openness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

140
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>And it can be divided into openness </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper,</v>

141
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially a dimension of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity and aesthetic sensitivity.</v>

142
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>So preference for engagement in </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities that are associated,</v>

143
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 1>say with fiction or drama or art and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect,</v>

144
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:34.754
<v Speaker 1>which is an index of interest in ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and abstraction and philosophical </v>

145
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:39.224
<v Speaker 1>concepts and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the report produces a very high </v>

146
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:47.150
<v Speaker 1>resolution representation of personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're very interesting differences</v>

147
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:49.840
<v Speaker 1>at the aspect level that are worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on.</v>

148
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.823
<v Speaker 1>We try to develop a personality test </v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't designed to make you feel </v>

149
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:54.164
<v Speaker 1>good about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it might know it depends on </v>

150
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:56.754
<v Speaker 1>your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to give you the most accurate and </v>

151
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.073
<v Speaker 1>straightforward description of who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are that's possible so that you can use </v>

152
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.970
<v Speaker 1>the genuine information that's provided </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to maybe organize your life.</v>

153
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.293
<v Speaker 1>Also understand the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and other people because you </v>

154
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:13.014
<v Speaker 1>know we often think that the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't share the same viewpoint is </v>

155
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:16.494
<v Speaker 1>because we have differences of opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it actually goes a lot deeper than </v>

156
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:20.304
<v Speaker 1>that because you're very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perceptions are dependent on the </v>

157
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:23.334
<v Speaker 1>variability in your personality and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't only that people differ in </v>

158
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:27.354
<v Speaker 1>their opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They differ very much in how they see </v>

159
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they actually perceive the world.</v>

160
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:35.931
<v Speaker 1>Because your personality constitutes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of template or filter through which</v>

161
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>you organize your perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very important to understand</v>

162
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 1>that there is substantial personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability in the world and that you're</v>

163
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 1>often talking with people who see things</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently than you.</v>

164
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 1>And a good example of that is the divide</v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

165
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.853
<v Speaker 1>let's say left leaning people in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right leading people because the left </v>

166
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:56.004
<v Speaker 1>leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people tend to be very high in openness </v>

167
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 1>to experience and relatively low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

168
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 1>especially in the aspect of orderliness.</v>

169
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the conservative types tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be very high in conscientiousness,</v>

170
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 1>especially orderliness and relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>low in openness.</v>

171
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 1>And so those are fundamentally different</v>
<v Speaker 1>orientations in the world.</v>

172
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 1>And you could say that the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative types,</v>

173
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:16.704
<v Speaker 1>that more right wing types are much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with the preservation of </v>

174
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.680
<v Speaker 1>tradition and tend to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that have been done,</v>

175
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.090
<v Speaker 1>the tried and true manner in the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the most reliable.</v>

176
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.253
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the people who are on the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are more radical or more concerned </v>

177
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:31.914
<v Speaker 1>with the fact that the environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifts radically and rapidly and </v>

178
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:37.710
<v Speaker 1>unpredictably and so we have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to shift with it.</v>

179
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:38.544
<v Speaker 1>And so those are both valid viewpoints </v>
<v Speaker 1>because every element of lived </v>

180
00:10:42.451 --> 00:10:45.600
<v Speaker 1>experience has an orderly element and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic element,</v>

181
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be prepared for both.</v>

182
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:48.924
<v Speaker 1>And the purpose of straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 1>political dialogue between people of </v>

183
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:53.034
<v Speaker 1>different personality types is to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine on an ongoing basis how much </v>

184
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:57.234
<v Speaker 1>we should be relying on tradition and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much we should be attempting to </v>

185
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.870
<v Speaker 1>transform ourselves.</v>

186
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.703
<v Speaker 1>And there is no permanent solution to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem because things stay the </v>

187
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 1>same and change and they do that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>different rates at different times.</v>

188
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.234
<v Speaker 1>So dialogue is unbelievably important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which by the way is why I'm such an </v>

189
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:13.764
<v Speaker 1>advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say for free speech because it's </v>

190
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:16.074
<v Speaker 1>the mechanism that keeps people up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different types speaking instead of </v>

191
00:11:18.601 --> 00:11:20.610
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really important.</v>

192
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:21.444
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the website is called understand </v>

193
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>myself.com and you can go there and sign</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for the personality test.</v>

194
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:29.124
<v Speaker 1>It'll be delivered to you pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately after you fill out the </v>

195
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

196
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:33.504
<v Speaker 1>Each question is posed as a phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm take you about 15 minutes to </v>

197
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.280
<v Speaker 1>complete the questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only do it once.</v>

198
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>norms that we compare you against,</v>

199
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:45.744
<v Speaker 1>so that would be the self reports of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000 other people against whom you're </v>

200
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:49.560
<v Speaker 1>compared.</v>

201
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.393
<v Speaker 1>They were only allowed to do at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we have to maintain stringent </v>

202
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 1>control over that to maintain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>validity of the test.</v>

203
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:56.851
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

204
00:11:56.851 --> 00:11:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I would say don't do it when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry.</v>

205
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.243
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it when you're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it when you're feeling down or </v>

206
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:03.664
<v Speaker 1>in a bad mood about yourself or feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>self critical and don't do it when </v>

207
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 1>you're likely to be interrupted or </v>
<v Speaker 1>distracted.</v>

208
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>You want to take it seriously and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to think about your answers.</v>

209
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Now you're supposed to answer as you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically not as you'd like to be.</v>

210
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

211
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be either too hard on </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself or too good to yourself.</v>

212
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.573
<v Speaker 1>You want to be as accurate as possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you'll benefit most from </v>

213
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:24.724
<v Speaker 1>the feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the last thing I would say is </v>

214
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 1>that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you know about this already,</v>

215
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:35.350
<v Speaker 1>but we've also developed a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interventions called self authoring.</v>

216
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's available at [inaudible] dot </v>
<v Speaker 1>com and what self authoring can help you</v>

217
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:40.714
<v Speaker 1>do is reconfigure certain elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior and perhaps over the long </v>

218
00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:45.694
<v Speaker 1>run your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cell phone suite helps you write </v>

219
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 1>an autobiography and detail out the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

220
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.193
<v Speaker 1>both positive and negative experiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your past so that you can capitalize </v>

221
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:57.034
<v Speaker 1>on the positive experiences and figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to duplicate them and maybe put </v>

222
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:00.454
<v Speaker 1>the negative experiences to rest and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that that's a good way to reduce </v>

223
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.103
<v Speaker 1>trait neuroticism over the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the evidence for that is that </v>

224
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:08.554
<v Speaker 1>writing programs of this sort tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve people's mental health and </v>

225
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.580
<v Speaker 1>decrease their negative emotion so and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stabilize them.</v>

226
00:13:15.581 --> 00:13:16.414
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take the personality test and </v>

227
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

228
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:20.734
<v Speaker 1>with your scores on trait neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel that you would benefit from </v>

229
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 1>some additional emotional stability.</v>

230
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.133
<v Speaker 1>Then the past authoring program from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>self authoring suite might be something </v>

231
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:30.814
<v Speaker 1>worth considering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with regards to the other </v>

232
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:34.264
<v Speaker 1>personality traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the present authoring program at </v>

233
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.290
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] dot com is also a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality exercise of a sort.</v>

234
00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:42.124
<v Speaker 1>But what it helps you do is center on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your virtues and your false using a big </v>

235
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:47.674
<v Speaker 1>five model again so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify what's good about your </v>

236
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:50.644
<v Speaker 1>personality and figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalize that on that in the future </v>

237
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.303
<v Speaker 1>and so that you can identify where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>major weaknesses are and figure out how </v>

238
00:13:57.461 --> 00:13:58.294
<v Speaker 1>to rectify those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's useful for general </v>

239
00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:01.504
<v Speaker 1>personality work I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the last one which we've done </v>

240
00:14:04.661 --> 00:14:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the most research on is called future </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring.</v>

241
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.583
<v Speaker 1>And the future authoring program helps </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about your life and we think </v>

242
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:12.544
<v Speaker 1>about it as an adjunct to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness perhaps over the long </v>

243
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:20.551
<v Speaker 1>run and also as an exercise that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase positive and decreased negative</v>

244
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:21.604
<v Speaker 1>emotion by by helping you establish your</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals and also stabilizing your view of </v>

245
00:14:25.691 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

246
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So in the future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asked to consider your life along</v>

247
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.040
<v Speaker 1>about seven dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So friendship,</v>

248
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.413
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do outside of work with your </v>

249
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:38.044
<v Speaker 1>private life in terms of useful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative activity or enjoyable activity </v>

250
00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 1>or social activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're aiming for in your career,</v>

251
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to configure your self </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

252
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.830
<v Speaker 1>How you're going to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself mentally and physically and how</v>

253
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:52.664
<v Speaker 1>are you going to handle your use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and alcohol because those are </v>

254
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:55.904
<v Speaker 1>pitfalls that people often encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that tear them down and hurt them </v>

255
00:14:59.121 --> 00:14:59.954
<v Speaker 1>badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're asked to think about </v>

256
00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:02.294
<v Speaker 1>yourself three to five years down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road as if you were taking care of </v>

257
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 1>yourself as if you were a valuable </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

258
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:10.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want to extend that courtesy</v>

259
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:14.540
<v Speaker 1>to yourself because you're as valuable </v>
<v Speaker 1>on average as anyone else and you should</v>

260
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:15.590
<v Speaker 1>treat yourself that way.</v>

261
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.080
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asked to design a future three to</v>

262
00:15:18.081 --> 00:15:18.914
<v Speaker 1>five years down the road where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience along each of those </v>

263
00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:23.864
<v Speaker 1>dimensions is optimized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're asked to write for 15 </v>

264
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 1>minutes about what your life could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like three to five years down the road.</v>

265
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.873
<v Speaker 1>If you were taking care of yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way you should and things were working </v>

266
00:15:34.731 --> 00:15:35.564
<v Speaker 1>out properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine that you're </v>

267
00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 1>developing a vision of the life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to lead.</v>

268
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 1>And then you're asked to reverse that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to write for 15 minutes.</v>

269
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:43.934
<v Speaker 1>And think about this as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About what your life would be like if </v>

270
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you let your bad habits and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

271
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:48.644
<v Speaker 1>logical weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the upper hand and Auger you into </v>

272
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:53.030
<v Speaker 1>the ground so that you became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:15:53.031 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 1>a failure and bitter and resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated and unhappy and,</v>

274
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.700
<v Speaker 1>and all of the terrible things that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with bad luck and,</v>

275
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>and also a missed opportunities.</v>

276
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.093
<v Speaker 1>And let's call them ethical errors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and then you're asked to take your </v>

277
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:07.874
<v Speaker 1>positive vision for the future and </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborate that out into a detailed plan </v>

278
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.050
<v Speaker 1>where you justify your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goals,</v>

279
00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you describe what those goals are.</v>

280
00:16:17.301 --> 00:16:22.070
<v Speaker 1>You rank order them in importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You describe how you would be better and</v>

281
00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:22.904
<v Speaker 1>your family would be better and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>society would be better if you stuck to </v>

282
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:26.204
<v Speaker 1>your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make a contract with yourself to </v>

283
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.380
<v Speaker 1>determine how it is that you were going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to approach those goals and stay on path</v>

284
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.543
<v Speaker 1>and and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these are quite extensive </v>

285
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:40.070
<v Speaker 1>exercises and we develop them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

286
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:40.904
<v Speaker 1>as an alternative to lengthy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive psychotherapy and there's a </v>

287
00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:46.424
<v Speaker 1>fair bit of research evidence suggesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that writing exercises of this sort are </v>

288
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:50.354
<v Speaker 1>extremely effective ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconfiguring the manner in which you </v>

289
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:55.670
<v Speaker 1>approach the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the research we've done,</v>

290
00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:56.504
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in three different locations now and </v>

291
00:16:58.221 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 1>with with several thousand college </v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

292
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 1>although this is not a program only </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed for college students,</v>

293
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.873
<v Speaker 1>has indicated that even if you do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively poor job of let's say the </v>

294
00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:10.790
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>college student,</v>

295
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:11.624
<v Speaker 1>it increases the probability that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in your program by about 25 </v>

296
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:15.434
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a walloping improvement and </v>

297
00:17:17.031 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 1>also has about the same effect on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>grade point average.</v>

298
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.780
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to be particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>true for people who are doing the worst.</v>

299
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.643
<v Speaker 1>So it's been really effective for </v>
<v Speaker 1>disenchanted ethnic minority males in </v>

300
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

301
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:32.174
<v Speaker 1>compared to the Dutch national females </v>
<v Speaker 1>who do better than anyone else in the </v>

302
00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:36.824
<v Speaker 1>sample that we looked at two years after</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire group did the future </v>

303
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:42.104
<v Speaker 1>authoring program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ethnic minority males who are </v>

304
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:45.584
<v Speaker 1>underperforming by about 80 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught up and slightly exceeded the </v>

305
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:49.214
<v Speaker 1>performance of the Dutch national women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was absolutely staggering </v>

306
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:53.214
<v Speaker 1>results as far as we're concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also duplicated that at a place in </v>

307
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:56.874
<v Speaker 1>Canada called Mohawk College,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that the program worked </v>

308
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:00.204
<v Speaker 1>particularly effectively for men again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for males who are underperforming </v>

309
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:04.074
<v Speaker 1>females generally speaking in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic world and especially if they </v>

310
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:10.410
<v Speaker 1>were males who hadn't done that well in </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school and hadn't carved out a very</v>

311
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:14.280
<v Speaker 1>specified a route forward in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic achievement.</v>

312
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's an excellent way of getting your</v>
<v Speaker 1>act together.</v>

313
00:18:16.891 --> 00:18:17.724
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the understand myself.com page is </v>

314
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:22.194
<v Speaker 1>designed to give you a picture of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality in detail and then the self </v>

315
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:25.914
<v Speaker 1>authoring program is designed to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>you reconfigure the way that you </v>

316
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:31.560
<v Speaker 1>approach life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're hoping that the combination</v>

317
00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:32.394
<v Speaker 1>of those two things are particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective way of bringing high quality </v>

318
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.983
<v Speaker 1>psychological information and advice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>help to a very broad audience at a very </v>

319
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:45.030
<v Speaker 1>low cost and at a relative minimum of </v>
<v Speaker 1>demands on time.</v>

320
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say we do know with the self </v>

321
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:49.260
<v Speaker 1>authoring program that the more you </v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

322
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:50.094
<v Speaker 1>the better it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of tantamount to saying </v>

323
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:54.480
<v Speaker 1>that the program works better in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

324
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:56.610
<v Speaker 1>gets better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you think about the future,</v>

325
00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:57.444
<v Speaker 1>which really stands to reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's nice to see that actually </v>

326
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:04.290
<v Speaker 1>represented and duplicated as part of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific research project.</v>

327
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.123
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've tried to keep the programs as </v>

328
00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:09.810
<v Speaker 1>reliable as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as straightforward as possible,</v>

329
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:10.883
<v Speaker 1>as dependent on your own actions as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible because the writing is really </v>

330
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:15.384
<v Speaker 1>crucial to reconfiguring your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and as widely distributable </v>

331
00:19:18.951 --> 00:19:21.480
<v Speaker 1>and as low cost as we can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage.</v>

332
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.523
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to provide you with </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate psychological information so </v>

333
00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:26.124
<v Speaker 1>that you understand yourself and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people better and so that your life can </v>

334
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:32.970
<v Speaker 1>be configured in a manner that I hope is</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more beneficial to you personally,</v>

335
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.833
<v Speaker 1>personally and helpful to your family </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also has a positive effect on the </v>

336
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:38.394
<v Speaker 1>broader society around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a great triumvirate of </v>

337
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 1>attainment and it's exactly what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be aiming for.</v>

338
00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:49.251
<v Speaker 1>So I would say I encourage you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine who you are and to think about</v>

339
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:53.130
<v Speaker 1>that very carefully and then to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine very carefully who you want to</v>

340
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:56.220
<v Speaker 1>be and why and to make a plan.</v>

341
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.960
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't get the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that in school,</v>

342
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.600
<v Speaker 1>junior high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>

343
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:01.830
<v Speaker 1>College,</v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

344
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:02.843
<v Speaker 1>no one ever sits you down and helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out where you came from and who </v>

345
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:08.520
<v Speaker 1>you are and what you're doing and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really need to know that.</v>

346
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I should also say that with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand myself dotcom site,</v>

347
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:12.774
<v Speaker 1>we're also working on our couples module</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will enable the people who have </v>

348
00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:17.484
<v Speaker 1>filled out the report to ask someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else to also do the questionnaire and </v>

349
00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:21.954
<v Speaker 1>then they'll both get a report that </v>
<v Speaker 1>details out there similarities and </v>

350
00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:25.044
<v Speaker 1>differences so that they can come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand where they're going to be an </v>

351
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:28.644
<v Speaker 1>agreement and get along and share </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests and where they're likely to </v>

352
00:20:30.721 --> 00:20:32.820
<v Speaker 1>have conflict and what might be done </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

353
00:20:32.821 --> 00:20:36.720
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's at minimum a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month to two months away.</v>

354
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:37.883
<v Speaker 1>And we're also going to release a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school version of the self authoring </v>

355
00:20:40.441 --> 00:20:40.770
<v Speaker 1>suite.</v>

356
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.670
<v Speaker 1>So that people can start to plan their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives when they're much younger and will</v>

357
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>only ask the high school students to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about three to months out into the</v>

358
00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:48.934
<v Speaker 1>future because when you're that young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about the practical limit of </v>

359
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:53.314
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say ability to think forward </v>

360
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:56.770
<v Speaker 1>into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the younger you are,</v>

361
00:20:56.771 --> 00:20:59.200
<v Speaker 1>the shorter your time horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because,</v>

362
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.333
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't been exposed to the world </v>

363
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:03.850
<v Speaker 1>that much and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have plenty to learn.</v>

364
00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:04.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

365
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:05.554
<v Speaker 1>we have a high school version in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>works and so all announced that when it </v>

366
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:08.494
<v Speaker 1>comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we all hope that you find these </v>

367
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 1>offerings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

368
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.310
<v Speaker 1>useful and practical and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

369
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:16.983
<v Speaker 1>and that they help you put your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>together so that you can be a solid </v>

370
00:21:19.661 --> 00:21:24.220
<v Speaker 1>citizen and a responsible person and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally stable as possible and maybe</v>

371
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:26.890
<v Speaker 1>even find some happiness along the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>from time to time.</v>

372
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:28.150
<v Speaker 1>So that would be really good.</v>
