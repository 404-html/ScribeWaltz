WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking today about how to</v>

2
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>explain this a little bit further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say</v>

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.560
<v Speaker 1>you're going for a job interview</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.060
<v Speaker 1>you're nervous about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go in to the job interview and</v>

5
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>there's some people there and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>chairs and tables and it's a room that's</v>

6
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not quite as ugly,</v>

7
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something like this.</v>

8
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.970
<v Speaker 1>What's in the room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're nervous,</v>

9
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>you've seen chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tables before,</v>

10
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>you've seen people what's in the room.</v>

11
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.623
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>How about a set of alternate futures?</v>

13
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.733
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

14
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't how we think,</v>

15
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>it's how we act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

16
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>if you talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was nervous about going to this job</v>

17
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

18
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I might be evaluated.</v>

19
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why does that matter?</v>

20
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know partly why it matters.</v>

21
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Look at this figure again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty happy with his figure.</v>

22
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>All things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'll shake my faith in my,</v>

25
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my belief that I'm a good person.</v>

26
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a little silly for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>

27
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're thinking that way,</v>

28
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I would say you're thinking you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not thinking specifically enough</v>

29
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>cause there's lots of reasons you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not do well at a job interview,</v>

30
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>including the fact that they might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>already given the job to someone else</v>

31
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>for all you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

32
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>so you don't want to leap to the top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy without cause.</v>

33
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.763
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things you might say is</v>

35
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:10.160
<v Speaker 1>that in the room there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are threats that might be posed to</v>

36
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:15.161
<v Speaker 1>any level of the hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of beliefs and behaviors that you use to</v>

37
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 1>interact with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

38
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:23.900
<v Speaker 1>the terror management people would tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

39
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>let's assume that this is a belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

40
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't care whether you agree with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way it's represented graphically or not</v>

41
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 1>for the time being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just assume that what we're</v>

42
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>talking about is a belief structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

43
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.820
<v Speaker 1>the Tara management people would tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that you have that belief structure</v>

44
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.900
<v Speaker 1>far in large part to protect you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear of death,</v>

45
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>From Maine,</v>

46
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.820
<v Speaker 1>from death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

47
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.780
<v Speaker 1>But there's a bunch of problems with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>

48
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Not least that it actually sidesteps the</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue of the function of the belief</v>

49
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't exactly have a</v>

50
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>belief system to make philosophical</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense out of the world.</v>

51
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.650
<v Speaker 1>You have a system of tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are embodied that allow you to</v>

52
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>actually act in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might also have an articulated</v>

53
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>representation of that on top that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less accurate,</v>

54
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>probably less all things considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

55
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe if your faith and not as shaken</v>
<v Speaker 1>your faith in what you do,</v>

56
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>we'll also be shaken because the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are are associated,</v>

57
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>but we should always remember that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe system doesn't just protect you</v>

58
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 1>from the fear of death and protects you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from death and that's a lot different,</v>

59
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this whole thing is,</v>

60
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>it's your set of skills and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the perceptions and thoughts and</v>

61
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>emotions that go along with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>

62
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>And then it's an integrated structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>consisting of the particular manner in</v>

63
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>which you've integrated all your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>little sub parts.</v>

64
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>And then in relationship to the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

65
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>you can also think about it in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense as a holographic representation of</v>

66
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:03.454
<v Speaker 1>the culture.</v>

67
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.003
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

68
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much you guys know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about holographs.</v>

69
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know very much about them</v>
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>

70
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.750
<v Speaker 1>but there's some things I know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

71
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you shine a light on a holograph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get it.</v>

72
00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the image that of whatever it was there</v>

73
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.740
<v Speaker 1>when the holograph was created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's created by lasers now.</v>

74
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.580
<v Speaker 1>And if you take a holograph and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>break it into pieces and then you shine</v>

75
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:32.900
<v Speaker 1>a light on the pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get an object in each piece.</v>

76
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's lower resolution.</v>

77
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice way of thinking about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

78
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if your brain is damaged,</v>

79
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.110
<v Speaker 1>you'll be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sort of as a lower resolution</v>

80
00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:47.510
<v Speaker 1>representation of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also really nice way of</v>

81
00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:52.511
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what culture is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culture is this massive structure of</v>

82
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 1>multiple levels and domains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's reflected in each of us.</v>

83
00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Like we're each partial carriers of it.</v>

84
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.740
<v Speaker 1>So we have a partial representation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure that we embody,</v>

85
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 1>a partial representation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

86
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally we embody it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also represent it abstractly.</v>

87
00:05:13.071 --> 00:05:14.600
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that you go to a</v>

88
00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:19.601
<v Speaker 1>university is to in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve your capacity to articulate your</v>

89
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:21.680
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Because you're a cultural creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

91
00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:25.250
<v Speaker 1>why are you the way you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

92
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.250
<v Speaker 1>some of it's psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of its sociological,</v>

93
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.490
<v Speaker 1>some of it's historical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of it is historical.</v>

94
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:35.960
<v Speaker 1>So when you go and you study social</v>
<v Speaker 1>science or humanity,</v>

95
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.030
<v Speaker 1>you're studying your own personality.</v>

96
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.633
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

97
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a paper a while back with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of my graduate students and it</v>

98
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:50.310
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called the entropy.</v>

99
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.280
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd think I would remember this.</v>

100
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Entropy doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypothesis was,</v>

101
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>and this is something I'd been thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a law for a long time,</v>

102
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.700
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>the world is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex.</v>

104
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that the act</v>
<v Speaker 1>of getting from one place to another is</v>

105
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>often very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>

106
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>And partly what you're doing when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>put together a functional submodule is</v>

107
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>you're putting together a little routine</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will enable you to transform some</v>

108
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>part of time and space from what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to what you want it to be.</v>

109
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is reducing the</v>

110
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:28.640
<v Speaker 1>complexity of that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this,</v>

111
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>so you go for your job interview and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

112
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>you're knocking them dead.</v>

113
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>

115
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.120
<v Speaker 1>that set of possibilities that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerning you starts to collapse</v>

116
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 1>towards a single solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that single solution is if you're</v>

117
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>doing very well in the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a positive solution.</v>

118
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>So your anxiety disappears and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced with positive emotion.</v>

119
00:06:56.391 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 1>You get enthusiastic and excited because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in that room is that a</v>

120
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>path to the desirable future is opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can't see any of this,</v>

121
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because we're so blinded by the idea</v>

122
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:09.870
<v Speaker 1>that we see objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

123
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 1>we failed to perceive in any articulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense what it is that we're actually</v>

124
00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>dealing with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

125
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I think that one way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that you're always on the edge of,</v>

126
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of something that's potential.</v>

127
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 1>That's where you exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You exist on this moving,</v>

128
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boundary of potential and you can</v>

129
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:35.150
<v Speaker 1>interact with it such that you form it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it passes,</v>

130
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 1>it passes by you into the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:42.911
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully you're forming it in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is in concordance with your better</v>

132
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 1>health and perhaps with the better</v>
<v Speaker 1>health of the people around you that</v>

133
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 1>would sort of be optimal.</v>

134
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>So you're realizing that potential inner</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner,</v>

135
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.420
<v Speaker 1>inner genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non metaphorical sense that that's the</v>

136
00:07:56.421 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 1>thing about these representations in</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

137
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.200
<v Speaker 1>they're often described as mythical or</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological or metaphorical,</v>

138
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really not metaphorical.</v>

139
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly right because the great</v>

140
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great father,</v>

141
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're partially metaphorical,</v>

142
00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 1>but the medic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that they stand for as</v>

143
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 1>metaphors is something other than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we conceptualize when we</v>

144
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 1>look at the world from an objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

145
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Now we've talked a little bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure of the dragon of chaos.</v>

146
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 1>And I think of all the metaphorical</v>
<v Speaker 1>images,</v>

147
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>it's the most difficult to grasp because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

148
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>it's that which has not yet been</v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered.</v>

149
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 1>So it's neither unknown nor known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

150
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even describe that.</v>

151
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:41.451
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

152
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:44.480
<v Speaker 1>but you can encounter it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter that when you go into a</v>

153
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:46.280
<v Speaker 1>situation that's radically new.</v>

154
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.640
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's just the second before</v>

155
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 1>you walk into a high stakes interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>just before you open the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's as close as you get.</v>

157
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a normal day,</v>

158
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>do a direct encounter with the dragon of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos because you don't know what's</v>

159
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>going to happen and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

160
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>you're in a room and there's a door in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you.</v>

161
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost moronic to think of it that</v>

162
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:07.801
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

163
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Because what the hell does that have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with anything?</v>

164
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 1>It's what's in there is unbelievably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

165
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>it's the localized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the localization of unbelievably</v>

166
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 1>complex webs of causality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's waiting for you inside</v>

167
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>that room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

168
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:26.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it structured in any real way?</v>

169
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no more structured then it's even</v>

170
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 1>less structured than a book that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>

171
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>

172
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.640
<v Speaker 1>if you're reading the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

173
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:38.780
<v Speaker 1>well where's the meaning in this book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is it,</v>

174
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 1>well it's not in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's partly there,</v>

175
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need the words in the</v>

176
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:45.660
<v Speaker 1>sentences and the paragraphs and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

177
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:49.080
<v Speaker 1>but you need the whole cultural context</v>
<v Speaker 1>around it in order to interpret it.</v>

178
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>So you're not reading it blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

179
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 1>you come to it with a set of a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>large set of presuppositions,</v>

180
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>enough of them so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the,</v>

181
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 1>the author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe you can't and the book's over</v>

182
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 1>your hand or it's badly written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But typically you come at it with the</v>

183
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:11.391
<v Speaker 1>machinery in place so that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with the words and the phrases</v>

184
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:16.560
<v Speaker 1>and the sentences and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revelations of new meaning poor forth.</v>

185
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say it any clearer</v>

186
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:20.790
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

187
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what the meaning of the book is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

188
00:10:22.491 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the dialectical interaction</v>

189
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:26.490
<v Speaker 1>between you and the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

190
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.110
<v Speaker 1>if you walk into an interview room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even less given in some sense than</v>

191
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:31.801
<v Speaker 1>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

192
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Because what's going to happen in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really means which of the many</v>

193
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:38.880
<v Speaker 1>futures that that room contains is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manifest itself.</v>

194
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>It depends very much on how you act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's in that way that you collapsed</v>

195
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:49.710
<v Speaker 1>the potential that's in a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>place and you extract something out of</v>

196
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's well that,</v>

197
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 1>and then that's when it gets tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neutral,</v>

198
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 1>positive or negative may be bombed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>

199
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

200
00:10:58.381 --> 00:10:59.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

201
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does,</v>

202
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

203
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very complicated question.</v>

204
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Then you're stuck with this hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

205
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're going to do when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go home.</v>

206
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.510
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

207
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I didn't dress properly or maybe I</v>

208
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 1>didn't get to the interview on time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they ask me a bunch of questions I</v>

209
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 1>wasn't prepared for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Jesus,</v>

210
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anything about what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

211
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>My whole education was a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what the hell am I doing?</v>

212
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And then he might go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to get a job.</v>

213
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.340
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you could say in some</v>

214
00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:31.341
<v Speaker 1>sense that all of those hypotheses as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move up and down the hierarchy,</v>

215
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move from trivial trouble to really</v>

216
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:40.401
<v Speaker 1>not good trouble as you bounce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of that is an attempt to specify</v>

217
00:11:40.531 --> 00:11:44.310
<v Speaker 1>in some sense what that room contained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not easy.</v>

218
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.060
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird too because the room can</v>

219
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 1>contain things that alter your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 1>because maybe you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

221
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're going for a computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>science job.</v>

222
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

223
00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go in there and you think you're the</v>

224
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 1>top person in your class and maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

225
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:02.980
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in there are so far ahead of</v>

226
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 1>you that you can't even imagine ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>catching up.</v>

227
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you come out of there,</v>

228
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which you construe your</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational history is going to be</v>

229
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:15.760
<v Speaker 1>radically transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of,</v>

230
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.210
<v Speaker 1>a lot of trouble in that room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot.</v>

231
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we thought in this</v>

232
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:23.560
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of each of those little</v>

233
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.760
<v Speaker 1>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really eggs as a container.</v>

234
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>And what they contain is entropy</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

235
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 1>And the smaller ones contained smaller</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of entropy and the bigger ones</v>

236
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>contain bigger amounts of entropy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

237
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>And so here's another example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're driving down the highway and your</v>

238
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.720
<v Speaker 1>car sputters and grinds to a halt.</v>

239
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it makes some nice red radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>noise as well.</v>

240
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:48.160
<v Speaker 1>It's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

241
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Well what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the answer is the simple answer is</v>

242
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 1>your car mental function and you had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull off the road.</v>

243
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a really object oriented</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

244
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 1>But what's actually happened is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a conceptualization of the car as a</v>

245
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause what do you know about the damn</v>

246
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:08.620
<v Speaker 1>car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

247
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 1>the car was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

248
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 1>the car was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an affordance that's the right word that</v>

249
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:18.670
<v Speaker 1>would get you from point a to point b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could have a very little</v>

250
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:20.170
<v Speaker 1>resolution model of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

251
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.800
<v Speaker 1>It can just look like a plastic shell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of what a car looks like.</v>

252
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.370
<v Speaker 1>And as long as you see how low root</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution that is,</v>

253
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:30.640
<v Speaker 1>you could replace it with a cartoon and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't even notice</v>

254
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.420
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough representation.</v>

255
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.760
<v Speaker 1>As long as the thing is doing what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be doing.</v>

256
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.880
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as it stops doing what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be doing,</v>

257
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:42.490
<v Speaker 1>then it could be any old thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

258
00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:43.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does any old thing mean?</v>

259
00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you're on a deserted highway</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's one o'clock in the morning.</v>

260
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.240
<v Speaker 1>And you know when someone pulls over to</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to help you.</v>

261
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's that?</v>

262
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:13:52.301 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 1>we believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your imagination will rapidly span the</v>

264
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:59.500
<v Speaker 1>world of possibility from oh good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's come to help to I'm going to</v>

265
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:02.070
<v Speaker 1>be dragged off in the bush and killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

266
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:05.860
<v Speaker 1>and that's all contained in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that sequence of events.</v>

267
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 1>And then even if no one does stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you know,</v>

268
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.960
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to worry about exactly</v>

269
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:13.260
<v Speaker 1>what's gone wrong and you would have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about how you're going to fix it.</v>

270
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>You have to worry about the mechanic</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might help you.</v>

271
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 1>And you have to concern yourself with</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you're going to need a</v>

272
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 1>new car and then you have to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>your finances and it's like the idea</v>

273
00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:26.371
<v Speaker 1>that that car is a bounded entity like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks is only true when it works,</v>

274
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 1>as soon as it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then God,</v>

275
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:35.440
<v Speaker 1>it's any old thing and that in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>senses the dragon of chaos.</v>

276
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.980
<v Speaker 1>It's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what seems to me to have happened</v>

277
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.091
<v Speaker 1>because you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

278
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:42.370
<v Speaker 1>how do people come to conceptualize such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing?</v>

279
00:14:42.371 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Because I would think of of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are different are difficult</v>

280
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:49.180
<v Speaker 1>to conceptualize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The category of all things that you have</v>

281
00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:52.760
<v Speaker 1>not yet encountered is the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing to discover it,</v>

282
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like zero.</v>

283
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.730
<v Speaker 1>It took people a long time to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero and no wonder we need a symbol for</v>

284
00:14:58.731 --> 00:14:59.564
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

285
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is even worse.</v>

286
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.530
<v Speaker 1>We need a representation for potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you think,</v>

287
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

288
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's actually potential that</v>

289
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with all of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

290
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 1>what seems to me to have happened was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

291
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a evolutionary just so story.</v>

292
00:15:18.721 --> 00:15:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not assuming that it actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked precisely this way,</v>

293
00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter cause it's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to touch on the appropriate,</v>

294
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

295
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.840
<v Speaker 1>the appropriate features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well one of the things we know about</v>

296
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:32.690
<v Speaker 1>social animals generally speaking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals in general,</v>

297
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 1>is that they have a territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

298
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what is their territory exactly?</v>

299
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:38.511
<v Speaker 1>And he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

300
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 1>you can mark it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

301
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:40.760
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

302
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 1>what will we think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would have a territory?</v>

303
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.350
<v Speaker 1>It must make it make it a like a tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty solitary.</v>

304
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:49.790
<v Speaker 1>So it'll be simple.</v>

305
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:54.650
<v Speaker 1>They have a big territory rights as</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of square miles.</v>

306
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is while there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are tigers,</v>

307
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 1>you can't have like 50 of them cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just eat everything that's</v>

308
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:02.870
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you have to have a big</v>

309
00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 1>territory to support one apex Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>

310
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 1>well what exactly is the territory of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tiger?</v>

311
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:10.221
<v Speaker 1>And you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

312
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:12.880
<v Speaker 1>here's its boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where it there,</v>

313
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 1>this is where it roams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the right way of thinking</v>

314
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 1>about the territory of the tiger because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the territory of the tiger is actually</v>

315
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.640
<v Speaker 1>all the places where when the tiger does</v>
<v Speaker 1>its thing,</v>

316
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.300
<v Speaker 1>the things that the tiger wants to or</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect happens,</v>

317
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.940
<v Speaker 1>that's the Tigers territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with you.</v>

318
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 1>You know you're at home wherever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to do and what you're doing</v>

319
00:16:37.911 --> 00:16:41.750
<v Speaker 1>when you knew what to do is you know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to match this hierarchy,</v>

320
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 1>which is partly action oriented.</v>

321
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.500
<v Speaker 1>You know how to match the hierarchy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this situation so that when you put it</v>

322
00:16:48.501 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 1>into practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential that's there transforms</v>

323
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:56.810
<v Speaker 1>itself into what you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's your territory.</v>

324
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.240
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need to think about it that way</v>

325
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:01.580
<v Speaker 1>because your territory can shift very</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly on.</v>

326
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.680
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about geography</v>
<v Speaker 1>geographically,</v>

327
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're on the subway that</v>

328
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>you always take and then someone sits</v>
<v Speaker 1>down beside you and they're muttering</v>

329
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:14.930
<v Speaker 1>away madly and have a pretty malevolent</v>
<v Speaker 1>look on their face and you get a glimpse</v>

330
00:17:14.931 --> 00:17:17.360
<v Speaker 1>inside their code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like there's a knife,</v>

331
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're not in your territory</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

332
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.940
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that all of the objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>entities are still there,</v>

333
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.420
<v Speaker 1>arrayed around you is it's just an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing more than a,</v>

334
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.510
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a delusion at that point to think</v>

335
00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:34.640
<v Speaker 1>that those things characterize where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

336
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're willing to consider</v>

337
00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:41.750
<v Speaker 1>territory as that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a space time continuum.</v>

338
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm stressing that,</v>

339
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reality is,</v>

340
00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:49.230
<v Speaker 1>is a space time continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

341
00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It's got three dimensions of space and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one dimension of time.</v>

342
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:57.021
<v Speaker 1>And everyone knows that as we sit here</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less stable in three dimensions,</v>

343
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.160
<v Speaker 1>time flows past us in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

344
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 1>the three dimensional reality is</v>
<v Speaker 1>transforming all by itself just because</v>

345
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:05.581
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

346
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:07.800
<v Speaker 1>And so when we're mapping out our</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory's,</v>

347
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.950
<v Speaker 1>we map out spacetime territory's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that not only do you</v>

348
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 1>know where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you are,</v>

349
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:19.620
<v Speaker 1>and if you're in your territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to act for that place in</v>

350
00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:23.700
<v Speaker 1>that time so that you transformed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential that's there into whatever it</v>

351
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 1>is that you're aiming at.</v>

352
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's your territory.</v>

353
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Now that territory is isomorphic</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary,</v>

354
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:37.770
<v Speaker 1>evolutionarily with lots of things which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could also confuse geographically.</v>

355
00:18:37.771 --> 00:18:40.590
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think of a human territory as</v>

356
00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:44.880
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the fundamental human</v>

357
00:18:44.881 --> 00:18:48.090
<v Speaker 1>territory is probably a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

358
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.910
<v Speaker 1>And so the fire is a place of light in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the darkness,</v>

359
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:55.911
<v Speaker 1>and then you can think of row rings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentric rings of relative safety,</v>

360
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding the fire.</v>

361
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 1>So right beside the fire where it's warm</v>
<v Speaker 1>and light and there's lots of other</v>

362
00:19:03.691 --> 00:19:04.440
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

363
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 1>that's explored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

364
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.540
<v Speaker 1>But then if you start wandering away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the fire into the Bush,</v>

365
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically active area,</v>

366
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.400
<v Speaker 1>then the farther away you get from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>

367
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.300
<v Speaker 1>the more you're going outside of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

368
00:19:18.301 --> 00:19:21.480
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell that it's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your whole nervous system starts</v>

369
00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:22.500
<v Speaker 1>to function differently.</v>

370
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.090
<v Speaker 1>What happens is is that the nervous</v>
<v Speaker 1>system parts that you were using using</v>

371
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.380
<v Speaker 1>while you were in known territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just they just shut down.</v>

372
00:19:31.381 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And the other nervous system elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you use an unknown territory start</v>

373
00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:39.891
<v Speaker 1>to turn on and generally you're not very</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy about that because where you're,</v>

374
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 1>when you're aware you've mastered the</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

375
00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:48.720
<v Speaker 1>you can presume that neutral or</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderately good things are going to</v>

376
00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:52.020
<v Speaker 1>happen with the possibility of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>great now and then.</v>

377
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.640
<v Speaker 1>But as you move away from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it flips in some sense too.</v>

378
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what is going on here and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>might fall to something's going to bite</v>

379
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die a painful death.</v>

380
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't use the same circuits to</v>

381
00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:11.610
<v Speaker 1>process the first situation as you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process the second you don't even</v>

382
00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 1>like having the second one on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:20:14.131 --> 00:20:16.610
<v Speaker 1>so you know what it's like you're you.</v>

384
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've been feeling a bit down</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that always helps.</v>

385
00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And then you wake up at three in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and you're worrying about six</v>

386
00:20:22.381 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>things and you hear some random noise</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

387
00:20:25.081 --> 00:20:26.610
<v Speaker 1>There shouldn't be around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noise.</v>

388
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Well how you feel right then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is like to have the</v>

389
00:20:31.921 --> 00:20:36.870
<v Speaker 1>system that deals with the unexpected on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your like a prey animal really,</v>

390
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.070
<v Speaker 1>really exactly like what because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually what you are in many ways and</v>

391
00:20:41.071 --> 00:20:45.450
<v Speaker 1>so you know your whole biology</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed so that you're prepared for</v>

392
00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:47.620
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

393
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 1>what seem to have happened in the course</v>
<v Speaker 1>of evolution was that when we were</v>

394
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 1>smaller creatures all and far after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

395
00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:02.520
<v Speaker 1>before let's say we figured out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use throwing sticks and slings and then</v>

396
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:09.811
<v Speaker 1>later maybe bows and arrows or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>even sticks like we're getting eaten</v>

397
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.340
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you guys last week that</v>

398
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 1>they just discovered this damn cat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa that it looks like it prayed on</v>

399
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:19.270
<v Speaker 1>our fore bearers and or we have pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard skull.</v>

400
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.370
<v Speaker 1>So the normal cap can't really know all</v>
<v Speaker 1>three of them.</v>

401
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:24.460
<v Speaker 1>But this cat had a special set of teeth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it grabbed the front of your</v>

402
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:26.020
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would drive one of its teeth right</v>

403
00:21:26.021 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Speaker 1>through the back of your skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

404
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.470
<v Speaker 1>the hominids were preyed on enough so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had their own predators.</v>

405
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

406
00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:37.120
<v Speaker 1>that's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not very pleasant.</v>

407
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And then that's why the time we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>hominins you can go back farther than</v>

408
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:42.070
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we were little tree rats,</v>

409
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and then all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things we're eating us,</v>

410
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of reptiles around back</v>

411
00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:49.960
<v Speaker 1>then and s 60 million years ago and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't pleasant.</v>

412
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 1>There was phil dinosaurs around 60</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>

413
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.950
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of evolutionary time for us</v>

414
00:21:56.951 --> 00:22:01.180
<v Speaker 1>to have developed biological systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>that distinguished between places were</v>

415
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:02.890
<v Speaker 1>safe and places we're not safe.</v>

416
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you roughly have one set of</v>

417
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:12.510
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological neuropsycho</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological functions for familiar</v>

418
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:15.070
<v Speaker 1>territory and another set for unfamiliar</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

419
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Now what I would say this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where this becomes I think</v>

420
00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 1>radically different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The terror management theory.</v>

421
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.750
<v Speaker 1>What these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what this hierarchy is doing.</v>

422
00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:29.860
<v Speaker 1>When it's functioning is shutting off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's keeping the system that operates an</v>

423
00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:33.250
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory shut off and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

424
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's when you're calm and like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in here,</v>

425
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 1>you're know you're relatively at home</v>
<v Speaker 1>here because you assume that you know</v>

426
00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:45.160
<v Speaker 1>how to act here as long as you sit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask questions more or less</v>

427
00:22:45.161 --> 00:22:48.340
<v Speaker 1>appropriately and he don't bother people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't talk on your phone,</v>

428
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.120
<v Speaker 1>various other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to be</v>

429
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:56.170
<v Speaker 1>confronted by an angry primate or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other Predator is a very,</v>

430
00:22:56.171 --> 00:22:59.230
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so so,</v>

431
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 1>so you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're normal,</v>

432
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.260
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you do normally here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

433
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.590
<v Speaker 1>but I would say the only reason you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way normally to begin with is</v>

434
00:23:08.591 --> 00:23:12.160
<v Speaker 1>because you don't go places where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel not normal.</v>

435
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:14.980
<v Speaker 1>You stay away from them and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what those places are.</v>

436
00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:15.814
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

437
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I saw a real cool example of this once I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was down by,</v>

438
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.780
<v Speaker 1>by old cad about midnight on a Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

439
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

440
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.280
<v Speaker 1>it was in the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are all these kids really</v>

441
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.220
<v Speaker 1>wandering around in their party clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

442
00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into the clubs.</v>

443
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:39.271
<v Speaker 1>And I was standing there watching and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked through a park at this street</v>

444
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:44.560
<v Speaker 1>that runs by near Oca and there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>these houses,</v>

445
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 1>there was a row of houses and there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three houses here and they're all</v>

446
00:23:48.591 --> 00:23:51.320
<v Speaker 1>really nicely taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a house here.</v>

447
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.140
<v Speaker 1>And then there was some more houses over</v>
<v Speaker 1>here that were well taken care of.</v>

448
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:56.600
<v Speaker 1>And that house in the middle was</v>
<v Speaker 1>condemned,</v>

449
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the roof was pro rotting and they</v>

450
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.170
<v Speaker 1>boarded up all the windows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 1>and the fences were falling over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was garbage in the yard.</v>

452
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.150
<v Speaker 1>It was a derelict place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

453
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.820
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of a spooky place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

454
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.570
<v Speaker 1>while I was standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy walked down the street and he</v>

455
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:15.650
<v Speaker 1>was very intoxicated and he wasn't very</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy and he was sort of muttering to</v>

456
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:19.370
<v Speaker 1>himself and he passed the three houses</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were in pretty good shape.</v>

457
00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:22.820
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as he got in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the House that was derelict,</v>

458
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 1>he just started to rant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

459
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding up and down and muttering</v>

460
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:29.030
<v Speaker 1>paranoid things and yelling and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

461
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Speaker 1>it was sounding really dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he kept more or less moving forward.</v>

462
00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:35.900
<v Speaker 1>And then just after he got past that</v>
<v Speaker 1>border line and back into the more or</v>

463
00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Speaker 1>less normal neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he switched back to just mumbling</v>

464
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 1>quietly and walk forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

465
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:43.460
<v Speaker 1>he was so damn intoxicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a possibility that he</v>

466
00:24:43.461 --> 00:24:46.370
<v Speaker 1>noticed what had happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was being cued by the</v>

467
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:47.420
<v Speaker 1>surroundings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

468
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.080
<v Speaker 1>And it was a different hand when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in unexplored territory.</v>

469
00:24:51.081 --> 00:24:52.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was something that had degenerated</v>

470
00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:56.160
<v Speaker 1>back into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the anger and aggression came out of</v>

471
00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:59.810
<v Speaker 1>them because that's often necessary if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be where there's chaos,</v>

472
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaos can burst forth and does all</v>

473
00:25:02.841 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 1>the time in people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

474
00:25:04.341 --> 00:25:07.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're sitting around the dinner</v>
<v Speaker 1>table with your family and everything's</v>

475
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.860
<v Speaker 1>going pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone touches on,</v>

476
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those topics that you should just</v>

477
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:13.670
<v Speaker 1>shut the hell up about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 1>it can take almost no time at all before</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing unravels.</v>

479
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:20.060
<v Speaker 1>And then God only knows where you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not pleasant.</v>

480
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.190
<v Speaker 1>So instead of our belief systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting us from death,</v>

481
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:29.810
<v Speaker 1>anxiety are hierarchical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic systems for interacting with</v>

482
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:34.811
<v Speaker 1>the world stopped the parts of our brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>that deal with the unexpected from being</v>

483
00:25:35.001 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

484
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And they don't do that because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe they do that.</v>

485
00:25:39.531 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Because when we enact those structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all hell doesn't break loose.</v>

486
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.090
<v Speaker 1>So there's nothing illusory about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

487
00:25:47.091 --> 00:25:47.924
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

488
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the final analysis,</v>

489
00:25:49.521 --> 00:25:53.360
<v Speaker 1>does it really protect you from chaos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know that's an okay question.</v>

490
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:57.680
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time that's irrelevant.</v>

491
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.100
<v Speaker 1>It isn't always irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time it just doesn't</v>

492
00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:02.900
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is,</v>

493
00:26:02.901 --> 00:26:06.800
<v Speaker 1>is that much of the time it doesn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter if you believe this,</v>

494
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by which I would mean you have an</v>

495
00:26:09.831 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 1>articulated representation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a self representation.</v>

496
00:26:14.481 --> 00:26:18.140
<v Speaker 1>And you carry that around and maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a crisis of faith and you don't</v>

497
00:26:18.141 --> 00:26:20.560
<v Speaker 1>believe in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still act all this stuff out and</v>

498
00:26:20.561 --> 00:26:23.210
<v Speaker 1>most of the time you're still extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>well protected by it.</v>

499
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more robust than merely the</v>

500
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 1>articulated or imagined version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot deeper than that.</v>

501
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:35.480
<v Speaker 1>It's only a tiny part of its structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we should never really talk about</v>

502
00:26:35.481 --> 00:26:37.370
<v Speaker 1>belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

503
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Especially not if they're shared with</v>
<v Speaker 1>very many other people because they're</v>

504
00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 1>not structures of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're much deeper structures and that,</v>

505
00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:49.830
<v Speaker 1>and the belief part is only a pale</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection of the underlying reality.</v>

506
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

507
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I presume that makes sense and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can make sense of that in your</v>

508
00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 1>own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

509
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.330
<v Speaker 1>there's other things that can happen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that I should mention is lots of</v>

510
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 1>times people have chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

511
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 1>you think your body has explored</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

512
00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like the ultimate explored</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

513
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 1>But I would say don't get too convinced</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

514
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 1>That can also switch in a moment.</v>

515
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.730
<v Speaker 1>And it happens to people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you get a tooth pulled,</v>

516
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.270
<v Speaker 1>it takes your tongue like three months</v>
<v Speaker 1>to map the inside of your mouth.</v>

517
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's refamiliarizing your brain</v>

518
00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:26.190
<v Speaker 1>with the new territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

519
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.290
<v Speaker 1>And that is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

520
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:33.291
<v Speaker 1>So your body representation is insanely</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and it's really easy to</v>

521
00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.880
<v Speaker 1>screw up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you go to have someone go like</v>

522
00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:40.020
<v Speaker 1>that and then you point to one of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers in the middle and get them to</v>

523
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:41.040
<v Speaker 1>move it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't touch it,</v>

524
00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:45.150
<v Speaker 1>they often can't because just that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to boggle up their visual</v>

525
00:27:45.151 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 1>representation of their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can play all sorts of tricks</v>

526
00:27:48.661 --> 00:27:51.990
<v Speaker 1>on people that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

527
00:27:51.991 --> 00:27:54.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that your map of your body and your</v>

528
00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 1>body are sort of reasonably well</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated,</v>

529
00:27:57.361 --> 00:27:59.670
<v Speaker 1>but they can be dissociated quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>

530
00:27:59.671 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens when maybe you get a little</v>

531
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:06.420
<v Speaker 1>hypochondriacal and start worrying about</v>
<v Speaker 1>your health.</v>

532
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Something's bugging you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:09.810
<v Speaker 1>and you don't exactly know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

534
00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:12.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you get alienated from</v>

535
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:15.270
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can get really serious.</v>

536
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.140
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen people after a car</v>

537
00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:21.300
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was the most striking case of this</v>

538
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.660
<v Speaker 1>client.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had had her shoulder up like this.</v>

539
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.100
<v Speaker 1>And I noticed he never really looked in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the direction of that arm.</v>

540
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And when she moved that you'd only move</v>
<v Speaker 1>at about this far.</v>

541
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:33.210
<v Speaker 1>And after seeing her for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

542
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's afraid of that arm now.</v>

543
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:39.090
<v Speaker 1>It had been hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well why would you get afraid of your</v>

544
00:28:39.091 --> 00:28:40.500
<v Speaker 1>arm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

545
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.340
<v Speaker 1>doesn't act like it used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's annoying.</v>

546
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.510
<v Speaker 1>And then when you move it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hurts.</v>

547
00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:49.050
<v Speaker 1>And then you also don't know that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>move it wrong and it hurts whether</v>

548
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 1>you're making it worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you just kind of ignore it and</v>

549
00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:55.290
<v Speaker 1>then it sort of your arm and sort of not</v>
<v Speaker 1>your arm,</v>

550
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:55.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

551
00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Well I had her at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just practice doing this.</v>

552
00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:00.691
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

553
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:03.120
<v Speaker 1>can I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The action,</v>

554
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:04.560
<v Speaker 1>can you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd do it.</v>

555
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.690
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well can you do this?</v>

556
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.330
<v Speaker 1>And then she'd do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now can you do this?</v>

557
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:13.500
<v Speaker 1>We just kept doing this and only took</v>
<v Speaker 1>about half an hour until she was up</v>

558
00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:14.161
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

559
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't put my arm up there for two</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

560
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.570
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I get the same thing with their</v>

561
00:29:18.571 --> 00:29:19.410
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

562
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.720
<v Speaker 1>can you lift it cheap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

563
00:29:21.721 --> 00:29:23.280
<v Speaker 1>can you lift your shoulder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

564
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Can you lift at one 16 seven inch while</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could do that,</v>

565
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.210
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 times at one 16th of an inch and</v>

566
00:29:30.211 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 1>that's an inch and that's starting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get there.</v>

567
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did this a bunch and then her arm</v>

568
00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 1>went down so she'd been holding the damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm up for two years.</v>

569
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Just try that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

570
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just do this for five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see what happens.</v>

571
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 1>You just hold your shoulder up there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years and see what that does to the</v>

572
00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:50.170
<v Speaker 1>entire right side of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really,</v>

573
00:29:50.171 --> 00:29:52.480
<v Speaker 1>really stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

574
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I did something strange then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a whim,</v>

575
00:29:55.781 --> 00:29:58.780
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodying her because I was paying so</v>

576
00:29:58.781 --> 00:30:00.940
<v Speaker 1>close attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked her to come and lean over my</v>

577
00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 1>desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the way she was</v>

578
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.450
<v Speaker 1>holding herself that was really bugging</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

579
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And so I asked her just to lean over her</v>
<v Speaker 1>desk,</v>

580
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:09.340
<v Speaker 1>my desk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I pounded on her back down her</v>

581
00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:11.650
<v Speaker 1>spinal cord and she dropped her</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders again.</v>

582
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Then she cried for about half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

583
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.750
<v Speaker 1>and again it was because she got hit by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car.</v>

584
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.710
<v Speaker 1>That's how she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just walked around like that,</v>

585
00:30:20.711 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it permanently,</v>

586
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:23.590
<v Speaker 1>more or less.</v>

587
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we work it out of her reasonably well,</v>

588
00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:28.570
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

589
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:32.500
<v Speaker 1>even your own damn body can become</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory.</v>

590
00:30:32.501 --> 00:30:33.520
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another,</v>

591
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.420
<v Speaker 1>that's another way of understanding that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yin Yang symbol,</v>

592
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:42.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got the black serpent Paisley and</v>

593
00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 1>it's got a little white dog in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that sometimes when things</v>

594
00:30:45.251 --> 00:30:49.270
<v Speaker 1>are really broken all to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a solution can come blasting fourth.</v>

595
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:51.490
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos turns into order,</v>

596
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.910
<v Speaker 1>but more likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:30:55.150 --> 00:31:00.150
<v Speaker 1>everything's going pretty nicely and op</v>
<v Speaker 1>something comes and the chaos builds</v>

598
00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 1>into the order and that's the world you</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in.</v>

599
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really interesting to know that</v>

600
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:10.600
<v Speaker 1>because then the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

601
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:14.310
<v Speaker 1>well what do you do in order?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you do in chaos out?</v>

602
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Those are useful things to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of know what to do in order</v>

603
00:31:17.621 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 1>because order that sort of defines</v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

604
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really know what to do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

605
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact the field of mental health in</v>

606
00:31:25.601 --> 00:31:27.610
<v Speaker 1>some senses and attempt to figure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

607
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.540
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you some things to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in chaos.</v>

608
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.270
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're dealing with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's very,</v>

609
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:39.271
<v Speaker 1>very ill or maybe it's you that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very ill and so god only knows what's</v>

610
00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 1>going to happen in the future or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>next week.</v>

611
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Well the first thing you do is stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about next week and the future</v>

612
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.320
<v Speaker 1>because it's not calculable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

613
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.500
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pathways have become so multiple and</v>

614
00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 1>so uncontrollable that if you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about them,</v>

615
00:31:57.191 --> 00:32:00.250
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

616
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just not think about it</v>

617
00:32:02.741 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 1>because that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you can do is narrow your</v>

618
00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 1>timeframe of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

619
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:10.030
<v Speaker 1>so instead of worrying about the week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

620
00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:12.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's make this day as good as it</v>

621
00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:14.680
<v Speaker 1>can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're really stressed it's</v>

622
00:32:14.681 --> 00:32:15.250
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

623
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:20.170
<v Speaker 1>we're going to really work on this hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is you hyper at 10</v>

624
00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:25.171
<v Speaker 1>to the local space time area and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've got.</v>

625
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 1>You can work with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really works.</v>

626
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're dealing with people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are dying,</v>

627
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:31.120
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>

628
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 1>He was zero in to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the right level of resolution</v>

629
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:38.470
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell when it's the right</v>

630
00:32:38.471 --> 00:32:42.830
<v Speaker 1>resume level of resolution because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't feel like you don't know what</v>

631
00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>you're doing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing here?</v>

632
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:46.460
<v Speaker 1>What am I supposed to do here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does all this mean?</v>

633
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:49.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause those are the wrong questions at</v>

634
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:51.130
<v Speaker 1>that point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe,</v>

635
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try and make the person comfortable and</v>

636
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention so that you can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right micro movements and the right</v>

637
00:32:57.411 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 1>micro attitudes in those critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>

638
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one way of dealing with</v>

639
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:06.170
<v Speaker 1>the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need to know that because it's</v>

640
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:07.004
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>

641
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're really stressed,</v>

642
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 1>you think about less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about smaller amounts of space</v>

643
00:33:12.651 --> 00:33:15.560
<v Speaker 1>and time and you could try to get them</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

644
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:20.450
<v Speaker 1>It's still important to get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the entropy is so high at that</v>

645
00:33:20.451 --> 00:33:23.480
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the landscape is so complicated that</v>

646
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:28.040
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can map more of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a few moments out of time.</v>

647
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out often that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay,</v>

648
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.140
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

649
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:36.950
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously it's not optimal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing you can be sure of is you</v>

650
00:33:36.951 --> 00:33:40.580
<v Speaker 1>can take a terrible situation and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could make it a hell of a lot worse.</v>

651
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.640
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a terrible situation and you</v>

652
00:33:43.641 --> 00:33:47.300
<v Speaker 1>manage it as well as it can be managed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's only terrible,</v>

653
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.990
<v Speaker 1>but if you take a terrible situation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you manage it really badly,</v>

654
00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:53.360
<v Speaker 1>then it can be something you'll never</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever recover from.</v>

655
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

656
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be hyper optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

657
00:33:57.561 --> 00:33:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I know that people go through rough</v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

658
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 1>but there's a difference between tragedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hale.</v>

659
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.250
<v Speaker 1>And tragedy is when something terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and unit and you're awake and</v>

660
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:11.600
<v Speaker 1>hell is when something terrible happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not awake and that's a place</v>

661
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:13.460
<v Speaker 1>you really don't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

662
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:16.760
<v Speaker 1>So then the death of your father could</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn it into the obliteration of your</v>

663
00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:18.440
<v Speaker 1>entire family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

664
00:34:18.441 --> 00:34:22.400
<v Speaker 1>you know the first is bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second might well be unbearable.</v>

665
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause people often fight in</v>

666
00:34:24.141 --> 00:34:26.300
<v Speaker 1>circumstances like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

667
00:34:26.301 --> 00:34:27.890
<v Speaker 1>the family gets very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very stressed.</v>

668
00:34:27.891 --> 00:34:29.270
<v Speaker 1>It's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

669
00:34:29.271 --> 00:34:32.000
<v Speaker 1>if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple has a sick child or a child</v>

670
00:34:32.001 --> 00:34:34.940
<v Speaker 1>that dies that they get divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not surprising.</v>

671
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not like they have a</v>

672
00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:40.460
<v Speaker 1>psychological problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a real problem and they might</v>

673
00:34:40.461 --> 00:34:42.950
<v Speaker 1>be amplifying it with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological problems.</v>

674
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:46.510
<v Speaker 1>But all problems are not psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

675
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's also useful to know because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you end up somewhere that you don't</v>

676
00:34:50.031 --> 00:34:52.250
<v Speaker 1>expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be thinking,</v>

677
00:34:52.251 --> 00:34:55.760
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I wasn't such a useless fool,</v>

678
00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I would've never ended up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

679
00:34:58.371 --> 00:35:00.950
<v Speaker 1>and there's a much more pessimistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought than that.</v>

680
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.060
<v Speaker 1>That's much more useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is whether you are a fool or not,</v>

681
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:07.400
<v Speaker 1>you are going to end up somewhere like</v>
<v Speaker 1>big now and then.</v>

682
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:08.750
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

683
00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:10.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a horrible thing to think because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

684
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:15.080
<v Speaker 1>that means that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our destinies are uncontrollable.</v>

685
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 1>At least in park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

686
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:17.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

687
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.990
<v Speaker 1>So partly what that means is prepare</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself for that.</v>

688
00:35:20.991 --> 00:35:25.991
<v Speaker 1>And don't pound yourself into the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get there because it happens to</v>

689
00:35:26.271 --> 00:35:28.790
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't necessarily the case that</v>

690
00:35:28.791 --> 00:35:31.820
<v Speaker 1>the reason it happened to you is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're useless now that might have</v>

691
00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 1>furthered the process and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just don't need those thoughts</v>

692
00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:36.434
<v Speaker 1>at that time.</v>

693
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:38.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they do is undermine you.</v>

694
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

695
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's dog dies,</v>

696
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 1>which is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

697
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:51.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes some of the guilt out of it and</v>

698
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.060
<v Speaker 1>the guilt is something that at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point you don't really need.</v>

699
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:55.523
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

700
00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:01.020
<v Speaker 1>you've got your explored territory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've kind of walked through what that</v>

701
00:36:01.021 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 1>is and then you have your unexplored</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

702
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.910
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the sort of things</v>

703
00:36:05.911 --> 00:36:09.030
<v Speaker 1>that exist on the fringe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I W I would say in some sense the things</v>

704
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:11.640
<v Speaker 1>that exist on the fringe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to the unknown,</v>

705
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.460
<v Speaker 1>those are usually symbolized by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the terrible mother.</v>

706
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.240
<v Speaker 1>And then the order is symbolized by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible father.</v>

707
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 1>And then the chaos that's beyond order</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond knowing,</v>

708
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:26.100
<v Speaker 1>that's beyond order in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dragon of chaos.</v>

709
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a reptile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

710
00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:31.920
<v Speaker 1>A reptilian carnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a reptilian carnivore that has a</v>

711
00:36:31.921 --> 00:36:34.980
<v Speaker 1>variety of interesting properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me show you some of the pictures</v>

712
00:36:34.981 --> 00:36:38.190
<v Speaker 1>that I've got here of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dragon of chaos.</v>

713
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.283
<v Speaker 1>This is a good one.</v>

714
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's a figure called a neuro</v>
<v Speaker 1>burrows.</v>

715
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:48.510
<v Speaker 1>And you could say in some sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the first graphical</v>

716
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:52.950
<v Speaker 1>representations of the infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

717
00:36:52.951 --> 00:36:54.720
<v Speaker 1>we have a symbol for infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

718
00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.370
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another thing that's pretty</v>

719
00:36:56.371 --> 00:36:59.730
<v Speaker 1>weird to symbolize because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>encapsulating something that can't be</v>

720
00:36:59.731 --> 00:37:01.770
<v Speaker 1>encapsulated inside a capsule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

721
00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:06.030
<v Speaker 1>It's very sneaky to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you actually need it to do advanced</v>

722
00:37:06.031 --> 00:37:09.030
<v Speaker 1>mathematics of all sorts of kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

723
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.870
<v Speaker 1>so it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in so far as you can use it as</v>

724
00:37:12.871 --> 00:37:14.760
<v Speaker 1>a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me tell you a few things about</v>

725
00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:16.950
<v Speaker 1>this symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This representation,</v>

726
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:23.910
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like the Judeo Christian</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of God being the Alpha and Omega,</v>

727
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.210
<v Speaker 1>which is this thing that exists at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the time,</v>

728
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way to the end of time.</v>

729
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.550
<v Speaker 1>So it's something that that exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of time.</v>

730
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:37.560
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about this at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>level as the eternal presence of the</v>

731
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators come and go.</v>

732
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:45.080
<v Speaker 1>The Predator never goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got this God,</v>

733
00:37:45.081 --> 00:37:47.880
<v Speaker 1>like you can say the spirit of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator never disappears.</v>

734
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.300
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you think that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you have some idea about what</v>

735
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 1>archaic people were doing when they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>populating the world of spirits.</v>

736
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Speaker 1>The difference between a spirit and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract idea is like there's no</v>

737
00:37:59.461 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

738
00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:04.020
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of the Predator and Hannah</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabits the jungle.</v>

739
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:04.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

740
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.530
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you should be very careful about</v>

741
00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:09.570
<v Speaker 1>disturbing such spirits when you go in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

742
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you might ask yourself,</v>

743
00:38:11.821 --> 00:38:13.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a predator?</v>

744
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a complicated thing because you</v>

745
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would say because we're</v>

746
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:23.460
<v Speaker 1>scientifically minded that you can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators and you could classify them</v>

747
00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:27.090
<v Speaker 1>according to their species and there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>subspecies in their Fila and all that</v>

748
00:38:27.091 --> 00:38:27.570
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>

749
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we think about classifying them as</v>

750
00:38:30.061 --> 00:38:35.061
<v Speaker 1>objects and then maybe in terms of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary origins,</v>

751
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.110
<v Speaker 1>but that's not very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

752
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 1>if something jumps out in and he's wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat you,</v>

753
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing what it is might help you plot</v>

754
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 1>your escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all those additional complexities,</v>

755
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:47.950
<v Speaker 1>they're just not the relevant issue at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>

756
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:52.510
<v Speaker 1>The realm of the issue is how do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the predators out away from your</v>

757
00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:54.700
<v Speaker 1>explored territory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

758
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a complicated question because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

759
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean right now,</v>

760
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:09.490
<v Speaker 1>while you're walking through the Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean right now for you and your</v>

761
00:39:09.491 --> 00:39:11.320
<v Speaker 1>family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will all of you are walking through the</v>

762
00:39:11.321 --> 00:39:13.840
<v Speaker 1>bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this old joke about these two</v>

763
00:39:13.841 --> 00:39:17.620
<v Speaker 1>guys that go out in the forest and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy says to the other,</v>

764
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.980
<v Speaker 1>there's grizzly bears here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to be careful.</v>

765
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.380
<v Speaker 1>And then the other guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

766
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.580
<v Speaker 1>how fast can you run?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first guy says,</v>

767
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 1>well don't you mean how fast does the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly bear rug?</v>

768
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:36.520
<v Speaker 1>And the first guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

769
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.890
<v Speaker 1>that is not what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to know if I can run faster</v>

770
00:39:38.891 --> 00:39:41.230
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

771
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:41.921
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

772
00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:43.480
<v Speaker 1>so right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you that</v>

773
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:48.481
<v Speaker 1>stupid joke is because what you want as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an answer to the question depends on</v>

774
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:54.490
<v Speaker 1>exactly how you put the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the answer there was,</v>

775
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:57.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if the grizzly bear eats</v>

776
00:39:57.731 --> 00:39:59.770
<v Speaker 1>someone as long as it's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

777
00:39:59.771 --> 00:40:01.510
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one answer to the question.</v>

778
00:40:01.511 --> 00:40:03.190
<v Speaker 1>But then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

779
00:40:03.191 --> 00:40:07.420
<v Speaker 1>let's keep the grizzly bears away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>me now my family now,</v>

780
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.650
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my tribe now me tomorrow,</v>

781
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.080
<v Speaker 1>my family tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my tribe tomorrow,</v>

782
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.830
<v Speaker 1>then across the week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then across the month,</v>

783
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:20.470
<v Speaker 1>then across the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe forever.</v>

784
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how is it that you have to act so</v>

785
00:40:22.601 --> 00:40:25.280
<v Speaker 1>that you keep the predators away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

786
00:40:25.281 --> 00:40:29.720
<v Speaker 1>That starts to become an extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated problem because the simplest</v>

787
00:40:29.721 --> 00:40:31.120
<v Speaker 1>solution might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

788
00:40:31.121 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 1>when there's a Predator around climb a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree or run into a whole,</v>

789
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.060
<v Speaker 1>which is what lots of animals do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

790
00:40:37.061 --> 00:40:39.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty partial solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get eaten that day.</v>

791
00:40:39.851 --> 00:40:44.380
<v Speaker 1>But what about tomorrow when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators little hungrier and kind of a</v>

792
00:40:44.381 --> 00:40:46.540
<v Speaker 1>bonehead and solutional things</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered.</v>

793
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.610
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if we thought of the spirit of the</v>

794
00:40:51.611 --> 00:40:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more like the fact that there</v>

795
00:40:55.781 --> 00:40:58.990
<v Speaker 1>is a class of predators and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>never going to go away,</v>

796
00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:03.970
<v Speaker 1>then miss that question we have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer is how do we act so that that</v>

797
00:41:03.971 --> 00:41:07.240
<v Speaker 1>class that's eternal doesn't bother us</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore than necessary?</v>

798
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Well that's really complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

799
00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:13.810
<v Speaker 1>really complicated because it might mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

800
00:41:13.811 --> 00:41:18.280
<v Speaker 1>well how should you act because</v>
<v Speaker 1>conquering the problem of having your</v>

801
00:41:18.281 --> 00:41:23.281
<v Speaker 1>territory invaded cause there's not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like reptilian and Mammalian predators.</v>

802
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like third things with teeth.</v>

803
00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:30.490
<v Speaker 1>There's other people and like there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot worse than anything else that is</v>

804
00:41:30.491 --> 00:41:32.860
<v Speaker 1>going to come at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you also have that problem.</v>

805
00:41:32.861 --> 00:41:36.950
<v Speaker 1>How You keep yourself away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory people and the foreign tribes</v>

806
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:39.890
<v Speaker 1>that are going to invade your land</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't take it well.</v>

807
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.970
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between that</v>

808
00:41:43.971 --> 00:41:46.490
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you establish the security of</v>

809
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:49.430
<v Speaker 1>a nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking or maybe even how do</v>

810
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you establish peace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

811
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a question that it doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious borders.</v>

812
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one answer might be stay away from</v>

813
00:41:57.861 --> 00:41:58.850
<v Speaker 1>the dam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Predators.</v>

814
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you build a big wall or someone else</v>

815
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:05.780
<v Speaker 1>does and you hide inside the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not a bad solution.</v>

816
00:42:05.781 --> 00:42:08.870
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's what people started</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do when they originally built cities.</v>

817
00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 1>They built these big walls like trump is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to build between Canada and the U</v>

818
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:17.330
<v Speaker 1>S and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it'll keep the predators out.</v>

819
00:42:17.331 --> 00:42:19.370
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we know from the story of</v>

820
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:24.371
<v Speaker 1>genesis and from the Taoist symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how big the wall is,</v>

821
00:42:24.381 --> 00:42:28.220
<v Speaker 1>you can't keep out the damn snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you build a wall and all the snakes</v>

822
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.580
<v Speaker 1>pop up inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a very good solution.</v>

823
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.170
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty obvious,</v>

824
00:42:33.171 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

825
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:36.900
<v Speaker 1>my suspicions are that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

826
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:41.270
<v Speaker 1>mass shooters who are native to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States kill a lot more people in</v>

827
00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:44.840
<v Speaker 1>the u s every week that Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal Mexican immigrants.</v>

828
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:46.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

829
00:42:46.781 --> 00:42:49.430
<v Speaker 1>soul looks like what problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly are you solving?</v>

830
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.863
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

831
00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first question you have to solve</v>

832
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:03.700
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

833
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.660
<v Speaker 1>there's no point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no solution to this</v>

834
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:06.494
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

835
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:10.263
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

836
00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.720
<v Speaker 1>So why did you laugh at that</v>

837
00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:26.010
<v Speaker 2>do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it opened again and there was</v>

838
00:43:26.011 --> 00:43:26.844
<v Speaker 2>unexpected.</v>

839
00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why didn't that terrify you walk.</v>

840
00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.160
<v Speaker 1>But you know what's related to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy at she,</v>

841
00:43:33.161 --> 00:43:34.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like the door isn't behaving</v>

842
00:43:34.931 --> 00:43:37.120
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what's funny about that?</v>

843
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny to watch someone,</v>

844
00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.760
<v Speaker 1>someone's little routine not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the consequences are trivial.</v>

845
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well he knows how to close the door.</v>

846
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now he's got the problem of this door</v>

847
00:43:51.431 --> 00:43:53.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's a stupid problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody could laugh about it,</v>

848
00:43:53.741 --> 00:43:55.540
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So little,</v>

849
00:43:55.570 --> 00:44:00.040
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little anomalies that you could bind</v>

850
00:44:00.041 --> 00:44:02.320
<v Speaker 1>quickly are comical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

851
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.560
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's an indication to tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you the truth.</v>

852
00:44:05.561 --> 00:44:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an indication of people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent ability.</v>

853
00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians do this with you too,</v>

854
00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:13.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd be,</v>

855
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:14.830
<v Speaker 1>you'd be sitting in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comedian,</v>

856
00:44:14.831 --> 00:44:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll say this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then this thing,</v>

857
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:18.970
<v Speaker 1>and they're connected some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obvious.</v>

858
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:23.260
<v Speaker 1>And then you go click and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like everybody celebrates their</v>

859
00:44:23.261 --> 00:44:24.340
<v Speaker 1>brilliance together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

860
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:25.031
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

861
00:44:25.031 --> 00:44:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Ha ha ha aren't nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>

862
00:44:26.741 --> 00:44:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it transforms you into the pub from the</v>

863
00:44:29.561 --> 00:44:33.180
<v Speaker 1>puzzle thing into the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone really likes that.</v>

864
00:44:33.181 --> 00:44:33.841
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

865
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:34.770
<v Speaker 1>we solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

866
00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:35.730
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can go and,</v>

867
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:36.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat down,</v>

868
00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:38.580
<v Speaker 1>known together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

869
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.520
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got this chaos thing here.</v>

870
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

871
00:44:43.951 --> 00:44:46.750
<v Speaker 1>that's called a neuro burrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>

872
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.110
<v Speaker 1>the reason it's got its tail in it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth is,</v>

873
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.131
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

874
00:44:50.131 --> 00:44:50.911
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

875
00:44:50.911 --> 00:44:53.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that that's trying to represent</v>

876
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 1>is that this thing is complete unto</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

877
00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's a symbol of totality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everything.</v>

878
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:05.190
<v Speaker 1>How well you walk into the room where</v>
<v Speaker 1>your interview is.</v>

879
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.410
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in there?</v>

880
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.900
<v Speaker 1>While a better question is what's not in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

881
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a better question because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole damn futures in there,</v>

882
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.070
<v Speaker 1>and you don't even know how much that</v>
<v Speaker 1>branches your futures.</v>

883
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.890
<v Speaker 1>They're the future of your children is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

884
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:21.720
<v Speaker 1>The future of your grandchildren is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

885
00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:25.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these waves that go out from</v>

886
00:45:25.111 --> 00:45:28.650
<v Speaker 1>that room that that in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you stretch them forward</v>

887
00:45:28.651 --> 00:45:31.020
<v Speaker 1>in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have almost no boundary.</v>

888
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:32.700
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

889
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of us is descended from one person.</v>

890
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how many millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

891
00:45:37.231 --> 00:45:41.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that many to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's even earlier than that,</v>

892
00:45:41.701 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 1>650,000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

893
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:47.070
<v Speaker 1>So for all you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you could be like the person who</v>

894
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:49.200
<v Speaker 1>through whom the entire human race</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>

895
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.710
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's because you made the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right decision in that interview.</v>

896
00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:55.920
<v Speaker 1>My point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that potential itself has no</v>

897
00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:57.870
<v Speaker 1>boundary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no obvious boundary,</v>

898
00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know what you're messing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with when you're messing with it.</v>

899
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

900
00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:04.560
<v Speaker 1>So how should you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

901
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 1>this figure says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

902
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:09.810
<v Speaker 1>you better watch out because some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's predatory and the crawls along the</v>

903
00:46:09.811 --> 00:46:12.960
<v Speaker 1>ground and it's got teeth and it's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn joke.</v>

904
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:14.790
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can think it's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>

905
00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:16.590
<v Speaker 1>like a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sneak around through the,</v>

906
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.420
<v Speaker 1>through the grass and then it sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodile light because snakes don't</v>

907
00:46:21.421 --> 00:46:22.650
<v Speaker 1>have teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but crocodile.</v>

908
00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Sure the hell do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so do other predatory lizards.</v>

909
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:27.900
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we've talked about before,</v>

910
00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:32.901
<v Speaker 1>the probability that our ancestral</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes dwelling African ancestors were</v>

911
00:46:33.511 --> 00:46:37.860
<v Speaker 1>regularly lunched upon by crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty damn high because how else</v>

912
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:39.810
<v Speaker 1>would they get water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

913
00:46:39.811 --> 00:46:43.290
<v Speaker 1>and you gotta be pretty mean before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can take on a Nile crocodile.</v>

914
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we did that fairly early in our</v>

915
00:46:45.811 --> 00:46:48.060
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before that we were,</v>

916
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.880
<v Speaker 1>a lot of us were snacks for lizards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

917
00:46:50.881 --> 00:46:52.800
<v Speaker 1>which seems like just not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

918
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.293
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

919
00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.710
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

920
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:58.670
<v Speaker 1>so this thing also lives in a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon.</v>

921
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.550
<v Speaker 1>It's usually live in holes or</v>
<v Speaker 1>underground,</v>

922
00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:03.820
<v Speaker 1>like Harry Potter's Basilisk and usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're immortal.</v>

923
00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.410
<v Speaker 1>They live in a cave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were mortal,</v>

924
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live forever.</v>

925
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to bother them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they pop out of their whole,</v>

926
00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.710
<v Speaker 1>like they do in the hobbit and they come</v>
<v Speaker 1>and burn down your village.</v>

927
00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Like leave the damn dragon alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

928
00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:18.370
<v Speaker 1>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not leave it alone?</v>

929
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would be better to go get the</v>

930
00:47:22.481 --> 00:47:25.660
<v Speaker 1>dragon before it gives you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly possible.</v>

931
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.880
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this other weird thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about dragons,</v>

932
00:47:27.881 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Speaker 1>which is that they hoard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you can go and confront the</v>

933
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:35.470
<v Speaker 1>dragon and you get the treasurer and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>treasurer takes basically two forms.</v>

934
00:47:35.471 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's the St George story where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>treasure is often an,</v>

935
00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:39.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

936
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped young female and other version</v>

937
00:47:43.931 --> 00:47:44.764
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

938
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.460
<v Speaker 1>the dragon sits on gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what's the whole idea there?</v>

939
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the best way to overcome</v>

940
00:47:51.701 --> 00:47:54.340
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of the creditor is to</v>

941
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.330
<v Speaker 1>confronted.</v>

942
00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of an idea.</v>

943
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

944
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:04.630
<v Speaker 1>how deep an idea is that you confront</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Predator,</v>

945
00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:05.740
<v Speaker 1>you get the gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

946
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:09.530
<v Speaker 1>this is that you confront infinite</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility and you get the,</v>

947
00:48:09.531 --> 00:48:12.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reward you encounter infinite</v>

948
00:48:12.671 --> 00:48:17.230
<v Speaker 1>possibility properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You derive from it the rewards that it</v>

949
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:19.240
<v Speaker 1>offers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the rewards that infinite</v>

950
00:48:19.241 --> 00:48:22.630
<v Speaker 1>possibility offers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

951
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea.</v>

952
00:48:24.451 --> 00:48:28.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting because we live</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a time in history where that's</v>

953
00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:32.260
<v Speaker 1>literally true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would hesitate to predict</v>

954
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.620
<v Speaker 1>anything about 50 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

955
00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quit worrying about the future,</v>

956
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:40.240
<v Speaker 1>about 20 years ago because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

957
00:48:40.241 --> 00:48:42.760
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what happens,</v>

958
00:48:42.761 --> 00:48:45.460
<v Speaker 1>the probability that it's something I</v>
<v Speaker 1>predict is zero.</v>

959
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's like whatever you're worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

960
00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 1>well I'll go ahead and worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something completely different is</v>

961
00:48:51.131 --> 00:48:52.060
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

962
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:57.640
<v Speaker 1>so it's not really all that useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just be ready for whatever comes because</v>

963
00:48:57.641 --> 00:48:59.140
<v Speaker 1>here it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

964
00:48:59.141 --> 00:49:03.310
<v Speaker 1>like I think where I'll have fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>functional autonomous robots within</v>

965
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:05.170
<v Speaker 1>three or four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

966
00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.240
<v Speaker 1>and that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real game changer,</v>

967
00:49:07.241 --> 00:49:09.360
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows what's going to</v>

968
00:49:09.361 --> 00:49:12.220
<v Speaker 1>happen after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transplantable organs,</v>

969
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.830
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can print those on three d</v>

970
00:49:14.831 --> 00:49:17.440
<v Speaker 1>printers already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

971
00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>augmented intelligence,</v>

972
00:49:19.901 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 1>while you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all have augmented intelligence</v>

973
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:23.780
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What good are facts?</v>

974
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.080
<v Speaker 1>He's look them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

975
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's an infinite supply and facts.</v>

976
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:34.290
<v Speaker 3>Can you explain and different words why</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dragon?</v>

977
00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Because it has everything it needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

978
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.920
<v Speaker 1>that's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

979
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:45.570
<v Speaker 1>it's self contained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

980
00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:49.290
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't need anything outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and there isn't anything outside</v>

981
00:49:49.291 --> 00:49:54.030
<v Speaker 1>of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't rely on anything to exist.</v>

982
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.430
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just there.</v>

983
00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:01.820
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an echo of the idea there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that of have an idea of beyond time</v>

984
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:06.360
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know so much beyond space but</v>

985
00:50:06.361 --> 00:50:09.510
<v Speaker 1>certainly be on time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time has no effect on it.</v>

986
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:12.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's beyond time in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

987
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:17.760
<v Speaker 3>There's another reason has its tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>snuff and that's because it represents</v>

988
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.800
<v Speaker 3>the border between the known world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all its goodness and badness.</v>

989
00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Unknown world order can get smaller</v>

990
00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 1>as it gets more of its tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

991
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

992
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:37.070
<v Speaker 1>so now it has wings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have links?</v>

993
00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.293
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

994
00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:42.720
<v Speaker 1>well this is another horribly</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated thing.</v>

995
00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you a diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the closest I've been able to</v>

996
00:50:48.001 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 1>get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often don't talk about this diagram,</v>

997
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:58.180
<v Speaker 1>but I guess I am today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

998
00:51:21.131 --> 00:51:21.881
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

999
00:51:21.881 --> 00:51:26.550
<v Speaker 1>we must go through this completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1000
00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.690
<v Speaker 1>So here's you.</v>

1001
00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:36.573
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1002
00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.520
<v Speaker 1>if you look right in the middle there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here I'll,</v>

1003
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:40.403
<v Speaker 1>I'll make it bigger</v>

1004
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:42.490
<v Speaker 2>so that you can see it.</v>

1005
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.040
<v Speaker 1>You kind of think that you're right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1006
00:51:47.041 --> 00:51:49.710
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of where your consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally sits.</v>

1007
00:51:49.711 --> 00:51:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you yourself that's sort of your</v>

1008
00:51:52.321 --> 00:51:55.140
<v Speaker 1>conscious body envelope and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you your family?</v>

1009
00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Well you know the border there is rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>pliable.</v>

1010
00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Well then you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can drill down into the self and</v>

1011
00:52:04.051 --> 00:52:05.940
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of the idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

1012
00:52:05.941 --> 00:52:07.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look at principles.</v>

1013
00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:11.730
<v Speaker 1>So those are your general philosophical</v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs and then your programs and then</v>

1014
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:15.480
<v Speaker 1>the sequence of behaviors that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiate that in and then your</v>

1015
00:52:15.481 --> 00:52:18.570
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can go below that even.</v>

1016
00:52:18.571 --> 00:52:23.490
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of yourself as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you're behaving well,</v>

1017
00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:24.840
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's under that?</v>

1018
00:52:24.841 --> 00:52:25.620
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1019
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.420
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the support for that?</v>

1020
00:52:27.421 --> 00:52:28.590
<v Speaker 1>The platform for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1021
00:52:28.591 --> 00:52:29.760
<v Speaker 1>it's your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1022
00:52:29.761 --> 00:52:31.110
<v Speaker 1>So what's there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1023
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:35.280
<v Speaker 1>once you get past the level of arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like musculature and then</v>

1024
00:52:35.281 --> 00:52:36.001
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1025
00:52:36.001 --> 00:52:37.260
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1026
00:52:37.261 --> 00:52:38.730
<v Speaker 1>what's under that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what's,</v>

1027
00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:40.080
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's next?</v>

1028
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your cellular structure.</v>

1029
00:52:42.151 --> 00:52:45.570
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what cellular biologist</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying God,</v>

1030
00:52:45.571 --> 00:52:48.000
<v Speaker 1>that's so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then below that,</v>

1031
00:52:48.001 --> 00:52:50.430
<v Speaker 1>while you have your molecular structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dna,</v>

1032
00:52:50.431 --> 00:52:52.560
<v Speaker 1>and then underneath that there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>atomic structure.</v>

1033
00:52:52.561 --> 00:52:55.090
<v Speaker 1>And then underneath that there's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subatomic structure.</v>

1034
00:52:55.091 --> 00:52:57.750
<v Speaker 1>And what are you going to say about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1035
00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.290
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't even time at that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1036
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:06.820
<v Speaker 1>and then you can do the same thing if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go up,</v>

1037
00:53:06.821 --> 00:53:09.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you shouldn't just pay attention to</v>

1038
00:53:09.131 --> 00:53:10.420
<v Speaker 1>your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're,</v>

1039
00:53:10.421 --> 00:53:12.550
<v Speaker 1>you're in a cultural group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're important too.</v>

1040
00:53:12.551 --> 00:53:14.560
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the biological group that</v>

1041
00:53:14.561 --> 00:53:16.900
<v Speaker 1>that's nested in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you should be paying more</v>

1042
00:53:16.901 --> 00:53:19.520
<v Speaker 1>attention to the ecosystem rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>to yourself.</v>

1043
00:53:19.521 --> 00:53:22.630
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shade upward into this thing that</v>

1044
00:53:22.631 --> 00:53:26.370
<v Speaker 1>you can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really dissociate yourself</v>

1045
00:53:26.371 --> 00:53:29.340
<v Speaker 1>from Arthur now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1046
00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 1>so that's what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake about it.</v>

1047
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Like you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness is such that you only</v>

1048
00:53:35.971 --> 00:53:40.971
<v Speaker 1>are located at in some sense at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of observation and that God only</v>

1049
00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:43.140
<v Speaker 1>knows why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if,</v>

1050
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:47.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being has to come to a pinpoint in order</v>

1051
00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:48.990
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for things to exist.</v>

1052
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.540
<v Speaker 1>The way I've been thinking about it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some senses,</v>

1053
00:53:51.541 --> 00:53:55.380
<v Speaker 1>like you could take ever all of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and you know,</v>

1054
00:53:55.410 --> 00:54:00.410
<v Speaker 1>narrow it down to a single point of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pencil that's writing and the writing is</v>

1055
00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:03.060
<v Speaker 1>the transformation of potential into</v>
<v Speaker 1>actuality.</v>

1056
00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.770
<v Speaker 1>But in order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

1057
00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.940
<v Speaker 1>you there has to be a point of contact</v>
<v Speaker 1>between you and potential.</v>

1058
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your body and part.</v>

1059
00:54:11.151 --> 00:54:14.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's even narrower than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever occupies your,</v>

1060
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:19.320
<v Speaker 1>this tiny little laser beam of attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're wandering through the</v>

1061
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:21.340
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like burning reality into</v>

1062
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.230
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
00:54:22.231 --> 00:54:24.720
<v Speaker 1>so why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1064
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:26.460
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

1065
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:30.030
<v Speaker 1>It's beyond strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1066
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way of thinking about this whole</v>

1067
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 1>structure is that you can think about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the psychological world because</v>

1068
00:54:38.161 --> 00:54:40.680
<v Speaker 1>you're at the center of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can think about it as the</v>

1069
00:54:40.681 --> 00:54:43.020
<v Speaker 1>spiritual world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about spirit as a</v>

1070
00:54:43.021 --> 00:54:46.590
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a material world anyways.</v>

1071
00:54:46.591 --> 00:54:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Or if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the material world in so far as</v>

1072
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:53.820
<v Speaker 1>it's you as a living conscious being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1073
00:54:53.821 --> 00:54:56.640
<v Speaker 1>we tend to separate out consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and matter,</v>

1074
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm conscious that that's</v>

1075
00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:02.700
<v Speaker 1>something we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't take this table is so we think</v>

1076
00:55:02.701 --> 00:55:05.340
<v Speaker 1>of them as separate substances in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

1077
00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Spirit and matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what that dragon is.</v>

1078
00:55:07.831 --> 00:55:10.200
<v Speaker 1>It's half matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's crawling around</v>

1079
00:55:10.201 --> 00:55:13.140
<v Speaker 1>on the ground and it's half spirit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Wayne's.</v>

1080
00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:16.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's many might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why the hell is the dragon half</v>

1081
00:55:16.291 --> 00:55:20.850
<v Speaker 1>spirit and half matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we've got the spirit park?</v>

1082
00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I just showed you it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm going to show you the</v>

1083
00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:23.850
<v Speaker 1>mattered park.</v>

1084
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:26.200
<v Speaker 2>That's worse.</v>

1085
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could say,</v>

1086
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:48.290
<v Speaker 1>well what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1087
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a chair.</v>

1088
00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.330
<v Speaker 1>You think that's pretty straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward?</v>

1089
00:55:53.331 --> 00:55:56.150
<v Speaker 1>It's actually not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you why very rapidly.</v>

1090
00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it a chair?</v>

1091
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.870
<v Speaker 1>How would a bean bag,</v>

1092
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:06.430
<v Speaker 1>is that a chair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we can sit in it.</v>

1093
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:07.490
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1094
00:56:07.491 --> 00:56:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Because we can sit in it and that seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the fundamental issue.</v>

1095
00:56:11.121 --> 00:56:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Is this a chair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be,</v>

1096
00:56:15.261 --> 00:56:15.861
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:56:15.861 --> 00:56:19.570
<v Speaker 1>You'd say it's not a canonical chair and</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither is a bean bag chair.</v>

1098
00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:22.070
<v Speaker 1>It could be a bean bag or a stump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1099
00:56:22.071 --> 00:56:26.080
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of a canonical chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But part of my point is,</v>

1100
00:56:26.081 --> 00:56:30.220
<v Speaker 1>you know the typical answer that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>will give when you ask why is that a</v>

1101
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:32.920
<v Speaker 1>chairs that they'll lay out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective structure,</v>

1102
00:56:32.921 --> 00:56:36.070
<v Speaker 1>which is really no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's only a tiny bit of why it's a</v>

1103
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:36.841
<v Speaker 1>chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1104
00:56:36.841 --> 00:56:40.060
<v Speaker 1>if it was that high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well would it be a chair?</v>

1105
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:45.130
<v Speaker 1>It has to have the right structure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right function in order for it to be</v>

1106
00:56:45.131 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 1>a chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that thing</v>

1107
00:56:47.441 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 1>which is an object is already only</v>
<v Speaker 1>existing in relationship to you in some</v>

1108
00:56:51.581 --> 00:56:52.414
<v Speaker 1>important sense.</v>

1109
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:53.860
<v Speaker 1>But I can also say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1110
00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the classroom partner?</v>

1111
00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Well that's part of Sid Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This chair is part of Sid Smith.</v>

1112
00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:03.790
<v Speaker 1>And what Sid Smith part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's part of the university.</v>

1113
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:05.920
<v Speaker 1>And what's the university part of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well God,</v>

1114
00:57:05.921 --> 00:57:08.290
<v Speaker 1>it's part of all sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we could say it's,</v>

1115
00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:11.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a piece of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a chunk of the province.</v>

1116
00:57:11.081 --> 00:57:15.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a bat of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's west nested inside a much</v>

1117
00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:19.060
<v Speaker 1>broader civilization than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of going up from the</v>

1118
00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:22.450
<v Speaker 1>chair and you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not read the chair.</v>

1119
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:23.501
<v Speaker 1>And I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1120
00:57:23.501 --> 00:57:27.820
<v Speaker 1>if that thing was floating at some point</v>
<v Speaker 1>halfway between the sun and Pluto,</v>

1121
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think considering it and a chair</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be reasonable,</v>

1122
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:32.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because well,</v>

1123
00:57:32.981 --> 00:57:34.420
<v Speaker 1>for obvious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1124
00:57:34.421 --> 00:57:37.900
<v Speaker 1>you can decontextualize something so</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely that it isn't what it is</v>

1125
00:57:37.901 --> 00:57:38.440
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1126
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1127
00:57:41.051 --> 00:57:42.910
<v Speaker 1>when you kind of do that to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say,</v>

1128
00:57:42.911 --> 00:57:43.721
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

1129
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Why is this important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to know in a million years?</v>

1130
00:57:46.091 --> 00:57:46.721
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

1131
00:57:46.721 --> 00:57:49.750
<v Speaker 1>you're decontextualized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a stupid trick.</v>

1132
00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:53.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like a party trick for intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid trick,</v>

1133
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:54.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because anybody can do it.</v>

1134
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And what does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you're looking at it from the</v>

1135
00:57:58.091 --> 00:57:59.890
<v Speaker 1>wrong perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>

1136
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like it's an ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1137
00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:05.650
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be able to think about in</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds if it was an ultimate</v>

1138
00:58:05.651 --> 00:58:07.090
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1139
00:58:07.091 --> 00:58:09.640
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you can do the same thing with</v>

1140
00:58:09.641 --> 00:58:12.610
<v Speaker 1>the chair that you did with yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you zoom into it.</v>

1141
00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1142
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.900
<v Speaker 1>it's made of parts obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the parts are made out of sub</v>

1143
00:58:16.901 --> 00:58:19.990
<v Speaker 1>parts and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way down to the subatomic level</v>

1144
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:22.150
<v Speaker 1>and the chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things at the same time.</v>

1145
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>

1146
00:58:25.541 --> 00:58:28.420
<v Speaker 1>well what do you encounter when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter the unknown?</v>

1147
00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:34.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you'll encounter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1148
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:38.770
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at this and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about this.</v>

1149
00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.580
<v Speaker 1>So weird idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1150
00:58:42.581 --> 00:58:44.230
<v Speaker 1>So you've got your little frame of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>

1151
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:46.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going from point a to point b and</v>

1152
00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 1>then when you're going from point a to</v>
<v Speaker 1>point b,</v>

1153
00:58:48.581 --> 00:58:51.310
<v Speaker 1>something that you didn't want to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1154
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.820
<v Speaker 1>And we already know that it can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little thing that happens and then you</v>

1155
00:58:54.821 --> 00:58:56.830
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haha it's funding or it can be like your</v>

1156
00:58:56.831 --> 00:58:59.500
<v Speaker 1>whole world falls apart and then it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

1157
00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:03.130
<v Speaker 1>But let's say it's something like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

1158
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:07.120
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that sort of a mid level</v>
<v Speaker 1>anomaly,</v>

1159
00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:08.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk in,</v>

1160
00:59:08.261 --> 00:59:11.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can handle it weirdly enough.</v>

1161
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that's because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>other places you can go where there are</v>

1162
00:59:15.581 --> 00:59:18.580
<v Speaker 1>potential futures lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like you're out of potential</v>

1163
00:59:18.581 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>futures just because you walk through</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1164
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:22.880
<v Speaker 1>So when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1165
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:25.080
<v Speaker 1>what's in that room is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's anomalous,</v>

1166
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.890
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unformed matter.</v>

1167
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone might say,</v>

1168
00:59:30.741 --> 00:59:33.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this interview matter to you?</v>

1169
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:37.280
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty weird question because</v>

1170
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:40.970
<v Speaker 1>things are made out of matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean when you say,</v>

1171
00:59:40.971 --> 00:59:43.130
<v Speaker 1>does this matter to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1172
00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:46.250
<v Speaker 1>partly what it means is that before</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter was our matter.</v>

1173
00:59:46.251 --> 00:59:49.760
<v Speaker 1>It was a matter that was more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated linguistically speaking.</v>

1174
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 1>So back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go back far enough,</v>

1175
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:56.900
<v Speaker 1>what people meant by matter wasn't this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1176
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:01.790
<v Speaker 1>it was more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's more like potential or</v>

1177
01:00:01.791 --> 01:00:04.490
<v Speaker 1>it's more like information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

1178
01:00:04.491 --> 01:00:07.250
<v Speaker 1>So you could certainly say that room was</v>
<v Speaker 1>chocked full of information.</v>

1179
01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's go with the information idea.</v>

1180
01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Just for the sake of argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already talked about it as potential.</v>

1181
01:00:13.701 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about it as information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of those work.</v>

1182
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>You walk in there and you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with people.</v>

1183
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you leave later and you know,</v>

1184
01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:22.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1185
01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>you tell your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

1186
01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:26.720
<v Speaker 1>well I went for this interview and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1187
01:00:26.721 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>how did it go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

1188
01:00:28.401 --> 01:00:32.360
<v Speaker 1>well I didn't go very well but I learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things cause you could say that.</v>

1189
01:00:32.361 --> 01:00:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well so I would say you went into that</v>

1190
01:00:35.091 --> 01:00:38.090
<v Speaker 1>room and you extracted some spirit out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the potential.</v>

1191
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Now that's exactly how piaget looked at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1192
01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:45.080
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I shouldn't say exactly because you</v>

1193
01:00:45.081 --> 01:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not exactly the way he</v>

1194
01:00:47.421 --> 01:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically what piaget proclaimed</v>

1195
01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>with children was that children have</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried a little routine and then</v>

1196
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:57.410
<v Speaker 1>something will happen that doesn't fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their little routine.</v>

1197
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.160
<v Speaker 1>And so they all investigate it using</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever tools they have at hand.</v>

1198
01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's trial and error and some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1199
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try out other tool like embodiments</v>

1200
01:01:06.921 --> 01:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>of their body that have worked in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

1201
01:01:09.411 --> 01:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I say a nine month old,</v>

1202
01:01:13.431 --> 01:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>we'll do crawling around on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it encounters something that's</v>

1203
01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>roughly mouth sized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll put it in her mouth.</v>

1204
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't know what it is,</v>

1205
01:01:22.551 --> 01:01:24.190
<v Speaker 1>but they don't kind of how to use their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouse.</v>

1206
01:01:24.191 --> 01:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>So they throw it in their mouth and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1207
01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Tom Hinten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1208
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>they get some sense of how it tastes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very important and what its</v>

1209
01:01:30.251 --> 01:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>shape is and all of that.</v>

1210
01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're very wired up in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth and so they can investigate like</v>

1211
01:01:34.401 --> 01:01:38.360
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what they encounter is a thing.</v>

1212
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>And then when they throw it in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>

1213
01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>they practice doing something with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1214
01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:46.550
<v Speaker 1>getting a shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now they know something about it.</v>

1215
01:01:46.551 --> 01:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>So that changes them from a spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1216
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.430
<v Speaker 1>a psychological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're slightly different than they</v>

1217
01:01:52.431 --> 01:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've incorporated some information</v>

1218
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>and they've also transformed the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a specific thing with specific</v>

1219
01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you might say is that out of</v>

1220
01:02:02.271 --> 01:02:06.770
<v Speaker 1>potential spirit and matter arise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very interesting way of</v>

1221
01:02:06.771 --> 01:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>looking about looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1222
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.720
<v Speaker 1>it fits well with the phenomenological</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers because they believe that</v>

1223
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>we encountered phenomenon and phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 1>where those phenomena were those things</v>

1224
01:02:21.421 --> 01:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>that sean forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's like a reversion to the</v>

1225
01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>idea of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you got to think about it this</v>

1226
01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>way too.</v>

1227
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you walk into a library,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1228
01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>what's in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1229
01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>it's inexhaustible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The library.</v>

1230
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come you just don't get exhausted?</v>

1231
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because you're not actually</v>

1232
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the whole library.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got this focal point like the</v>

1233
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>laser again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've made it into a focal point</v>

1234
01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>because you're inside that hierarchical</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

1235
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you say,</v>

1236
01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the library to get this book.</v>

1237
01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting this book to read this</v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter.</v>

1238
01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.000
<v Speaker 1>So chapter book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Library,</v>

1239
01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to become educated and get a job</v>

1240
01:03:04.441 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>so that I'll be a good citizen and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good person.</v>

1241
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you're doing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>library.</v>

1242
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.560
<v Speaker 1>You're just doing one little fragment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1243
01:03:10.561 --> 01:03:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And the more you have that whole model</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>

1244
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.100
<v Speaker 1>right all the way from good person right</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to why you were in the library,</v>

1245
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the more precise your aim is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you know what you're doing,</v>

1246
01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:24.660
<v Speaker 1>the less encumbered by doubt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty you are and the higher</v>

1247
01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:29.661
<v Speaker 1>probability you have of focusing on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>task and then writing the past that you</v>

1248
01:03:30.061 --> 01:03:33.630
<v Speaker 1>want to be into Ba and so well.</v>

1249
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:37.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's very useful to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>things this way and it's also very</v>

1250
01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:39.240
<v Speaker 1>interesting to note that that's how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

1251
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:43.050
<v Speaker 1>You actually act like the world has made</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way and it's even weirder because</v>

1252
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:46.860
<v Speaker 1>this is the case that I made for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were talking about the structure</v>

1253
01:03:46.861 --> 01:03:49.830
<v Speaker 1>of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually looks like this is how your</v>

1254
01:03:49.831 --> 01:03:53.760
<v Speaker 1>brain construes the world and because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have systems,</v>

1255
01:03:53.761 --> 01:03:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you've got the system that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you know what you're doing and</v>

1256
01:03:56.611 --> 01:03:59.250
<v Speaker 1>you've got the other system that works</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't know what you're doing.</v>

1257
01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:03.270
<v Speaker 1>And so basically the world is divided</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the dallas say into the</v>

1258
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:08.010
<v Speaker 1>orderly domain and the chaotic domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need to know how to operate in</v>

1259
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>both and you need to balance them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to transform one into the</v>

1260
01:04:12.061 --> 01:04:13.740
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically what you're doing</v>

1261
01:04:13.741 --> 01:04:15.270
<v Speaker 1>when you're interacting with reality.</v>

1262
01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I would,</v>

1263
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I will claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this will become more important as</v>

1264
01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:25.320
<v Speaker 1>the course progresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when you're doing something</v>

1265
01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing that property.</v>

1266
01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:33.650
<v Speaker 1>And the sense of meaning that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually an indication that your</v>

1267
01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiology is manifesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're in the right place at the</v>

1268
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>right time doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's real.</v>

1269
01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not only real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's the most real thing.</v>

1270
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.080
<v Speaker 1>It's where potential is transformed into</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and it's hard to get any more</v>

1271
01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.690
<v Speaker 1>real than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why I'm telling you</v>

1272
01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:56.730
<v Speaker 1>that these things aren't exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphors.</v>

1273
01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:00.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be represented by metaphor</v>

1274
01:05:00.481 --> 01:05:03.690
<v Speaker 1>in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality of this underlying them</v>

1275
01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:06.090
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a story.</v>

1276
01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Even though it is a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a story.</v>

1277
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:11.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a real representation of reality.</v>

1278
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:16.020
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I kind of outlined here</v>

1279
01:05:16.021 --> 01:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>is that when you hit an the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally it's sort of the anomaly is the</v>

1280
01:05:19.931 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>thing from which everything shines</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

1281
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's still really anomalous,</v>

1282
01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>what happens is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it manifests itself to you in sort of</v>

1283
01:05:28.421 --> 01:05:32.500
<v Speaker 1>like a burst of contradictory meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can be paralyzing.</v>

1284
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be really,</v>

1285
01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really excited and reading,</v>

1286
01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:36.281
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>

1287
01:05:36.281 --> 01:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might happen.</v>

1288
01:05:37.661 --> 01:05:40.180
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were going to a job interview and</v>

1289
01:05:40.181 --> 01:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>you actually wanted the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be even worse if you went to a</v>

1290
01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:49.141
<v Speaker 1>job interview and like 30% of you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job because you know that's the 30%</v>

1291
01:05:49.481 --> 01:05:52.900
<v Speaker 1>that wants to develop and now they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>30% would just soon fail so that you</v>

1292
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>crawl under your bed at home and stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>there with the dust bunnies til you're</v>

1293
01:05:56.111 --> 01:06:00.640
<v Speaker 1>40 and you know another 25% of you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful about the fact that you got to</v>

1294
01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:02.530
<v Speaker 1>have to go get a stupid job at all.</v>

1295
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.990
<v Speaker 1>And so then you go in there and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1296
01:06:04.991 --> 01:06:09.220
<v Speaker 1>really complicated because not only is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all that potential there,</v>

1297
01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:13.930
<v Speaker 1>but your fractured and those fractures</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the whole situation way more</v>

1298
01:06:13.931 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 1>complicated and unstable than it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise have to be.</v>

1299
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:20.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happens to people all the time,</v>

1300
01:06:20.321 --> 01:06:22.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people hedge their bets in job</v>

1301
01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:24.340
<v Speaker 1>interviews all the time cause they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1302
01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:25.870
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care.</v>

1303
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.561
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1304
01:06:26.561 --> 01:06:30.340
<v Speaker 1>you care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want to have a story to tell</v>

1305
01:06:30.341 --> 01:06:33.520
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you fail while and then if you have</v>

1306
01:06:33.521 --> 01:06:35.350
<v Speaker 1>that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then probably you're going to fail</v>

1307
01:06:35.351 --> 01:06:40.351
<v Speaker 1>because you don't get to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't go in there at 60% and hope to</v>

1308
01:06:40.391 --> 01:06:42.610
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go in there at 100% now</v>

1309
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:46.150
<v Speaker 1>that's cool too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what it implies is just what the</v>

1310
01:06:46.151 --> 01:06:51.151
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist have been telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>people for 60 years or 70 years,</v>

1311
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:52.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1312
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:55.570
<v Speaker 1>You have to voluntarily face the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're afraid of.</v>

1313
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little more complicated than that</v>

1314
01:06:57.551 --> 01:06:59.380
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you could just go play</v>
<v Speaker 1>in traffic,</v>

1315
01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:00.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

1316
01:07:00.911 --> 01:07:05.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not a call to stupid adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it does is assume that you've gone</v>

1317
01:07:05.441 --> 01:07:08.200
<v Speaker 1>a direction and that the direction is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>valid direction,</v>

1318
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:11.410
<v Speaker 1>and then that what happens is as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue that,</v>

1319
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.750
<v Speaker 1>obstacles emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous,</v>

1320
01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:18.700
<v Speaker 1>threatening obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you either confront them or you</v>

1321
01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.640
<v Speaker 1>abandon the whole project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while generally speaking,</v>

1322
01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:25.990
<v Speaker 1>if you chop them into little pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can confront them and digest</v>

1323
01:07:25.991 --> 01:07:28.570
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get stronger because you're</v>

1324
01:07:28.571 --> 01:07:30.670
<v Speaker 1>doing all this digesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're eating,</v>

1325
01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:36.090
<v Speaker 1>you're eating the monster of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a classic metaphor for,</v>

1326
01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:40.000
<v Speaker 1>for developing wisdom to ingest piaget</v>
<v Speaker 1>than uses that,</v>

1327
01:07:40.001 --> 01:07:40.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assimilate.</v>

1328
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:45.370
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same idea as ingesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of what you're eating is</v>

1329
01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:46.900
<v Speaker 1>information instead of matter.</v>

1330
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1331
01:07:48.461 --> 01:07:52.930
<v Speaker 1>and the information restructures you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you more informed and that puts</v>

1332
01:07:52.931 --> 01:07:55.240
<v Speaker 1>you more information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1333
01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:56.841
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1334
01:07:56.841 --> 01:08:00.670
<v Speaker 1>you encounter the anomaly and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>burst of contradictory potential.</v>

1335
01:08:00.671 --> 01:08:02.590
<v Speaker 1>And so that's exactly how you respond to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1336
01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Your body's going everywhere at once</v>
<v Speaker 1>because God only knows what's going to</v>

1337
01:08:06.341 --> 01:08:08.580
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as you interact with it,</v>

1338
01:08:08.581 --> 01:08:10.630
<v Speaker 1>it collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're collapsing it.</v>

1339
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:14.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the situation and then you</v>

1340
01:08:14.051 --> 01:08:18.710
<v Speaker 1>reduce it to a single path where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's going properly.</v>

1341
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1342
01:08:20.121 --> 01:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>you're bending it to your own selfish</v>
<v Speaker 1>wills,</v>

1343
01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.580
<v Speaker 1>but that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're in,</v>

1344
01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.430
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're in an interview and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's five or six people in there,</v>

1345
01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:32.660
<v Speaker 1>you can't just bend the damn thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your will because you have to interact</v>

1346
01:08:32.661 --> 01:08:35.570
<v Speaker 1>with those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you don't do that with,</v>

1347
01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be a psychopath and manipulate,</v>

1348
01:08:38.001 --> 01:08:39.920
<v Speaker 1>but that will only work for a short</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>

1349
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>You'll get caught and then you'll have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move because that's what psychopaths</v>

1350
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're,</v>

1351
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>that's how they keep being psychopaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1352
01:08:46.341 --> 01:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>they exhaust everyone's trust and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to move and then they go find</v>

1353
01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>some other people who are trustworthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they built up trust capital with</v>

1354
01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:57.230
<v Speaker 1>other people and then they betrayed</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1355
01:08:57.231 --> 01:08:59.750
<v Speaker 1>but they have to keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an unstable solution.</v>

1356
01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.110
<v Speaker 1>So you go in there and you do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

1357
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing exactly?</v>

1358
01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:08.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that if you're really,</v>

1359
01:09:08.751 --> 01:09:11.510
<v Speaker 1>really nailing that interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>

1360
01:09:11.511 --> 01:09:12.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

1361
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:16.160
<v Speaker 1>here's a future that we could all march</v>
<v Speaker 1>together into consonantly and happily</v>

1362
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:20.000
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm the person to do that.</v>

1363
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be saying that on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively low scale,</v>

1364
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:26.510
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm your assistant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to have to worry</v>

1365
01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:28.880
<v Speaker 1>about me because I'm always going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1366
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:29.660
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1367
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.420
<v Speaker 1>And then if maybe you're the CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to say,</v>

1368
01:09:32.421 --> 01:09:33.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1369
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:36.590
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the way that all of us are going</v>

1370
01:09:36.591 --> 01:09:38.210
<v Speaker 1>and here's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what it's going to look</v>

1371
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:40.190
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the better you are at that,</v>

1372
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:46.910
<v Speaker 1>the more that potential will turn into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it multiplies.</v>

1373
01:09:46.911 --> 01:09:48.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens if you're good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with it,</v>

1374
01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.710
<v Speaker 1>the potential that's accessible to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiply.</v>

1375
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:55.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really cool.</v>

1376
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.850
<v Speaker 1>And also how you'd hope it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you don't,</v>

1377
01:09:58.851 --> 01:10:01.790
<v Speaker 1>you hope that more potential would</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself to people who are more</v>

1378
01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:04.400
<v Speaker 1>competent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things worked well.</v>

1379
01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:07.610
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1380
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:13.630
<v Speaker 1>so that's the spirit matter idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's represented in that</v>

1381
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.930
<v Speaker 1>drag it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go back to him.</v>

1382
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:33.880
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1383
01:10:33.881 --> 01:10:37.420
<v Speaker 1>So are you remember this character here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what to do about that?</v>

1384
01:10:37.421 --> 01:10:41.140
<v Speaker 1>What to do about chaos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1385
01:10:41.141 --> 01:10:44.920
<v Speaker 1>one thing you might want to start by</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is admitting that it exists.</v>

1386
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:49.040
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that you're,</v>

1387
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:52.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not a terror management advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're an advocate of positive</v>

1388
01:10:52.901 --> 01:10:55.870
<v Speaker 1>illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does everybody know what those are?</v>

1389
01:10:56.770 --> 01:10:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Just do you or are you still taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>about those in social psychology?</v>

1390
01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Positive illusions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1391
01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:04.330
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people know about them?</v>

1392
01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did you learn about them?</v>

1393
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Your class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1394
01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Sexy 30 in two 30 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one else has taught you about this.</v>

1395
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else learned it to anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>

1396
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:19.740
<v Speaker 1>You learned it online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1397
01:11:19.741 --> 01:11:21.960
<v Speaker 1>well thank God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1398
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.650
<v Speaker 1>what happened was the paper where</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive illusions were first pouted and</v>

1399
01:11:25.651 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 1>that was in social psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was in the Journal of Personality</v>

1400
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:29.280
<v Speaker 1>and social psychology.</v>

1401
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.240
<v Speaker 1>That was the most cited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most cited paper ever in social</v>

1402
01:11:33.241 --> 01:11:35.250
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up there.</v>

1403
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:36.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1404
01:11:36.121 --> 01:11:39.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's an appalling paper because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically says,</v>

1405
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:42.240
<v Speaker 1>it says something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you scrape away all the nonsense,</v>

1406
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>things are so horrible that if you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at them,</v>

1407
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:48.780
<v Speaker 1>you'll be so depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to die so you better not you</v>

1408
01:11:48.781 --> 01:11:51.810
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've around yourself an illusion that</v>

1409
01:11:51.811 --> 01:11:55.190
<v Speaker 1>things are better than they are and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more powerful and wonderful venue</v>

1410
01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.010
<v Speaker 1>actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that but not too much,</v>

1411
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.950
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1412
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the error is in that are just manifolds</v>

1413
01:12:04.681 --> 01:12:05.370
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1414
01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:07.800
<v Speaker 1>well who cares if you're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell does that have to do with</v>

1415
01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:08.634
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1416
01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.770
<v Speaker 1>it could be happy stepping on ats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1417
01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:15.090
<v Speaker 1>so well really it's like what the hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid ideas that you've got.</v>

1418
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caucasian cocaine will do that.</v>

1419
01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullies are pretty happy when they're</v>

1420
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:22.470
<v Speaker 1>pounding out someone like mill house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1421
01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:25.170
<v Speaker 1>so happiness is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that?</v>

1422
01:12:25.171 --> 01:12:27.120
<v Speaker 1>It's shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dopey idea.</v>

1423
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

1424
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:30.540
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1425
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:33.720
<v Speaker 1>how big should these lies that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling yourself be?</v>

1426
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.750
<v Speaker 1>And answer that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just exactly the size that will make you</v>

1427
01:12:36.751 --> 01:12:38.940
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not helpful because if</v>

1428
01:12:38.941 --> 01:12:41.850
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's hear about exactly how big they</v>

1429
01:12:41.851 --> 01:12:42.690
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1430
01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.810
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they should be this big and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then other times they shouldn't be this</v>

1431
01:12:45.811 --> 01:12:47.880
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no real way of telling a</v>

1432
01:12:47.881 --> 01:12:50.670
<v Speaker 1>priority while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not really very helpful</v>

1433
01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:52.080
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1434
01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:55.800
<v Speaker 1>and then there's another id underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's even worse,</v>

1435
01:12:55.801 --> 01:12:59.060
<v Speaker 1>which is reality is so awful that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't look at it.</v>

1436
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nasty man.</v>

1437
01:13:02.491 --> 01:13:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Because that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

1438
01:13:03.651 --> 01:13:05.220
<v Speaker 1>and that is what the pause to pollution</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1439
01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:07.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like the terror management</v>

1440
01:13:07.081 --> 01:13:10.170
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you got an unvarnished look at</v>

1441
01:13:10.171 --> 01:13:13.920
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just destroy it because you're,</v>

1442
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:17.880
<v Speaker 1>you're not strong enough to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality in an unvarnished manner.</v>

1443
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:20.383
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1444
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.370
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine why people would believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1445
01:13:24.371 --> 01:13:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

1446
01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:26.560
<v Speaker 1>you could thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1447
01:13:26.561 --> 01:13:27.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1448
01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.850
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty damn awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you think,</v>

1449
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1450
01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:39.740
<v Speaker 1>is it read the case that everyone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there coping with the world is like</v>

1451
01:13:39.741 --> 01:13:43.430
<v Speaker 1>blind and diluted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe is it that the people who are</v>

1452
01:13:43.431 --> 01:13:45.980
<v Speaker 1>not coping with the world very well or</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind and diluted,</v>

1453
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself that you see people in your</v>

1454
01:13:48.831 --> 01:13:50.600
<v Speaker 1>life that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you admire.</v>

1455
01:13:50.601 --> 01:13:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I presume as certainly you've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you don't admire.</v>

1456
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Well also like let's take the ones you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't admire.</v>

1457
01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bout blind in diluted?</v>

1458
01:14:00.081 --> 01:14:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Does that partially described them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be blind,</v>

1459
01:14:03.441 --> 01:14:04.310
<v Speaker 1>diluted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter,</v>

1460
01:14:04.311 --> 01:14:07.400
<v Speaker 1>resentful at mean that sort of covers</v>
<v Speaker 1>the territory.</v>

1461
01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:09.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the people you admire?</v>

1462
01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're strong people.</v>

1463
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Generally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can do things that are really</v>

1464
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.550
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have a baby and raise it without</v>

1465
01:14:18.551 --> 01:14:19.570
<v Speaker 1>destroying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1466
01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:24.130
<v Speaker 1>or work in a palliative care board or be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nurse in a cancer ward for children or</v>

1467
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1468
01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:27.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of awful things.</v>

1469
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I talked to this guy the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just met him sort of randomly and he</v>

1470
01:14:31.421 --> 01:14:34.090
<v Speaker 1>had had a motorcycle accident that was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad one.</v>

1471
01:14:34.091 --> 01:14:37.800
<v Speaker 1>He rolled like 200 feet at 60 miles an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour when he broke seven ribs and you</v>

1472
01:14:37.801 --> 01:14:40.360
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a brain hemorrhage and like it</v>

1473
01:14:40.361 --> 01:14:42.880
<v Speaker 1>really took it out to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was a good athlete before that.</v>

1474
01:14:42.881 --> 01:14:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And so it probably aged him 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1475
01:14:45.011 --> 01:14:49.570
<v Speaker 1>and he's still recovering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was telling me he works for a</v>

1476
01:14:49.571 --> 01:14:52.060
<v Speaker 1>power company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's climbing up these power poles,</v>

1477
01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:53.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's part of his job.</v>

1478
01:14:53.501 --> 01:14:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Well now he's pretty screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in his mid fifties he's still</v>

1479
01:14:57.011 --> 01:15:00.520
<v Speaker 1>climbing up power poles and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with a guy who had Parkinson's</v>

1480
01:15:00.521 --> 01:15:03.190
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the guy with the Parkinson's</v>

1481
01:15:03.191 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 1>disease is at the top of the power pole</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing his job,</v>

1482
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:06.940
<v Speaker 1>but he's getting shaky.</v>

1483
01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:08.860
<v Speaker 1>So they're afraid things are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>

1484
01:15:08.861 --> 01:15:10.630
<v Speaker 1>And then this guy comes up behind him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help him.</v>

1485
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:14.470
<v Speaker 1>He's only really got one arm that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jesus,</v>

1486
01:15:14.471 --> 01:15:16.810
<v Speaker 1>that's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people are tough,</v>

1487
01:15:16.811 --> 01:15:18.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1488
01:15:18.011 --> 01:15:21.520
<v Speaker 1>because Parkinson's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sucks and well,</v>

1489
01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:25.220
<v Speaker 1>so just having half your arm more or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less destroyed by a motorcycle acts and</v>

1490
01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:27.460
<v Speaker 1>not staying at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding under the bed,</v>

1491
01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:30.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out there still making sure the</v>

1492
01:15:30.371 --> 01:15:34.030
<v Speaker 1>lights are on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a pretty ardent unvarnished</v>

1493
01:15:34.031 --> 01:15:36.370
<v Speaker 1>confrontation with reality as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

1494
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:38.560
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I couldn't say.</v>

1495
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:41.020
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's another story.</v>

1496
01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:46.410
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably told you a little bit about</v>

1497
01:15:46.811 --> 01:15:51.811
<v Speaker 1>this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the behaviorist first proposed that</v>

1498
01:15:52.501 --> 01:15:57.501
<v Speaker 1>you could use exposure to treat anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The psychoanalysts were all skeptical</v>

1499
01:15:58.141 --> 01:16:01.080
<v Speaker 1>about that because they thought while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just treating the symptom,</v>

1500
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:04.860
<v Speaker 1>they usually thought of a full bi as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation,</v>

1501
01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:08.970
<v Speaker 1>the visible manifestation of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was more that learn more deeply</v>

1502
01:16:08.971 --> 01:16:12.530
<v Speaker 1>underground and there's real truth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like,</v>

1503
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:14.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1504
01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:18.220
<v Speaker 1>whatever a mouse is to someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouse phobic isn't what MLC is.</v>

1505
01:16:18.221 --> 01:16:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Cue the mouse is a bunch of other things</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise they wouldn't be</v>

1506
01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:23.680
<v Speaker 1>afraid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all those,</v>

1507
01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:27.310
<v Speaker 1>you could say the mouse is an exemplar</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the category of all things that</v>

1508
01:16:27.311 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good way of thinking what</v>

1509
01:16:30.131 --> 01:16:33.910
<v Speaker 1>it might mean symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I had one client who was afraid</v>

1510
01:16:33.911 --> 01:16:37.450
<v Speaker 1>of mice and she thought one would run up</v>
<v Speaker 1>her leg and she was also afraid of being</v>

1511
01:16:37.451 --> 01:16:38.980
<v Speaker 1>raped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those two things were,</v>

1512
01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:43.150
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a metaphorical union between them,</v>

1513
01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:44.830
<v Speaker 1>even though they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1514
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:48.010
<v Speaker 1>are obviously not exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the psychoanalysts,</v>

1515
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.450
<v Speaker 1>they're making their point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1516
01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:53.770
<v Speaker 1>but it turned out that it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the original behavior theory was you</v>

1517
01:16:53.771 --> 01:16:55.870
<v Speaker 1>can't be anxious and calm at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1518
01:16:56.890 --> 01:16:59.230
<v Speaker 1>So what you do first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to teach someone not to</v>

1519
01:16:59.231 --> 01:17:01.690
<v Speaker 1>be afraid of a mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is teach them how not to be afraid.</v>

1520
01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:05.890
<v Speaker 1>So you put them in the chair and you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relaxation exercise with them and then</v>

1521
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.560
<v Speaker 1>you show them a picture of a mouse and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

1522
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:09.680
<v Speaker 1>just breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1523
01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 1>calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they all,</v>

1524
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.540
<v Speaker 1>they calm down and then sooner or later</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can look at the pictures of mice by</v>

1525
01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:17.090
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you could throw a like</v>

1526
01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.370
<v Speaker 1>stuffed mouse them and then maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1527
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.520
<v Speaker 1>they could walk by a pet store and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at her house and so on and so forth</v>

1528
01:17:22.521 --> 01:17:25.670
<v Speaker 1>until you get them like holding rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1529
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works works,</v>

1530
01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but it works even if you don't relax</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1531
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works just as well.</v>

1532
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:36.950
<v Speaker 1>So the oil behavioral idea that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>countered conditioning was wrong.</v>

1533
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Just like the idea that the reason you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were afraid of a rat was because of</v>

1534
01:17:40.341 --> 01:17:41.300
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1535
01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:42.650
<v Speaker 1>of course you're afraid of a rat.</v>

1536
01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1537
01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:47.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just like you're afraid of snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1538
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:52.460
<v Speaker 1>to a lesser or greater degree in people</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually become more afraid of stakes as</v>

1539
01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:54.020
<v Speaker 1>they get older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough,</v>

1540
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:56.000
<v Speaker 1>which is not what you really expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1541
01:17:56.001 --> 01:18:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Unless it was a biological function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1542
01:18:00.111 --> 01:18:04.220
<v Speaker 1>all you have to show people the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of and what did they</v>

1543
01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:06.950
<v Speaker 1>learn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't learn that the thing isn't</v>

1544
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:09.410
<v Speaker 1>frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They learn that they're tough.</v>

1545
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:13.100
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why generalize it.</v>

1546
01:18:13.101 --> 01:18:16.820
<v Speaker 1>So which is the behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See No psychoanalysts predicted what</v>

1547
01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:18.020
<v Speaker 1>would happen is as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1548
01:18:18.021 --> 01:18:18.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1549
01:18:18.471 --> 01:18:20.540
<v Speaker 1>You're not afraid of a mouse anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you're,</v>

1550
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you're twice as afraid of being raped in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cabin when you're up there alone.</v>

1551
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:25.543
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1552
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:28.160
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not afraid of the mouse anymore</v>

1553
01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:31.040
<v Speaker 1>and your half is afraid of being alone</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in your cabinet.</v>

1554
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:34.400
<v Speaker 1>It generalizes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take someone who's</v>

1555
01:18:34.401 --> 01:18:37.280
<v Speaker 1>agoraphobic and in their mid forties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat dependent,</v>

1556
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:39.050
<v Speaker 1>and you treat them for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>agoraphobic,</v>

1557
01:18:39.051 --> 01:18:40.910
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll go home and give their</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband tail,</v>

1558
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:43.730
<v Speaker 1>cause they're usually women and tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>them all the things that they'd been</v>

1559
01:18:43.731 --> 01:18:46.310
<v Speaker 1>wanting to tell him for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it'd be too afraid to because they</v>

1560
01:18:46.311 --> 01:18:48.500
<v Speaker 1>thought he might leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they were afraid that,</v>

1561
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd leave and they fall apart and all</v>

1562
01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:53.660
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they get you teach them that they</v>

1563
01:18:53.661 --> 01:18:56.150
<v Speaker 1>don't have to run out of the subway and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden they get more</v>

1564
01:18:56.151 --> 01:18:58.400
<v Speaker 1>confrontation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because they</v>

1565
01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:02.390
<v Speaker 1>get more courageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is they go do</v>

1566
01:19:02.391 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 1>something difficult and they watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and hey,</v>

1567
01:19:05.061 --> 01:19:07.640
<v Speaker 1>they could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you might ask</v>

1568
01:19:07.641 --> 01:19:12.380
<v Speaker 1>about yourself is how do you know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to run away from?</v>

1569
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:14.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be so damn tough,</v>

1570
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:16.850
<v Speaker 1>you just can't bloody well imagine it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're just,</v>

1571
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:19.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just sort of a sheltered,</v>

1572
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:21.980
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now look,</v>

1573
01:19:21.981 --> 01:19:24.350
<v Speaker 1>you're a lot less sheltered than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were when you were three,</v>

1574
01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I presume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you live on your own?</v>

1575
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that was a transition,</v>

1576
01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I presume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you were depressed and</v>

1577
01:19:32.541 --> 01:19:34.160
<v Speaker 1>anxious their first year of university?</v>

1578
01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you work?</v>

1579
01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1580
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's about 50% well,</v>

1581
01:19:40.851 --> 01:19:43.580
<v Speaker 1>that's about right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both the third of first year u of t</v>

1582
01:19:43.581 --> 01:19:46.490
<v Speaker 1>students meet clinical criteria for</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression according to the Beck</v>

1583
01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:47.900
<v Speaker 1>depression inventory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1584
01:19:47.901 --> 01:19:48.740
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1585
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.450
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1586
01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:52.880
<v Speaker 1>you leave your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of protected there.</v>

1587
01:19:52.881 --> 01:19:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out all the things</v>

1588
01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:57.710
<v Speaker 1>you have to do to keep yourself alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to go to university</v>

1589
01:19:57.711 --> 01:19:59.930
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to give you an</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible amount of work that no one</v>

1590
01:19:59.931 --> 01:20:03.320
<v Speaker 1>could ever possibly master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's daunting.</v>

1591
01:20:03.321 --> 01:20:06.380
<v Speaker 1>And then you're surrounded by people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are smarter than the people you're used</v>

1592
01:20:06.381 --> 01:20:08.550
<v Speaker 1>to being surrounded by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means you're not as smart as you</v>

1593
01:20:08.551 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 1>thought you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you meet people now,</v>

1594
01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:13.680
<v Speaker 1>men who are way smarter than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and way harder working and way better</v>

1595
01:20:13.681 --> 01:20:14.860
<v Speaker 1>looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of those phases.</v>

1596
01:20:14.861 --> 01:20:15.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1597
01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:16.501
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1598
01:20:16.501 --> 01:20:19.590
<v Speaker 1>it's depressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>

1599
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.690
<v Speaker 1>how many of you feel less armed to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the world then you get five years</v>

1600
01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:25.524
<v Speaker 1>ago?</v>

1601
01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:28.830
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna admit it probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I presume that that's a very small</v>

1602
01:20:28.831 --> 01:20:30.870
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you feel more prepared?</v>

1603
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:33.151
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1604
01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:35.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that you went out</v>

1605
01:20:35.671 --> 01:20:39.780
<v Speaker 1>there and get a whole bunch of difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and some of those things you've</v>

1606
01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:41.270
<v Speaker 1>been reading each other's</v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiographies,</v>

1607
01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:45.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that going to be an interesting,</v>

1608
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:47.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it worthwhile?</v>

1609
01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Anybody think it isn't worthwhile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really want to know,</v>

1610
01:20:50.641 --> 01:20:52.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know what's,</v>

1611
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:55.020
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of an experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense to see how this was working,</v>

1612
01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.190
<v Speaker 1>what's good about it</v>

1613
01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:00.750
<v Speaker 4>so you can get to know.</v>

1614
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:04.370
<v Speaker 1>So why do you like that?</v>

1615
01:21:05.410 --> 01:21:07.220
<v Speaker 4>Cause it makes the class feel more like,</v>

1616
01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:10.611
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1617
01:21:10.611 --> 01:21:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about working with the</v>

1618
01:21:12.261 --> 01:21:15.160
<v Speaker 1>company and the Edmonton is setting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>up as a,</v>

1619
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:19.730
<v Speaker 1>we increase increasing trust among</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who work together with the same</v>

1620
01:21:19.731 --> 01:21:21.380
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be sharing your</v>

1621
01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:24.350
<v Speaker 1>deepest secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what they will be doing is having</v>

1622
01:21:24.351 --> 01:21:27.560
<v Speaker 1>structured conversations where they find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a little bit about each other.</v>

1623
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:29.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it sort of,</v>

1624
01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:32.060
<v Speaker 1>it seems like have a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

1625
01:21:32.061 --> 01:21:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you'd kind of have to get to know their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical structure.</v>

1626
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's just the,</v>

1627
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:39.620
<v Speaker 1>like the sh the tiniest things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that person sits at the desk and</v>

1628
01:21:39.621 --> 01:21:42.530
<v Speaker 1>types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's a shallow relationship.</v>

1629
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:45.740
<v Speaker 1>If it's a deep relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know much more about the whole</v>

1630
01:21:45.741 --> 01:21:46.550
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1631
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is why the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the metaphor of depth works so well,</v>

1632
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:51.381
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1633
01:21:51.381 --> 01:21:54.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you found that it like catalyze the</v>

1634
01:21:54.051 --> 01:21:55.250
<v Speaker 1>classroom a little bit more,</v>

1635
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:56.760
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1636
01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:59.480
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it like you fall in love with them</v>

1637
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.370
<v Speaker 4>when they're applying for,</v>

1638
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:09.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting thing to a</v>

1639
01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:11.090
<v Speaker 1>about the whole vulnerability issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1640
01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1641
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:16.330
<v Speaker 1>if you're forming a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

1642
01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:20.660
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you basically mutually</v>
<v Speaker 1>open up your shells and you know what's,</v>

1643
01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:24.680
<v Speaker 1>or you kind of go like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1644
01:22:24.681 --> 01:22:26.380
<v Speaker 1>And if you could ask to close</v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently,</v>

1645
01:22:26.381 --> 01:22:28.060
<v Speaker 1>well then you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

1646
01:22:28.061 --> 01:22:29.830
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting too,</v>

1647
01:22:29.831 --> 01:22:32.050
<v Speaker 1>because one of the prizes that unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1648
01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily expose your vulnerabilities,</v>

1649
01:22:35.261 --> 01:22:39.040
<v Speaker 1>you'll never find partner or they won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a real partner cause they don't know</v>

1650
01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:42.250
<v Speaker 1>who the hell you are and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>weak because there's only one of you,</v>

1651
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:43.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1652
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1653
01:22:48.170 --> 01:22:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why'd you like that?</v>

1654
01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Because I can share it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like making decisions but not feel like</v>

1655
01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:55.403
<v Speaker 4>anyone really,</v>

1656
01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some evidence that people like</v>

1657
01:22:59.851 --> 01:23:03.540
<v Speaker 1>computer guided psychotherapy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly that reason.</v>

1658
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can be completely honest</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the computer cause like it doesn't</v>

1659
01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:07.720
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

1660
01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>It's will soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1661
01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:13.060
<v Speaker 1>but you probably won't judge you any</v>
<v Speaker 1>more harshly than you said it too.</v>

1662
01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:18.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like love and affection today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that won't be very far away.</v>

1663
01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are other people have to say</v>

1664
01:23:22.121 --> 01:23:23.590
<v Speaker 1>about the autobiography?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1665
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:28.870
<v Speaker 3>I find really interesting because like I</v>
<v Speaker 3>never sold dp on that person as be</v>

1666
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:33.830
<v Speaker 3>stokes share.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then as we get has to be taught what</v>

1667
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.920
<v Speaker 3>weight thinking beginning of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>childhood up to this point.</v>

1668
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:38.990
<v Speaker 3>You never really had that conversation.</v>

1669
01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1670
01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1671
01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.100
<v Speaker 1>So you liked that too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:23:44.101 --> 01:23:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

1673
01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:48.300
<v Speaker 1>what was good about it for you?</v>

1674
01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:49.410
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1675
01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.760
<v Speaker 3>you get to see usually as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're like say just like you</v>

1676
01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:56.000
<v Speaker 3>want to reach out to your agent and</v>
<v Speaker 3>every student like holistically,</v>

1677
01:23:56.690 --> 01:23:59.070
<v Speaker 3>but watching them grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda like,</v>

1678
01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:03.880
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda very strange because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about people in that.</v>

1679
01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you're seeing more of this say.</v>

1680
01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1681
01:24:06.961 --> 01:24:11.040
<v Speaker 1>because the person actually extends</v>
<v Speaker 1>across time and you're right.</v>

1682
01:24:11.041 --> 01:24:14.190
<v Speaker 1>All you see as a slice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're not a slice at the whole</v>

1683
01:24:14.191 --> 01:24:16.560
<v Speaker 1>damn thing and this thing that grows</v>
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>

1684
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1685
01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:18.594
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

1686
01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:20.490
<v Speaker 1>who else has something to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1687
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the people don't want to talk now.</v>

1688
01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:27.540
<v Speaker 1>So anybody else?</v>

1689
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:29.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1690
01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.860
<v Speaker 3>After doing that and writing so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>things about myself,</v>

1691
01:24:31.861 --> 01:24:33.900
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about the assignment to a</v>

1692
01:24:33.901 --> 01:24:38.670
<v Speaker 3>couple of friends and it really thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd actually be okay if the people who</v>

1693
01:24:38.671 --> 01:24:42.580
<v Speaker 3>read my assignment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like identified who I was and like even</v>

1694
01:24:42.581 --> 01:24:47.581
<v Speaker 3>like engage in conversation with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it really kind of inspired me to be</v>

1695
01:24:48.751 --> 01:24:52.380
<v Speaker 3>more honest about sharing myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do my existing relationships.</v>

1696
01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why did you conclude that it would be</v>

1697
01:24:55.921 --> 01:24:57.490
<v Speaker 1>okay if someone identified you?</v>

1698
01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Because I felt a desire to be seen more</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was kind of,</v>

1699
01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I felt more with myself when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>disclosing more information about</v>

1700
01:25:09.351 --> 01:25:12.650
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it made me want to be more with</v>

1701
01:25:12.651 --> 01:25:15.370
<v Speaker 3>myself in my existing kitchen shit.</v>

1702
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to what is a very good observation.</v>

1703
01:25:17.361 --> 01:25:20.390
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to say a couple of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that and you tell me if you think</v>

1704
01:25:20.391 --> 01:25:22.010
<v Speaker 1>they're accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1705
01:25:22.011 --> 01:25:23.210
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is,</v>

1706
01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:24.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1707
01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.110
<v Speaker 1>it's an act of courage to expose</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to someone.</v>

1708
01:25:28.111 --> 01:25:29.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to say that precisely.</v>

1709
01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:34.000
<v Speaker 1>It's an active car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an act of courage too,</v>

1710
01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.850
<v Speaker 1>to be truthful with someone because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually interacting with the</v>

1711
01:25:38.851 --> 01:25:42.480
<v Speaker 1>actual you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no facade.</v>

1712
01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing.</v>

1713
01:25:44.071 --> 01:25:46.620
<v Speaker 1>So you get more courageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the next thing might be,</v>

1714
01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I would say that you have a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic relationship with yourself.</v>

1715
01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:54.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1716
01:25:54.951 --> 01:25:58.010
<v Speaker 1>because let's say you have this stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory about some dumb you did when you</v>

1717
01:25:58.011 --> 01:26:00.380
<v Speaker 1>were 13 and you're still carrying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

1718
01:26:00.381 --> 01:26:01.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1719
01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:02.960
<v Speaker 1>you were 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

1720
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:05.540
<v Speaker 1>You expect 15 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just dumb as sticks.</v>

1721
01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:07.340
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do all sorts of stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1722
01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:11.030
<v Speaker 1>They're brains are all addled from</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones and they're trapped in those</v>

1723
01:26:11.031 --> 01:26:15.530
<v Speaker 1>little educational prisons and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to do stupid things.</v>

1724
01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 1>But if you're carrying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's you that did that.</v>

1725
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:21.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not some stupid 13 year old that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you once word.</v>

1726
01:26:21.991 --> 01:26:26.000
<v Speaker 1>So then you can start to see yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

1727
01:26:26.001 --> 01:26:28.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a 13 year old like other 13 year</v>

1728
01:26:28.761 --> 01:26:29.594
<v Speaker 1>olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1729
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:33.270
<v Speaker 1>no better but perhaps no worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can get on your,</v>

1730
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:37.880
<v Speaker 1>you can get on your side in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>by walking through your story and seeing</v>

1731
01:26:37.881 --> 01:26:40.520
<v Speaker 1>what the causal elements are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that seem reasonable?</v>

1732
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1733
01:26:42.051 --> 01:26:42.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1734
01:26:42.441 --> 01:26:44.640
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>

1735
01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1736
01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really liked it again,</v>

1737
01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 4>because you really get to know other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and that's,</v>

1738
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:50.803
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1739
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:54.530
<v Speaker 4>I really liked that aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was also interesting that I</v>

1740
01:26:54.531 --> 01:26:59.531
<v Speaker 4>think other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>not necessarily knew more about you than</v>

1741
01:27:00.861 --> 01:27:02.620
<v Speaker 4>you did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can talk a little bit</v>

1742
01:27:02.650 --> 01:27:04.930
<v Speaker 4>information that you gave them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1743
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:06.200
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1744
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.460
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone looked at something that I'd</v>

1745
01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.070
<v Speaker 4>written a completely different light</v>
<v Speaker 4>than I did.</v>

1746
01:27:10.071 --> 01:27:13.400
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just like the idea of looking at it,</v>

1747
01:27:13.401 --> 01:27:16.790
<v Speaker 4>I guess a little bit more from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside and getting a different</v>

1748
01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:17.350
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

1749
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what's the famous poem about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best gift we could possibly be given</v>

1750
01:27:23.581 --> 01:27:27.280
<v Speaker 1>us to see ourselves as others see us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Robbie Burns and I just</v>

1751
01:27:27.281 --> 01:27:30.090
<v Speaker 1>mangled the hell out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's basically what it meant.</v>

1752
01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:32.060
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do get that opportunity and,</v>

1753
01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:34.600
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird and this is something the</v>

1754
01:27:34.601 --> 01:27:36.580
<v Speaker 1>positive illusion people never think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about either,</v>

1755
01:27:36.581 --> 01:27:40.240
<v Speaker 1>is that sometimes people think they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than they are,</v>

1756
01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:44.170
<v Speaker 1>like objectively whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But lots of times the opposite is true</v>

1757
01:27:44.171 --> 01:27:46.570
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think often it's true even more</v>

1758
01:27:46.571 --> 01:27:49.050
<v Speaker 1>often it's like people think they're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot worse than they are.</v>

1759
01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.390
<v Speaker 1>No one's as anxious as me or as</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about acts or,</v>

1760
01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:54.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was confused about this,</v>

1761
01:27:54.041 --> 01:27:54.791
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1762
01:27:54.791 --> 01:27:57.270
<v Speaker 1>as socially awkward or is not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1763
01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:59.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got their paranoia about</v>

1764
01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.190
<v Speaker 1>this part of the niche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst that anyone could possibly be</v>

1765
01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.620
<v Speaker 1>in the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost never,</v>

1766
01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.550
<v Speaker 1>almost never true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1767
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:11.200
<v Speaker 1>other people are a lot more like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

1768
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:14.260
<v Speaker 1>and they're running around trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hide it madly as well,</v>

1769
01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.690
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good thing.</v>

1770
01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:17.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1771
01:28:17.471 --> 01:28:19.210
<v Speaker 1>you also allow your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

1772
01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:20.980
<v Speaker 1>you're allowing yourself out into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

1773
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.360
<v Speaker 1>You go through your life and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1774
01:28:22.361 --> 01:28:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I can allow other people.</v>
