1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 2>that's a hell of a welcome for someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to talk about the Bible.</v>

3
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.550
<v Speaker 2>So I thought I would get farther than </v>
<v Speaker 2>through genesis by the,</v>

4
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 2>by this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

5
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not unhappy about the pace either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a tremendous amount and so </v>

6
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.280
<v Speaker 2>hopefully what we'll do today is finish </v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis completely.</v>

7
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.220
<v Speaker 2>And then I think I'll try to start up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with exodus in me depending on what </v>

8
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 2>happens next year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a busy travel schedule,</v>

9
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 2>but I would really like to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the exodus story and I </v>

10
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>understand it very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the stories in genesis,</v>

11
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 2>especially after the first few stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>say up to the Tower of Babel,</v>

12
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.130
<v Speaker 2>I had to do a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning about,</v>

13
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 2>which is really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do know the exodus story,</v>

14
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 2>so I'm really looking forward to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

15
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Speaker 2>So let's dive right into it and see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>far we can get today.</v>

16
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 2>So we'll review first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Joseph's father is Jacob and Jacob is</v>

17
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.090
<v Speaker 2>the patriarch of Israel essentially that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the father of the 12 tribes.</v>

18
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

19
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

20
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:37.460
<v Speaker 2>you might remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

21
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 2>he had a very morally ambivalent pathway</v>
<v Speaker 2>through life and it's one of the things </v>

22
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 2>that I think so interesting about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories in the,</v>

23
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 2>in the Old Testament is that these so </v>
<v Speaker 2>called patriarchal figures are very </v>

24
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:05.051
<v Speaker 2>realistic and it's something that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>over being struck by that counts in the </v>

25
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:10.211
<v Speaker 2>new testament that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of things that Christ does </v>

26
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 2>that you'd think would have been edited </v>
<v Speaker 2>out over time and sanitized,</v>

27
00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:18.431
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Old Testament is definitely not a </v>

28
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:18.431
<v Speaker 2>book that's been sanitized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

29
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 2>it's quite interesting that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

30
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 2>So you sort of see people with all their</v>
<v Speaker 2>flaws and I've been trying to also </v>

31
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 2>derive some general conclusions about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral of the story of the genesis </v>

32
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:38.261
<v Speaker 2>stories and because these stories are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally moral and moral as far as </v>

33
00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to do with action,</v>

34
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

35
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Because moral decisions are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions that you make when you're </v>

36
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.481
<v Speaker 2>structuring action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you decide to do one thing or </v>

37
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:50.870
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally want to do things that are the</v>

38
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 2>best things that you can think of to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hence good,</v>

39
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes you also want to do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are the worst things you can do,</v>

40
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>

41
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 2>or resentful or bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the moral decisions that you make</v>

42
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.030
<v Speaker 2>that govern your actions are really the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most important decisions that you make </v>

43
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 2>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that easy to figure out how</v>

44
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:15.961
<v Speaker 2>to make moral decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have an unerring technology for</v>

45
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:21.961
<v Speaker 2>that the same way as we do for say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making decisions about empirical </v>

46
00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in some ways seem a lot simpler,</v>

47
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because we can work collectively </v>

48
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 2>at it partly because we have a rigorous </v>
<v Speaker 2>methodology for deciding what's true and</v>

49
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 2>what's not.</v>

50
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>struck me,</v>

51
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 2>like it's an overarching theme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that emerges out of genesis,</v>

52
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 2>especially after the really ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories say,</v>

53
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.720
<v Speaker 2>especially after the stories of Cain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel.</v>

54
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.360
<v Speaker 2>When you get to the accounts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically for historically real </v>

55
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:03.931
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one injunction seems to be get the hell </v>

56
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:07.530
<v Speaker 2>out there and do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

57
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>One of the major themes for all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriarchs that we've talked about,</v>

58
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:17.311
<v Speaker 2>Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say Jacob and Joseph is move out into </v>

59
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 2>the world regardless of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances at hand.</v>

60
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Now that's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

61
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 2>in the Old Testament stories that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically portrayed as hearkening to the</v>

62
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 2>voice of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

63
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could think about that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>destiny or psychological calling.</v>

64
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the funny thing too is,</v>

65
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:41.911
<v Speaker 2>is that it's not that these people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an easy time of it when they heed that </v>

66
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:41.911
<v Speaker 2>call.</v>

67
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.130
<v Speaker 2>So what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's fascinating is that they often </v>

68
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>run into extreme difficulties right </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

69
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

70
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 2>because life is obviously full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme difficulties.</v>

71
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.850
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another example of the failure to </v>

72
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 2>sugarcoat things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the things I think makes</v>

73
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 2>a mockery of antireligious theories that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are even quite sophisticated say,</v>

74
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>like Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Freud thought of religion as a,</v>

75
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.530
<v Speaker 2>as a wish fulfillment essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

76
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 2>and also marks who thought about </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is the opiate of the masses.</v>

77
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:22.081
<v Speaker 2>It's if those were true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that there'd be a lot </v>

78
00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 2>more wish and a lot less reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot less stark,</v>

79
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 2>harsh reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

80
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first thing that Abraham </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounters is a famine and then he has </v>

81
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:38.251
<v Speaker 2>to hide his wife and then he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He basically journeys into a tyranny,</v>

82
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 2>so that's about as bad as it gets in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some ways,</v>

83
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 2>and those themes recur continually and </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one ever lives where they're supposed</v>

84
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:50.821
<v Speaker 2>to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They leave and live in Canaan and not </v>

85
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:50.821
<v Speaker 2>the promised land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's a pretty rough.</v>

86
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:55.800
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty rough series of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fundamental idea is something </v>

87
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

88
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.500
<v Speaker 3>there's no time for sitting around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's time to go out into the world </v>

89
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 3>and engage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's.</v>

90
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 3>There's hints about the proper and </v>
<v Speaker 3>improper ways of engaging right?</v>

91
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 3>So clearly the improper way to engage </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

92
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.610
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most clearly delineated in the Cain and </v>

93
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.491
<v Speaker 3>Abel Story and with Kane exemplifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>the inappropriate way to engage with the</v>

94
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 3>world and that's to engage with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world in a bitter,</v>

95
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.640
<v Speaker 3>jealous and resentful manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

96
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I really liked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Cain and Abel story and that theme</v>

97
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 3>recurs continually with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the duality of the brothers,</v>

98
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:35.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

99
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.930
<v Speaker 3>there's constant conflict between a </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective that's essentially like </v>

100
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.770
<v Speaker 3>canes and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

101
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 3>and the opposite perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which all,</v>

102
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.090
<v Speaker 3>which I'll get to in a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Cain sees that the world is a very </v>

103
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.030
<v Speaker 3>tragic place and that the rewards are </v>
<v Speaker 3>distributed unfairly and that there are </v>

104
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 3>people who do better and people who do </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse,</v>

105
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.980
<v Speaker 3>and as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he becomes bitter and resentful and </v>

106
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 3>curses God and then he becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>homicidal.</v>

107
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:10.450
<v Speaker 3>Fratricidal which is even worse than he </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroys his own ideal than his </v>

108
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 3>descendants basically become genocidal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

109
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 3>So that seems to be the wrong way to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>about things,</v>

110
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless your goal is to make things </v>

111
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.821
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not like it has a limited </v>

112
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 3>number of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has nothing to object to.</v>

113
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 3>He's got plenty to object to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His situation actually is bad.</v>

114
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 3>He's overshadowed terribly by his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother who everyone loves,</v>

115
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 3>who does extraordinarily well and who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at everything.</v>

116
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 3>And the story is a bit ambivalent about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reasons for keynes failure,</v>

117
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.030
<v Speaker 3>although a fair bit of it's laid out his</v>
<v Speaker 3>own feet,</v>

118
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.120
<v Speaker 3>but he's definitely failing and so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can understand why he would have this </v>

119
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.620
<v Speaker 3>terrible attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is all it does is make </v>

120
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.161
<v Speaker 3>it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't seem to be one of the </v>

121
00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:57.680
<v Speaker 3>things I've also learned as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologist,</v>

122
00:07:57.681 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 3>sort of pondering these sorts of things.</v>

123
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 3>It's often a lot easier to identify what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't do then what you should </v>

124
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's.</v>

125
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.950
<v Speaker 3>I think evil is easier to identify than </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

126
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.520
<v Speaker 3>I think good is trickier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but evil stands out to some degree and </v>

127
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.541
<v Speaker 3>then at least you can say if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get as far away from that as </v>

128
00:08:16.541 --> 00:08:19.361
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could even say just for practical </v>

129
00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:21.821
<v Speaker 3>reasons so your life doesn't become hell</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your family life doesn't become </v>

130
00:08:21.821 --> 00:08:25.181
<v Speaker 3>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least you could get as far away from </v>

131
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:27.641
<v Speaker 3>that as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you weren't able to conjure up </v>

132
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 3>what would constitute the good as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ame,</v>

133
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 3>you could at least avoid those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitfalls.</v>

134
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:37.181
<v Speaker 3>And I do also think that it's pitfalls </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that that really threatened our </v>

135
00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:37.181
<v Speaker 3>society right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

136
00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:41.741
<v Speaker 3>that I see a tremendous rise in </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentment fueling almost all of the </v>

137
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:47.231
<v Speaker 3>political polarization that's taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>place seems unfortunate given that by </v>

138
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:51.851
<v Speaker 3>and large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone on the planet is richer than </v>

139
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:51.851
<v Speaker 3>they've ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

140
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean there's no disparity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

141
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 3>but there's always disparity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

142
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Jacob,</v>

143
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jacob and Rebecca,</v>

144
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 2>the deceiver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Esau and Jacob ends up with,</v>

145
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.520
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 2>with Isaac's blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

147
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a moral catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he has to run because his </v>

148
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.680
<v Speaker 2>brother wants to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the fratricidal motif.</v>

149
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that too.</v>

150
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

151
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that Freud noted </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly,</v>

152
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 2>and this is where Freud really is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>genius,</v>

153
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:29.751
<v Speaker 2>is that the most intense hatreds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also sometimes the most intense love is </v>

154
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:32.290
<v Speaker 2>within families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

155
00:09:32.291 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 2>when in the Freudian world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopathology,</v>

156
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all inside the family.</v>

157
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.950
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pathology in the Freudian world is </v>

158
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.370
<v Speaker 2>actually the fact that it's all inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>the family because people who get </v>

159
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 2>tangled up in the Freudian familial </v>
<v Speaker 2>nightmare,</v>

160
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:55.521
<v Speaker 2>which is roughly to in structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can only conceptualize the world in </v>

161
00:09:55.531 --> 00:10:00.531
<v Speaker 2>terms of their familial relationships </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they've been so damaged by the </v>

162
00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:04.041
<v Speaker 2>enmeshment and the trauma and the deceit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the betrayal and the blurred lines </v>

163
00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:08.511
<v Speaker 2>and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they just can't expand past the </v>

164
00:10:08.511 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 2>family and go out in the world.</v>

165
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that brothers can be at each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other's throats,</v>

166
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I think is out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very powerful idea and it's not </v>

167
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 2>something that people like to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

168
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.460
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Jacob has to leave and it's not </v>

169
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 2>surprising because mean what he did was </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty reprehensible.</v>

170
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 2>He betrayed his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless,</v>

171
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 2>he's the person who dreams of the ladder</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Unites Heaven and earth.</v>

172
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.750
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very perverse thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

173
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I think it does is </v>
<v Speaker 2>give.</v>

174
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives hope to everyone because it </v>

175
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 2>if only the good guys when we're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>in trouble,</v>

177
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's not that easy to be a good </v>

178
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:52.340
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

179
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.820
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really not that easy and most </v>

180
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 2>people are pretty keenly aware of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ways that they fall short,</v>

181
00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.950
<v Speaker 2>even have their own ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if there was no hope except for </v>

182
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:03.900
<v Speaker 2>the good guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all of us would be lost.</v>

183
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.440
<v Speaker 2>And so that's one of the things I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked and was more surprised about with </v>

184
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.941
<v Speaker 2>the old testament stories is that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are very complex lives and they </v>

185
00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:18.591
<v Speaker 2>make very major moral errors by anyone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>standard and yet and yet the overall </v>

186
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:25.191
<v Speaker 2>message is still hopeful and the message</v>
<v Speaker 2>that runs contrary to the message of </v>

187
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:28.230
<v Speaker 2>evil say that message of good is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

188
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of emphasis on faith.</v>

189
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a tough one because cynics,</v>

190
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.650
<v Speaker 2>people who are cynical about religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures like to think of faith as the</v>

191
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:48.381
<v Speaker 2>willingness to demolish your intellect </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the service of superstition and well,</v>

192
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.470
<v Speaker 2>there's something to be said for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

193
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.370
<v Speaker 2>but not a lot</v>

194
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 3>because the reality is much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated.</v>

195
00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:02.641
<v Speaker 3>Part of the faith that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is being insisted upon in the old </v>

196
00:12:02.641 --> 00:12:07.501
<v Speaker 3>testament is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm speaking psychologically here </v>

197
00:12:07.501 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's useful to pause it.</v>

198
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:10.840
<v Speaker 3>A hi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

199
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Good to aim at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

200
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think that's practically useful</v>

201
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:17.860
<v Speaker 3>to the research we've done with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future authoring program,</v>

202
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:19.960
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>indicates pretty clearly that if you get</v>

203
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 3>people to conceptualize an ideal and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>balanced ideal,</v>

204
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what do you want for your family?</v>

205
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:28.660
<v Speaker 3>What do you want for your career?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you want for your education?</v>

206
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 3>What do you want for your character </v>
<v Speaker 3>development?</v>

207
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to use your time </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of work?</v>

208
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:38.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to structure your use </v>

209
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:39.520
<v Speaker 3>of drugs and alcohol and places where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you might get impulsive?</v>

210
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.290
<v Speaker 3>How can you avoid falling into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible path?</v>

211
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:47.290
<v Speaker 3>If you really think that through and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with an integrated ideal and </v>

212
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:47.290
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put it above us,</v>

213
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.080
<v Speaker 3>something to reach for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're more committed to the world </v>

214
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:57.760
<v Speaker 3>in a positive way and you're less </v>
<v Speaker 3>tormented by anxiety and uncertainty.</v>

215
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.220
<v Speaker 3>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that makes sense,</v>

216
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:05.221
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because here you are alive and </v>

217
00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:06.170
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so unless you were Cape,</v>

218
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 3>if you're not capable of manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>some positive relationship with the fact</v>

219
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:15.271
<v Speaker 3>of your being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then how could that be anything other </v>

220
00:13:15.271 --> 00:13:18.241
<v Speaker 3>than hellish because it would just be </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety provoking and terrible because </v>

221
00:13:18.241 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 3>you're vulnerable and there'd be nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>useful or worthwhile to do.</v>

222
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just not.</v>

223
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.690
<v Speaker 3>I just can't see that as a winning </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy for anyone.</v>

224
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.900
<v Speaker 3>You can make a rational case for </v>
<v Speaker 3>adopting that strategy in that you know,</v>

225
00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

226
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:36.130
<v Speaker 3>there's no evidence for for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent morality or for an ultimate</v>

227
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:36.460
<v Speaker 3>meaning.</v>

228
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:41.460
<v Speaker 3>There's no hard empirical evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems to me that there's </v>

229
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 3>existential evidence as well that has to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be taken into account.</v>

230
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Speaker 3>And of course psychologists have talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this a lot.</v>

231
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm Carl Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

232
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:52.570
<v Speaker 3>in human for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freud,</v>

233
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:57.571
<v Speaker 3>for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the great psychologists have </v>

234
00:13:57.571 --> 00:13:57.571
<v Speaker 3>pointed out that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

235
00:13:57.571 --> 00:14:01.260
<v Speaker 3>you can derive reasonable information </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's solid from your own experience,</v>

236
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:06.391
<v Speaker 3>especially if you also talked to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and you can kind of see in your </v>

237
00:14:06.391 --> 00:14:07.390
<v Speaker 3>own life when you're on a productive </v>
<v Speaker 3>path.</v>

238
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:12.650
<v Speaker 3>It sort of ennobles and enlightens you </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a destructive path and I think it's </v>

239
00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:18.511
<v Speaker 3>kind of useful to think that maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dichotomy between those two paths might </v>

240
00:14:18.511 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 3>be real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

241
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because that also allows you to give</v>

242
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.890
<v Speaker 3>credence to your intuitions about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing.</v>

243
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.120
<v Speaker 3>But I don't anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's unreasonable to pause</v>

244
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:35.121
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that since you're alive adopting the </v>

245
00:14:35.121 --> 00:14:38.251
<v Speaker 3>highest possible regard for the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're alive and that you're </v>

246
00:14:38.251 --> 00:14:39.580
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by other creatures that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

247
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 3>I just can't see how that can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>be construed as a losing strategy.</v>

248
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.570
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's something like faith,</v>

249
00:14:46.571 --> 00:14:47.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's faith,</v>

250
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.650
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not only faith in your being but </v>

251
00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 3>it's faith in being such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the faith would be something like if</v>

252
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:58.931
<v Speaker 3>you could orient your being properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe that would orient you with </v>

253
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 3>being as such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you never know.</v>

254
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it might be true.</v>

255
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.030
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason to assume that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be true.</v>

256
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you just take a strict </v>

257
00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.531
<v Speaker 3>biological perspective on this and think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about us as the product of three and a </v>

258
00:15:14.531 --> 00:15:18.491
<v Speaker 3>half billion years of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we have struggled over all those </v>

259
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 3>billions of years to be alive and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>match ourselves with reality.</v>

260
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 3>And so because one of the things I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>often wondered is,</v>

261
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is definitely difficult.</v>

262
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.400
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfair and there's inequality and all of</v>

263
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 3>those things and people are subject to </v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of terrible things.</v>

264
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:39.251
<v Speaker 3>But I also wonder if you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>actively striving to make things worse,</v>

265
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.170
<v Speaker 3>just how much better could they be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

266
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.180
<v Speaker 3>because people are very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like houses that are divided </v>

267
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.180
<v Speaker 3>amongst themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pointing in different directions</v>

268
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:58.181
<v Speaker 3>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're working at cross purposes to </v>

269
00:15:58.181 --> 00:16:01.271
<v Speaker 3>themselves because of bitterness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentment and an unprocessed memories </v>

270
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:06.080
<v Speaker 3>and childhood hatreds and unexamined </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumptions,</v>

271
00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:11.081
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you just gotTa wonder if you could </v>

272
00:16:11.081 --> 00:16:13.100
<v Speaker 3>push that aside and orient yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

273
00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:18.101
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing that of course </v>
<v Speaker 3>is stressed very heavily in the old </v>

274
00:16:18.101 --> 00:16:22.241
<v Speaker 3>testament and of course that goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the entire biblical corpus is </v>

275
00:16:22.241 --> 00:16:26.360
<v Speaker 3>that it's not only enough to establish a</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive relationship with being,</v>

276
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 3>which I think is the essential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a good description of faith.</v>

277
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.330
<v Speaker 3>You have to make that decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

278
00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:37.331
<v Speaker 3>Because being is very ambivalent and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can make the case that maybe it's </v>

279
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 3>something that should have never </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

280
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.240
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't seem to be productive </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

281
00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:46.241
<v Speaker 3>And faith seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to act as if being is </v>

282
00:16:46.241 --> 00:16:48.710
<v Speaker 3>ultimately justifiable and that if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>partake in it properly,</v>

283
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I will improve it rather than making it </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>

284
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's the statement of </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith.</v>

285
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.840
<v Speaker 3>And then what seems to go along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is something like truth in </v>

286
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.980
<v Speaker 3>conception,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inaction.</v>

287
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:06.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even people like Jacob who are pretty </v>

288
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.551
<v Speaker 3>damn morally ambivalent to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get hammered a lot by what they go </v>

289
00:17:09.551 --> 00:17:11.150
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what seems to happen is that they're</v>

290
00:17:11.151 --> 00:17:13.430
<v Speaker 3>hammered into some sort of ethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>shape,</v>

291
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by the mid point of their life's </v>

292
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.160
<v Speaker 3>journey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people who are solidly planted</v>

293
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:24.460
<v Speaker 3>who you can trust and who don't be trey </v>
<v Speaker 3>being or themselves or their fellow man.</v>

294
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.520
<v Speaker 3>And so it's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems reasonable to me to </v>

295
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:37.601
<v Speaker 3>first assume that you have to establish </v>
<v Speaker 3>a relationship with something that's </v>

296
00:17:37.601 --> 00:17:39.500
<v Speaker 3>transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might even be just the future version</v>

297
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:44.501
<v Speaker 3>of you and then second that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>align yourself with reality in a </v>

298
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:49.560
<v Speaker 3>truthful manner and that that's your </v>
<v Speaker 3>best bet and</v>

299
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.590
<v Speaker 3>the biblical stories are actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>realistic about that too because they </v>

300
00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 3>don't really say that if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be instantly transported</v>

301
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 3>to the promised land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even Moses,</v>

302
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:03.870
<v Speaker 3>as we'll find out in the accident </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

303
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:09.110
<v Speaker 3>He never makes it to the promised land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not like you're offered </v>

304
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.910
<v Speaker 3>instantaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>final redemption.</v>

305
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 3>If you move out forthrightly into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

306
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:20.030
<v Speaker 3>establish a faithful relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 3>being an attempt to conduct yourself </v>

307
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:25.941
<v Speaker 3>with integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's your best bat and it might be </v>

308
00:18:25.941 --> 00:18:27.090
<v Speaker 3>good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even if it's not good enough,</v>

309
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.940
<v Speaker 3>it's really preferable to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative,</v>

310
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 3>which seems to be something closely akin</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hell,</v>

311
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 3>both personal and social.</v>

312
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.180
<v Speaker 3>So Joseph's father is Jacob later </v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>

313
00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:46.500
<v Speaker 3>He who wrestles with God and we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about that a little bit.</v>

314
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of implicit in what I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying is that I think we all do that to</v>

315
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 3>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wrestle with reality itself.</v>

316
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:57.540
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure not only the reality we </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>

317
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:02.541
<v Speaker 3>but the reality we don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is sort of a transcendent reality </v>

318
00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe whatever reality is </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of that,</v>

319
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:08.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the classic Judeo Christian </v>

320
00:19:08.961 --> 00:19:10.881
<v Speaker 3>conception of God is that there's time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and space and of course there's lots of </v>

321
00:19:10.881 --> 00:19:15.231
<v Speaker 3>things about what exists in time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>space that were completely ignorant to </v>

322
00:19:15.231 --> 00:19:18.060
<v Speaker 3>oven that's transcendent in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there's an idea that there is a</v>

323
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:21.150
<v Speaker 3>realm outside of that which is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

324
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:23.610
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very sophisticated idea,</v>

325
00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:26.070
<v Speaker 3>I think rather than a simple idea and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

326
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult to know what to make of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

327
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:34.550
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't really matter because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think regardless of what your attitude </v>

328
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:37.890
<v Speaker 3>is towards those sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually,</v>

329
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 3>you still end up in the same position as</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jacob for all intents and purposes,</v>

330
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:48.111
<v Speaker 3>practically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think that there's </v>

331
00:19:48.111 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 3>anyone who at some point in their life </v>
<v Speaker 3>or perhaps even everyday doesn't at some</v>

332
00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:55.110
<v Speaker 3>level wrestle with God and you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>just call it well the nature of reality,</v>

333
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.710
<v Speaker 3>I suppose if you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say reductionistic about it,</v>

334
00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:00.210
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it makes any </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

335
00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:05.211
<v Speaker 3>It's still something you're stuck with </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not only the nature of reality </v>

336
00:20:05.401 --> 00:20:10.401
<v Speaker 3>itself that you have to struggle with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the nature of your moral </v>

337
00:20:10.401 --> 00:20:11.010
<v Speaker 3>relationship to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your behavior in relationship to it.</v>

338
00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:14.880
<v Speaker 3>So that's how you should perceive it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you should conduct yourself.</v>

339
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:20.300
<v Speaker 3>And then whether or not the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the advantages of doing it properly are </v>

340
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 3>worth the difficulty and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>disadvantages.</v>

341
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 3>So that seems to me just a straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>existential statement.</v>

342
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jacob gets damaged by his wrestling,</v>

343
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 3>which is also very realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

344
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.840
<v Speaker 3>he also ends up as father of Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the favorite son,</v>

345
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.380
<v Speaker 3>son who's born in his old age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to his favorite wife,</v>

346
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.780
<v Speaker 3>and that's who we're going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>two today.</v>

347
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:48.710
<v Speaker 3>So you remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Jacob is the for father of the 12 </v>

348
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:53.461
<v Speaker 3>tribes of Israel and there's his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wives and the son and the offspring </v>

349
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:57.130
<v Speaker 3>that resulted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are all the sons.</v>

350
00:20:57.131 --> 00:21:02.131
<v Speaker 3>There's a daughter named Diana as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Rachel is the woman he really loved </v>

351
00:21:02.131 --> 00:21:04.420
<v Speaker 3>and the first son he had with Rachel was</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joseph,</v>

352
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:09.421
<v Speaker 3>and that was when he was older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's in some sense why Joseph </v>

353
00:21:09.421 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 3>is his favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

354
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.960
<v Speaker 3>this is the beginning of the story of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Joseph.</v>

355
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 3>Now Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jacob loved Joseph more than all his </v>

356
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.631
<v Speaker 3>children because he was the son of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>old age and he made him a coat of many </v>

357
00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:25.070
<v Speaker 3>colors and there's a lot packed into </v>
<v Speaker 3>those two sentences.</v>

358
00:21:25.071 --> 00:21:30.071
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first is that now Israel loved </v>

359
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Joseph more than all his other children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably not so good.</v>

360
00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:37.691
<v Speaker 3>One of the things we've seen in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories that have preceded this is that </v>

361
00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:41.560
<v Speaker 3>whenever there's marked preference on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the part of parents for one child over </v>

362
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.830
<v Speaker 3>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

363
00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.180
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

364
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.330
<v Speaker 3>with Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Esau was Rachel was,</v>

365
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jacob was Rachel's favorite and Isa was,</v>

366
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

367
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.950
<v Speaker 3>Isaac's favorite that didn't work out so</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that put a real twist in the entire</v>

368
00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 3>structure of the family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a warning there right off</v>

369
00:22:02.831 --> 00:22:05.350
<v Speaker 3>the bat you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

370
00:22:05.351 --> 00:22:08.050
<v Speaker 3>you can't help having a preference for </v>
<v Speaker 3>one child or another,</v>

371
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:13.051
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's certainly something that you </v>

372
00:22:13.051 --> 00:22:16.141
<v Speaker 3>should be very cautious about because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem to work out very well </v>

373
00:22:16.141 --> 00:22:17.110
<v Speaker 3>because he was the son of his old age </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

374
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 3>And he made him a coat of many colors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very interesting image,</v>

375
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:24.460
<v Speaker 3>that coat of many colors they have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

376
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm going to delve into that idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it sets the stage,</v>

377
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.490
<v Speaker 3>like it says what sort of person Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

378
00:22:30.491 --> 00:22:32.680
<v Speaker 3>He's favored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's younger,</v>

379
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.920
<v Speaker 3>he's favored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he also has this particular garment </v>

380
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:37.920
<v Speaker 3>that characterizes him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

381
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.470
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things I've really </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned from analyzing women's dreams in</v>

382
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:44.140
<v Speaker 3>particular is that women very </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently,</v>

383
00:22:44.141 --> 00:22:49.141
<v Speaker 3>in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very frequently dream of clothing as </v>

384
00:22:49.141 --> 00:22:49.141
<v Speaker 3>role.</v>

385
00:22:49.141 --> 00:22:49.840
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're interpreting women's </v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams,</v>

386
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:53.800
<v Speaker 3>then if they put on the shoes of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandmother for example,</v>

387
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.040
<v Speaker 3>then you understand very rapidly that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that dream is trying to make an </v>

388
00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.421
<v Speaker 3>association between their own behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>and something that's characteristic of </v>

389
00:23:03.421 --> 00:23:05.500
<v Speaker 3>either the state of being a grandmother </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the particular grandmother.</v>

390
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.090
<v Speaker 3>And it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

391
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Because clothing protects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also signifies a role.</v>

392
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:16.590
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting in the old testament </v>

393
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.951
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often if someone is going to act </v>

394
00:23:19.951 --> 00:23:20.470
<v Speaker 3>deceitfully they changed their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they changed their outfit.</v>

395
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's Kinda what you do when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>act deceitfully,</v>

396
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You dress up like someone else,</v>

397
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 3>you present yourself like someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

398
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:32.050
<v Speaker 3>back to the coat of many colors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

399
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:39.990
<v Speaker 3>for something to be many colored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sort of spans the entire gamut of </v>

400
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:45.121
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a hint there that if you </v>

401
00:23:45.121 --> 00:23:47.881
<v Speaker 3>want to be a full fledged person that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to manifest a very large number</v>

402
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:56.561
<v Speaker 3>of traits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I want to go into that idea a </v>

403
00:23:56.561 --> 00:23:59.711
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing I want to talk about is </v>

404
00:23:59.711 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 3>some of the things that we've learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what happens to you when you go to</v>

405
00:24:00.681 --> 00:24:02.720
<v Speaker 3>a new environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

406
00:24:02.721 --> 00:24:07.130
<v Speaker 3>there's this idea in very deep idea and </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinical psychology,</v>

407
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 3>a fundamental idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that if someone's anxious about</v>

408
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:11.660
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do is you.</v>

409
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:16.250
<v Speaker 3>And it's getting in their way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take what they're anxious about,</v>

410
00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:18.680
<v Speaker 3>new define it because that already </v>
<v Speaker 3>delimits it,</v>

411
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:23.681
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the problems with being </v>

412
00:24:23.681 --> 00:24:23.681
<v Speaker 3>anxious about something as you won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak of it,</v>

413
00:24:23.681 --> 00:24:25.500
<v Speaker 3>it's like voldemort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you don't speak of it you,</v>

414
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.260
<v Speaker 3>it's way bigger than it should be.</v>

415
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.720
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you start talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cut it down to size.</v>

416
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.550
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

417
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.520
<v Speaker 3>it's for a bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because you're not as.</v>

418
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.620
<v Speaker 3>You're not as afraid of as many things </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you think.</v>

419
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:38.930
<v Speaker 3>And you're braver than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

420
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:44.530
<v Speaker 3>And more and more capable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as soon as you're brave enough to </v>

421
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:44.530
<v Speaker 3>start talking about what you're afraid </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

422
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 3>then you see that there's more to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>than you thought and that there's less </v>

423
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.600
<v Speaker 3>to the problem than you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you can decompose it further </v>

424
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.770
<v Speaker 3>into smaller problems and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to approach those smaller</v>

425
00:24:54.771 --> 00:24:59.771
<v Speaker 3>problems and so and then it doesn't seem</v>
<v Speaker 3>to meet to be that you get less </v>

426
00:24:59.771 --> 00:25:04.271
<v Speaker 3>frightened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to be that you get more </v>

427
00:25:04.271 --> 00:25:06.161
<v Speaker 3>courageous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is way better than being less </v>

428
00:25:06.161 --> 00:25:06.161
<v Speaker 3>frightened because there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to be frightened about.</v>

429
00:25:06.161 --> 00:25:08.060
<v Speaker 3>So if you're courageous that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that really does the trick.</v>

430
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Now the question is what happens if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

431
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:16.511
<v Speaker 3>let's say that you're a very socially </v>
<v Speaker 3>inept and you don't know how to </v>

432
00:25:16.511 --> 00:25:20.891
<v Speaker 3>introduce yourself or to make any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were established the initial parts of a </v>

433
00:25:20.891 --> 00:25:24.671
<v Speaker 3>relationship with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then you start putting yourself </v>

434
00:25:24.671 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 3>in situations where you're required to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

435
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:30.680
<v Speaker 3>And so then the question is how is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>technically that you transform?</v>

436
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.460
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

437
00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:32.510
<v Speaker 3>you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

438
00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:36.080
<v Speaker 3>we want to be more specific about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean that you learn?</v>

439
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Well if you're dealing with someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's particularly socially inept and </v>

440
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.431
<v Speaker 3>you're doing psychotherapy with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might teach them how to shake </v>

441
00:25:45.431 --> 00:25:47.950
<v Speaker 3>someone's hand properly and say their </v>
<v Speaker 3>name and remember the other person's </v>

442
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.851
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you just practice that with them </v>

443
00:25:51.851 --> 00:25:54.190
<v Speaker 3>so that they have the motoric routine </v>
<v Speaker 3>down so that form of knowledge is built </v>

444
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.710
<v Speaker 3>right into your body.</v>

445
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the person,</v>

446
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.040
<v Speaker 3>put out your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shake it.</v>

447
00:25:58.041 --> 00:26:02.750
<v Speaker 3>Don't not like a dead Halibut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know with a reasonable grip.</v>

448
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Say Your name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't mumble it.</v>

449
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at them so that they can hear you,</v>

450
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:12.130
<v Speaker 3>and then when they say their name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to remember it and that's meant so </v>

451
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.970
<v Speaker 3>you can practice that with people and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they develop something that's </v>

452
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Metorik,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

453
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:19.610
<v Speaker 3>It's embedded right in their body and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you can say to them,</v>

454
00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:24.611
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing you can do is when you </v>

455
00:26:24.611 --> 00:26:26.171
<v Speaker 3>start a conversation is don't sit there </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about what you're going to say </v>

456
00:26:26.171 --> 00:26:30.281
<v Speaker 3>next because then you won't be paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to the person and you'll make </v>

457
00:26:30.281 --> 00:26:34.031
<v Speaker 3>a fool out of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you'll manifest nonsequitors,</v>

458
00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:35.540
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you'll get out of.</v>

459
00:26:35.541 --> 00:26:38.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're dancing and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're paying attention to is where your</v>

460
00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:43.541
<v Speaker 3>feet are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to step on the other </v>

461
00:26:43.541 --> 00:26:45.701
<v Speaker 3>person all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you want to pay attention to the </v>

462
00:26:45.701 --> 00:26:47.591
<v Speaker 3>other person and then whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>automatized social knowledge you have </v>

463
00:26:47.591 --> 00:26:48.600
<v Speaker 3>will come to the forefront.</v>

464
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.850
<v Speaker 3>So it's a good thing to know if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>socially anxious,</v>

465
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:52.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're socially anxious,</v>

466
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:57.441
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you should do is pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>way more attention to the person you're </v>

467
00:26:57.441 --> 00:27:01.041
<v Speaker 3>talking to rather than less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you should pay as little attention </v>

468
00:27:01.041 --> 00:27:04.641
<v Speaker 3>as possible to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you feel yourself falling in </v>

469
00:27:04.641 --> 00:27:08.241
<v Speaker 3>because you're anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what you do is you push your </v>

470
00:27:08.241 --> 00:27:08.820
<v Speaker 3>attention out and pay attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person because to the degree that you've</v>

471
00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:13.821
<v Speaker 3>been socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all your automatic responses will </v>

472
00:27:13.821 --> 00:27:13.821
<v Speaker 3>kick it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

473
00:27:13.821 --> 00:27:17.871
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you go out into the social world and </v>

474
00:27:17.871 --> 00:27:20.570
<v Speaker 3>you learn to shake someone's hand and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn how to listen to them and ask </v>

475
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.510
<v Speaker 3>them questions because that's the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

476
00:27:21.511 --> 00:27:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Because people love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just ask them random questions</v>

477
00:27:24.991 --> 00:27:27.600
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they start talking to you and you</v>

478
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:32.601
<v Speaker 3>don't understand something about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying or maybe something they </v>

479
00:27:32.601 --> 00:27:33.000
<v Speaker 3>said is interesting in you ask them a </v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

480
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:38.210
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty damn happy about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it means you're actually paying </v>

481
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:41.001
<v Speaker 3>attention to them and people actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>love to be paid attention to because it </v>

482
00:27:41.001 --> 00:27:41.400
<v Speaker 3>hardly ever happens.</v>

483
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.200
<v Speaker 3>So they really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really like it.</v>

484
00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:44.310
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

485
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:45.780
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what's happening?</v>

486
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're mastering the automated motor </v>

487
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.910
<v Speaker 3>movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

488
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.610
<v Speaker 3>Where to point your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where to put your hands,</v>

489
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.760
<v Speaker 3>how to move your lips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really embodied knowledge.</v>

490
00:27:56.761 --> 00:28:01.761
<v Speaker 3>It's a special kind of memory and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>practicing that and so that's building </v>

491
00:28:01.761 --> 00:28:06.110
<v Speaker 3>new skills for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then by listening to the person and </v>

492
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.341
<v Speaker 3>watching yourself interact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're also generating new new abstract </v>

493
00:28:11.101 --> 00:28:16.101
<v Speaker 3>information that enables you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualize the world in a different </v>

494
00:28:16.101 --> 00:28:19.191
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you go out to can you go talk to </v>

495
00:28:19.191 --> 00:28:19.950
<v Speaker 3>10 different people or 50 different </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

496
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Then you get to listen to what those 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>people said.</v>

497
00:28:23.281 --> 00:28:26.280
<v Speaker 3>You get to watch how they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they express themselves,</v>

498
00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:30.210
<v Speaker 3>and you gather a corpus of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>that changes the way you perceive.</v>

499
00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:33.090
<v Speaker 3>That broadens you as a social agent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

500
00:28:33.091 --> 00:28:38.091
<v Speaker 3>so that's two forms of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's a third one which is </v>

501
00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:39.660
<v Speaker 3>really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that you know you have a lot of</v>

502
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 3>biological potential and it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what potentially is,</v>

503
00:28:43.591 --> 00:28:48.591
<v Speaker 3>but part of it is that you're capable of</v>
<v Speaker 3>generating proteins that you haven't </v>

504
00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:49.950
<v Speaker 3>been generating.</v>

505
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 3>So you should get right on that by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

506
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.960
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what the way that works in part is </v>

507
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.150
<v Speaker 3>that if you put yourself in a radically </v>
<v Speaker 3>new situation,</v>

508
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:02.510
<v Speaker 3>then your brain that there are genetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>switches that turn on because of the </v>

509
00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:06.420
<v Speaker 3>demands of the new situation that code </v>
<v Speaker 3>for new proteins.</v>

510
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:11.660
<v Speaker 3>So it's as if you have latent software.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be one way of thinking about </v>

511
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:17.390
<v Speaker 3>that will only be turned on if you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into this situation where that's </v>

512
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 3>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then you might think,</v>

513
00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:19.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's the case,</v>

514
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:24.710
<v Speaker 3>how much have you could be turned on if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you went a whole bunch of different </v>

515
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.990
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a really,</v>

516
00:29:24.991 --> 00:29:29.991
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a profound question because one </v>

517
00:29:29.991 --> 00:29:32.511
<v Speaker 3>of the deep answers to how you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>get your life together is you should go </v>

518
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:38.340
<v Speaker 3>a very large number of places and turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself on.</v>

519
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:44.210
<v Speaker 3>And I want to walk through that a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a very rich symbolic </v>

520
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:49.170
<v Speaker 3>world that expresses that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now the idea about having a coat of </v>

521
00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:55.231
<v Speaker 3>many colors would be that the person who</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the appropriate leader,</v>

522
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.360
<v Speaker 3>because remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the proper person,</v>

523
00:29:58.361 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Speaker 3>which would be the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that these old stories</v>

524
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.780
<v Speaker 3>are trying to express and to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>is how is it that you should act which </v>

525
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.370
<v Speaker 3>is the same as what constitutes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideal.</v>

526
00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:14.371
<v Speaker 3>Those are the same question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the hand here with Joseph is while </v>

527
00:30:14.371 --> 00:30:18.841
<v Speaker 3>you should wear a coat of many colors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that you should be able to </v>

528
00:30:18.841 --> 00:30:20.260
<v Speaker 3>go have a drink in the pub with the guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were,</v>

529
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dry walling,</v>

530
00:30:21.641 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your house.</v>

531
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:27.871
<v Speaker 3>And you should be able to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated conversation with someone </v>

532
00:30:27.871 --> 00:30:28.870
<v Speaker 3>who's more educated in an abstract way.</v>

533
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 3>And that maybe you should be equally </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable in both situations,</v>

534
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you might think,</v>

535
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:37.600
<v Speaker 3>well there's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the indications that there's more</v>

536
00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:42.601
<v Speaker 3>to you is that you can be put more </v>
<v Speaker 3>places and function properly and that </v>

537
00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:48.091
<v Speaker 3>would be a good thing to aim at because </v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the other issue is that you know </v>

538
00:30:48.091 --> 00:30:52.861
<v Speaker 3>perfectly well that the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedies of life and your exposure to </v>

539
00:30:53.591 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 3>malevolence in the course of that life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those being the worst things,</v>

540
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.400
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot you can do to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to alter that fundamentally because </v>

541
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.990
<v Speaker 3>their conditions of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be subject to your </v>

542
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.670
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability and your going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject to malevolence.</v>

543
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:12.720
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't hide from it because it </v>

544
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.780
<v Speaker 3>actually makes it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're stuck with it.</v>

545
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 3>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

546
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:18.460
<v Speaker 3>what are your options?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one option is to curse the structure</v>

547
00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:21.880
<v Speaker 3>of being for being malevolent and tragic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fair enough.</v>

548
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:26.970
<v Speaker 3>And the other is to make yourself so </v>
<v Speaker 3>damn differentiated and dynamic and able</v>

549
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:33.810
<v Speaker 3>that you're more than a match for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's not an easy thing,</v>

550
00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:35.860
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because like what?</v>

551
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:41.280
<v Speaker 3>What's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no good alternative and that's </v>

552
00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.521
<v Speaker 3>also worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you see these ideas expressed in the </v>

553
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:50.200
<v Speaker 3>strangest places and so we've talked a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

554
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I think in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this series about Pinocchio,</v>

555
00:31:53.081 --> 00:31:54.520
<v Speaker 3>but if we haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

556
00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:01.290
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's Jimminy cricket at the opening </v>

557
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:03.571
<v Speaker 3>of the Pinocchio Movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pointing to a star,</v>

558
00:32:03.641 --> 00:32:06.760
<v Speaker 3>which is roughly the Nativity Star for </v>
<v Speaker 3>all intents and purposes,</v>

559
00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:11.761
<v Speaker 3>and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a symbolic indicator of a of </v>

560
00:32:11.761 --> 00:32:16.710
<v Speaker 3>something diamond like and pure right </v>
<v Speaker 3>glimmering in the darkness that's </v>

561
00:32:17.081 --> 00:32:20.350
<v Speaker 3>transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that above the horizon upon which to fix</v>

562
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:23.530
<v Speaker 3>your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's the thing is you need that</v>

563
00:32:23.531 --> 00:32:28.531
<v Speaker 3>technically and the reason you need that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because we know enough about </v>

564
00:32:28.531 --> 00:32:33.391
<v Speaker 3>psychology now to know that almost all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the positive emotion that you're </v>

565
00:32:33.391 --> 00:32:36.571
<v Speaker 3>going to experience in your life and </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive emotion is analgesic by the </v>

566
00:32:36.571 --> 00:32:36.571
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

567
00:32:36.571 --> 00:32:40.800
<v Speaker 3>It actually quells paint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not just positive and also gets </v>

568
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.000
<v Speaker 3>rid of negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a big plus.</v>

569
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Almost all of the positive emotion that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to feel.</v>

570
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.040
<v Speaker 3>You're going to feel in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a goal because you feel positive emotion</v>

571
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:54.250
<v Speaker 3>as you approach a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so if you want to feel positive </v>

572
00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.461
<v Speaker 3>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you need a goal and then you might </v>

573
00:32:57.461 --> 00:32:57.461
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

574
00:32:57.461 --> 00:32:57.461
<v Speaker 3>if you want to maximize that positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion,</v>

575
00:32:57.461 --> 00:33:02.441
<v Speaker 3>which is enthusiasm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also what pulls you out into the </v>

576
00:33:02.441 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 3>world as well as feeling good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you need the best possible goal.</v>

577
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Well that because that's going to engage</v>
<v Speaker 3>the largest segments of your being,</v>

578
00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:15.440
<v Speaker 3>like if your goals too narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then a bunch of you isn't going to be on</v>

579
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 3>board for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

580
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.700
<v Speaker 3>If the goal is well developed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>multifaceted,</v>

581
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:21.440
<v Speaker 3>then all of you can partake in that.</v>

582
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Even your negative elements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even your anger and your fear can get </v>

583
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.920
<v Speaker 3>onboard with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say so you need a goal,</v>

584
00:33:27.921 --> 00:33:29.690
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's worthy.</v>

585
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:30.650
<v Speaker 3>You got us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

586
00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:35.651
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need a goal that justifies the </v>

587
00:33:35.651 --> 00:33:36.080
<v Speaker 3>tragedy and malevolence of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be the bottom line.</v>

588
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 3>Now maybe you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

589
00:33:37.821 --> 00:33:39.500
<v Speaker 3>there's no goal that can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

590
00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:44.501
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are still better and worse </v>

591
00:33:45.091 --> 00:33:46.870
<v Speaker 3>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and I,</v>

592
00:33:46.871 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm not convinced that there are no </v>
<v Speaker 3>goals that can do that.</v>

593
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I think that's an open question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd never know that until you pursued </v>

594
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:59.471
<v Speaker 3>the proper goal long enough to find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>who you would be as a consequence of </v>

595
00:33:59.481 --> 00:34:04.481
<v Speaker 3>pursuing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's also your destiny or your </v>

596
00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:04.481
<v Speaker 3>existential voyage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

597
00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:05.870
<v Speaker 3>It's also not something that anyone else</v>
<v Speaker 3>can do for you.</v>

598
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Someone can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your act together for Christ's sake </v>

599
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:11.110
<v Speaker 3>and get it.</v>

600
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Get good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

601
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.570
<v Speaker 3>that'll make the world unfold best for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

602
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 3>But there's no way you can know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>without doing it.</v>

603
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.680
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and unless you think you've done a </v>

604
00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.161
<v Speaker 3>particularly stellar job of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have no reason to doubt its </v>

605
00:34:27.161 --> 00:34:30.020
<v Speaker 3>potential validity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So plus,</v>

606
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:33.170
<v Speaker 3>like crickets are telling you this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

607
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.500
<v Speaker 3>there are a very reliable source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

608
00:34:36.501 --> 00:34:40.280
<v Speaker 3>so you see the star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>The star recurs as a Motif in Pinocchio.</v>

609
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:45.281
<v Speaker 3>And one of the more interesting elements</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it here is that when Japan wants to </v>

610
00:34:45.281 --> 00:34:50.081
<v Speaker 3>transform his puppet Marionette,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose being played by forces that </v>

611
00:34:50.181 --> 00:34:55.181
<v Speaker 3>operate behind the scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really good definition of the </v>

612
00:34:55.181 --> 00:34:56.090
<v Speaker 3>persona from a union perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

613
00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:01.300
<v Speaker 3>And also something indicative of </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like an ideological or </v>

614
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.781
<v Speaker 3>conceptual possession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan who's a good guy is positive </v>

615
00:35:04.781 --> 00:35:09.260
<v Speaker 3>father figure read lifts his even though</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is a patriarchal figure,</v>

616
00:35:09.261 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

617
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:14.860
<v Speaker 3>And a very competent one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's still even lifts his eyes up to </v>

618
00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.471
<v Speaker 3>something that transcends his mode of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being positive as it is and wishes that </v>

619
00:35:17.471 --> 00:35:22.391
<v Speaker 3>his creation would undertake the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation that would make it </v>

620
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.930
<v Speaker 3>autonomous and fully functional as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral agent.</v>

621
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:28.070
<v Speaker 3>No strings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

622
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:33.310
<v Speaker 3>So that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think soldier hits and said the </v>

623
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:36.680
<v Speaker 3>salvation of mankind lies only in making</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that concern of all.</v>

624
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.310
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty decent star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like goal I would say.</v>

625
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens in the story is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

626
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:50.800
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is a symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 3>representative of what I just described </v>

627
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.330
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens at a genetic level,</v>

628
00:35:51.331 --> 00:35:56.331
<v Speaker 3>if you put yourself in new situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Japan is roughly culture in the </v>

629
00:35:56.971 --> 00:35:58.140
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio Story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

630
00:35:58.141 --> 00:35:59.430
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a craftsman.</v>

631
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.510
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

632
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he makes Pinocchio.</v>

633
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's who's his son.</v>

634
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:12.531
<v Speaker 3>He's the socializing agent and he aims </v>
<v Speaker 3>for something above mere socialization,</v>

635
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:15.870
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

636
00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:17.940
<v Speaker 3>part of the mysterious element of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

637
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when our scientific models,</v>

638
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:22.170
<v Speaker 3>we basically have socialization and </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology,</v>

639
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.020
<v Speaker 3>but there's always a third element and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological stories,</v>

640
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:30.021
<v Speaker 3>which is whatever you might construe as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the spontaneous action of consciousness </v>

641
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.240
<v Speaker 3>that's associated with freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

642
00:36:33.241 --> 00:36:38.241
<v Speaker 3>that's just basically being </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualized in religious terms as </v>

643
00:36:38.241 --> 00:36:41.001
<v Speaker 3>something akin to the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we don't have a category for that </v>

644
00:36:41.001 --> 00:36:44.810
<v Speaker 3>scientifically because what we try to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientifically is to reduce everything </v>

645
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:48.621
<v Speaker 3>either to socialization or to biology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it isn't clear to me that that's.</v>

646
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.200
<v Speaker 3>It's perfectly reasonable from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective of practicality at a </v>

647
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.551
<v Speaker 3>scientific level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to multiply explanatory </v>

648
00:36:58.551 --> 00:37:01.671
<v Speaker 3>principles beyond necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's many things that that </v>

649
00:37:01.671 --> 00:37:04.671
<v Speaker 3>doesn't come to terms with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such as the fact that we all treat each </v>

650
00:37:04.671 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 3>other as autonomous beings with free </v>
<v Speaker 3>will and that that seems to work.</v>

651
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:08.790
<v Speaker 3>And that if we stopped doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then things go to hell very,</v>

652
00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:09.600
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>

653
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.510
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the mere fact that we have been able</v>

654
00:37:12.511 --> 00:37:16.470
<v Speaker 3>to conceptualize what that conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>freewill might be,</v>

655
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 3>metaphysically or physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean it doesn't exist,</v>

656
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:21.210
<v Speaker 3>it just means that we don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

657
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean what it was only in the last 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years that we discovered that 95 percent</v>

658
00:37:26.131 --> 00:37:31.131
<v Speaker 3>of the universe was made out of some </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of matter that we can't even whose </v>

659
00:37:31.131 --> 00:37:34.950
<v Speaker 3>properties we can't even imagine except </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it seems to have mass.</v>

660
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:40.580
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is when Japan Eto reach </v>

661
00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.570
<v Speaker 3>lifts his eyes up to the star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

662
00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:48.140
<v Speaker 3>so it's society aligning itself with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>proper goal with regards to individual </v>

663
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 3>development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

664
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:53.781
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there instead of society being at </v>

665
00:37:53.781 --> 00:37:57.321
<v Speaker 3>odds with the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they line up and then what happens is </v>

666
00:37:57.321 --> 00:37:58.050
<v Speaker 3>nature comes on board and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>blue fairy in the,</v>

667
00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:03.410
<v Speaker 3>in the Pinocchio Story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's seems to me to be a symbolic </v>

668
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.471
<v Speaker 3>representation of what happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>biologically when when you set the goal </v>

669
00:38:06.471 --> 00:38:11.391
<v Speaker 3>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your culture behind you and move </v>

670
00:38:11.391 --> 00:38:13.881
<v Speaker 3>into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there's a biological </v>

671
00:38:13.881 --> 00:38:14.280
<v Speaker 3>transformation that occurs as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of that,</v>

672
00:38:14.281 --> 00:38:18.600
<v Speaker 3>which means that a bunch of you that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hasn't been turned on turns on.</v>

673
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:24.260
<v Speaker 3>And I guess one question would be is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you be like if you turned on </v>

674
00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.650
<v Speaker 3>everything inside of you that could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned on?</v>

675
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:27.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good goal.</v>

676
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.600
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I'm going to introduce a couple </v>

677
00:38:34.171 --> 00:38:39.171
<v Speaker 3>of other ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this idea in union psychology </v>

678
00:38:39.171 --> 00:38:43.441
<v Speaker 3>called the circumambulation and young </v>
<v Speaker 3>had this idea that you had a potential </v>

679
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:48.571
<v Speaker 3>future self which would be in potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that you could be and that it</v>

680
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:53.941
<v Speaker 3>manifests itself moment to moment in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your present life by making you </v>

681
00:38:53.941 --> 00:38:58.090
<v Speaker 3>interested in things and the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're interested in are the things that</v>

682
00:38:58.091 --> 00:39:01.510
<v Speaker 3>would guide you along the path that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would lead you to maximal development.</v>

683
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Now it sounds like a metaphysical idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a or a mystical idea even,</v>

684
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:09.280
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

685
00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:14.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really profoundly biological </v>

686
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:14.380
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is something like,</v>

687
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:18.391
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your setup so that you're automatically </v>

688
00:39:18.391 --> 00:39:21.421
<v Speaker 3>interested in those things that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fully expand you as a well adapted </v>

689
00:39:21.421 --> 00:39:21.610
<v Speaker 3>creature.</v>

690
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Well like there's nothing radical about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that idea.</v>

691
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:29.820
<v Speaker 3>How well what else could possibly be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>case unless there's something </v>

692
00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.310
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally flawed about you that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the situation would be.</v>

693
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.520
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of interesting to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how that would be manifest moment to </v>

694
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:38.560
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is something like,</v>

695
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:43.950
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your interest is captured by those </v>

696
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:44.980
<v Speaker 3>things that lead you down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The path of development will have better</v>

697
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:46.150
<v Speaker 3>be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

698
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:51.151
<v Speaker 3>so that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so there's some utility in pursuing </v>

699
00:39:51.151 --> 00:39:52.120
<v Speaker 3>those things that you're interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the call to adventure,</v>

700
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 3>let's say so and the call to adventure </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes you all sorts of places.</v>

701
00:39:56.501 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 3>Now the problem with the call to </v>
<v Speaker 3>adventure is like,</v>

702
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:03.661
<v Speaker 3>what the hell do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be interested in things that </v>

703
00:40:03.661 --> 00:40:06.931
<v Speaker 3>are kind of warped and bent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and often it's the case that when new </v>

704
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 3>parts of people manifest themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 3>grip their interest,</v>

705
00:40:10.661 --> 00:40:15.661
<v Speaker 3>say they do it very badly and shoddily </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you stumble around like an idiot.</v>

706
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:20.940
<v Speaker 3>When you try to do something new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the fool is the precursor </v>

707
00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.450
<v Speaker 3>to the savior from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the symbolic perspectives,</v>

708
00:40:22.451 --> 00:40:27.451
<v Speaker 3>because you have to be a fool before you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be a master and if you're not </v>

709
00:40:27.451 --> 00:40:27.451
<v Speaker 3>willing to be a fool and you can't be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>master,</v>

710
00:40:27.451 --> 00:40:29.790
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to.</v>

711
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.040
<v Speaker 3>It's an error error ridden process and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's also laid out the old testament </v>

712
00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Speaker 3>stories because the first thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to all these patriarchal figures</v>

713
00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:42.490
<v Speaker 3>when God kicks them out of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>father's house when they're like 84,</v>

714
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 3>is that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They run into all sorts of trouble.</v>

715
00:40:46.031 --> 00:40:48.040
<v Speaker 3>And some of it's social too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of it's natural.</v>

716
00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Some of it's a consequence of their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral inadequacy.</v>

717
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.380
<v Speaker 3>So they're fools and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

718
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:58.410
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that's so interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that despite the fact that they're </v>

719
00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.800
<v Speaker 3>fools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still supposed to go on the </v>

720
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.391
<v Speaker 3>adventure and that they're capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning enough as a consequence of </v>

721
00:41:03.391 --> 00:41:08.041
<v Speaker 3>moving forward on the adventure so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they straightened themselves out across </v>

722
00:41:08.041 --> 00:41:08.041
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

723
00:41:08.041 --> 00:41:11.230
<v Speaker 3>And so it's something like this and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>circumambulation that young talked about</v>

724
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:14.300
<v Speaker 3>was this continual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll return to this,</v>

725
00:41:14.301 --> 00:41:18.100
<v Speaker 3>this continual circling in some sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you could be.</v>

726
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:19.570
<v Speaker 3>You might notice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

727
00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:21.280
<v Speaker 3>that there are themes in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

728
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.800
<v Speaker 3>when you go back across your </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>

729
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of have your typical experience</v>

730
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:29.590
<v Speaker 3>that sort of repeats itself and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be variation on it,</v>

731
00:41:29.591 --> 00:41:34.591
<v Speaker 3>like a musical theme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like you're circling yourself </v>

732
00:41:34.591 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 3>and getting closer to yourself as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>move across time.</v>

733
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:42.250
<v Speaker 3>That's the circumambulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you remember that for a sec because </v>

734
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:42.250
<v Speaker 3>we'll go back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

735
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that something glimmers </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you.</v>

736
00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:47.270
<v Speaker 3>It's an an interest that's dawning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you decide,</v>

737
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

738
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:49.250
<v Speaker 3>you're paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

739
00:41:49.251 --> 00:41:50.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I know if I should pursue that?</v>

740
00:41:50.871 --> 00:41:54.650
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a stupid idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the proper response to that is,</v>

741
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.800
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it probably is a stupid idea because </v>

742
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.141
<v Speaker 3>almost all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all ideas are stupid and so the </v>

743
00:42:02.141 --> 00:42:04.070
<v Speaker 3>probability that as you move forward on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your adventure,</v>

744
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to get it right the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time is zero.</v>

745
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.340
<v Speaker 3>It's just not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then you might think,</v>

746
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:15.341
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll just wait around until I get </v>

747
00:42:15.341 --> 00:42:15.470
<v Speaker 3>the right idea and which people do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

748
00:42:15.471 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 3>So they're like 40 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 year olds,</v>

749
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:22.751
<v Speaker 3>which is not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they wait around until it's </v>

750
00:42:22.751 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 3>waiting for Godot until they finally got</v>
<v Speaker 3>it right.</v>

751
00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:27.050
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is you're too stupid to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know when you've got it right.</v>

752
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:32.051
<v Speaker 3>So waiting around isn't going to help </v>
<v Speaker 3>because even if it's the perfect </v>

753
00:42:32.051 --> 00:42:35.210
<v Speaker 3>opportunity manifested itself to you in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your incomplete form,</v>

754
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:39.470
<v Speaker 3>the probability that you would recognize</v>
<v Speaker 3>it as the perfect opportunity is zero.</v>

755
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:44.590
<v Speaker 3>You might even think it's the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible idea that you've ever heard of </v>

756
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:44.780
<v Speaker 3>anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly likely,</v>

757
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:46.660
<v Speaker 3>highly likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

758
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.790
<v Speaker 3>so you ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a niche nature called that,</v>

759
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:50.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

760
00:42:50.191 --> 00:42:52.670
<v Speaker 3>will to stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I really liked.</v>

761
00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:55.440
<v Speaker 3>So because he thought of stupidity as </v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

762
00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:56.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

763
00:42:56.921 --> 00:43:01.921
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to take it into account </v>

764
00:43:01.921 --> 00:43:04.270
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally and work with it and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you can take these tentative </v>

765
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:08.891
<v Speaker 3>steps on your pathway to destiny and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can assume that you're going to do it </v>

766
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:13.190
<v Speaker 3>badly and that's really useful because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to beat yourself up.</v>

767
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:18.190
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty easy to do it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is it's way better to do </v>

768
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:21.821
<v Speaker 3>it badly than not to do it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the continual message that </v>

769
00:43:21.821 --> 00:43:24.380
<v Speaker 3>echoes through these historical stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>in genesis.</v>

770
00:43:24.381 --> 00:43:29.381
<v Speaker 3>It's like these are flawed people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should have got the hell out of </v>

771
00:43:29.381 --> 00:43:33.311
<v Speaker 3>their house way before they did and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>go out and they stumble around in </v>

772
00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:38.201
<v Speaker 3>tyranny and feminine self betrayal and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and violence.</v>

773
00:43:38.571 --> 00:43:43.571
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a hell of a lot better than </v>

774
00:43:43.571 --> 00:43:43.571
<v Speaker 3>just rotting away at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>

775
00:43:43.571 --> 00:43:44.840
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's good.</v>

776
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.520
<v Speaker 3>And so why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

777
00:43:46.521 --> 00:43:47.150
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

778
00:43:47.151 --> 00:43:52.151
<v Speaker 3>you start your path and you think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're heading towards your star and so </v>

779
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:56.840
<v Speaker 3>you go in that direction and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're here,</v>

780
00:43:56.841 --> 00:43:59.780
<v Speaker 3>the world looks a particular way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then when you move here,</v>

781
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:06.010
<v Speaker 3>the world looks different and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>different as a consequence of having </v>

782
00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:09.371
<v Speaker 3>made that voyage and so what that means </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that now that thing that glimmers in </v>

783
00:44:09.371 --> 00:44:13.781
<v Speaker 3>front of you is going to have shifted </v>
<v Speaker 3>its location because you weren't very </v>

784
00:44:13.781 --> 00:44:18.311
<v Speaker 3>good at specifying it to begin with and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now that you're a little sharper and </v>

785
00:44:18.311 --> 00:44:22.271
<v Speaker 3>more focused than you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to reveal itself with more </v>

786
00:44:22.271 --> 00:44:23.000
<v Speaker 3>accuracy to you.</v>

787
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:27.410
<v Speaker 3>And so then you have to take a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

788
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like 180 degree reversal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it because you know,</v>

789
00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 3>you've.</v>

790
00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've gone this far and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>long ways to get that far.</v>

791
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:44.090
<v Speaker 3>But that's a lot farther than you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be if you just stayed where you were </v>

792
00:44:44.311 --> 00:44:49.311
<v Speaker 3>waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it doesn't matter that you </v>

793
00:44:49.311 --> 00:44:52.440
<v Speaker 3>overshoot continually because as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>overshoot,</v>

794
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.830
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't learn what you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>have done,</v>

795
00:44:55.831 --> 00:44:59.430
<v Speaker 3>you're going to continually learn what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't keep doing.</v>

796
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 3>And if you learn enough about what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't keep doing,</v>

797
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:08.630
<v Speaker 3>then that's tantamount at some point to </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning at the same time what you </v>

798
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 3>should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's okay.</v>

799
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 3>So it's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what's cool about it though,</v>

800
00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:20.451
<v Speaker 3>I think is that as you progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the degree of overshooting starts to </v>

801
00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:21.930
<v Speaker 3>decline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

802
00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.110
<v Speaker 3>And that we know that there was nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothetical about that.</v>

803
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.660
<v Speaker 3>As you learn a new skill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even to play it,</v>

804
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:29.370
<v Speaker 3>play a song on the piano,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

805
00:45:29.371 --> 00:45:32.370
<v Speaker 3>you overshoot madly making all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistakes to begin with.</v>

806
00:45:32.371 --> 00:45:33.930
<v Speaker 3>And then the mistakes</v>

807
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.100
<v Speaker 3>they disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great ted talk,</v>

808
00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:43.300
<v Speaker 3>I think it was about sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a setup,</v>

809
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:48.320
<v Speaker 3>a really advanced computational </v>
<v Speaker 3>recording system in his home and </v>

810
00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.491
<v Speaker 3>recorded every single utterance his </v>
<v Speaker 3>young child made while learning to </v>

811
00:45:52.491 --> 00:45:57.231
<v Speaker 3>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he put together the child's </v>

812
00:45:57.231 --> 00:45:59.910
<v Speaker 3>attempts to say certain phonemes and put</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in the list.</v>

813
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:03.510
<v Speaker 3>And you can hear the child deviating </v>
<v Speaker 3>madly to begin with,</v>

814
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.910
<v Speaker 3>and then after hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>repetitions,</v>

815
00:46:05.911 --> 00:46:10.911
<v Speaker 3>just zeroing in on the exact phoneme so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you might not know this,</v>

816
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:14.130
<v Speaker 3>but when kids babble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they start babbling when they're</v>

817
00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:19.131
<v Speaker 3>quite young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they babble every human phoneme </v>

818
00:46:19.131 --> 00:46:20.130
<v Speaker 3>including all sorts of phonemes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>adults can't say,</v>

819
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.400
<v Speaker 3>and then they they die into their </v>
<v Speaker 3>language so that after they learn,</v>

820
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.980
<v Speaker 3>say English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's all sorts of phonemes they </v>

821
00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:30.980
<v Speaker 3>can no longer here or pronounced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to begin with,</v>

822
00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:32.340
<v Speaker 3>it's all there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really quite interesting,</v>

823
00:46:32.341 --> 00:46:36.300
<v Speaker 3>but so they zip as they learn a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular language,</v>

824
00:46:36.301 --> 00:46:40.880
<v Speaker 3>they zero in on the proper way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pronounce that in their errors minimize.</v>

825
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.290
<v Speaker 3>And every time you learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's how it is.</v>

826
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:48.291
<v Speaker 3>And that's really useful to know too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it means that it's okay to </v>

827
00:46:48.291 --> 00:46:50.670
<v Speaker 3>wander around stupidly before you fix </v>
<v Speaker 3>your destination.</v>

828
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Now you see that echoed in exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

829
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Because what happens is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians or the Hebrews escape a </v>

830
00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:02.301
<v Speaker 3>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of whatever you do </v>

831
00:47:02.301 --> 00:47:05.180
<v Speaker 3>personally and psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you escape from your previous set </v>

832
00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.070
<v Speaker 3>of stupidly held and ignorant and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stubborn axioms,</v>

833
00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.080
<v Speaker 3>it's like away from that tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

834
00:47:10.081 --> 00:47:11.640
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I freed myself from that.</v>

835
00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Well then what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you think,</v>

836
00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:15.450
<v Speaker 3>well now I'm on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no,</v>

837
00:47:15.451 --> 00:47:20.451
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you're in the desert where you </v>

838
00:47:20.451 --> 00:47:22.671
<v Speaker 3>wonder around stupidly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know and worship the wrong things </v>

839
00:47:22.671 --> 00:47:27.080
<v Speaker 3>until you finally organize yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>morally again and had in the proper </v>

840
00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.431
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's worth knowing too because you </v>

841
00:47:31.431 --> 00:47:31.431
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

842
00:47:31.431 --> 00:47:32.860
<v Speaker 3>I got rid of a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>baggage,</v>

843
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:34.900
<v Speaker 3>excess baggage that I didn't need in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

844
00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:36.160
<v Speaker 3>and now everything's okay.</v>

845
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:36.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

846
00:47:36.641 --> 00:47:41.641
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got rid of a whole set of </v>

847
00:47:41.641 --> 00:47:42.700
<v Speaker 3>scaffolds that were keeping you in place</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though they were pathological.</v>

848
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Now you have nothing and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually turns out to be better than </v>

849
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.931
<v Speaker 3>something pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're still stuck with the problem </v>

850
00:47:51.931 --> 00:47:52.930
<v Speaker 3>of nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

851
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly why exodus is structured </v>

852
00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:57.960
<v Speaker 3>the way that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that you escaped from maturity.</v>

853
00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.830
<v Speaker 3>It's hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're no longer slaves.</v>

854
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well now you're nihilistic and lost.</v>

855
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessarily an improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is,</v>

856
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.600
<v Speaker 3>but it is the pre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See.</v>

857
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.660
<v Speaker 3>It's also useful to know that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can also be diluted into the idea </v>

858
00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.500
<v Speaker 3>that imagine that you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become enlightened,</v>

859
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:18.010
<v Speaker 3>which might mean to turn all those parts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of you on that could be turned on.</v>

860
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:18.730
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

861
00:48:18.731 --> 00:48:21.010
<v Speaker 3>that's just a linear pathway uphill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

862
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:23.020
<v Speaker 3>it's just from one success to another.</v>

863
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 3>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

864
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:29.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like here you are and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing too badly in the first step is a </v>

865
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:32.131
<v Speaker 3>complete bloody catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worse and then maybe you can pull </v>

866
00:48:32.131 --> 00:48:36.331
<v Speaker 3>yourself together and you hit a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>plateau and then that crumbles and </v>

867
00:48:36.331 --> 00:48:40.471
<v Speaker 3>shakes and bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worse again and so because part of </v>

868
00:48:40.471 --> 00:48:44.101
<v Speaker 3>the reason that people don't become </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightened is because it's punctuated </v>

869
00:48:44.101 --> 00:48:47.521
<v Speaker 3>by intermittent deserts essentially by </v>
<v Speaker 3>intermittent catastrophes and if you </v>

870
00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:52.891
<v Speaker 3>don't know that well then you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically screwed because you go ahead </v>

871
00:48:52.891 --> 00:48:54.280
<v Speaker 3>on your movement forward and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse and you think,</v>

872
00:48:54.281 --> 00:48:55.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't work.</v>

873
00:48:55.031 --> 00:48:56.110
<v Speaker 3>I collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

874
00:48:56.111 --> 00:48:58.750
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's par for the course.</v>

875
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:04.440
<v Speaker 3>It's not indication that you failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just indication that it's really </v>

876
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.090
<v Speaker 3>hard and that when you learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you also unlearn something and the thing</v>

877
00:49:07.091 --> 00:49:10.570
<v Speaker 3>you unlearned is probably useful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unlearning it actually is painful.</v>

878
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:15.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say if you have to get out of a </v>

879
00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:15.780
<v Speaker 3>bad relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like not every,</v>

880
00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:19.290
<v Speaker 3>not any real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't any relationship that's a </v>

881
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:20.590
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when you jump out of it,</v>

882
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:25.620
<v Speaker 3>well maybe you're in better shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're still lonesome and </v>

883
00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.381
<v Speaker 3>disoriented and you don't know what your</v>
<v Speaker 3>past was and you don't know what your </v>

884
00:49:28.381 --> 00:49:28.381
<v Speaker 3>president is and you don't want to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what your future is.</v>

885
00:49:28.381 --> 00:49:33.151
<v Speaker 3>It's that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people stay with the devil </v>

886
00:49:33.151 --> 00:49:33.330
<v Speaker 3>they know instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

887
00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 3>looking for the devil they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

888
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:42.120
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you're full of faults </v>

889
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean you have to stop and thank </v>
<v Speaker 3>God for that.</v>

890
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:50.371
<v Speaker 3>That's a really useful thing and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that you're full of faults doesn't </v>

891
00:49:50.371 --> 00:49:54.271
<v Speaker 3>mean that you can't learn and so you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>pause it and an ideal and you're going </v>

892
00:49:54.371 --> 00:49:59.371
<v Speaker 3>to be wrong about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter because what </v>

893
00:49:59.371 --> 00:49:59.650
<v Speaker 3>you're right about his positing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideal moving towards it,</v>

894
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:05.010
<v Speaker 3>if the actual ideal isn't conceptualized</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly well first surprise,</v>

895
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 3>surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like what are you going to do?</v>

896
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:12.990
<v Speaker 3>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't matter that it's </v>

897
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:12.990
<v Speaker 3>imperfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imperfect,</v>

898
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:14.710
<v Speaker 3>it just matters that you do it and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you move forward.</v>

899
00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:19.920
<v Speaker 3>So that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really positive news as far as </v>

900
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned because you could actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that,</v>

901
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do it badly.</v>

902
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:22.930
<v Speaker 3>Anyone can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

903
00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 3>that's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

904
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:29.690
<v Speaker 3>So like if you were an efficient person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have just done that but you're</v>

905
00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:31.130
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But who cares?</v>

906
00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still end up in the,</v>

907
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.440
<v Speaker 3>in the same place and maybe the trip is </v>
<v Speaker 3>even more interesting.</v>

908
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably two interesting young.</v>

909
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:45.880
<v Speaker 3>I began to understand that the goal of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychic development by which he means </v>

910
00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:49.481
<v Speaker 3>psychological development or spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 3>development is the self.</v>

911
00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.320
<v Speaker 3>There is no linear evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only a circumambulation of the </v>

912
00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:59.111
<v Speaker 3>self are getting closer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's like you're spiraling </v>

913
00:50:59.111 --> 00:51:01.661
<v Speaker 3>into something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that and the thing that </v>

914
00:51:01.661 --> 00:51:05.261
<v Speaker 3>you're spiraling into recedes as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>move towards it and gets more and more </v>

915
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.380
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated and well developed as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>move towards it because you're not going</v>

916
00:51:09.381 --> 00:51:10.610
<v Speaker 3>to run out of goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

917
00:51:10.611 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 3>No matter how much you have your act </v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

918
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:18.220
<v Speaker 3>there's probably undoubtedly 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimensions along which you could get </v>

919
00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:23.111
<v Speaker 3>your act together a lot more so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of those aren't even </v>

920
00:51:23.111 --> 00:51:26.120
<v Speaker 3>conceivable to you when you're in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>initial on carved state,</v>

921
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:30.020
<v Speaker 3>let's say uniform development exists at </v>
<v Speaker 3>most at the beginning.</v>

922
00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything points towards the center.</v>

923
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:36.320
<v Speaker 3>This insight gave me stability and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gradually my inner peace returned.</v>

924
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.430
<v Speaker 3>So this is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the left there.</v>

925
00:51:43.431 --> 00:51:48.431
<v Speaker 3>That's the sharp cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that has the maze in it </v>

926
00:51:48.431 --> 00:51:51.881
<v Speaker 3>that I told you about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually light that up with lasers </v>

927
00:51:51.881 --> 00:51:53.900
<v Speaker 3>now and so that's it lit up with lasers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so.</v>

928
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:57.050
<v Speaker 3>So they're turning it into a cathedral </v>
<v Speaker 3>of light,</v>

929
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.330
<v Speaker 3>which I think is really fascinating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

930
00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.000
<v Speaker 3>It's a continuation of the same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

931
00:52:02.001 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Because the stained glass windows were </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

932
00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:06.740
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't call them primitive attempts </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>

933
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean stained glass windows are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>impressive,</v>

934
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:14.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an elaboration of the same </v>

935
00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:14.290
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you can go to that Cathedral.</v>

936
00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:16.820
<v Speaker 3>They light up the whole town like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really something.</v>

937
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.100
<v Speaker 3>And so they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's how the cathedral is built.</v>

938
00:52:19.101 --> 00:52:20.950
<v Speaker 3>It's across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

939
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:26.170
<v Speaker 3>and do you remember the cross is an ex </v>
<v Speaker 3>that marks the center of the world and </v>

940
00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:26.990
<v Speaker 3>the cross is the place where each </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual is.</v>

941
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:31.990
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>message of Christianity is the cross </v>

942
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:33.920
<v Speaker 3>marks the place where every single </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual is.</v>

943
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:39.130
<v Speaker 3>And it's a tragic place that consists of</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering and exposure to malevolence </v>

944
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.310
<v Speaker 3>and that the only way to come to terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it is to accept it.</v>

945
00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:49.240
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see anything metaphysical about </v>

946
00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:49.240
<v Speaker 3>that statement whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

947
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:51.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>x marks the spot.</v>

948
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in a spot,</v>

949
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:55.010
<v Speaker 3>you're right in the center of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

950
00:52:55.011 --> 00:52:57.470
<v Speaker 3>It's right in the center of the world as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as you're concerned.</v>

951
00:52:57.471 --> 00:53:02.471
<v Speaker 3>And the same with the rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's characterized by suffering and </v>

952
00:53:02.471 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 3>exposure to malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>

953
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:06.230
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitter,</v>

954
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:07.910
<v Speaker 3>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hateful.</v>

955
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:11.570
<v Speaker 3>All that does is make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to accept it.</v>

956
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not an easy thing because that's </v>

957
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:17.170
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

958
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 3>a heroic task to voluntarily accept the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions of your own existence.</v>

959
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:21.620
<v Speaker 3>And that happens at the cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's fine.</v>

960
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:23.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's associated with light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

961
00:53:23.961 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 3>that's good that that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>

962
00:53:26.101 --> 00:53:28.320
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't want that to be associated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with darkness.</v>

963
00:53:28.321 --> 00:53:30.540
<v Speaker 3>That would be a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

964
00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.990
<v Speaker 3>and so there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>

965
00:53:37.991 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

966
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.180
<v Speaker 3>the labyrinth that was built in 1200 </v>
<v Speaker 3>add.</v>

967
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:49.250
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is you walk in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same idea as that star sequence</v>

968
00:53:49.801 --> 00:53:53.000
<v Speaker 3>of slides that I just showed you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's the idea,</v>

969
00:53:53.001 --> 00:53:55.080
<v Speaker 3>is that north,</v>
<v Speaker 3>south,</v>

970
00:53:55.470 --> 00:54:00.470
<v Speaker 3>west and east.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the whole world laid out in </v>

971
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:01.410
<v Speaker 3>two dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the question is,</v>

972
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:03.960
<v Speaker 3>how do you get to the center?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we already know what the center is.</v>

973
00:54:03.961 --> 00:54:08.961
<v Speaker 3>The center is the center of the Cross </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the place of maximal </v>

974
00:54:08.961 --> 00:54:12.410
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could save maximal malevolence as </v>

975
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:15.261
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the place where that's </v>

976
00:54:15.261 --> 00:54:15.630
<v Speaker 3>transcended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how do you get there while the answer</v>

977
00:54:15.631 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

978
00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:19.950
<v Speaker 3>you don't just stand on the outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking in,</v>

979
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:25.010
<v Speaker 3>that's not gonna help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and you can't just run right to the </v>

980
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:28.941
<v Speaker 3>center even if you're in California and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to walk in here and then you</v>

981
00:54:33.031 --> 00:54:38.031
<v Speaker 3>see you go like this and you go to every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single place,</v>

982
00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:42.780
<v Speaker 3>every single place on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that little cosmos,</v>

983
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:48.230
<v Speaker 3>and then once you've gone to every </v>
<v Speaker 3>single place and expanded yourself as a </v>

984
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:49.920
<v Speaker 3>consequence of going north and west and </v>
<v Speaker 3>east and south,</v>

985
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.090
<v Speaker 3>then there's enough of you so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at so that you can tolerate being</v>

986
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:56.100
<v Speaker 3>first of all that you can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the center is,</v>

987
00:54:56.101 --> 00:54:58.650
<v Speaker 3>but also that you can tolerate being at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the center.</v>

988
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.310
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what that represents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's pretty.</v>

989
00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.920
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean let's make no mistake about it.</v>

990
00:55:04.921 --> 00:55:09.921
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were pretty damn serious about </v>

991
00:55:09.921 --> 00:55:09.921
<v Speaker 3>those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's,</v>

992
00:55:09.921 --> 00:55:14.230
<v Speaker 3>that's quite the piece of work for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the twelfth century in all of </v>

993
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:17.870
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of those damn cathedrals took 300 </v>

994
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:20.271
<v Speaker 3>years to build.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't build anything that takes 300 </v>

995
00:55:20.271 --> 00:55:20.271
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

996
00:55:20.271 --> 00:55:22.860
<v Speaker 3>and people were putting a lot of effort </v>
<v Speaker 3>into whatever these things meant,</v>

997
00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:28.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you think they meant bearded man </v>

998
00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:28.860
<v Speaker 3>in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>

999
00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:33.590
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to account for the kind of </v>

1000
00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:37.521
<v Speaker 3>motivation that would produce these </v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings with that kind of paucity of </v>

1001
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:39.540
<v Speaker 3>conceptualization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1002
00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:43.180
<v Speaker 3>the towns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was certainly the case in charter</v>

1003
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:47.970
<v Speaker 3>that they groaned under the tax burden </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was required to produce these.</v>

1004
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
<v Speaker 3>Now you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's partly tyrannical and no </v>

1005
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:53.000
<v Speaker 3>doubt that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1006
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole story is that the people who </v>

1007
00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:01.020
<v Speaker 3>produce those buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought about every bit of it.</v>

1008
00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's accidental and they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to portray something just like that </v>

1009
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:09.760
<v Speaker 3>window is trying to portray something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the same thing as this.</v>

1010
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:14.050
<v Speaker 3>It's the center from which all things </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifest themselves.</v>

1011
00:56:14.051 --> 00:56:18.160
<v Speaker 3>You see that's Christ there and being </v>
<v Speaker 3>portrayed as,</v>

1012
00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:21.160
<v Speaker 3>as that center or the center within him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1013
00:56:21.161 --> 00:56:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Very much like the shockers and in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in um,</v>

1014
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 2>in a yogic practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same basic idea.</v>

1015
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:33.300
<v Speaker 2>It's the opening up of the internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and its proper realization.</v>

1016
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:39.540
<v Speaker 2>So there are people walking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>labyrinth,</v>

1017
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.480
<v Speaker 2>so that's the coat of many colors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1018
00:56:46.481 --> 00:56:51.481
<v Speaker 2>That's this differentiated motive being </v>
<v Speaker 2>that enables you to be competent at home</v>

1019
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:58.320
<v Speaker 2>in the widest possible number of places </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that's a real differentiation </v>

1020
00:56:58.871 --> 00:57:03.130
<v Speaker 2>of your personality to breaking through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boundaries of your personality,</v>

1021
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:08.131
<v Speaker 2>including the ones that you impose on </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself to become someone who is useful</v>

1022
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:13.330
<v Speaker 2>wherever they're put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really relevant to this story</v>

1023
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:17.980
<v Speaker 2>of Joseph too because one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens to Joseph is that,</v>

1024
00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:23.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of bad things happen to him </v>

1025
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:23.890
<v Speaker 2>because he's the favorite of his father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His brothers hated him,</v>

1026
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.950
<v Speaker 2>and so the first they're going to throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>him in a pit.</v>

1027
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I think they do throw them in a pit.</v>

1028
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Then they sell them to be a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he ends up in,</v>

1029
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go through the story.</v>

1030
00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:38.850
<v Speaker 2>He ends up some places where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably wouldn't want to go prison </v>

1031
00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:41.941
<v Speaker 2>being one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter because even when </v>

1032
00:57:42.221 --> 00:57:45.280
<v Speaker 2>they put them in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually not in prison.</v>

1033
00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.490
<v Speaker 2>He just figures out how to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison work way better.</v>

1034
00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Then he's in control of the prison and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really.</v>

1035
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:54.730
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this friend,</v>

1036
00:57:55.510 --> 00:58:00.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was very smart but very cynical </v>

1037
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:03.960
<v Speaker 2>and he wasn't employed very well and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a little older than he should have </v>

1038
00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 2>given his level of intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>employability and so he had to take jobs</v>

1039
00:58:09.041 --> 00:58:10.930
<v Speaker 2>that weren't very intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging.</v>

1040
00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:11.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1041
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I tried to convince </v>
<v Speaker 2>him of was that even if he worked,</v>

1042
00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:21.480
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to work behind the parts </v>
<v Speaker 2>department in an automotive store </v>

1043
00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:21.910
<v Speaker 2>because he liked cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was beneath them,</v>

1044
00:58:21.911 --> 00:58:23.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was sort of a.</v>

1045
00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.050
<v Speaker 2>As far as he was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

1046
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:32.100
<v Speaker 2>he was too smart for a job like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which actually turned out not to be </v>

1047
00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:35.431
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't smart enough for a job like </v>

1048
00:58:35.431 --> 00:58:35.431
<v Speaker 2>that or it wasn't wise enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1049
00:58:35.431 --> 00:58:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I tried to tell them </v>

1050
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.441
<v Speaker 2>was that you're looking at the situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong because even in a simple job,</v>

1051
00:58:41.051 --> 00:58:46.051
<v Speaker 2>so called simple job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say dishwashing in a </v>

1052
00:58:46.051 --> 00:58:46.051
<v Speaker 2>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I did an awful lot of.</v>

1053
00:58:46.051 --> 00:58:50.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with a lot of other </v>

1054
00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:50.980
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fast staff changeover.</v>

1055
00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:54.130
<v Speaker 2>You're feeding people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're helping them have a celebration,</v>

1056
00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:59.370
<v Speaker 2>you're helping them take a break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can do it really well and then </v>

1057
00:59:00.101 --> 00:59:05.101
<v Speaker 2>the kitchen can operate properly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then people can come out to the </v>

1058
00:59:05.101 --> 00:59:07.891
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bloody catastrophe and like </v>

1059
00:59:07.891 --> 00:59:08.920
<v Speaker 2>you're even when you're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a menial job,</v>

1060
00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dishwashing,</v>

1061
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:15.930
<v Speaker 2>there are ways of doing it really badly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resentfully and horribly and doing it </v>

1062
00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:17.710
<v Speaker 2>really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you do it really well,</v>

1063
00:59:17.711 --> 00:59:19.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not a menial job anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1064
00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 2>it immediately transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1065
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

1066
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.980
<v Speaker 3>you can be around people who won't let </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happen and you should go get </v>

1067
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.000
<v Speaker 3>another job if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you do it properly,</v>

1068
00:59:29.001 --> 00:59:34.001
<v Speaker 3>then it's not meaningful at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's also a good way out of </v>

1069
00:59:34.911 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 3>resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

1070
00:59:36.021 --> 00:59:36.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just got this,</v>

1071
00:59:36.941 --> 00:59:37.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two bit job.</v>

1072
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:38.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1073
00:59:38.361 --> 00:59:41.000
<v Speaker 3>what if you did it as well as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly could,</v>

1074
00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.650
<v Speaker 3>you know what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1075
00:59:42.651 --> 00:59:44.900
<v Speaker 3>the first thing that would happen is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd get a lot smarter,</v>

1076
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:48.530
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's hardly a negative thing.</v>

1077
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the coat of many colors.</v>

1078
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:58.630
<v Speaker 3>So it's an estimation of what Joseph is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like and what we're seeing with all of </v>

1079
00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:03.131
<v Speaker 3>these patriarchal figures is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>continual realization of the ideal </v>

1080
01:00:03.131 --> 01:00:03.740
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1081
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:08.510
<v Speaker 3>You could think about it as success of </v>
<v Speaker 3>approximations of the ideal person.</v>

1082
01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:12.380
<v Speaker 3>And the story is exploring all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different possibilities,</v>

1083
01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:16.070
<v Speaker 3>including ones that are very violent and</v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic and malevolent.</v>

1084
01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:21.070
<v Speaker 3>It's trying to cover the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>territory and to focus in on what the </v>

1085
01:00:21.801 --> 01:00:24.470
<v Speaker 3>proper way through the maze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the maze of life,</v>

1086
01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:29.471
<v Speaker 3>the labyrinth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the hint here is that while you </v>

1087
01:00:29.471 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 3>should be multidimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the generations of Jacob.</v>

1088
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Joseph being 17 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was feeding the flock with his brothers </v>

1089
01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.360
<v Speaker 3>and the lad was with his sons of Bilhah </v>
<v Speaker 3>and with the sons of Zilpah,</v>

1090
01:00:38.361 --> 01:00:41.840
<v Speaker 3>his father's wives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Joseph brought unto his father.</v>

1091
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:44.480
<v Speaker 3>They're evil report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1092
01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.050
<v Speaker 3>we already know that Joseph has Jacob's </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite,</v>

1093
01:00:48.051 --> 01:00:51.470
<v Speaker 3>and so that doesn't make him very </v>
<v Speaker 3>popular among his brothers.</v>

1094
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:56.270
<v Speaker 3>He's younger and now we also find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's been set up more or less,</v>

1095
01:00:56.271 --> 01:01:00.170
<v Speaker 3>as you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a snitch because that's what this phrase</v>

1096
01:01:00.171 --> 01:01:05.171
<v Speaker 3>means is that he goes out and watches </v>
<v Speaker 3>his older brothers and if they do </v>

1097
01:01:05.171 --> 01:01:08.351
<v Speaker 3>something they shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He comes trotting back to Jacob and </v>

1098
01:01:08.351 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 3>reports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1099
01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to make you popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1100
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:12.290
<v Speaker 3>And you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1101
01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:13.640
<v Speaker 3>is that Joseph's problem?</v>

1102
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Or Jacob's problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say,</v>

1103
01:01:18.561 --> 01:01:20.450
<v Speaker 3>and this is something I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading too,</v>

1104
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.710
<v Speaker 3>is that that's a conspiratorial problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1105
01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Is it's the parents that fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so is the child who agrees to do </v>

1106
01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:33.371
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got a little cabal going and you</v>

1107
01:01:33.741 --> 01:01:34.250
<v Speaker 3>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1108
01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:39.251
<v Speaker 3>it's only the parents' fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the sun will be taking advantage of </v>

1109
01:01:39.251 --> 01:01:42.680
<v Speaker 3>every advantage that offers him because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he could say no to.</v>

1110
01:01:42.681 --> 01:01:44.630
<v Speaker 3>I won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1111
01:01:44.631 --> 01:01:49.631
<v Speaker 3>so Joseph is the favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a bit of a teacher's pet.</v>

1112
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:55.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel loved Joseph more than all his </v>

1113
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:59.231
<v Speaker 3>colors because he was the son of his old</v>
<v Speaker 3>age and he made him a coat of many </v>

1114
01:01:59.231 --> 01:02:02.051
<v Speaker 3>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when his brethren saw that their </v>

1115
01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:02.051
<v Speaker 3>father loved him more than all his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brothers,</v>

1116
01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:04.100
<v Speaker 3>they hated him and could not speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>peaceably unto him.</v>

1117
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:09.430
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you have a child or number </v>
<v Speaker 3>of children and one of them is your </v>

1118
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.430
<v Speaker 3>favorite.</v>

1119
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:11.660
<v Speaker 3>How should you treat that child?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1120
01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.720
<v Speaker 3>it isn't obvious that you do them any </v>
<v Speaker 3>favors by overtly making them be your </v>

1121
01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.330
<v Speaker 3>favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1122
01:02:17.331 --> 01:02:18.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1123
01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:20.490
<v Speaker 3>maybe you don't them as much as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should.</v>

1124
01:02:20.491 --> 01:02:25.491
<v Speaker 3>And second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you definitely set up a Cain and Abel </v>

1125
01:02:25.491 --> 01:02:28.470
<v Speaker 3>like scenario in the household and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe it's new situation too,</v>

1126
01:02:28.471 --> 01:02:31.770
<v Speaker 3>because you happen to love your child </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than you love your spouse,</v>

1127
01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:37.010
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a recipe for familial </v>

1128
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:37.490
<v Speaker 3>harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1129
01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:39.390
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1130
01:02:39.391 --> 01:02:44.130
<v Speaker 3>so now we have two reasons that Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not liked by his brothers is.</v>

1131
01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:49.131
<v Speaker 3>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he's a bit of a rat fink and the </v>

1132
01:02:49.131 --> 01:02:52.431
<v Speaker 3>other is that he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the favorite and he's playing that </v>

1133
01:02:52.431 --> 01:02:56.360
<v Speaker 3>to the hill by the looks of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when his brothers saw that their </v>

1134
01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.421
<v Speaker 3>father loved him more than all his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brethren and all his brothers and they </v>

1135
01:02:59.421 --> 01:03:00.630
<v Speaker 3>hated him and could not speak peaceably </v>
<v Speaker 3>unto him.</v>

1136
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:06.510
<v Speaker 3>And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told </v>
<v Speaker 3>it to his brethren and they hated him.</v>

1137
01:03:06.511 --> 01:03:11.511
<v Speaker 3>The more he said unto them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here I pray you this dream which I have </v>

1138
01:03:11.511 --> 01:03:13.560
<v Speaker 3>dreamed for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Behold we were binding.</v>

1139
01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:17.160
<v Speaker 3>We chiefs in the field and Lo my sheaf </v>
<v Speaker 3>arose.</v>

1140
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:20.280
<v Speaker 3>And behold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your sheaves stood round about and bowed</v>

1141
01:03:20.281 --> 01:03:25.281
<v Speaker 3>to my sheaf and his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And remember he's the young one,</v>

1142
01:03:27.211 --> 01:03:27.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1143
01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:30.300
<v Speaker 3>and also the daughter of the favorite </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife,</v>

1144
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:32.670
<v Speaker 3>which is another thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the son of the favorite wife,</v>

1145
01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:34.860
<v Speaker 3>which is another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really working in his favor.</v>

1146
01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:38.970
<v Speaker 3>And his brethren said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shalt Thou indeed reign over us or shall</v>

1147
01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:41.820
<v Speaker 3>thou indeed have dominion over us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they hated him,</v>

1148
01:03:41.821 --> 01:03:44.190
<v Speaker 3>yet the more for his dreams and for his </v>
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>

1149
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:46.480
<v Speaker 3>while there there's a shock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1150
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.050
<v Speaker 3>that makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when it gets worse,</v>

1151
01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:54.051
<v Speaker 3>so you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's the wheat sheaves bowing </v>

1152
01:03:54.051 --> 01:03:55.260
<v Speaker 3>there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you see this,</v>

1153
01:03:55.261 --> 01:03:56.280
<v Speaker 3>what's going on here?</v>

1154
01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the end of his,</v>

1155
01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:03.230
<v Speaker 3>let's call it grandiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's an idea to and in the Old </v>

1156
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the stories of Joseph,</v>

1157
01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:07.500
<v Speaker 3>that if God sends you a dream twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really means it.</v>

1158
01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:13.010
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't know if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I do know that people have </v>

1159
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:15.771
<v Speaker 3>repeating dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be true that that a dream you </v>

1160
01:04:15.771 --> 01:04:17.970
<v Speaker 3>have twice is really trying to punch </v>
<v Speaker 3>something home.</v>

1161
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:22.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly the case that recurrent </v>

1162
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:25.281
<v Speaker 3>nightmares are meaningful and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>recurrent nightmares are associated </v>

1163
01:04:25.281 --> 01:04:30.081
<v Speaker 3>quite tightly with decreased states of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental health and that if you can treat </v>

1164
01:04:30.081 --> 01:04:32.880
<v Speaker 3>the nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is often quite easy by the way,</v>

1165
01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:37.020
<v Speaker 3>then the some of the mental health </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems will decrease,</v>

1166
01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:40.230
<v Speaker 3>so repeated dreams seem to be important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>

1167
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.170
<v Speaker 3>He dreamed yet another dream and told it</v>
<v Speaker 3>to his brethren and said,</v>

1168
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:44.820
<v Speaker 3>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had another dream,</v>

1169
01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:50.060
<v Speaker 3>and be and behold the sun and the moon </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the 11 stars bowed to me and he told</v>

1170
01:04:51.451 --> 01:04:56.451
<v Speaker 3>it to his father and to his brothers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his father rebuked him and said unto </v>

1171
01:04:56.451 --> 01:05:00.070
<v Speaker 3>unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this dream that though history </v>

1172
01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:02.151
<v Speaker 3>of I in my and your mother and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brothers indeed come to bow down </v>

1173
01:05:02.151 --> 01:05:06.240
<v Speaker 3>ourselves to the to the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his brothers envied him,</v>

1174
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.110
<v Speaker 3>but his father observed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1175
01:05:10.111 --> 01:05:11.850
<v Speaker 3>what the hell do you make of something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

1176
01:05:11.851 --> 01:05:12.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1177
01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:17.130
<v Speaker 3>If someone tells you that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they responsible for their dreams?</v>

1178
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:23.670
<v Speaker 3>We don't really seem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't really hold ourselves </v>

1179
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.670
<v Speaker 3>responsible for our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the dreams we have at night,</v>

1180
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.800
<v Speaker 3>and what do you make of a dream is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that [inaudible] </v>

1181
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.950
<v Speaker 3>pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where he differed from Freud's </v>

1182
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:33.390
<v Speaker 3>substantially is Freud tended to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the dream head,</v>

1183
01:05:33.391 --> 01:05:37.780
<v Speaker 3>its meaning because it's contents </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't acceptable to the conscious mind</v>

1184
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:39.130
<v Speaker 3>and young said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1185
01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:40.390
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand.</v>

1186
01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:45.480
<v Speaker 3>That's not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens is the dream is doing the </v>

1187
01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:48.061
<v Speaker 3>best it can to express something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the person doesn't yet really know and </v>

1188
01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:51.160
<v Speaker 3>young thought about the dream as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifestation of nature.</v>

1189
01:05:51.161 --> 01:05:52.930
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't associated with the ego at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1190
01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:56.800
<v Speaker 3>It was just like you have a dream and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were things happening in it.</v>

1191
01:05:56.801 --> 01:05:58.930
<v Speaker 3>The same way that when you walk into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinner party,</v>

1192
01:05:58.931 --> 01:06:00.490
<v Speaker 3>there are things happening there.</v>

1193
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:04.240
<v Speaker 3>You know it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dream isn't something that's subject</v>

1194
01:06:04.241 --> 01:06:07.570
<v Speaker 3>to your capacity for manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that happens to you,</v>

1195
01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.910
<v Speaker 3>not something that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1196
01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:13.270
<v Speaker 3>so if someone has a dream like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you've got three options.</v>

1197
01:06:13.271 --> 01:06:17.830
<v Speaker 3>You can just discount dreams altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what people in the modern world</v>

1198
01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:22.831
<v Speaker 3>tend to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very bad idea because there </v>

1199
01:06:22.831 --> 01:06:22.990
<v Speaker 3>are thoughts and you shouldn't discount </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1200
01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.040
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're hardly random as some </v>

1201
01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.470
<v Speaker 3>neuroscientists claim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely cockeyed theory.</v>

1202
01:06:29.471 --> 01:06:33.250
<v Speaker 3>That random like television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snow on a TV set,</v>

1203
01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:34.990
<v Speaker 3>if it was random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1204
01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.750
<v Speaker 3>so one is while you just discount </v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams.</v>

1205
01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:42.751
<v Speaker 3>The other is that you consider the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person a liar and a braggart and a </v>

1206
01:06:42.751 --> 01:06:43.510
<v Speaker 3>narcissist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the third is,</v>

1207
01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.550
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the third?</v>

1208
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:50.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like he dreamt that the sun and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moon and the stars bowed down to him.</v>

1209
01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:54.760
<v Speaker 3>You might think about that two or three </v>
<v Speaker 3>times so,</v>

1210
01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:57.250
<v Speaker 3>but it's not necessarily something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to make you happy.</v>

1211
01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.940
<v Speaker 3>And his brother and went to feed their </v>
<v Speaker 3>father's flock and check him.</v>

1212
01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:03.190
<v Speaker 3>So they took off and Israel said unto </v>
<v Speaker 3>Joseph,</v>

1213
01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:08.820
<v Speaker 3>you're not thy brethren,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feed the flock and check him calm and I </v>

1214
01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.410
<v Speaker 3>will send thee unto him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said him and he said to him,</v>

1215
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:11.390
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here tomorrow.</v>

1216
01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:15.850
<v Speaker 3>And when they saw him afar off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even before he came near onto them,</v>

1217
01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:21.060
<v Speaker 3>they conspired against him to slay him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rough people act then,</v>

1218
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:22.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1219
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:24.820
<v Speaker 3>this sort of thing is happening quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently.</v>

1220
01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they said to one another,</v>

1221
01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:30.460
<v Speaker 3>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dreamer cometh.</v>

1222
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Come now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore let us slay him,</v>

1223
01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:38.370
<v Speaker 3>cast him into some pit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we will say some evil beast has </v>

1224
01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:40.270
<v Speaker 3>devoured him and we shall see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes of his dreams.</v>

1225
01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.730
<v Speaker 3>So there's an echo of the Cain and Abel </v>
<v Speaker 3>story there.</v>

1226
01:07:42.731 --> 01:07:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1227
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:51.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not quite as clear because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicate enables store able is clearly </v>

1228
01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:53.650
<v Speaker 3>just doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here you can't quite get a handle on</v>

1229
01:07:53.651 --> 01:07:58.651
<v Speaker 3>Joseph's character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell if he is actually the </v>

1230
01:07:58.651 --> 01:07:59.440
<v Speaker 3>elect or if he's just a spoiled Brat </v>
<v Speaker 3>with delusions of grandeur.</v>

1231
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.210
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't matter because his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brothers,</v>

1232
01:08:04.211 --> 01:08:09.211
<v Speaker 3>they're so irritated at his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that he's favored and perhaps </v>

1233
01:08:09.211 --> 01:08:13.381
<v Speaker 3>even the fact that he might be someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>destined for something,</v>

1234
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:18.980
<v Speaker 3>that they find it perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>to destroy that.</v>

1235
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.260
<v Speaker 3>And it's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so interesting how often that motif</v>

1236
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:28.190
<v Speaker 3>of pulling down an ideal manifest itself</v>
<v Speaker 3>in these old stories,</v>

1237
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:33.191
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the pattern is established in the </v>

1238
01:08:33.191 --> 01:08:36.011
<v Speaker 3>Cain and Abel Story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just repeats and repeats and repeats </v>

1239
01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:36.011
<v Speaker 3>and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's dead true.</v>

1240
01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:39.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it just repeats all the time so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are annoyed about how tragic</v>

1241
01:08:39.831 --> 01:08:40.580
<v Speaker 3>their lives are.</v>

1242
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:45.940
<v Speaker 3>They're annoyed that they're subject to </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence and they're annoyed that </v>

1243
01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:49.380
<v Speaker 3>they're not doing as well as other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are doing and that makes them up,</v>

1244
01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.470
<v Speaker 3>puts them exactly into this state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

1245
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe with modern people,</v>

1246
01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.410
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to kill someone because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're resentful as a modern person,</v>

1247
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:59.990
<v Speaker 3>you don't generally slay them and throw </v>
<v Speaker 3>them into a pit.</v>

1248
01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:05.290
<v Speaker 3>You know what you do is you just killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>them slowly over a few decades and it </v>

1249
01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:06.770
<v Speaker 3>isn't obvious to me that that's any </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1250
01:09:07.190 --> 01:09:12.190
<v Speaker 3>So I've seen plenty of married couples </v>
<v Speaker 3>who were in that situation.</v>

1251
01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:17.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there is this Mitch Hedberg he</v>

1252
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.600
<v Speaker 3>used to complain about Turtleneck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said it was like being strangled by a </v>

1253
01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.111
<v Speaker 3>really weak midget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably really politically incorrect </v>

1254
01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:29.600
<v Speaker 3>jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a funny joke.</v>

1255
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:31.590
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1256
01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:37.260
<v Speaker 3>and then you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see relationships that are like </v>

1257
01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:41.291
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like each person has their hands </v>

1258
01:09:41.291 --> 01:09:43.541
<v Speaker 3>around the neck of the other person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have enough courage to </v>

1259
01:09:43.541 --> 01:09:46.241
<v Speaker 3>actually to squeeze it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just put enough pressure on to cut the </v>

1260
01:09:46.241 --> 01:09:50.921
<v Speaker 3>circulation off a tiny bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the person just gets like a die over </v>

1261
01:09:50.921 --> 01:09:52.700
<v Speaker 3>a 30 year period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1262
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:57.140
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you all laugh because,</v>

1263
01:09:57.141 --> 01:09:58.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

1264
01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:58.700
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>

1265
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:04.070
<v Speaker 3>And we will say some evil beast has </v>
<v Speaker 3>devoured him,</v>

1266
01:10:04.071 --> 01:10:08.060
<v Speaker 3>which would be true actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be the evil beast that's inside</v>

1267
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:11.270
<v Speaker 3>the brothers and we shall see what will </v>
<v Speaker 3>become of his dreams.</v>

1268
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's uh,</v>

1269
01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:17.860
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting too because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they want to spite themselves because</v>

1270
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:22.670
<v Speaker 3>maybe Joseph is something special and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they want to spite their farther,</v>

1271
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:26.930
<v Speaker 3>which is probably not the wisest idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they owe him some gratitude.</v>

1272
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:32.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he's acting like a pain in the </v>

1273
01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:32.050
<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some evidence for that,</v>

1274
01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:35.441
<v Speaker 3>but this is a little bit harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also want to spite God just </v>

1275
01:10:35.441 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Speaker 3>like Cain did because that's what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>

1276
01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.310
<v Speaker 3>We shall see what will become of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams,</v>

1277
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:42.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because then as soon as you're,</v>

1278
01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.880
<v Speaker 3>in some sense trying to fight against </v>
<v Speaker 3>the intuition of someone,</v>

1279
01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:48.410
<v Speaker 3>the natural intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone,</v>

1280
01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:53.411
<v Speaker 3>you've set yourself up against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of being itself and so pretty </v>

1281
01:10:53.841 --> 01:10:58.841
<v Speaker 3>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Reuben heard it and he delivered </v>

1282
01:10:58.841 --> 01:10:58.841
<v Speaker 3>them out of their hands and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1283
01:10:58.841 --> 01:11:00.230
<v Speaker 3>let us not kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Ruben said unto them,</v>

1284
01:11:00.231 --> 01:11:03.800
<v Speaker 3>shed no blood but cast him into this pit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's in the wilderness.</v>

1285
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:06.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like Reuben's the good guy in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1286
01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:12.460
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no water in the pit by the </v>

1287
01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.041
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lay no hand upon him that he might read </v>

1288
01:11:15.041 --> 01:11:15.041
<v Speaker 3>him out of their hands</v>

1289
01:11:15.041 --> 01:11:19.280
<v Speaker 2>to deliver him to his father again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Robin was actually trying to save him</v>

1290
01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.320
<v Speaker 2>steady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might read him out of their hands to </v>

1291
01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.251
<v Speaker 2>deliver them to his father again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it came to pass when Joseph came </v>

1292
01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:29.100
<v Speaker 2>unto his brethren that they stripped him</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his coat,</v>

1293
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:34.850
<v Speaker 2>his coat of many colors that was on him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they took him and cast him into a </v>

1294
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:36.810
<v Speaker 2>pit and the pit was empty and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>no water in it.</v>

1295
01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:46.770
<v Speaker 2>And then they sat down to eat bread and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifted up their eyes and looked and </v>

1296
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:49.531
<v Speaker 2>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a company of ishmaelites come came from </v>

1297
01:11:49.531 --> 01:11:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Gilead with their camels bearing spices </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bomb and murmur going to carry it </v>

1298
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.560
<v Speaker 2>down to Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Judah said unto his brother,</v>

1299
01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:57.730
<v Speaker 2>how does it profit us if we kill our </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother and conceal his blood?</v>

1300
01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:00.750
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the practical guy here.</v>

1301
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:05.770
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would we kill them when we can sell </v>

1302
01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:05.770
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1303
01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:10.350
<v Speaker 2>come let us sell him to the ishmaelites </v>
<v Speaker 2>and let not our hand be upon him for he </v>

1304
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:11.920
<v Speaker 2>is our brother and our flesh and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother and we're content.</v>

1305
01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Then they're passed by the midianites </v>
<v Speaker 2>merchantmen and they drew and lifted up </v>

1306
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:21.451
<v Speaker 2>Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver </v>

1307
01:12:21.451 --> 01:12:25.000
<v Speaker 2>to amount that echoes through into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

1308
01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:28.780
<v Speaker 2>And they brought Joseph into Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never really sure how these slavery</v>

1309
01:12:28.781 --> 01:12:30.450
<v Speaker 2>stories work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1310
01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.370
<v Speaker 2>so it's two 2,500,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3000 years ago,</v>

1311
01:12:33.371 --> 01:12:36.490
<v Speaker 2>and I decided I'm going to sell you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Israelites and that just works out.</v>

1312
01:12:36.491 --> 01:12:41.491
<v Speaker 2>They I get the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to be a slave and they take you </v>

1313
01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:44.221
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really understand how that </v>

1314
01:12:44.221 --> 01:12:45.961
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't figure out how people were just </v>

1315
01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.791
<v Speaker 2>selling each other all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But maybe if you're a family you can do </v>

1316
01:12:48.881 --> 01:12:49.030
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1317
01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:58.650
<v Speaker 2>So there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sold him and Rubin returned to the </v>

1318
01:12:58.691 --> 01:13:03.691
<v Speaker 2>pit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And behold Joseph was not there and </v>

1319
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:03.691
<v Speaker 2>Rubin rant is close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Rubin's very upset about this.</v>

1320
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:05.230
<v Speaker 2>And he returned unto his brothers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1321
01:13:05.231 --> 01:13:08.020
<v Speaker 2>the child is not in our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where shall I go?</v>

1322
01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:12.220
<v Speaker 2>And they conspired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took Joseph's coat and killed a kid</v>

1323
01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.230
<v Speaker 2>of the goats and dip the code in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood.</v>

1324
01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:17.320
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because blood is actually another color,</v>

1325
01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:20.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's got this coat of many colors and</v>

1326
01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:25.590
<v Speaker 2>blood is definitely a color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is the addition in some </v>

1327
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.370
<v Speaker 2>sense of the color of blood to Joseph's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coat.</v>

1328
01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:32.850
<v Speaker 2>And I would say it's probably a </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary color because I don't think </v>

1329
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:35.710
<v Speaker 2>that you're serious enough till your </v>
<v Speaker 2>code has been dipped in blood.</v>

1330
01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Now it can happen in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they sent the coat of many colors </v>

1331
01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.120
<v Speaker 2>and they brought it to their father and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1332
01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.260
<v Speaker 2>so they lied to him.</v>

1333
01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.850
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very nasty business.</v>

1334
01:13:45.851 --> 01:13:48.940
<v Speaker 2>This they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sell his son to slavery.</v>

1335
01:13:48.941 --> 01:13:51.610
<v Speaker 2>They claim that he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lie to them,</v>

1336
01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.970
<v Speaker 2>they put them into an extreme state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>grief.</v>

1337
01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:00.540
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of hatred underneath that </v>
<v Speaker 2>write a tremendous amount of hatred for </v>

1338
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Joseph and also for Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This we have found no.</v>

1339
01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Now whether it be thy son's coat or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he knew it,</v>

1340
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:10.930
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my son's coat and evil beast,</v>

1341
01:14:10.931 --> 01:14:14.290
<v Speaker 2>has him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph is without doubt,</v>

1342
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:19.291
<v Speaker 2>rent in pieces and Jacob Torres clothes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and put sackcloth on his loins and </v>

1343
01:14:19.291 --> 01:14:23.131
<v Speaker 2>mourned for many days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all his sons and daughters rose up </v>

1344
01:14:23.131 --> 01:14:23.131
<v Speaker 2>to comfort them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either refused to be comforted.</v>

1345
01:14:23.131 --> 01:14:25.150
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go down into my grave.</v>

1346
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my son does.</v>

1347
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:33.030
<v Speaker 2>His father wept for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's Jacob collapsing at the news </v>

1348
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:43.730
<v Speaker 2>and the midianites sold Joseph into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt,</v>

1349
01:14:43.731 --> 01:14:48.731
<v Speaker 2>onto Potiphar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an officer of Pharaohs and captain of </v>

1350
01:14:48.731 --> 01:14:48.731
<v Speaker 2>the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and</v>

1351
01:14:48.731 --> 01:14:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Potiphar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an officer of Pharaoh,</v>

1352
01:14:50.211 --> 01:14:53.180
<v Speaker 2>captain of the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Egyptian bought him of the hands</v>

1353
01:14:53.181 --> 01:14:55.340
<v Speaker 2>of the Ishmaelites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which had brought him down thither.</v>

1354
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.440
<v Speaker 2>So now he's a slave.</v>

1355
01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:00.810
<v Speaker 2>So now you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that would be,</v>

1356
01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.440
<v Speaker 2>this is a man who has a lot of reason to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be irritated out the structure of </v>

1357
01:15:06.601 --> 01:15:07.350
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1358
01:15:07.351 --> 01:15:11.280
<v Speaker 2>He's gone from being the favorite to </v>
<v Speaker 2>being betrayed by all of his brothers.</v>

1359
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:16.430
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he's been transformed into a </v>

1360
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:18.540
<v Speaker 2>slave and now he's being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's being sold to work as a slave.</v>

1361
01:15:18.541 --> 01:15:22.290
<v Speaker 2>So you'd think that that would corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 2>his character because you know,</v>

1362
01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.510
<v Speaker 2>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the case anyways,</v>

1363
01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:29.690
<v Speaker 2>I think people are always looking for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse to have their character </v>

1364
01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:30.330
<v Speaker 2>corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if your character is corrupted,</v>

1365
01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:35.360
<v Speaker 2>then you get to lie and you get to cheat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get to steal and you get to be </v>

1366
01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:35.370
<v Speaker 2>trained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to act resentfully and he get to</v>

1367
01:15:35.371 --> 01:15:40.371
<v Speaker 2>do nothing and that's all easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to lie than to tell the </v>

1368
01:15:40.371 --> 01:15:40.371
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

1369
01:15:40.371 --> 01:15:41.250
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to do nothing than to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1370
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:43.830
<v Speaker 2>So there's always part of you thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1371
01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:47.640
<v Speaker 2>I need a justification for being useless</v>
<v Speaker 2>and horrible because that.</v>

1372
01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:52.700
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a lot less work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then if something terrible comes </v>

1373
01:15:52.891 --> 01:15:54.260
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think a high.</v>

1374
01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.540
<v Speaker 2>That's just exactly the excuse that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was waiting for.</v>

1375
01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.380
<v Speaker 2>And then out all that comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1376
01:16:01.381 --> 01:16:06.381
<v Speaker 2>soldier should Ipsen when he was in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camps in Russia watching </v>

1377
01:16:06.381 --> 01:16:07.980
<v Speaker 2>how people behaved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1378
01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:12.981
<v Speaker 2>he said that there were people that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>put in the camps who immediately became </v>

1379
01:16:12.981 --> 01:16:16.491
<v Speaker 2>trustees are guards and they were even </v>
<v Speaker 2>more vicious than the people who had </v>

1380
01:16:16.491 --> 01:16:19.170
<v Speaker 2>been hired as guards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his idea was that they had collected</v>

1381
01:16:19.171 --> 01:16:22.870
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He called it fallenness,</v>

1382
01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.910
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly around them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal life,</v>

1383
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:29.640
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>express it.</v>

1384
01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:31.470
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as you gave them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>

1385
01:16:31.471 --> 01:16:33.060
<v Speaker 2>it was like there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was right away.</v>

1386
01:16:33.061 --> 01:16:38.061
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the messages that seems to </v>

1387
01:16:38.341 --> 01:16:43.341
<v Speaker 2>echo through these old testament stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that just because something terrible </v>

1388
01:16:43.681 --> 01:16:45.960
<v Speaker 2>happens to you doesn't mean that you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

1389
01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:50.840
<v Speaker 2>that you get to wander off the path and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make things worse.</v>

1390
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:55.370
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it doesn't matter how terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is that what happens to you,</v>

1391
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:57.650
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1392
01:16:57.651 --> 01:17:02.651
<v Speaker 2>because you see people now and then in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life who they've really got it rough </v>

1393
01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:03.260
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 50 bad things are happening to them</v>

1394
01:17:03.261 --> 01:17:04.520
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

1395
01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:09.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no wonder if you are bitter and </v>

1396
01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:09.730
<v Speaker 2>resentful and hostile and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1397
01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:13.990
<v Speaker 2>no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you meet people and socialize </v>

1398
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:16.550
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about this in the Gulag </v>

1399
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:17.921
<v Speaker 2>archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he met lots of people in not </v>

1400
01:17:17.921 --> 01:17:20.530
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He met enough people to impress him in </v>

1401
01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:22.850
<v Speaker 2>the concentration camp system who didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow their misfortunes to corrupt them.</v>

1402
01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:28.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's something man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because maybe the only real misfortune </v>

1403
01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.100
<v Speaker 2>is to become corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really useful thing to think,</v>

1404
01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the rest of it,</v>

1405
01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe the rest of it is trivial in </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison.</v>

1406
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:39.440
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a rough thing because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be in very harsh circumstances,</v>

1407
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:44.441
<v Speaker 2>but I do think there's something to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Lord was with Joseph and he was </v>

1408
01:17:44.441 --> 01:17:46.070
<v Speaker 2>a prosperous man and he was in the house</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his master.</v>

1409
01:17:46.071 --> 01:17:51.071
<v Speaker 2>The Egyptian and his master saw that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord was with him and the Lord made all </v>

1410
01:17:51.071 --> 01:17:54.881
<v Speaker 2>that he did to prosper in his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an echo of the idea that we </v>

1411
01:17:54.881 --> 01:17:55.040
<v Speaker 2>encountered earlier about walking with </v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

1412
01:17:55.070 --> 01:18:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Adam walked with God before he ate </v>

1413
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:03.310
<v Speaker 2>the fruit with eve and then he wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk with God and they had noah walked </v>

1414
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:05.180
<v Speaker 2>with God and Abraham walked with God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea is,</v>

1415
01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:10.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that alignment with the highest </v>

1416
01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:10.420
<v Speaker 2>ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's something like that.</v>

1417
01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:14.260
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could think about that as a </v>

1418
01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.230
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical claim as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it is.</v>

1419
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:20.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got thousands of letters now in the</v>

1420
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:24.170
<v Speaker 2>last year from people who have told me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were in a pit.</v>

1421
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:30.490
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they decided that they were </v>

1422
01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:33.860
<v Speaker 2>going to try to put their lives together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that it worked,</v>

1423
01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.090
<v Speaker 2>and so that's really something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1424
01:18:37.091 --> 01:18:38.660
<v Speaker 2>and they write surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1425
01:18:38.661 --> 01:18:43.661
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decided that I was going to work hard </v>

1426
01:18:43.661 --> 01:18:45.911
<v Speaker 2>at what I was doing and I wasn't going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lie any more than absolutely </v>

1427
01:18:45.911 --> 01:18:48.791
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I'd give it a try for a few </v>

1428
01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:48.791
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1429
01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:49.250
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of good things started to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1430
01:18:49.251 --> 01:18:54.251
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like maybe that's how the world </v>

1431
01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:56.921
<v Speaker 2>works now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it doesn't work like that all </v>

1432
01:18:56.921 --> 01:18:56.921
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1433
01:18:56.921 --> 01:18:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Because you can get sliced off at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees.</v>

1434
01:18:57.531 --> 01:19:02.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's an arbitrary element to </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence that's that you can't wish </v>

1435
01:19:02.531 --> 01:19:06.740
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that there are.</v>

1436
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that there aren't bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies and good strategies and so I </v>

1437
01:19:13.581 --> 01:19:18.581
<v Speaker 2>do think that one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental existential questions is </v>

1438
01:19:18.581 --> 01:19:21.791
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if things aren't going well for you in </v>

1439
01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:24.041
<v Speaker 2>your life is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you absolutely certain that you're </v>

1440
01:19:24.041 --> 01:19:24.320
<v Speaker 2>doing absolutely everything you can to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put things in order?</v>

1441
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you shouldn't complain because you </v>

1442
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:32.531
<v Speaker 2>don't know to what degree you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually contributing or even causing </v>

1443
01:19:32.531 --> 01:19:32.810
<v Speaker 2>the circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1444
01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:36.200
<v Speaker 2>that's a very annoying thing to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not trying to blame the victim.</v>

1445
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:41.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that people end up with lung </v>

1446
01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:41.410
<v Speaker 2>cancer because they were exposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>asbestos,</v>

1447
01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:41.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to.</v>

1448
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Although I also know too that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have lung cancer because you've been </v>

1449
01:19:47.230 --> 01:19:48.560
<v Speaker 2>exposed to asbestos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be a tragedy or it can be hell.</v>

1450
01:19:48.561 --> 01:19:51.170
<v Speaker 2>And to some degree that depends on how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you conduct yourself.</v>

1451
01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:56.680
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's pretty gloomy </v>

1452
01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:56.680
<v Speaker 2>possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1453
01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.970
<v Speaker 2>But so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Joseph as a slave,</v>

1454
01:19:58.971 --> 01:20:03.971
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hasn't sacrifice the integrity of his</v>

1455
01:20:04.221 --> 01:20:07.230
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it turns out that being it out,</v>

1456
01:20:07.231 --> 01:20:12.231
<v Speaker 2>that he's not asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that everyone around him </v>

1457
01:20:12.231 --> 01:20:12.240
<v Speaker 2>thinks he's a slave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not.</v>

1458
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:17.700
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a goodly person and well favored.</v>

1459
01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's a good guy and he's an </v>

1460
01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:25.461
<v Speaker 2>impressive specimen as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty interesting given the </v>

1461
01:20:25.461 --> 01:20:26.790
<v Speaker 2>current political climate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1462
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.360
<v Speaker 2>and it came to pass after these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that his master's wife cast her eyes </v>

1463
01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.750
<v Speaker 2>upon Joseph and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie with me.</v>

1464
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:36.450
<v Speaker 2>That means that actually has two </v>
<v Speaker 2>meanings,</v>

1465
01:20:36.451 --> 01:20:41.451
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he refused and said unto his </v>

1466
01:20:44.441 --> 01:20:45.820
<v Speaker 2>master's wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behold,</v>

1467
01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:50.850
<v Speaker 2>my master does not know what's with me </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the house and he's committed all that</v>

1468
01:20:52.121 --> 01:20:57.121
<v Speaker 2>he has to my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no one greater in this house </v>

1469
01:20:57.121 --> 01:21:01.291
<v Speaker 2>than I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neither has he kept back anything from </v>

1470
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:04.690
<v Speaker 2>me but you because you are his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How then can I do this great wickedness,</v>

1471
01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.820
<v Speaker 2>wickedness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sin against God.</v>

1472
01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:15.060
<v Speaker 2>And it came to pass that she speak to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Day by day that he harkened not </v>

1473
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:17.890
<v Speaker 2>unto her to lie by her or be with her </v>
<v Speaker 2>being sexually harassed.</v>

1474
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it came to pass.</v>

1475
01:21:20.690 --> 01:21:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1476
01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.600
<v Speaker 2>it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1477
01:21:22.601 --> 01:21:27.601
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the painting and it came to pass</v>

1478
01:21:31.691 --> 01:21:36.691
<v Speaker 2>about this time that Joseph went into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the house to do his business and there </v>

1479
01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:36.790
<v Speaker 2>was none of the men of the house they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>within.</v>

1480
01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.240
<v Speaker 2>And she caught him by his garment saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie with me,</v>

1481
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:44.050
<v Speaker 2>and he left his garment in her hand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fled and got him out.</v>

1482
01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of embarrassing for poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph,</v>

1483
01:21:47.591 --> 01:21:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a bit on the suspicious side.</v>

1484
01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And it came to pass when she saw that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had left his garment in her hand and was</v>

1485
01:21:54.911 --> 01:21:59.911
<v Speaker 2>fled forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she called unto the men of her </v>

1486
01:21:59.911 --> 01:21:59.911
<v Speaker 2>house and spake unto them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

1487
01:21:59.911 --> 01:22:01.440
<v Speaker 2>see he hath brought into Hebrew </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>

1488
01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.430
<v Speaker 2>He came in unto me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie with me,</v>

1489
01:22:03.431 --> 01:22:08.431
<v Speaker 2>and I cried with a loud voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it Hell hath no fury like a </v>

1490
01:22:09.761 --> 01:22:13.750
<v Speaker 2>woman scorned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the proper commentary on that.</v>

1491
01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:18.780
<v Speaker 2>And it came to pass when he heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lifted up my voice and cried that he </v>

1492
01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.570
<v Speaker 2>left his garment with me and fled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>got himself out.</v>

1493
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:23.680
<v Speaker 2>And it came to pass when his master </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard the words of his wife.</v>

1494
01:22:23.681 --> 01:22:25.780
<v Speaker 2>So that's the Faro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he spake unto him,</v>

1495
01:22:25.781 --> 01:22:28.690
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after this manner did thy servant to me,</v>

1496
01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.170
<v Speaker 2>his wrath was kindled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Joseph's master took him and put him</v>

1497
01:22:32.171 --> 01:22:37.171
<v Speaker 2>in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A place where the king's prisoners were </v>

1498
01:22:37.171 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were bound and he was there in the </v>

1499
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1500
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:43.021
<v Speaker 2>that sort of socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like first his brothers betray him </v>

1501
01:22:43.021 --> 01:22:45.670
<v Speaker 2>and throw him in a pit and then he gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>made a slave,</v>

1502
01:22:45.671 --> 01:22:49.060
<v Speaker 2>which is probably better than being in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pit and then he becomes sort of like</v>

1503
01:22:49.061 --> 01:22:49.850
<v Speaker 2>king slave.</v>

1504
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:52.900
<v Speaker 2>So that's working out pretty well and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now someone lies about him.</v>

1505
01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:56.050
<v Speaker 2>He gets betrayed again and now it's into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prison with them and so it's this.</v>

1506
01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.550
<v Speaker 2>It's this again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1507
01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:02.640
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sisyphus up with the Rock and then </v>

1508
01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.300
<v Speaker 2>down and its order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>

1509
01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:07.120
<v Speaker 2>order chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to think,</v>

1510
01:23:07.121 --> 01:23:08.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you the order?</v>

1511
01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Are you the chaos or you the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's moving between them because </v>

1512
01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 2>that's the right thing to be because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you're just ordering.</v>

1513
01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:19.390
<v Speaker 2>That's a really bad idea or you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and that's a really bad idea.</v>

1514
01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:24.700
<v Speaker 2>You can be the thing that's dynamically </v>
<v Speaker 2>mediating between them and that's what </v>

1515
01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:29.611
<v Speaker 2>he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Lord was with Joseph and showed </v>

1516
01:23:29.611 --> 01:23:31.480
<v Speaker 2>him mercy and gave him favor in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sight of the keeper of the prison.</v>

1517
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:34.090
<v Speaker 2>That's no easy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think,</v>

1518
01:23:34.091 --> 01:23:39.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're thrown in prison and </v>

1519
01:23:39.091 --> 01:23:39.091
<v Speaker 2>now the jailer likes you.</v>

1520
01:23:39.091 --> 01:23:43.390
<v Speaker 2>How exactly are you going to manage that</v>
<v Speaker 2>much good thing to think about because </v>

1521
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.390
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1522
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:48.390
<v Speaker 2>if you are really in dire straits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it that you should conduct </v>

1523
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:51.421
<v Speaker 2>yourself so that you have the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability of having things work out </v>

1524
01:23:51.421 --> 01:23:52.390
<v Speaker 2>and it's not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1525
01:23:52.630 --> 01:23:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Joseph took over the thumb screw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1526
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:58.840
<v Speaker 2>and started using that on the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoners that that's not the indication</v>

1527
01:23:58.841 --> 01:24:00.700
<v Speaker 2>here at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that he's doing something.</v>

1528
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:06.030
<v Speaker 2>He's acting like a person who isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoner even though he's in the prison,</v>

1529
01:24:06.491 --> 01:24:09.700
<v Speaker 2>just like he was acting like someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a slave when he was a slave,</v>

1530
01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:15.360
<v Speaker 2>and so it makes you wonder who you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be despite the fact that other people </v>

1531
01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:22.700
<v Speaker 2>think that you're whatever you appear to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

1532
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.970
<v Speaker 2>And the keeper of the prison committed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Joseph's hand.</v>

1533
01:24:25.971 --> 01:24:30.971
<v Speaker 2>All the prisoners that were in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison and whatsoever they did there he </v>

1534
01:24:30.971 --> 01:24:34.121
<v Speaker 2>was the doer of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The keeper of the prison look not to </v>

1535
01:24:34.121 --> 01:24:36.821
<v Speaker 2>anything that was under his hand because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Lord was with him and that which he </v>

1536
01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:36.821
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Lord made it to prosper.</v>

1537
01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:44.640
<v Speaker 2>So it's a repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a repeat of exactly what happened </v>

1538
01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.950
<v Speaker 2>when he was the slave of the pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except it's one rung deeper into hell,</v>

1539
01:24:47.951 --> 01:24:48.880
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1540
01:24:48.881 --> 01:24:50.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's slave pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adherence,</v>

1541
01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:51.910
<v Speaker 2>prisoner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail,</v>

1542
01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:53.560
<v Speaker 2>master.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't matter.</v>

1543
01:24:53.561 --> 01:24:58.561
<v Speaker 2>The same thing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now Joseph has imprisoned and the </v>

1544
01:24:58.561 --> 01:25:01.651
<v Speaker 2>Pharaoh has a fit one day of peak and </v>
<v Speaker 2>throws the chief of his Butler's into </v>

1545
01:25:01.651 --> 01:25:05.881
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the chief of his bakers and they </v>

1546
01:25:05.881 --> 01:25:05.881
<v Speaker 2>have a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each of them.</v>

1547
01:25:05.881 --> 01:25:05.881
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1548
01:25:07.210 --> 01:25:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Joseph interprets the dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be something that he can do.</v>

1549
01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:16.410
<v Speaker 2>And he tells the Butler that history </v>
<v Speaker 2>means that the fair was going to forgive</v>

1550
01:25:18.941 --> 01:25:23.941
<v Speaker 2>him and put him back in his position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he tells the baker that the Pharaoh </v>

1551
01:25:23.941 --> 01:25:26.770
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to forgive him and that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to take off his head and hang them</v>

1552
01:25:26.771 --> 01:25:29.950
<v Speaker 2>in a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is rather rough dream.</v>

1553
01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:31.930
<v Speaker 2>But that is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens.</v>

1554
01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:37.230
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the baker or the Butler goes free </v>

1555
01:25:37.230 --> 01:25:37.230
<v Speaker 2>and Joseph says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1556
01:25:37.230 --> 01:25:41.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could just keep in mind the </v>

1557
01:25:41.341 --> 01:25:43.261
<v Speaker 2>fact that I did do a bit of a favor here</v>
<v Speaker 2>and told you something that was </v>

1558
01:25:43.261 --> 01:25:47.761
<v Speaker 2>accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the chief didn't really remember </v>

1559
01:25:47.761 --> 01:25:47.761
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

1560
01:25:47.761 --> 01:25:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Once he was freed interpreting dreams in</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison,</v>

1561
01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:59.340
<v Speaker 2>and so now the pharaoh has a dream and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually asked to dreams.</v>

1562
01:25:59.491 --> 01:26:01.530
<v Speaker 2>So it's another one of those doubled </v>
<v Speaker 2>motifs.</v>

1563
01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:06.531
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is these are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important dreams because they came in a </v>

1564
01:26:06.531 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 2>pair and behold there came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>river seven well favored kind and fat </v>

1565
01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:14.450
<v Speaker 2>flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So cattle and they fed in the meadow.</v>

1566
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Meadow and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven other cattle came up after the </v>

1567
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:21.290
<v Speaker 2>motor of the river ill favored and lean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fleshed,</v>

1568
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:25.190
<v Speaker 2>starving and stood by the other cows on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brink of the river.</v>

1569
01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:30.340
<v Speaker 2>And the ill favored and lean fleshed </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind did eat up the seven well favored </v>

1570
01:26:30.741 --> 01:26:34.460
<v Speaker 2>and fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So feral it woke fair enough.</v>

1571
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:39.461
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty nasty dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he has another dream to two </v>

1572
01:26:39.461 --> 01:26:42.560
<v Speaker 2>headed home and he slept and dreamt the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second time.</v>

1573
01:26:42.561 --> 01:26:47.561
<v Speaker 2>And behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven years of corn came up upon one </v>

1574
01:26:47.561 --> 01:26:50.321
<v Speaker 2>stock rank and good and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven thin years and blasted with the </v>

1575
01:26:50.321 --> 01:26:54.900
<v Speaker 2>east wind sprung up after them and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventh thin yours devoured the seven </v>

1576
01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:58.901
<v Speaker 2>rank and full years and pharaoh woke and</v>
<v Speaker 2>beheld it was a dream and then it says a</v>

1577
01:26:59.151 --> 01:27:02.840
<v Speaker 2>little later and for that the dream was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doubled unto Pharaoh twice.</v>

1578
01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:07.900
<v Speaker 2>It is because the thing is established </v>
<v Speaker 2>by God and God will shortly bring it to </v>

1579
01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:11.231
<v Speaker 2>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because one of the </v>

1580
01:27:11.231 --> 01:27:14.231
<v Speaker 2>better theories about dreams is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're part of the way that the right </v>

1581
01:27:14.231 --> 01:27:16.580
<v Speaker 2>and left hemisphere communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe the nonverbal part of the brain</v>

1582
01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:19.220
<v Speaker 2>communicates with the verbal brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>verbal part of the brain,</v>

1583
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:24.760
<v Speaker 2>and so the nonverbal part of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is less differentiated and things </v>

1584
01:27:26.061 --> 01:27:29.750
<v Speaker 2>more globally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is looking for patterns and anomalies in</v>

1585
01:27:29.751 --> 01:27:34.751
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that don't fit well with the </v>

1586
01:27:34.751 --> 01:27:34.760
<v Speaker 2>current way of conceptualizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1587
01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Things that make you anxious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncertain,</v>

1588
01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:38.780
<v Speaker 2>and those are things you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>mastered,</v>

1589
01:27:38.781 --> 01:27:43.781
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't fit well into your </v>

1590
01:27:43.781 --> 01:27:43.781
<v Speaker 2>conception of realization of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>by definition.</v>

1591
01:27:43.781 --> 01:27:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Because if you had mastered them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't make you anxious,</v>

1592
01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:51.110
<v Speaker 2>nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the the nonverbal parts of your </v>

1593
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:54.401
<v Speaker 2>brain or like an alarm system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're looking around for places where </v>

1594
01:27:54.401 --> 01:27:57.221
<v Speaker 2>you're probably wrong and then they put </v>
<v Speaker 2>those in images and try to conceptualize</v>

1595
01:27:58.191 --> 01:28:02.090
<v Speaker 2>them so that you can update your model </v>
<v Speaker 2>of reality to take them into account,</v>

1596
01:28:02.091 --> 01:28:04.580
<v Speaker 2>but that also produces a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion,</v>

1597
01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.760
<v Speaker 2>especially at night and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we know that we know if you deprive </v>

1598
01:28:12.891 --> 01:28:15.590
<v Speaker 2>people of dreams that they go insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>

1599
01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:18.830
<v Speaker 2>Animals as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary part of mental equilibrium.</v>

1600
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:23.330
<v Speaker 2>The way you do that with rats in case </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to know is that you've got rats</v>

1601
01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:25.190
<v Speaker 2>that you want to drive and saying this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is how you do it.</v>

1602
01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:30.290
<v Speaker 2>So you put the rat on a like a pedestal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty small.</v>

1603
01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.470
<v Speaker 2>And then when he fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's surrounded by water and then when</v>

1604
01:28:33.471 --> 01:28:35.870
<v Speaker 2>he falls asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his nose hits the water.</v>

1605
01:28:35.871 --> 01:28:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Then he wakes up and so you can deprive </v>
<v Speaker 2>the route of sleep and that doesn't.</v>

1606
01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:43.400
<v Speaker 2>The rats don't respond to that very well</v>
<v Speaker 2>after some period of time.</v>

1607
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:48.230
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the ways that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been discovered,</v>

1608
01:28:48.231 --> 01:28:53.231
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dream does seem to be an update </v>

1609
01:28:53.231 --> 01:28:53.231
<v Speaker 2>mechanism and so if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1610
01:28:53.231 --> 01:28:55.430
<v Speaker 2>if you have a very powerful dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a nightmare,</v>

1611
01:28:55.550 --> 01:29:00.550
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's repeating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like something is trying to hammer </v>

1612
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:03.431
<v Speaker 2>on the door that needs to be let in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>often you don't know how to let it in </v>

1613
01:29:03.431 --> 01:29:04.170
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>

1614
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:09.710
<v Speaker 2>So then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he had talked to his,</v>

1615
01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.170
<v Speaker 2>his butler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they brought them hastily out of the</v>

1616
01:29:13.171 --> 01:29:18.171
<v Speaker 2>dungeon and Joseph shaved himself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed his clothes and came in unto </v>

1617
01:29:18.171 --> 01:29:22.161
<v Speaker 2>Pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he didn't want to shock pharaoh </v>

1618
01:29:22.161 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 2>with how people dressed in a prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Pharaoh said Unto Joseph,</v>

1619
01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I've dreamed a dream and there's none </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can interpret it.</v>

1620
01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I've heard safety that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand a dream to interpret it.</v>

1621
01:29:28.951 --> 01:29:30.780
<v Speaker 2>And Joseph said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not me.</v>

1622
01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:34.560
<v Speaker 2>God will give Pharaoh announcer of </v>
<v Speaker 2>peace.</v>

1623
01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:39.210
<v Speaker 2>It's so Jacob isn't taking credit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>his ability to interpret dreams,</v>

1624
01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:41.280
<v Speaker 2>which also indicates quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>

1625
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:42.650
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing to,</v>

1626
01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.810
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that he's successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and competent,</v>

1627
01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:49.080
<v Speaker 2>he's not narcissistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he happens to have this gift,</v>

1628
01:29:49.081 --> 01:29:52.440
<v Speaker 2>he regards it as a gift and not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you.</v>

1629
01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:57.700
<v Speaker 2>He renounced his favorites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just something that he happens to be </v>

1630
01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:57.700
<v Speaker 2>able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's,</v>

1631
01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:02.300
<v Speaker 2>that's a hallmark of someone who's got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty well put together personality as </v>

1632
01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:06.471
<v Speaker 2>far as I'm concerned because you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have gifts that they didn't </v>

1633
01:30:06.871 --> 01:30:08.730
<v Speaker 2>really earn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those will be your talents,</v>

1634
01:30:08.731 --> 01:30:13.731
<v Speaker 2>your intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your good looks if you happen to have </v>

1635
01:30:13.731 --> 01:30:13.731
<v Speaker 2>good looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1636
01:30:13.731 --> 01:30:17.750
<v Speaker 2>And they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no sense being All puffed up </v>

1637
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:18.540
<v Speaker 2>about that because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

1638
01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:23.541
<v Speaker 2>It's luck of the draw though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the proper attitude is to note that </v>

1639
01:30:23.541 --> 01:30:24.270
<v Speaker 2>it's luck of the draw and to be grateful</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

1640
01:30:30.850 --> 01:30:35.850
<v Speaker 2>It's quite a fine painting that one hold</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1641
01:30:36.971 --> 01:30:41.971
<v Speaker 2>Come seven years of great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty throughout the island of Egypt </v>

1642
01:30:41.971 --> 01:30:43.090
<v Speaker 2>and then there shall arise after seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of famine and all the plenti shall</v>

1643
01:30:43.091 --> 01:30:48.091
<v Speaker 2>be forgotten and the famine shall </v>
<v Speaker 2>consume the land and the plenty shall </v>

1644
01:30:48.091 --> 01:30:51.751
<v Speaker 2>not be known in the land by reason of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that famine following for it shall be </v>

1645
01:30:51.751 --> 01:30:51.751
<v Speaker 2>very grievous.</v>

1646
01:30:54.130 --> 01:30:56.230
<v Speaker 2>So now we see to that jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1647
01:30:56.231 --> 01:30:58.900
<v Speaker 2>he can interpret dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also the sort of person who can</v>

1648
01:30:58.901 --> 01:31:03.901
<v Speaker 2>look into the future and think this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of what adam was called on to do </v>

1649
01:31:03.901 --> 01:31:08.790
<v Speaker 2>when he got kicked out of the garden of </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradise is you're going to be able to </v>

1650
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:12.421
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize that even if things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going well now that that doesn't mean </v>

1651
01:31:12.421 --> 01:31:13.300
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to go well into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

1652
01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:18.660
<v Speaker 2>And so he's The ant and the grasshopper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the grasshopper and the ants </v>

1653
01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.080
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything's good,</v>

1654
01:31:20.081 --> 01:31:25.081
<v Speaker 2>but you should wake the hell up and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should test to see how things can go </v>

1655
01:31:25.081 --> 01:31:28.390
<v Speaker 2>wrong and you can see if your systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>can survive them.</v>

1656
01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Things going wrong and which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I think we could all </v>

1657
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:38.130
<v Speaker 2>harken tube because I think we do a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad job in the modern world of testing </v>

1658
01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:41.671
<v Speaker 2>to see if our systems can go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1659
01:31:42.891 --> 01:31:47.891
<v Speaker 2>So the pharaoh was pretty impressed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>this dream interpretation and pretty </v>

1660
01:31:47.891 --> 01:31:47.900
<v Speaker 2>worried about it and I guess he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable person,</v>

1661
01:31:47.901 --> 01:31:49.910
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that he put joseph in </v>
<v Speaker 2>jail,</v>

1662
01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:50.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gifts.</v>

1663
01:31:51.010 --> 01:31:53.840
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have much choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now therefore,</v>

1664
01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:58.550
<v Speaker 2>let pharaoh look for a man discreet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wise and set him over the land of Egypt.</v>

1665
01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Let pharaoh do this and let him appoint </v>
<v Speaker 2>officers over the land.</v>

1666
01:32:01.721 --> 01:32:06.721
<v Speaker 2>This is what joseph was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take up the fifth part of the land </v>

1667
01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:07.990
<v Speaker 2>of Egypt in the seven plenteous years</v>

1668
01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:15.810
<v Speaker 2>and let them gather all the food of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those good years that come and lay up </v>

1669
01:32:15.810 --> 01:32:16.450
<v Speaker 2>corn under the hand of pharaoh and let </v>
<v Speaker 2>them keep food in the cities</v>

1670
01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.400
<v Speaker 2>and just like that joseph has restored </v>
<v Speaker 2>to his position.</v>

1671
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:25.900
<v Speaker 2>So pharaoh said unto joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am pharaoh,</v>

1672
01:32:25.901 --> 01:32:30.901
<v Speaker 2>and without these shall no man lifted up</v>
<v Speaker 2>his hand or foot in all of the land of </v>

1673
01:32:30.901 --> 01:32:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he comes out of the prison and he</v>

1674
01:32:34.151 --> 01:32:35.500
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>

1675
01:32:35.501 --> 01:32:40.501
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually occupies a position that's </v>

1676
01:32:40.501 --> 01:32:41.890
<v Speaker 2>higher than the position of the pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how you look at it because</v>

1677
01:32:41.891 --> 01:32:44.560
<v Speaker 2>the pharaoh is relegated himself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ceremonial status,</v>

1678
01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:47.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph has all the responsibility,</v>

1679
01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:49.510
<v Speaker 2>makes all the decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So defacto,</v>

1680
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:53.410
<v Speaker 2>he's the pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't get the glory precisely,</v>

1681
01:32:53.411 --> 01:32:55.180
<v Speaker 2>although he's not doing too bad for </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

1682
01:32:55.420 --> 01:33:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a lesson in that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote these rules for corp a long time</v>

1683
01:33:00.881 --> 01:33:03.580
<v Speaker 2>ago and one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have written them into this,</v>

1684
01:33:03.670 --> 01:33:06.250
<v Speaker 2>some of them into this book you guys got</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pamphlet about today.</v>

1685
01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:08.380
<v Speaker 2>One of the rules that I didn't write </v>
<v Speaker 2>about was,</v>

1686
01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:14.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>note that responsive it note that </v>

1687
01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:15.310
<v Speaker 2>opportunity lurks where responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been abdicated,</v>

1688
01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:17.680
<v Speaker 2>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1689
01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:20.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people in their jobs,</v>

1690
01:33:20.051 --> 01:33:21.040
<v Speaker 2>they say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1691
01:33:21.041 --> 01:33:24.760
<v Speaker 2>my guy worked with doesn't do any work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1692
01:33:24.761 --> 01:33:25.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do it.</v>

1693
01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's limits to that,</v>

1694
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:31.720
<v Speaker 2>but one of their things you can do at </v>
<v Speaker 2>work is make yourself indispensable.</v>

1695
01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might get the cane types against you</v>

1696
01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:40.290
<v Speaker 2>if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something to be said for </v>

1697
01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:42.541
<v Speaker 2>being indispensable because when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to be dispensed with you probably </v>

1698
01:33:42.581 --> 01:33:44.740
<v Speaker 2>won't be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or even If you are,</v>

1699
01:33:44.741 --> 01:33:47.830
<v Speaker 2>then the fact that you're indispensable </v>
<v Speaker 2>just means you can go somewhere else and</v>

1700
01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:50.530
<v Speaker 2>be indispensable there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's just as useful.</v>

1701
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:55.950
<v Speaker 2>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to permanently put down </v>

1702
01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:02.100
<v Speaker 2>someone who's really good at doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things because they can just go off and </v>

1703
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:06.151
<v Speaker 2>do them somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways that you get like </v>

1704
01:34:06.151 --> 01:34:09.241
<v Speaker 2>that is to take responsibility when </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else is failing to do so and you</v>

1705
01:34:09.941 --> 01:34:10.330
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1706
01:34:10.331 --> 01:34:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

1707
01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Another way of thinking about it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh good,</v>

1708
01:34:14.681 --> 01:34:15.640
<v Speaker 2>I get to do that.</v>

1709
01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:21.250
<v Speaker 2>And the seven years of plenty isness </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was in the land of Egypt were ended</v>

1710
01:34:21.251 --> 01:34:25.060
<v Speaker 2>in the seven years of dearth began to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come according as joseph has said.</v>

1711
01:34:27.190 --> 01:34:29.890
<v Speaker 2>And the dearth was in all the lands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1712
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:32.320
<v Speaker 2>that's an archetypal story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1713
01:34:32.890 --> 01:34:35.440
<v Speaker 2>The archetypal story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the business cycle story.</v>

1714
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a little harsher when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>starving,</v>

1715
01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:39.790
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the point.</v>

1716
01:34:39.791 --> 01:34:44.791
<v Speaker 2>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that sometimes things are getting </v>

1717
01:34:44.791 --> 01:34:47.791
<v Speaker 2>good and sometimes things are getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad and that's you can be sure that </v>

1718
01:34:47.791 --> 01:34:49.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the case that's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

1719
01:34:49.031 --> 01:34:54.031
<v Speaker 2>And so the wise person takes stock of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that things are going to get </v>

1720
01:34:54.521 --> 01:34:59.521
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this is the same thing that happens </v>

1721
01:34:59.521 --> 01:35:01.921
<v Speaker 2>with noah?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like assume the flood because it's </v>

1722
01:35:01.921 --> 01:35:02.870
<v Speaker 2>going to happen and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1723
01:35:02.871 --> 01:35:05.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a hell of a world that has floods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not if you have a boat,</v>

1724
01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:09.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps a lot.</v>

1725
01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:10.640
<v Speaker 2>If if there's a flood and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boat,</v>

1726
01:35:10.641 --> 01:35:14.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like you can float on the flood and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not such a problem,</v>

1727
01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:19.540
<v Speaker 2>and so if you refuse to look out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that things are going to be going </v>

1728
01:35:22.551 --> 01:35:26.180
<v Speaker 2>downhill badly and that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in a pit at some point,</v>

1729
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:30.920
<v Speaker 2>you and your family perhaps then when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

1730
01:35:30.921 --> 01:35:35.921
<v Speaker 2>it will be as bad as it possibly can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're awake and alert to that </v>

1731
01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:40.070
<v Speaker 2>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can mitigate it.</v>

1732
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:48.200
<v Speaker 2>And the dearth was in all the lands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the land of Egypt there was bread</v>

1733
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:53.530
<v Speaker 2>and when the land of Egypt was famished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people cried to pharaoh for bread </v>

1734
01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:54.320
<v Speaker 2>and pharaoh said unto the egyptians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to joseph.</v>

1735
01:35:54.710 --> 01:35:55.730
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says to you too,</v>

1736
01:35:55.731 --> 01:35:59.090
<v Speaker 2>do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fireman was all over the face of</v>

1737
01:35:59.091 --> 01:35:59.980
<v Speaker 2>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And joe boo,</v>

1738
01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.990
<v Speaker 2>joseph opened up the store houses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sold to the egyptians,</v>

1739
01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:07.070
<v Speaker 2>and the feminine waxed sore in the land </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Egypt and all the countries came into</v>

1740
01:36:07.071 --> 01:36:12.071
<v Speaker 2>Egypt to buy to joseph to buy corn </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the famine was soaring all the </v>

1741
01:36:12.921 --> 01:36:15.110
<v Speaker 2>lands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1742
01:36:15.111 --> 01:36:17.480
<v Speaker 2>when jacob saw that there was corn in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt,</v>

1743
01:36:17.690 --> 01:36:22.690
<v Speaker 2>jacob said unto his sons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you standing around looking at </v>

1744
01:36:22.690 --> 01:36:22.790
<v Speaker 2>each other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1745
01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that there's corn in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get down there and I from a buyer for us</v>

1746
01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:30.260
<v Speaker 2>so that we may live and not die.</v>

1747
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:35.410
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty straightforward advice that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And joseph's 10 brothers went down to </v>

1748
01:36:35.661 --> 01:36:38.450
<v Speaker 2>buy corn in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but benjamin,</v>

1749
01:36:38.451 --> 01:36:40.520
<v Speaker 2>joseph's brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the youngest one,</v>

1750
01:36:40.521 --> 01:36:41.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only one left.</v>

1751
01:36:41.511 --> 01:36:43.820
<v Speaker 2>That's the one that was younger than </v>
<v Speaker 2>joseph.</v>

1752
01:36:43.821 --> 01:36:47.240
<v Speaker 2>The only youngest one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also rachel's other son.</v>

1753
01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:52.480
<v Speaker 2>But Jeff Benjamin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joseph's brother jacob didn't send </v>

1754
01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.890
<v Speaker 2>because he was worried that something </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad would happen to him,</v>

1755
01:36:54.891 --> 01:36:59.891
<v Speaker 2>which kind of indicates to me that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>jacob was a bit suspicious about what </v>

1756
01:36:59.891 --> 01:37:04.241
<v Speaker 2>had happened to joseph the last time he </v>
<v Speaker 2>sent all the brothers on a adventure.</v>

1757
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Joseph was the governor over all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>land and and he,</v>

1758
01:37:09.111 --> 01:37:14.111
<v Speaker 2>It was that sold to all the people of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the land in joseph's brothers came and </v>

1759
01:37:14.111 --> 01:37:15.350
<v Speaker 2>bowed down themselves before him with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their faces to the earth.</v>

1760
01:37:15.710 --> 01:37:19.520
<v Speaker 2>While there's the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is too,</v>

1761
01:37:19.521 --> 01:37:24.521
<v Speaker 2>is that one question you have in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is who should you bow down to?</v>

1762
01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:30.700
<v Speaker 2>And you might say no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not exactly the right answer </v>

1763
01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:34.361
<v Speaker 2>because that means that you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an ideal because you bow down to your </v>

1764
01:37:34.361 --> 01:37:34.361
<v Speaker 2>ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it an ideal.</v>

1765
01:37:34.361 --> 01:37:36.650
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't have an ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what the hell are you going to do?</v>

1766
01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:40.730
<v Speaker 2>So you have to bow down to something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens here as well,</v>

1767
01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:46.780
<v Speaker 2>the brothers are bowing down to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who is so bloody resilient and </v>

1768
01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:50.201
<v Speaker 2>competent that they can take themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a prison and become the ruler of </v>

1769
01:37:50.201 --> 01:37:51.890
<v Speaker 2>the land that happened to vaclav havel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in czechoslovakia.</v>

1770
01:37:51.891 --> 01:37:53.600
<v Speaker 2>It also happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1771
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 2>mandela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Africa,</v>

1772
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:59.640
<v Speaker 2>like these things actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really something.</v>

1773
01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:04.760
<v Speaker 2>So you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god only knows what you might learn in </v>

1774
01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:04.760
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1775
01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:10.620
<v Speaker 2>so they bow down to joseph and properly </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know he's,</v>

1776
01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:15.800
<v Speaker 2>he is even without his coat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still the person with a coat of </v>

1777
01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.610
<v Speaker 2>many colors and joseph saw his brothers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he knew them,</v>

1778
01:38:17.611 --> 01:38:19.500
<v Speaker 2>but he made themselves strange onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1779
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:22.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a number of years have passed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he spoke roughly onto the mini,</v>

1780
01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.480
<v Speaker 2>said down to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you Come from?</v>

1781
01:38:24.481 --> 01:38:27.600
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the land of canaan to buy food.</v>

1782
01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:31.080
<v Speaker 2>And joseph knew whose brothers were but </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know who he was</v>

1783
01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:38.960
<v Speaker 2>and they came back to jacob their father</v>
<v Speaker 2>and told him all that and said,</v>

1784
01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:42.530
<v Speaker 2>the man who is lord of the country spoke</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly to us and took us for spies.</v>

1785
01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:44.600
<v Speaker 2>And we said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1786
01:38:44.690 --> 01:38:46.250
<v Speaker 2>we're true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1787
01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Honest man were not spies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We be 12 brothers,</v>

1788
01:38:49.161 --> 01:38:51.410
<v Speaker 2>sons of our fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is not.</v>

1789
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:55.190
<v Speaker 2>And the youngest is this day with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>father in the land of canaan.</v>

1790
01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:00.380
<v Speaker 2>And the man said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how I'll know that you're honest,</v>

1791
01:39:00.381 --> 01:39:05.381
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leave one of the brothers here with me </v>

1792
01:39:05.381 --> 01:39:05.750
<v Speaker 2>and take some food for the famine of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your households and be gone.</v>

1793
01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:07.940
<v Speaker 2>And then bring your youngest brother to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1794
01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll know that you're not spies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you're honest,</v>

1795
01:39:11.711 --> 01:39:16.711
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll deliver the other brother and </v>

1796
01:39:16.711 --> 01:39:17.740
<v Speaker 2>you shall trade in the lounge so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to starve to death.</v>

1797
01:39:17.741 --> 01:39:22.741
<v Speaker 2>And it came to pass as they emptied </v>
<v Speaker 2>their sacks that behold every man's </v>

1798
01:39:22.741 --> 01:39:25.150
<v Speaker 2>bundle of money in his sock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when both say in their fathers,</v>

1799
01:39:25.151 --> 01:39:26.830
<v Speaker 2>saw the bundles of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were afraid.</v>

1800
01:39:26.831 --> 01:39:31.831
<v Speaker 2>So they had bought food from joseph and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave them the food and then he put </v>

1801
01:39:31.831 --> 01:39:36.211
<v Speaker 2>all their money back in their socks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I can imagine would worry them to </v>

1802
01:39:36.211 --> 01:39:37.860
<v Speaker 2>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and jacob said,</v>

1803
01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:43.460
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have already bereaved of my </v>

1804
01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:43.460
<v Speaker 2>childrEn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph is not as is.</v>

1805
01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Not now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll take benjamin,</v>

1806
01:39:43.810 --> 01:39:46.360
<v Speaker 2>benjamin away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these things are against me.</v>

1807
01:39:46.810 --> 01:39:48.850
<v Speaker 2>And ruben spake unto his father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1808
01:39:48.851 --> 01:39:51.100
<v Speaker 2>slay my two sons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I bring him not to the,</v>

1809
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:53.740
<v Speaker 2>deliver them into my hand and I will </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring them to the again</v>

1810
01:39:55.670 --> 01:39:56.580
<v Speaker 2>and he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1811
01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:01.640
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My son shall not go down with you for </v>

1812
01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:01.640
<v Speaker 2>his brother is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's left alone.</v>

1813
01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.290
<v Speaker 2>If mischief befall him by the way in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which you shall go,</v>

1814
01:40:04.291 --> 01:40:07.470
<v Speaker 2>then you shall bring down my greer or </v>
<v Speaker 2>gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</v>

1815
01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what happens in the last part of the</v>

1816
01:40:11.851 --> 01:40:13.980
<v Speaker 2>jacob storage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The joseph story is,</v>

1817
01:40:14.130 --> 01:40:19.130
<v Speaker 2>and this is associated with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting your house in order your </v>

1818
01:40:19.130 --> 01:40:23.331
<v Speaker 2>individual house in order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then putting your family's house in </v>

1819
01:40:23.331 --> 01:40:23.331
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's reversed a little bit,</v>

1820
01:40:23.331 --> 01:40:28.000
<v Speaker 2>this story because joseph puts himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and then he puts the state of </v>

1821
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.180
<v Speaker 2>of Egypt in order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really quite interesting </v>

1822
01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:33.990
<v Speaker 2>because Egypt is the canonical tyranny </v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the old testament.</v>

1823
01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:39.290
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clear here that the person who </v>

1824
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:41.070
<v Speaker 2>wears the coat of many colors can put </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tyranny right,</v>

1825
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:45.210
<v Speaker 2>and then the next extension as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has to put his family right now.</v>

1826
01:40:45.210 --> 01:40:50.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally the progression would be put </v>

1827
01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:50.210
<v Speaker 2>yourself right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then put your family right,</v>

1828
01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:50.580
<v Speaker 2>then put the state right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1829
01:40:50.730 --> 01:40:53.010
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can do it in a different order,</v>

1830
01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:56.120
<v Speaker 2>that's probably okay too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so,</v>

1831
01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:58.540
<v Speaker 2>so that's what happens at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story is that,</v>

1832
01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joseph is doing pretty damn well and so </v>

1833
01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:06.070
<v Speaker 2>is the state that he serves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't good enough for him.</v>

1834
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:11.430
<v Speaker 2>He wants his family to be functional and</v>
<v Speaker 2>put together properly even though they </v>

1835
01:41:12.731 --> 01:41:17.450
<v Speaker 2>did terrible things to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's very interesting because once</v>

1836
01:41:17.451 --> 01:41:22.451
<v Speaker 2>someone does terrible things to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the logical thing or a logical </v>

1837
01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:24.070
<v Speaker 2>thing to think as well go to hell in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand basket.</v>

1838
01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

1839
01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.880
<v Speaker 2>you deserve exactly what you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1840
01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:36.720
<v Speaker 2>it's not a very productive attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're around people that </v>

1841
01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.780
<v Speaker 2>you have to be around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1842
01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:42.840
<v Speaker 2>So like if it's your family and you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a family dinner and one of you </v>

1843
01:41:43.031 --> 01:41:45.070
<v Speaker 2>punches the other and then the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>punches you back,</v>

1844
01:41:45.071 --> 01:41:47.650
<v Speaker 2>and then that's like the family dinner </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the next 30 years.</v>

1845
01:41:47.890 --> 01:41:52.890
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to be very productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're the person who happened </v>

1846
01:41:52.890 --> 01:41:56.041
<v Speaker 2>to get into the last blow because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have to put up with them at </v>

1847
01:41:56.041 --> 01:41:59.941
<v Speaker 2>minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be nice to just let what you </v>

1848
01:41:59.941 --> 01:42:02.740
<v Speaker 2>can go go and work to make towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>making things better.</v>

1849
01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.040
<v Speaker 2>You have to get rid of the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>revenge and resentment and all those </v>

1850
01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:08.040
<v Speaker 2>things that you carry along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1851
01:42:12.450 --> 01:42:17.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably better to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how your family could be if it was </v>

1852
01:42:17.450 --> 01:42:19.830
<v Speaker 2>really functioning well and then just </v>
<v Speaker 2>aim unerringly of that.</v>

1853
01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I know that's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people are very screwy and </v>

1854
01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.860
<v Speaker 2>there's no end to the depths of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathology within families,</v>

1855
01:42:28.861 --> 01:42:32.130
<v Speaker 2>but of course this story states that </v>
<v Speaker 2>very clearly.</v>

1856
01:42:32.131 --> 01:42:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean they tried to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sold him into slavery.</v>

1857
01:42:36.061 --> 01:42:38.430
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pathological family,</v>

1858
01:42:38.431 --> 01:42:39.590
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1859
01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:43.470
<v Speaker 2>but joseph's attitude is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1860
01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:46.980
<v Speaker 2>we got to set this right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not least because of his father,</v>

1861
01:42:46.981 --> 01:42:49.310
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't only because of his father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you see,</v>

1862
01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:54.380
<v Speaker 2>as the story unfolds and the famine was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sore in the land and it came to pass </v>

1863
01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:56.130
<v Speaker 2>when they had eaten up the court in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which they had brought out of Egypt,</v>

1864
01:42:56.131 --> 01:42:59.460
<v Speaker 2>their father said unto them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go again and bias a little food.</v>

1865
01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:02.190
<v Speaker 2>And judah spake unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1866
01:43:03.230 --> 01:43:07.290
<v Speaker 2>the man did solidly protest on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not you will not see my face except your</v>

1867
01:43:07.291 --> 01:43:12.291
<v Speaker 2>brother be with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't go back to Egypt without </v>

1868
01:43:12.291 --> 01:43:12.360
<v Speaker 2>benjamin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

1869
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:16.160
<v Speaker 2>the man asked is straightly of our eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>other kindred saying,</v>

1870
01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:18.470
<v Speaker 2>is your father yet alive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you another brother?</v>

1871
01:43:18.710 --> 01:43:21.140
<v Speaker 2>And we told them according to the tenor </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those words,</v>

1872
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:24.800
<v Speaker 2>could we know that he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring your brother down?</v>

1873
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:27.440
<v Speaker 2>and judas said unto Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father,</v>

1874
01:43:27.441 --> 01:43:29.540
<v Speaker 2>send the lab with me and will arise and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1875
01:43:29.541 --> 01:43:34.541
<v Speaker 2>that we may live and not die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both we and vowel and also our little </v>

1876
01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:34.820
<v Speaker 2>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will be surety for him.</v>

1877
01:43:35.690 --> 01:43:38.620
<v Speaker 2>My hand shell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll require him if I bring them onto</v>

1878
01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:42.080
<v Speaker 2>the inset them before the lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me bear the blame forever.</v>

1879
01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so judah who played a pretty dismal role</v>

1880
01:43:47.401 --> 01:43:52.401
<v Speaker 2>in the original selling joseph into </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to obviously have learned </v>

1881
01:43:53.571 --> 01:43:57.440
<v Speaker 2>something by this point since he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to put himself on the line,</v>

1882
01:43:57.710 --> 01:43:59.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take responsibility for the situation</v>

1883
01:43:59.841 --> 01:44:03.350
<v Speaker 2>and to put himself on the line and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand in for benjamin.</v>

1884
01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.860
<v Speaker 2>So he's making himself into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificial object of sorts,</v>

1885
01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:12.160
<v Speaker 2>and so the game that joseph's playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he sort of teasing his brothers,</v>

1886
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:18.260
<v Speaker 2>but he's also testing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The game that he's playing is twofold.</v>

1887
01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:23.360
<v Speaker 2>One is have you bloody well learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything or are you just as corrupt and </v>

1888
01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.530
<v Speaker 2>useless as you were before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's game number one.</v>

1889
01:44:24.531 --> 01:44:29.531
<v Speaker 2>Then game number two is maybe if I poke </v>
<v Speaker 2>and prod you and put you into a </v>

1890
01:44:29.531 --> 01:44:30.890
<v Speaker 2>relatively difficult and mysterious </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

1891
01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I can get you to clue the hell in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>adopt some responsibility and we can </v>

1892
01:44:36.130 --> 01:44:36.710
<v Speaker 2>move this whole mess forward.</v>

1893
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:41.690
<v Speaker 2>And so that seems to be happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So judah is taking responsibility.</v>

1894
01:44:41.691 --> 01:44:44.840
<v Speaker 2>And ruben did that as well and the men </v>
<v Speaker 2>took presence and they took double money</v>

1895
01:44:44.841 --> 01:44:49.841
<v Speaker 2>in their hand and Benjamin Rose up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>went down to Egypt and stood before </v>

1896
01:44:49.841 --> 01:44:51.530
<v Speaker 2>joseph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When joseph saw benjamin with them,</v>

1897
01:44:51.531 --> 01:44:56.531
<v Speaker 2>he said to the ruler of his house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring these men home and slay and make </v>

1898
01:44:56.531 --> 01:44:58.580
<v Speaker 2>ready food for these men shall dine with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me at noon.</v>

1899
01:44:58.581 --> 01:45:03.581
<v Speaker 2>And the men mandate is joseph bade in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the man brought them in into joseph's </v>

1900
01:45:03.581 --> 01:45:05.090
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when joseph came home,</v>

1901
01:45:05.091 --> 01:45:08.420
<v Speaker 2>they brought them the presence which was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their hand and bowed themselves again</v>

1902
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:11.240
<v Speaker 2>to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the earth,</v>

1903
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:13.430
<v Speaker 2>and he asked them of their welfare and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1904
01:45:13.431 --> 01:45:16.910
<v Speaker 2>is your father well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old man of whom you speak is whom he</v>

1905
01:45:16.911 --> 01:45:20.180
<v Speaker 2>spake as a yet alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they answered thy servant,</v>

1906
01:45:20.181 --> 01:45:22.580
<v Speaker 2>our father is in good health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's yet alive.</v>

1907
01:45:22.581 --> 01:45:24.910
<v Speaker 2>And they bow down their heads and made </v>
<v Speaker 2>obeisance.</v>

1908
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.550
<v Speaker 2>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother benjamin,</v>

1909
01:45:31.551 --> 01:45:33.590
<v Speaker 2>his mother's son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

1910
01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:36.320
<v Speaker 2>is this your younger brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of whom you speak unto me?</v>

1911
01:45:36.321 --> 01:45:37.760
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

1912
01:45:37.761 --> 01:45:42.761
<v Speaker 2>be gracious unto thee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My son and joseph made haste for his </v>

1913
01:45:42.761 --> 01:45:43.970
<v Speaker 2>bowels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did urine upon his brother,</v>

1914
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:48.380
<v Speaker 2>and he sought were to weep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he entered into his chamber and wept</v>

1915
01:45:48.381 --> 01:45:53.381
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he washed his face and went out and </v>

1916
01:45:53.381 --> 01:45:53.381
<v Speaker 2>reframed himself and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set on the bread.</v>

1917
01:45:53.630 --> 01:45:58.630
<v Speaker 2>And they sat before them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he plays another trick on his </v>

1918
01:45:58.630 --> 01:45:58.630
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he has them all sit at the table,</v>

1919
01:45:58.630 --> 01:46:02.290
<v Speaker 2>but he lines them up according to age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he started to.</v>

1920
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:08.590
<v Speaker 2>What is he trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of freaked them out fundamentally </v>

1921
01:46:08.590 --> 01:46:13.300
<v Speaker 2>and so at an imanage is that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no idea how in the world they </v>

1922
01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:16.871
<v Speaker 2>could possibly he could possibly pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that or if they think </v>

1923
01:46:16.871 --> 01:46:19.691
<v Speaker 2>it's magic and the men marveled at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>another and he took and sent messages </v>

1924
01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:24.720
<v Speaker 2>unto them from before him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but benjamin's mess was five times as </v>

1925
01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:24.720
<v Speaker 2>much as any of theirs.</v>

1926
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:26.660
<v Speaker 2>So what's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1927
01:46:26.661 --> 01:46:31.661
<v Speaker 2>he's testing his brothers again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that when he was the child </v>

1928
01:46:31.971 --> 01:46:35.630
<v Speaker 2>joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he got more meant that his brothers</v>

1929
01:46:35.631 --> 01:46:37.910
<v Speaker 2>got terribly Jealous and then murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1930
01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:40.100
<v Speaker 2>And so now he's doing the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with benjamin.</v>

1931
01:46:40.101 --> 01:46:40.850
<v Speaker 2>He's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1932
01:46:40.851 --> 01:46:45.851
<v Speaker 2>well I'll give this kid more than his </v>
<v Speaker 2>share and a watch how these reprobates </v>

1933
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:55.010
<v Speaker 2>and see if they've learned anything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so and he commanded the steward of his </v>

1934
01:46:55.111 --> 01:47:00.111
<v Speaker 2>house saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill the men sock with food as much as </v>

1935
01:47:00.111 --> 01:47:00.990
<v Speaker 2>they can carry and put every man's money</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sock as well.</v>

1936
01:47:01.230 --> 01:47:06.230
<v Speaker 2>And put my cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the silver cup in the sax mouth of the </v>

1937
01:47:06.230 --> 01:47:08.931
<v Speaker 2>youngest and his corn money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the steWard did according to the </v>

1938
01:47:08.931 --> 01:47:10.710
<v Speaker 2>word that joseph had spoken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as the morning was light,</v>

1939
01:47:10.711 --> 01:47:14.100
<v Speaker 2>the men were sent away along with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>transportation.</v>

1940
01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:20.760
<v Speaker 2>The big cup is found in benjamin sack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1941
01:47:20.761 --> 01:47:23.580
<v Speaker 2>so benjamin's kinda young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1942
01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:31.800
<v Speaker 2>joseph sends out people to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the company's going and they find </v>

1943
01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:33.660
<v Speaker 2>it in benjamin's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in benjamin sock.</v>

1944
01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:39.540
<v Speaker 2>And they're very upset about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said that a harsh punishment would </v>

1945
01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:41.500
<v Speaker 2>be fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoever had the cop in his sack,</v>

1946
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:47.070
<v Speaker 2>they rent their clothes and late at </v>
<v Speaker 2>every man his ass and returned to this </v>

1947
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:50.071
<v Speaker 2>city and judah and his brothers came to </v>
<v Speaker 2>joseph's house for he was out there and </v>

1948
01:47:50.071 --> 01:47:53.140
<v Speaker 2>they fell before I'm on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unhappy and apologetic.</v>

1949
01:47:53.290 --> 01:47:56.320
<v Speaker 2>And joseph said unto them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what need is this that you have done?</v>

1950
01:47:56.380 --> 01:48:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't you know that a man like I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly divine.</v>

1951
01:48:01.690 --> 01:48:04.000
<v Speaker 2>I know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she would've said,</v>

1952
01:48:04.001 --> 01:48:05.800
<v Speaker 2>what shall we say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What shall we speak?</v>

1953
01:48:05.801 --> 01:48:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Or how could we possibly clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves?</v>

1954
01:48:08.050 --> 01:48:10.630
<v Speaker 2>God found out the iniquity of thy </v>
<v Speaker 2>servants.</v>

1955
01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Behold we are your servants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both we and also he with whom the cup is</v>

1956
01:48:16.211 --> 01:48:19.980
<v Speaker 2>found and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god forbid that I should do so,</v>

1957
01:48:19.981 --> 01:48:24.981
<v Speaker 2>but the man in whose cup and whose hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the companies found he shall be my </v>

1958
01:48:24.991 --> 01:48:26.310
<v Speaker 2>servant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as for you,</v>

1959
01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:31.760
<v Speaker 2>get you up in peace to your father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the discovery of the cup.</v>

1960
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Judah says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1961
01:48:40.221 --> 01:48:42.140
<v Speaker 2>therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I come to this servant,</v>

1962
01:48:42.141 --> 01:48:47.141
<v Speaker 2>my father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father and the loud be not with us </v>

1963
01:48:47.141 --> 01:48:47.141
<v Speaker 2>and seeing that his life is bound up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the clouds.</v>

1964
01:48:47.141 --> 01:48:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shall come to pass.</v>

1965
01:48:48.471 --> 01:48:50.420
<v Speaker 2>When he sees that the loud is not with </v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

1966
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:55.750
<v Speaker 2>that he will die and the servant shall </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring down the gray hairs of thy </v>

1967
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:57.140
<v Speaker 2>servant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our father with sorrow to the grave,</v>

1968
01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:01.220
<v Speaker 2>for thy servant became security for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>latin to my father saying,</v>

1969
01:49:01.221 --> 01:49:04.340
<v Speaker 2>if I bring him not unto thee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I shall bear the blame too.</v>

1970
01:49:04.341 --> 01:49:07.070
<v Speaker 2>My father forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now therefore I pray thee.</v>

1971
01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Let me stay instead of the lab and let </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lord go with his brothers for how </v>

1972
01:49:13.311 --> 01:49:16.730
<v Speaker 2>shall I go up to my brother and allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be not with me.</v>

1973
01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's pair adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shall see the evil that will come on </v>

1974
01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:22.720
<v Speaker 2>my father.</v>

1975
01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what's happened?</v>

1976
01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they learned their lesson.</v>

1977
01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:29.620
<v Speaker 2>So now judah again is willing to stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the place of benjamin and become a </v>

1978
01:49:30.471 --> 01:49:35.471
<v Speaker 2>slave himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now joseph has determined that </v>

1979
01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:41.200
<v Speaker 2>his brothers have developed their </v>
<v Speaker 2>character to the point where </v>

1980
01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.490
<v Speaker 2>reconciliation might be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1981
01:49:43.491 --> 01:49:48.491
<v Speaker 2>it says you should forgive and forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the conditions for that are quite,</v>

1982
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:53.230
<v Speaker 2>are quite specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1983
01:49:53.231 --> 01:49:55.300
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a dispute with someone,</v>

1984
01:49:55.580 --> 01:49:58.960
<v Speaker 2>they've wronged you in some sense and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they apologize.</v>

1985
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.110
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1986
01:50:00.111 --> 01:50:01.920
<v Speaker 2>what's the apology?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1987
01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:05.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a layout of a rationale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like,</v>

1988
01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:10.620
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the reasons I did this horrible </v>

1989
01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:13.621
<v Speaker 2>thing and here's what I've learned from </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and here's what I'm going to do to </v>

1990
01:50:13.621 --> 01:50:17.971
<v Speaker 2>try not to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And would you give me another crack at </v>

1991
01:50:17.971 --> 01:50:19.270
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the proper repentance,</v>

1992
01:50:19.271 --> 01:50:19.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1993
01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:22.120
<v Speaker 2>And then you forgive because you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot too,</v>

1994
01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:27.121
<v Speaker 2>and you'll probably do something stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you'd like the same kind of </v>

1995
01:50:27.121 --> 01:50:28.030
<v Speaker 2>break at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and besides,</v>

1996
01:50:28.031 --> 01:50:33.031
<v Speaker 2>if we all held each other completely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Account at all possible times for </v>

1997
01:50:33.031 --> 01:50:34.900
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it just be hopeless because there'd</v>

1998
01:50:34.901 --> 01:50:39.250
<v Speaker 2>be no room for error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if forgiveness,</v>

1999
01:50:39.251 --> 01:50:41.890
<v Speaker 2>which joseph is showing is why is </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgiveness,</v>

2000
01:50:41.891 --> 01:50:46.891
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to put himself out on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>line for people who haven't learned so </v>

2001
01:50:46.891 --> 01:50:50.821
<v Speaker 2>that the same stupid thing can happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>again so that they can continue to </v>

2002
01:50:50.821 --> 01:50:53.791
<v Speaker 2>spread misery wherever they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to find out if they've clued </v>

2003
01:50:53.791 --> 01:50:56.851
<v Speaker 2>in a little bit and then if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can move on with putting a </v>

2004
01:50:56.851 --> 01:50:58.990
<v Speaker 2>family together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that breaks them up.</v>

2005
01:50:58.991 --> 01:51:00.460
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joseph could not refrain.</v>

2006
01:51:00.730 --> 01:51:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Refrain himself before all of them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stood by him and he cried.</v>

2007
01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:08.620
<v Speaker 2>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get every man away from me.</v>

2008
01:51:10.690 --> 01:51:14.890
<v Speaker 2>So all the people except for joseph's </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother left and there stood no man with</v>

2009
01:51:14.891 --> 01:51:17.200
<v Speaker 2>him while joseph made himself known unto</v>
<v Speaker 2>his brothers.</v>

2010
01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Joseph said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm joseph is my father is still alive.</v>

2011
01:51:23.170 --> 01:51:26.560
<v Speaker 2>And his brothers could not answer for </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were troubled at his presence.</v>

2012
01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:28.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2013
01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:37.600
<v Speaker 2>understatement of the decade there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And joseph said unto his brothers,</v>

2014
01:51:37.601 --> 01:51:39.040
<v Speaker 2>come near to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pray you.</v>

2015
01:51:39.041 --> 01:51:40.900
<v Speaker 2>And they came near and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am joseph,</v>

2016
01:51:40.901 --> 01:51:42.430
<v Speaker 2>your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whom you sold into Egypt,</v>

2017
01:51:43.570 --> 01:51:47.470
<v Speaker 2>but don't be grieved or angry with </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that you sold me hither for god</v>

2018
01:51:47.471 --> 01:51:52.471
<v Speaker 2>did send me before you to preserve life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now it was not you that sent me here </v>

2019
01:51:53.021 --> 01:51:55.930
<v Speaker 2>but god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's made me a father to pharaoh and</v>

2020
01:51:55.931 --> 01:51:58.840
<v Speaker 2>lord of all his house in a ruler </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout all the land of Egypt.</v>

2021
01:51:59.830 --> 01:52:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Hurry and go to my father and say unto </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

2022
01:52:03.130 --> 01:52:07.000
<v Speaker 2>thus say they son joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god has made me lord of all Egypt.</v>

2023
01:52:07.210 --> 01:52:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Come down onto me and terry naught and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thou shall dwell in the land of goshen </v>

2024
01:52:13.871 --> 01:52:18.871
<v Speaker 2>and now shall be near unto me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thou and thy children and their </v>

2025
01:52:18.871 --> 01:52:19.060
<v Speaker 2>children's children and their flocks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>herds and all that thou hast.</v>

2026
01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:23.710
<v Speaker 2>And either I will nourish you for yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are five years of famine,</v>

2027
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:27.010
<v Speaker 2>less dow and I household and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thou has come to poverty,</v>

2028
01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:32.660
<v Speaker 2>so that's the other thing that another </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of a hint that the bread hint here,</v>

2029
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:40.360
<v Speaker 2>who's the what's the most reliable </v>
<v Speaker 2>source of bread?</v>

2030
01:52:40.450 --> 01:52:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't bread itself.</v>

2031
01:52:42.071 --> 01:52:46.670
<v Speaker 2>It's whatever it is that gives rise to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bread and what joseph is in this story.</v>

2032
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:50.090
<v Speaker 2>He's the force that gives ride rise to </v>
<v Speaker 2>nourishment.</v>

2033
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 2>That's an joseph is often considered a </v>
<v Speaker 2>type of christ,</v>

2034
01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:57.090
<v Speaker 2>which means like a precursor in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that's.</v>

2035
01:52:57.170 --> 01:53:00.060
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that echoed right there.</v>

2036
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:01.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2037
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:04.850
<v Speaker 2>what do you store up for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Famine.</v>

2038
01:53:04.851 --> 01:53:08.780
<v Speaker 2>You store up character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best way through.</v>

2039
01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean you don't also </v>
<v Speaker 2>store up bread and they went out of </v>

2040
01:53:15.771 --> 01:53:20.771
<v Speaker 2>egyPt and came into the land of canaan </v>
<v Speaker 2>unto jacob and told him joseph is still </v>

2041
01:53:20.771 --> 01:53:23.150
<v Speaker 2>alive and he's governor and jacob's </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart fainted for he didn't believe them</v>

2042
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:25.100
<v Speaker 2>and they told him all the words of </v>
<v Speaker 2>joseph,</v>

2043
01:53:25.101 --> 01:53:27.380
<v Speaker 2>which he said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when he saw the wagons,</v>

2044
01:53:27.381 --> 01:53:29.870
<v Speaker 2>which joseph had sent to carry him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spirit of jacob,</v>

2045
01:53:29.871 --> 01:53:33.350
<v Speaker 2>their father revived and Israel said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has enough.</v>

2046
01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my son is he had live.</v>

2047
01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I will go and see him before I die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Israel took his journey with all </v>

2048
01:53:39.850 --> 01:53:43.421
<v Speaker 2>that he had and came to beersheba and </v>
<v Speaker 2>offered sacrifices unto the god of his </v>

2049
01:53:43.421 --> 01:53:46.991
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isaac and god spake unto Israel in the </v>

2050
01:53:46.991 --> 01:53:46.991
<v Speaker 2>visions of the night and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jacob,</v>

2051
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:48.620
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here am I.</v>

2052
01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:49.940
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am god,</v>

2053
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:53.300
<v Speaker 2>the god of my father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't fear to go to each down into Egypt</v>

2054
01:53:53.301 --> 01:53:56.060
<v Speaker 2>for I will make you a great nation </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2055
01:53:56.061 --> 01:53:59.390
<v Speaker 2>And so that's how the israelites ended </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in Egypt.</v>

2056
01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I will go down with the into Egypt and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>will also surely bring the up again and </v>

2057
01:54:04.930 --> 01:54:08.750
<v Speaker 2>jacob shall put his hand upon his dies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jacob Rose up from beersheba and the</v>

2058
01:54:08.751 --> 01:54:13.751
<v Speaker 2>sons of Israel carry jacob their father </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the little ones and their wives in </v>

2059
01:54:13.751 --> 01:54:14.030
<v Speaker 2>the wagons which pharaoh had sent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>carry.</v>

2060
01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:19.810
<v Speaker 2>So the families now all united in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper state of being that joseph has </v>

2061
01:54:19.810 --> 01:54:21.980
<v Speaker 2>raged and they took their cattle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their goods.</v>

2062
01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:25.490
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting too because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course joseph isn't even.</v>

2063
01:54:25.491 --> 01:54:29.630
<v Speaker 2>He's a foreigner as well as being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>former slave and prisoner,</v>

2064
01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:31.820
<v Speaker 2>foreigner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slave and prisoner,</v>

2065
01:54:31.821 --> 01:54:36.821
<v Speaker 2>and yet he ends up ruling Egypt sheer </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheerly because of the force of his </v>

2066
01:54:36.821 --> 01:54:41.081
<v Speaker 2>character and competence and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really something to think about and they</v>

2067
01:54:41.841 --> 01:54:46.841
<v Speaker 2>took their cattle because that story </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is that there isn't anything </v>

2068
01:54:46.841 --> 01:54:46.841
<v Speaker 2>stronger than that.</v>

2069
01:54:46.841 --> 01:54:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter what the circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 2>are that there isn't a forest that's </v>

2070
01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:53.711
<v Speaker 2>more powerful not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think that that's naive.</v>

2071
01:54:55.730 --> 01:55:00.730
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the exact opposite of </v>

2072
01:55:00.730 --> 01:55:00.730
<v Speaker 2>naive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter where you are,</v>

2073
01:55:00.730 --> 01:55:05.621
<v Speaker 2>you can generally make things better if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you want to do and unless </v>

2074
01:55:05.621 --> 01:55:07.520
<v Speaker 2>you're in some place that's really hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

2075
01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:13.600
<v Speaker 2>not usually is something that elevates </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and elevates the people around you </v>

2076
01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:19.180
<v Speaker 2>and you can do that wherever you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there isn't a place that's so </v>

2077
01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:22.811
<v Speaker 2>small that you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the message of the prison and </v>

2078
01:55:22.811 --> 01:55:26.531
<v Speaker 2>they took their cattle and their goods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they had gotten in the land of </v>

2079
01:55:26.531 --> 01:55:28.931
<v Speaker 2>canaan and came into Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jacob and all his seed with him and he </v>

2080
01:55:31.101 --> 01:55:34.080
<v Speaker 2>sent judah before a month to joseph to </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct his face onto gosh,</v>

2081
01:55:34.081 --> 01:55:37.760
<v Speaker 2>and then they came into the land of </v>
<v Speaker 2>goshen and joseph made ready his chariot</v>

2082
01:55:37.761 --> 01:55:40.970
<v Speaker 2>and went to meet Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father and presented himself to them</v>

2083
01:55:41.150 --> 01:55:43.320
<v Speaker 2>and fell on his neck and wept on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>

2084
01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:48.320
<v Speaker 2>A good while and Israel said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can now die because I've seen your </v>

2085
01:55:48.481 --> 01:55:53.481
<v Speaker 2>face because you're still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying </v>

2086
01:55:55.591 --> 01:56:00.591
<v Speaker 2>that father and thy brethren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're coming to the land of Egypt is </v>

2087
01:56:00.591 --> 01:56:03.861
<v Speaker 2>before the in the best of the land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your father and brothers can dwell in </v>

2088
01:56:03.861 --> 01:56:07.281
<v Speaker 2>the land of gosh and let them do well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if the now know any men of activity </v>

2089
01:56:07.281 --> 01:56:08.730
<v Speaker 2>among them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then make them rulers over my cattle.</v>

2090
01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:13.960
<v Speaker 2>It gives them a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And joseph brought in jacob his father </v>

2091
01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:15.240
<v Speaker 2>and set up before pharaoh and jacob </v>
<v Speaker 2>blessed pharaoh.</v>

2092
01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:19.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a very interesting little turn of</v>
<v Speaker 2>events because you'd expect the opposite</v>

2093
01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.840
<v Speaker 2>under those circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it appears that jacob was a man of </v>

2094
01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:29.570
<v Speaker 2>relatively great self-possession because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a.</v>

2095
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:32.550
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't blast queen elizabeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In all likelihood,</v>

2096
01:56:33.970 --> 01:56:37.140
<v Speaker 2>as you had a lot of gall and pharaoh </v>
<v Speaker 2>said unto jacob,</v>

2097
01:56:37.141 --> 01:56:37.770
<v Speaker 2>how old are you?</v>

2098
01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:40.530
<v Speaker 2>And jacob said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 130 years.</v>

2099
01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Few and evil have been the days of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of my life and I've not attained </v>

2100
01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:48.060
<v Speaker 2>into the days of the years of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my father's,</v>

2101
01:56:48.210 --> 01:56:53.210
<v Speaker 2>in the days of their pilgrimage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And jacob blessed pharaoh and went out </v>

2102
01:56:53.210 --> 01:56:54.810
<v Speaker 2>from before pharaoh and the Israel dwelt</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the land of Egypt,</v>

2103
01:56:54.811 --> 01:56:58.860
<v Speaker 2>in the country of gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and grew and multiplied exceedingly.</v>

2104
01:56:59.070 --> 01:57:01.680
<v Speaker 2>And jacob lived in the land of Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventeen years.</v>

2105
01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:07.580
<v Speaker 2>So the whole age of jacob was 147 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the time drew nigh that Israel must </v>

2106
01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:09.660
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he called his son.</v>

2107
01:57:09.661 --> 01:57:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Joseph said unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have now found grace in thy sight,</v>

2108
01:57:14.610 --> 01:57:19.110
<v Speaker 2>put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh </v>
<v Speaker 2>and deal kindly and truly with me,</v>

2109
01:57:19.170 --> 01:57:21.150
<v Speaker 2>bury me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not I pray thee in Egypt,</v>

2110
01:57:22.050 --> 01:57:27.050
<v Speaker 2>but I will lie with my father's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>now shall carry me out of Egypt and </v>

2111
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.050
<v Speaker 2>burnaby.</v>

2112
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:29.640
<v Speaker 2>And they're burying place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And joseph said,</v>

2113
01:57:29.641 --> 01:57:31.110
<v Speaker 2>I will do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you've said.</v>

2114
01:57:32.010 --> 01:57:36.060
<v Speaker 2>And it came to pass after these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that one told joseph,</v>

2115
01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:38.910
<v Speaker 2>behold I father is sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he took with him his two sons,</v>

2116
01:57:38.911 --> 01:57:41.970
<v Speaker 2>madison ephram and one told jacob and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2117
01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:45.060
<v Speaker 2>behold thy son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one told jacob and said,</v>

2118
01:57:45.061 --> 01:57:47.430
<v Speaker 2>behold thy son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joseph cometh unto thee,</v>

2119
01:57:47.690 --> 01:57:50.010
<v Speaker 2>and Israel strengthened himself and sat </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon the bed.</v>

2120
01:57:51.150 --> 01:57:56.150
<v Speaker 2>And he Israel said unto joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd not thought to see your face and </v>

2121
01:57:56.150 --> 01:57:57.840
<v Speaker 2>low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>god has also showed me your children.</v>

2122
01:57:58.890 --> 01:58:03.890
<v Speaker 2>And joseph brought them out from between</v>
<v Speaker 2>his knees and out himself with his face </v>

2123
01:58:03.890 --> 01:58:05.400
<v Speaker 2>to the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And joseph took them both a in his right</v>

2124
01:58:05.401 --> 01:58:08.880
<v Speaker 2>hand towards israel's lefthand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>madison is lefthand toward Israel,</v>

2125
01:58:08.881 --> 01:58:10.500
<v Speaker 2>his right hand and brought them near </v>
<v Speaker 2>unto him.</v>

2126
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:16.310
<v Speaker 2>And Israel stretched out his right hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>and laid it upon eh firms had who was </v>

2127
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:19.671
<v Speaker 2>the younger and his left upon madness's </v>
<v Speaker 2>had guiding his hands purposefully for </v>

2128
01:58:20.101 --> 01:58:21.330
<v Speaker 2>madison was the first born.</v>

2129
01:58:21.330 --> 01:58:24.930
<v Speaker 2>And when joseph saw that his father laid</v>
<v Speaker 2>his right hand on the head of ephraim,</v>

2130
01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:29.931
<v Speaker 2>it displeased him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he held up his father's hand to </v>

2131
01:58:29.931 --> 01:58:32.511
<v Speaker 2>remove it from him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Firms had under my head and joseph said </v>

2132
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:33.500
<v Speaker 2>unto his father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2133
01:58:33.501 --> 01:58:37.530
<v Speaker 2>not so my father for this is the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>board put the right hand upon his head,</v>

2134
01:58:37.740 --> 01:58:39.780
<v Speaker 2>head at his father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refused and said,</v>

2135
01:58:39.781 --> 01:58:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I know it my son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it.</v>

2136
01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:44.590
<v Speaker 2>he shall also be my people and he shall </v>
<v Speaker 2>also be great,</v>

2137
01:58:44.591 --> 01:58:49.591
<v Speaker 2>but truly his younger brother shall be </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater than he and his seed shall </v>

2138
01:58:49.591 --> 01:58:53.251
<v Speaker 2>become a multitude of nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another repeat of the same thing that </v>

2139
01:58:53.251 --> 01:58:53.430
<v Speaker 2>happens continually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2140
01:58:53.431 --> 01:58:58.431
<v Speaker 2>It's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when god wants to intervene in human </v>

2141
01:58:58.431 --> 01:59:01.681
<v Speaker 2>affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he does is invert tradition at </v>

2142
01:59:01.681 --> 01:59:03.881
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's a sign that there's </v>

2143
01:59:03.881 --> 01:59:07.501
<v Speaker 2>something new and special going on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gives precedence to the younger </v>

2144
01:59:07.501 --> 01:59:10.951
<v Speaker 2>child rather than the older child </v>
<v Speaker 2>precedent to what is new rather than </v>

2145
01:59:10.951 --> 01:59:10.951
<v Speaker 2>what's traditional.</v>

2146
01:59:10.951 --> 01:59:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes that's necessary because </v>

2147
01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:18.060
<v Speaker 2>tradition is insufficient and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new has to come into being in </v>

2148
01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:22.201
<v Speaker 2>order to update it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And jacob called together his sons and </v>

2149
01:59:22.201 --> 01:59:23.290
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathered together so that I can tell you</v>

2150
01:59:23.291 --> 01:59:25.600
<v Speaker 2>that which shall befall you in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

2151
01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:31.620
<v Speaker 2>gather yourself together and here you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sons of jacob and hearkened unto Israel </v>

2152
01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:32.170
<v Speaker 2>your father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruben.</v>

2153
01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go through all 12 of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these rubin,</v>

2154
01:59:34.601 --> 01:59:35.680
<v Speaker 2>thou art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my firstborn,</v>

2155
01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:37.750
<v Speaker 2>my might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the beginning of my strength,</v>

2156
01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:40.870
<v Speaker 2>the excellency of dignity and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>excellency of power.</v>

2157
01:59:41.590 --> 01:59:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Now the story's quite interesting here </v>
<v Speaker 2>because jacob blesses joseph's sons </v>

2158
01:59:49.601 --> 01:59:54.601
<v Speaker 2>before he blesses his own sons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what he's doing is placing the </v>

2159
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:59.710
<v Speaker 2>rights of the firstborn into the sons of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his favorite son.</v>

2160
01:59:59.890 --> 02:00:04.690
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes to his sons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that has implications for the way</v>

2161
02:00:04.691 --> 02:00:09.691
<v Speaker 2>the biblical stories laid themselves out</v>
<v Speaker 2>from thence forward the excellent of </v>

2162
02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.960
<v Speaker 2>dignity in the excellency of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unstable as water.</v>

2163
02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Thou shalt not excel because that went </v>
<v Speaker 2>has stopped to thy father's bed.</v>

2164
02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Then defiled it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went up to my couch.</v>

2165
02:00:20.050 --> 02:00:22.930
<v Speaker 2>You may remember that ruben slept with </v>
<v Speaker 2>his fathers,</v>

2166
02:00:22.931 --> 02:00:23.740
<v Speaker 2>cucumber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ca,</v>

2167
02:00:23.770 --> 02:00:27.960
<v Speaker 2>concubine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simeon and levi are brethren.</v>

2168
02:00:27.970 --> 02:00:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Instruments of cruelty are in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>habitations.</v>

2169
02:00:31.230 --> 02:00:36.230
<v Speaker 2>So that painting there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened with simeon and levi was </v>

2170
02:00:36.230 --> 02:00:41.011
<v Speaker 2>that somebody lay with her sister diana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then offered to marry her and then </v>

2171
02:00:45.401 --> 02:00:50.401
<v Speaker 2>had and then became circumcised because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was part of the deal and then how </v>

2172
02:00:50.401 --> 02:00:54.711
<v Speaker 2>to older men circumcised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then simeon and levi went in when </v>

2173
02:00:54.711 --> 02:00:55.150
<v Speaker 2>they were recovering and killed them </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2174
02:00:55.330 --> 02:01:00.330
<v Speaker 2>And then jacob and all his people had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave because all that irritated their </v>

2175
02:01:00.791 --> 02:01:05.791
<v Speaker 2>relatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So see me.</v>

2176
02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Simeon and levi are brethren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instruments of cruelty or in their </v>

2177
02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:12.910
<v Speaker 2>habitations oh my soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come out now into their secret.</v>

2178
02:01:12.911 --> 02:01:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Until their assembly might honor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be not thou united.</v>

2179
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:20.790
<v Speaker 2>For in their anger they slew a man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their self self will they dig down a </v>

2180
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:21.160
<v Speaker 2>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cursed be their anger,</v>

2181
02:01:21.161 --> 02:01:23.440
<v Speaker 2>for it was fierce and their route for it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was cruel.</v>

2182
02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:26.290
<v Speaker 2>I will divide them in jacob and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scattered them in Israel.</v>

2183
02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Judah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thou art,</v>

2184
02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:33.540
<v Speaker 2>he who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brethren shall praise thy hand shall </v>

2185
02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:35.920
<v Speaker 2>be in the neck of dynamics that father's</v>
<v Speaker 2>children shall bow down before the judah</v>

2186
02:01:35.921 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>is alliance help from the prey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My son art gone up.</v>

2187
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:45.340
<v Speaker 2>He stooped down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couched as a lion and as an old lion </v>

2188
02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:47.810
<v Speaker 2>who shall rosa bump the sceptre shall </v>
<v Speaker 2>not depart from judah,</v>

2189
02:01:48.010 --> 02:01:52.220
<v Speaker 2>nor a law giver from between his feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>until shiloh come and unto him shall the</v>

2190
02:01:52.221 --> 02:01:57.221
<v Speaker 2>gathering of the people be joseph is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruitful bough,</v>

2191
02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:01.760
<v Speaker 2>even a fruitful bough by a well whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>branches run over the wall.</v>

2192
02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:05.150
<v Speaker 2>The archers have sorely grieved him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shot at him and hated him,</v>

2193
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:10.510
<v Speaker 2>but his bowl abode in strength and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arms of his hands were made strong by </v>

2194
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:11.180
<v Speaker 2>the hands of the mighty god of jacob.</v>

2195
02:02:11.810 --> 02:02:14.570
<v Speaker 2>For then since the shepherd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stone of Israel,</v>

2196
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:22.330
<v Speaker 2>even by the god of my father who shall </v>
<v Speaker 2>help the and by the almighty who shall </v>

2197
02:02:22.330 --> 02:02:25.751
<v Speaker 2>bless thee with the blessings of heavens</v>
<v Speaker 2>above blessings of the deep that a </v>

2198
02:02:25.751 --> 02:02:27.260
<v Speaker 2>thunder blessings of the beasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Breasts in the womb,</v>

2199
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:32.950
<v Speaker 2>the blessings of your father have </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevailed above the blessings of my </v>

2200
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:33.920
<v Speaker 2>progenitors unto the utmost bound of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>everlasting health.</v>

2201
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:38.090
<v Speaker 2>They shall be on the head of joseph and </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the crown of the head of him that was</v>

2202
02:02:38.091 --> 02:02:42.470
<v Speaker 2>separate from his brother and all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the 12 tribes of Israel.</v>

2203
02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:46.160
<v Speaker 2>And this is it that they're farther </v>
<v Speaker 2>spake unto them and blessed them.</v>

2204
02:02:46.161 --> 02:02:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Everyone according to his blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he blessed them so that what we see here</v>

2205
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:55.670
<v Speaker 2>is an echo in some sense of what happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mesopotamian creation story.</v>

2206
02:02:55.671 --> 02:03:00.671
<v Speaker 2>When the mesopotamian creation story is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dragon of chaos tie matt and her </v>

2207
02:03:03.021 --> 02:03:08.021
<v Speaker 2>consort appsu freshwater and saltwater </v>
<v Speaker 2>respectively in they're mingled </v>

2208
02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:11.690
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2209
02:03:11.690 --> 02:03:14.600
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that combination of chaos and order,</v>

2210
02:03:14.601 --> 02:03:18.260
<v Speaker 2>it gives rise to the first assembly of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ancient gods.</v>

2211
02:03:18.261 --> 02:03:23.261
<v Speaker 2>And then the ancient gods kill appsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>casually and foolishly and enraged,</v>

2212
02:03:24.801 --> 02:03:27.920
<v Speaker 2>tie a mat with their foolishness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorance.</v>

2213
02:03:27.921 --> 02:03:32.921
<v Speaker 2>And she comes back with a vengeance in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the meantime.</v>

2214
02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:36.860
<v Speaker 2>And then she produces this huge army of </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters and puts king knew the worst of</v>

2215
02:03:36.861 --> 02:03:41.861
<v Speaker 2>the monsters out its head and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>decides she's going to take out her </v>

2216
02:03:41.861 --> 02:03:43.340
<v Speaker 2>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a little warning from 3000</v>

2217
02:03:43.341 --> 02:03:47.390
<v Speaker 2>years ago about foolishly undermining </v>
<v Speaker 2>your tradition.</v>

2218
02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:52.760
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gods in their friends and go out and</v>

2219
02:03:52.761 --> 02:03:57.761
<v Speaker 2>try to fight against high mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come back with their tails between </v>

2220
02:03:57.761 --> 02:03:59.660
<v Speaker 2>their legs continually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then a new god appears on the scene.</v>

2221
02:03:59.661 --> 02:04:03.020
<v Speaker 2>And that's marduk and he's got eyes all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way around his head and he can speak</v>

2222
02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:08.050
<v Speaker 2>words of magic and they know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something new about this newest </v>

2223
02:04:10.161 --> 02:04:10.520
<v Speaker 2>god.</v>

2224
02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:14.030
<v Speaker 2>It's his capacity for vision in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity for articulate speech.</v>

2225
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:15.170
<v Speaker 2>And so they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2226
02:04:15.171 --> 02:04:18.170
<v Speaker 2>why don't you go out and try to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the chaos?</v>

2227
02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:19.910
<v Speaker 2>And mark says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2228
02:04:19.911 --> 02:04:20.810
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem,</v>

2229
02:04:20.811 --> 02:04:22.670
<v Speaker 2>but here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You elect me,</v>

2230
02:04:22.671 --> 02:04:27.671
<v Speaker 2>top god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I determine the destiny of the </v>

2231
02:04:27.671 --> 02:04:31.031
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're desperate because like </v>

2232
02:04:31.031 --> 02:04:31.031
<v Speaker 2>thai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>matt is coming to get them.</v>

2233
02:04:31.031 --> 02:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>That's chaos with the worst of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible bonsers.</v>

2234
02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:35.510
<v Speaker 2>They're probably thinking he's not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to win anyways.</v>

2235
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:40.320
<v Speaker 2>And so they agree and how he goes and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>confronts timeout.</v>

2236
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:45.350
<v Speaker 2>He was the goddess of chaos and he cuts </v>
<v Speaker 2>her into pieces and he makes the world </v>

2237
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:49.671
<v Speaker 2>out of her pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of his names is he who makes </v>

2238
02:04:49.671 --> 02:04:50.850
<v Speaker 2>ingenious things out of the combat with </v>
<v Speaker 2>tire math,</v>

2239
02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:53.970
<v Speaker 2>which is so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a remarkable.</v>

2240
02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:59.910
<v Speaker 2>That's a remarkable bit of nomenclature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who's should be at the pinnacle,</v>

2241
02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:05.460
<v Speaker 2>the forest that sees and speaks and goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to confront chaos voluntarily.</v>

2242
02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:08.760
<v Speaker 2>You know how many years it took people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure that out.</v>

2243
02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:12.570
<v Speaker 2>That's like the pinnacle discovery of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>

2244
02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:14.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's echoed here.</v>

2245
02:05:15.090 --> 02:05:17.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see simeon and levi are too angry.</v>

2246
02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:23.480
<v Speaker 2>The other brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all have flaws and faults of </v>

2247
02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:24.780
<v Speaker 2>various sorts and so they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevated to the highest place,</v>

2248
02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:30.080
<v Speaker 2>but joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he has his coat of many colors </v>

2249
02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:30.780
<v Speaker 2>and because he lands on his feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter where he goes and because he's</v>

2250
02:05:30.781 --> 02:05:35.100
<v Speaker 2>not resentful and bitter and malevolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and genocidal and,</v>

2251
02:05:35.330 --> 02:05:40.330
<v Speaker 2>and he's not shaking his fist at the sky</v>
<v Speaker 2>or yelling at god because of trump,</v>

2252
02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:43.410
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he's the,</v>

2253
02:05:43.530 --> 02:05:48.530
<v Speaker 2>he's the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the right representative of the 12 </v>

2254
02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:50.100
<v Speaker 2>tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's brilliant.</v>

2255
02:05:50.130 --> 02:05:51.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a brilliant story.</v>

2256
02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:58.460
<v Speaker 2>All these are the 12 tribes of Israel </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is it that their father spake </v>

2257
02:05:58.460 --> 02:05:59.250
<v Speaker 2>unto them and blessed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone according To his blessing,</v>

2258
02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:04.080
<v Speaker 2>he blessed them when jacob had made an </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of commanding his son.</v>

2259
02:06:04.081 --> 02:06:09.081
<v Speaker 2>So it's the last thing he does to state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows that these are the 12 tribes </v>

2260
02:06:09.081 --> 02:06:13.641
<v Speaker 2>that will progress into the future of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this people and now he's trying it.</v>

2261
02:06:15.810 --> 02:06:20.810
<v Speaker 2>The last thing he does is to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchically organize their relative </v>

2262
02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:25.461
<v Speaker 2>virtues as an indication of what has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been learned and when jacob has made an </v>

2263
02:06:26.581 --> 02:06:29.520
<v Speaker 2>end of commanding his sons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gathered up his feet into the bed and</v>

2264
02:06:29.521 --> 02:06:32.040
<v Speaker 2>yielded up the ghost and was gathered </v>
<v Speaker 2>unto his people.</v>

2265
02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:35.580
<v Speaker 2>And joseph fell upon his father's face </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wept upon him and kissed him.</v>

2266
02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:40.960
<v Speaker 2>And joseph commanded his servants to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>physicians to embalm his father and the </v>

2267
02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:41.580
<v Speaker 2>physicians embalmed Israel.</v>

2268
02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:46.680
<v Speaker 2>When the days of his morning we're past </v>
<v Speaker 2>joseph's spake unto the house of pharaoh</v>

2269
02:06:46.681 --> 02:06:51.681
<v Speaker 2>sayIng,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if now I have found grace in your eyes </v>

2270
02:06:51.681 --> 02:06:55.580
<v Speaker 2>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pray you in the ears of pharaoh </v>

2271
02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:55.580
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father made me swear of saying low.</v>

2272
02:06:55.580 --> 02:07:00.501
<v Speaker 2>I die in my grave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I have digged for me in the land </v>

2273
02:07:00.501 --> 02:07:00.870
<v Speaker 2>of canaan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There shalt thou burry me now,</v>

2274
02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:01.950
<v Speaker 2>therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me go up.</v>

2275
02:07:01.951 --> 02:07:04.320
<v Speaker 2>I pray thee and bury my father and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>will come again.</v>

2276
02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:09.680
<v Speaker 2>And pharaoh said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go up and bury thy father according as </v>

2277
02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:12.330
<v Speaker 2>he made these swear for his son's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carried them into the land of canaan and</v>

2278
02:07:12.331 --> 02:07:15.030
<v Speaker 2>bury them in the cave of the field of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mac pella,</v>

2279
02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:17.520
<v Speaker 2>which abraham bought with the field for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a possession of,</v>

2280
02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:22.780
<v Speaker 2>of burying place of effort on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hittite before mammary and joseph </v>

2281
02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:27.141
<v Speaker 2>returned into Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and his brother and all that went up </v>

2282
02:07:27.141 --> 02:07:30.470
<v Speaker 2>to him and that all and all that went up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him to bury his father after he is </v>

2283
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:32.100
<v Speaker 2>brewed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after he had buried his father.</v>

2284
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:35.860
<v Speaker 2>And when joseph's brethren saw that </v>
<v Speaker 2>their father was dead,</v>

2285
02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:41.460
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joseph will now hate us and will </v>

2286
02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:44.260
<v Speaker 2>certainly pay back to us all the evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>which we did unto him.</v>

2287
02:07:45.210 --> 02:07:48.940
<v Speaker 2>And they sent a messenger saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father did command before he died,</v>

2288
02:07:48.941 --> 02:07:53.941
<v Speaker 2>saying four shall say unto joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgive I pray thee now the trespass of </v>

2289
02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:56.260
<v Speaker 2>thy brethren and their sin pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>sniffily.</v>

2290
02:07:56.261 --> 02:07:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Really for tHey did unto thee evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now we pray thee.</v>

2291
02:07:59.471 --> 02:08:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Forgive the trespass of the servants of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the god of thy father.</v>

2292
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:05.410
<v Speaker 2>And joseph wept when they spake unto </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

2293
02:08:05.810 --> 02:08:09.010
<v Speaker 2>and his brethren also went and fell down</v>
<v Speaker 2>before his face and they said,</v>

2294
02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:10.600
<v Speaker 2>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we be thy servants.</v>

2295
02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:16.980
<v Speaker 2>And joseph said unto them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear not for am I in the place of god,</v>

2296
02:08:17.230 --> 02:08:19.390
<v Speaker 2>but as for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you thought evil against me,</v>

2297
02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:22.240
<v Speaker 2>but god meant it unto good to bring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pass,</v>

2298
02:08:22.570 --> 02:08:25.240
<v Speaker 2>as it is this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to save much people alive.</v>

2299
02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore fear not I will nourish you </v>

2300
02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:35.851
<v Speaker 2>and your little ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he comforted them and spake kIndly </v>

2301
02:08:35.851 --> 02:08:38.221
<v Speaker 2>unto them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the the idea there is that there is </v>

2302
02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:53.011
<v Speaker 2>no evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so evil that good cannot triumph over </v>

2303
02:08:53.011 --> 02:08:53.011
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2304
02:08:54.250 --> 02:08:59.250
<v Speaker 2>And joseph dwelt in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and his father's house and joseph </v>

2305
02:08:59.250 --> 02:09:02.131
<v Speaker 2>lived 110 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And joseph saw frms children of the </v>

2306
02:09:02.131 --> 02:09:05.341
<v Speaker 2>third generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The children also have makir the son of </v>

2307
02:09:05.341 --> 02:09:06.070
<v Speaker 2>menace that were brought up upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>joseph's knees.</v>

2308
02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:12.390
<v Speaker 2>And joseph said unto his brethren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I die and god will surely visit you and </v>

2309
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:15.310
<v Speaker 2>bring you out of this land unto the land</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he swore to abraham,</v>

2310
02:09:15.311 --> 02:09:19.720
<v Speaker 2>to isaac and jacob and joseph took an </v>
<v Speaker 2>oath of the children of Israel saying,</v>

2311
02:09:19.721 --> 02:09:23.590
<v Speaker 2>god will surely visit you and she'll end</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shall carry my bones from hence.</v>

2312
02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:28.800
<v Speaker 2>So joseph died being 110 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they embalmed him and he was put into a </v>

2313
02:09:30.641 --> 02:09:34.840
<v Speaker 2>coffin in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's genesis.</v>

2314
02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:37.730
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2315
02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:45.240
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

2316
02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:55.240
<v Speaker 2>So thank you all for persevering.</v>

2317
02:09:55.490 --> 02:10:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2318
02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2319
02:10:26.690 --> 02:10:29.120
<v Speaker 2>This has been very worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as I'm concerned,</v>

2320
02:10:29.121 --> 02:10:34.121
<v Speaker 2>I learned an awful lot and so I'm very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much looking forward to continuing it </v>

2321
02:10:34.121 --> 02:10:37.360
<v Speaker 2>and thank you all very much for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>support and your rapt attention and your</v>

2322
02:10:37.361 --> 02:10:41.230
<v Speaker 2>seriousness in this endeavor and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>care and all of that.</v>

2323
02:10:41.231 --> 02:10:44.380
<v Speaker 2>It's really been a privilege to be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this.</v>

2324
02:10:44.410 --> 02:10:48.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely surreal thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage.</v>

2325
02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:50.180
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far,</v>

2326
02:10:50.181 --> 02:10:55.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about 5 million people have </v>

2327
02:10:55.181 --> 02:10:56.180
<v Speaker 2>watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's seems to be a very good thing.</v>

2328
02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:56.580
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2329
02:10:58.330 --> 02:11:03.330
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

2330
02:11:07.390 --> 02:11:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've asked a question in the last </v>

2331
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:16.410
<v Speaker 2>three sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't ask a question today </v>

2332
02:11:16.410 --> 02:11:20.100
<v Speaker 2>because I never get through everyone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd like to have some questions from </v>

2333
02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:23.020
<v Speaker 2>people that I haven't answered questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>from before,</v>

2334
02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:24.070
<v Speaker 2>if that's okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I professor peterson,</v>

2336
02:11:28.341 --> 02:11:30.710
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much for my community and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the jewish community.</v>

2337
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:35.950
<v Speaker 4>So many people who have been inspired by</v>
<v Speaker 4>you to be better people and I wouldn't </v>

2338
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:36.830
<v Speaker 4>be able to speak to without saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So thank you very much.</v>

2339
02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:40.850
<v Speaker 4>A couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing I wanted to do is make a</v>

2340
02:11:40.851 --> 02:11:45.851
<v Speaker 4>quick comment that you might find </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting that in the jewish </v>

2341
02:11:45.851 --> 02:11:45.851
<v Speaker 4>astrological calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2342
02:11:45.851 --> 02:11:50.440
<v Speaker 4>we read the yearly cycle of the five </v>
<v Speaker 4>books of moses and it just so happens </v>

2343
02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:50.930
<v Speaker 4>that we are reading this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a part of the,</v>

2344
02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:53.240
<v Speaker 4>of the twitter story that very </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

2345
02:11:53.241 --> 02:11:55.100
<v Speaker 4>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And synchronistic,</v>

2346
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:58.730
<v Speaker 4>which brings me into a question that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to ask you about,</v>

2347
02:11:59.060 --> 02:12:01.640
<v Speaker 4>which is one question with two parts </v>
<v Speaker 4>about your knowledge of,</v>

2348
02:12:01.710 --> 02:12:02.720
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of hebrew,</v>

2349
02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:05.330
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you look at the torah scrolls</v>

2350
02:12:05.331 --> 02:12:07.460
<v Speaker 4>that you find in a synagogue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are no vowels,</v>

2351
02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:09.320
<v Speaker 4>there are no sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There.</v>

2352
02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:11.510
<v Speaker 4>It is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is chaos,</v>

2353
02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:13.700
<v Speaker 4>chaos and order is trying to be bought </v>
<v Speaker 4>into it.</v>

2354
02:12:13.701 --> 02:12:18.701
<v Speaker 4>I'm wondering how knowledge of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledgeable are you of the hebrew </v>

2355
02:12:18.701 --> 02:12:18.701
<v Speaker 4>which has many layers of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2356
02:12:18.701 --> 02:12:19.200
<v Speaker 4>of dimensional,</v>

2357
02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:22.740
<v Speaker 2>staggeringly ignorant of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2358
02:12:22.741 --> 02:12:23.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2359
02:12:23.161 --> 02:12:25.590
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of commentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2360
02:12:25.591 --> 02:12:30.591
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to zero in on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with each of the phrases that we </v>

2361
02:12:30.591 --> 02:12:35.450
<v Speaker 2>went through today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably looked at 10 different </v>

2362
02:12:35.450 --> 02:12:37.581
<v Speaker 2>commentaries and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I have this underlying </v>

2363
02:12:37.581 --> 02:12:41.811
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalytic knowledge that it's sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like if you have a bunch of different</v>

2364
02:12:42.990 --> 02:12:47.990
<v Speaker 2>templates to look at things through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then something shines through all those </v>

2365
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:50.220
<v Speaker 2>templates at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very unlikely.</v>

2366
02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:55.440
<v Speaker 2>And sO then you can know a coincidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>is one thing,</v>

2367
02:12:55.771 --> 02:12:58.500
<v Speaker 2>but five coincidence is that's no longer</v>
<v Speaker 2>a coincidence.</v>

2368
02:12:58.501 --> 02:13:03.501
<v Speaker 2>That's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think I'm hoping that despite </v>

2369
02:13:03.501 --> 02:13:07.041
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many things that I don't know that </v>

2370
02:13:07.041 --> 02:13:10.760
<v Speaker 2>there's enough things that I do know to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of weave my way through this with </v>

2371
02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:12.270
<v Speaker 2>some degree of utility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not certainty.</v>

2372
02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:15.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>BecauSe I just was just the second part,</v>

2373
02:13:15.041 --> 02:13:16.590
<v Speaker 4>which I guess maybe you don't know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2374
02:13:17.290 --> 02:13:22.290
<v Speaker 4>the jewish oral stories that date back </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost as long as these stories which </v>

2375
02:13:22.290 --> 02:13:26.191
<v Speaker 4>fill in a lot of mindblowingly crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>random and so many details about these </v>

2376
02:13:26.191 --> 02:13:30.871
<v Speaker 4>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was just wondering if you had </v>

2377
02:13:30.871 --> 02:13:30.871
<v Speaker 4>encountered any of them before.</v>

2378
02:13:30.871 --> 02:13:30.871
<v Speaker 2>I've encountered some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

2379
02:13:30.871 --> 02:13:32.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's well as you know,</v>

2380
02:13:32.611 --> 02:13:34.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rich tradition.</v>

2381
02:13:34.561 --> 02:13:38.160
<v Speaker 2>And so I haven't encountered enough of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2382
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Were you thinking of anything in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sPecific specifically in relationship to</v>

2383
02:13:42.331 --> 02:13:42.960
<v Speaker 2>this story?</v>

2384
02:13:43.330 --> 02:13:45.130
<v Speaker 4>Not in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually forgot it.</v>

2385
02:13:45.131 --> 02:13:46.930
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was intending to bring you a,</v>

2386
02:13:47.130 --> 02:13:50.680
<v Speaker 4>a book of majestic store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a hell of a thing to say now.</v>

2387
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:53.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

2388
02:13:53.710 --> 02:13:54.340
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2389
02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:56.350
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I had to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2390
02:13:56.830 --> 02:14:01.830
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe for the exodus version I'll bring </v>

2391
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.830
<v Speaker 4>you back.</v>

2392
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.830
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be good.</v>

2393
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2394
02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:05.260
<v Speaker 5>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr.</v>

2395
02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:10.260
<v Speaker 5>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just like to ask you to please </v>

2396
02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:10.890
<v Speaker 5>talk about what you called a psychic </v>
<v Speaker 5>death,</v>

2397
02:14:10.891 --> 02:14:12.420
<v Speaker 5>also known as an ego death.</v>

2398
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

2399
02:14:13.810 --> 02:14:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Say that again.</v>

2400
02:14:14.770 --> 02:14:19.770
<v Speaker 5>Would you please talk about what young </v>
<v Speaker 5>refer to as a psychic death also called </v>

2401
02:14:19.770 --> 02:14:20.270
<v Speaker 5>an ego death.</v>

2402
02:14:22.690 --> 02:14:25.150
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens when someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>loves you betrays you.</v>

2403
02:14:26.890 --> 02:14:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that.</v>

2404
02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Like the world is complicated beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehension,</v>

2405
02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:37.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you only see a very little bit of </v>

2406
02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:39.691
<v Speaker 2>it and the way you structured your </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding is you make assumptions </v>

2407
02:14:39.691 --> 02:14:41.100
<v Speaker 2>about things and they're simplifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>assumptions.</v>

2408
02:14:41.101 --> 02:14:46.101
<v Speaker 2>So if you trust someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you reduce their complexity massively,</v>

2409
02:14:46.391 --> 02:14:47.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like,</v>

2410
02:14:47.710 --> 02:14:52.710
<v Speaker 2>let's say we were married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's a whole bunch of ways that </v>

2411
02:14:52.710 --> 02:14:53.770
<v Speaker 2>you're going to act that are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>simpler.</v>

2412
02:14:54.910 --> 02:14:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I can tolerate being around you </v>

2413
02:14:59.910 --> 02:15:00.460
<v Speaker 2>in some sense because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything at once.</v>

2414
02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Now those simplifying structures are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchically assembled and some of </v>

2415
02:15:09.731 --> 02:15:13.030
<v Speaker 2>them are far more important than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust is one of them,</v>

2416
02:15:13.031 --> 02:15:15.070
<v Speaker 2>especially trust in loved ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family members,</v>

2417
02:15:15.071 --> 02:15:16.780
<v Speaker 2>which is why I'd be trailed by a family </v>
<v Speaker 2>member,</v>

2418
02:15:16.781 --> 02:15:21.250
<v Speaker 2>is really catastrophic because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>destabilizes your past,</v>

2419
02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:22.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the memories you have,</v>

2420
02:15:22.601 --> 02:15:27.601
<v Speaker 2>it destabilizes your present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It destabilizes your future is shakes </v>

2421
02:15:27.601 --> 02:15:31.201
<v Speaker 2>your faith in human beings including </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and everything collapses and </v>

2422
02:15:31.201 --> 02:15:36.151
<v Speaker 2>that's an ego death and so now </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath the ego as far as young was </v>

2423
02:15:36.911 --> 02:15:38.980
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was another structure that he called the</v>

2424
02:15:38.981 --> 02:15:43.900
<v Speaker 2>self and the self is this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>remains constant across ego deaths,</v>

2425
02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:49.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's deeper and less personal.</v>

2426
02:15:49.630 --> 02:15:54.630
<v Speaker 2>It's architectural and it's the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the eagle collapses into when it </v>

2427
02:15:54.671 --> 02:15:58.900
<v Speaker 2>collapses and then rebuIlds the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that across time,</v>

2428
02:15:59.590 --> 02:16:03.880
<v Speaker 2>but that's when an ego death is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's variants of that because you can</v>

2429
02:16:03.881 --> 02:16:08.200
<v Speaker 2>have a voluntary or involuntary ego </v>
<v Speaker 2>death and a voluntary ego.</v>

2430
02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Death is when you learn a bunch and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're willing to let go,</v>

2431
02:16:11.710 --> 02:16:14.870
<v Speaker 2>so that would be your own emulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like your lighting,</v>

2432
02:16:14.871 --> 02:16:15.620
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your a phoenix,</v>

2433
02:16:15.621 --> 02:16:19.840
<v Speaker 2>and your lighting yourself on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a much better idea even though it</v>

2434
02:16:19.841 --> 02:16:23.890
<v Speaker 2>can still be really harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The involuntary ego deaths,</v>

2435
02:16:23.900 --> 02:16:28.900
<v Speaker 2>they're really hard on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will do almost anything to stop </v>

2436
02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:28.930
<v Speaker 2>that from happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is partly,</v>

2437
02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:34.080
<v Speaker 2>they fight to maintain their group </v>
<v Speaker 2>fostered axiomatic simplifications.</v>

2438
02:16:36.490 --> 02:16:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not surprising because it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You lose your like that ego death is a </v>

2439
02:16:41.771 --> 02:16:44.650
<v Speaker 2>journey into the underworld or it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse into chaos.</v>

2440
02:16:44.850 --> 02:16:46.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's not so bad if you do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposefully.</v>

2441
02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:49.420
<v Speaker 2>But in the pinocchio story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2442
02:16:49.421 --> 02:16:54.421
<v Speaker 2>that's exemplified by pinocchio going </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to the depths to rescue his father </v>

2443
02:16:54.421 --> 02:16:54.940
<v Speaker 2>from the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he does that voluntarily,</v>

2444
02:16:54.941 --> 02:16:57.490
<v Speaker 2>but it damn near killed him right in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2445
02:16:57.491 --> 02:17:00.180
<v Speaker 2>he hardly gets out of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second,</v>

2446
02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:03.760
<v Speaker 2>he actually drowns in dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he comes back to life.</v>

2447
02:17:03.970 --> 02:17:08.970
<v Speaker 2>So even if you do it voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still well think it's just better </v>

2448
02:17:09.321 --> 02:17:11.960
<v Speaker 2>than doing it in voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the other alternative.</v>

2449
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:13.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's what it is.</v>

2450
02:17:14.910 --> 02:17:15.450
<v Speaker 2>You bet.</v>

2451
02:17:21.690 --> 02:17:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>

2452
02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2453
02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:28.640
<v Speaker 2>so I've been listening to bach to all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these biblical lectures for the second </v>

2454
02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:29.510
<v Speaker 2>time now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

2455
02:17:29.580 --> 02:17:32.730
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to show you an observation I </v>
<v Speaker 2>came upon because I was trying to find a</v>

2456
02:17:32.731 --> 02:17:34.770
<v Speaker 2>question that you haven't been asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

2457
02:17:34.830 --> 02:17:37.620
<v Speaker 2>which is harder than doing my ryerson </v>
<v Speaker 2>exams,</v>

2458
02:17:37.621 --> 02:17:40.370
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2459
02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:43.260
<v Speaker 2>so I've noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're getting funnier.</v>

2460
02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no.</v>

2461
02:17:46.351 --> 02:17:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I think michael koren said that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>week I think.</v>

2462
02:17:48.571 --> 02:17:53.571
<v Speaker 2>But the word he used was bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think actually I'm feeling better,</v>

2463
02:17:53.611 --> 02:17:55.680
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually have a sense of humor.</v>

2464
02:17:55.681 --> 02:17:57.150
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to believe that.</v>

2465
02:17:57.740 --> 02:18:02.740
<v Speaker 2>So it sort of comes back when I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling like I'm going to die at any </v>

2466
02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:03.020
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2467
02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I basically noticed one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making more attempts at jokes,</v>

2468
02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:07.260
<v Speaker 2>so that's great.</v>

2469
02:18:12.610 --> 02:18:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2470
02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:19.260
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you to those Jokes are landing </v>

2471
02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:22.241
<v Speaker 2>more often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's this third element </v>

2472
02:18:22.241 --> 02:18:24.650
<v Speaker 2>which I think was what steve martin quit</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of,</v>

2473
02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:29.680
<v Speaker 2>which is that I think the audience is </v>
<v Speaker 2>anticipating jokes more and they're </v>

2474
02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:29.680
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2475
02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed people laughing more at </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that aren't intending to be </v>

2476
02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:34.580
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was just wondering what you make of</v>

2477
02:18:34.581 --> 02:18:36.710
<v Speaker 2>that and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their intended.</v>

2478
02:18:37.010 --> 02:18:42.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping they're intended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because I keep a straight face </v>

2479
02:18:42.010 --> 02:18:42.010
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean they're not intended to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes,</v>

2480
02:18:42.350 --> 02:18:43.880
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2481
02:18:43.881 --> 02:18:44.600
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2482
02:18:44.601 --> 02:18:47.480
<v Speaker 2>one of the things is like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've tried to keep this,</v>

2483
02:18:47.570 --> 02:18:50.330
<v Speaker 2>I learned a while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably about five years ago,</v>

2484
02:18:50.510 --> 02:18:55.510
<v Speaker 2>that even when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>really serious matters that if you're </v>

2485
02:18:55.510 --> 02:18:57.140
<v Speaker 2>not handling it with a light touch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not an expert at it.</v>

2486
02:18:57.141 --> 02:19:02.141
<v Speaker 2>You're not a master at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'd think while there are some </v>

2487
02:19:02.141 --> 02:19:03.020
<v Speaker 2>things that are so deep and dark that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't handle it with a light touch,</v>

2488
02:19:03.350 --> 02:19:06.500
<v Speaker 2>and that's actually not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

2489
02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:08.870
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean you make light of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2490
02:19:08.871 --> 02:19:11.030
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tHat you don't.</v>

2491
02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:15.110
<v Speaker 2>It's minimal necessary force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2492
02:19:15.111 --> 02:19:17.300
<v Speaker 2>You don't hit it any harder than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to,</v>

2493
02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:22.560
<v Speaker 2>and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an art when you're discussing </v>

2494
02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:22.560
<v Speaker 2>serious matters and so</v>

2495
02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:27.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the upshots of that is that </v>

2496
02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:30.030
<v Speaker 2>because we're discussing serious matters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and serious matters are being discussed </v>

2497
02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:33.611
<v Speaker 2>in the ultra large right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be really good if everybody </v>

2498
02:19:33.611 --> 02:19:33.611
<v Speaker 2>could keep their sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2499
02:19:33.611 --> 02:19:37.460
<v Speaker 2>when I see positive signs of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a lot of satirical activity</v>

2500
02:19:37.461 --> 02:19:38.420
<v Speaker 2>on the net,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2501
02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:41.450
<v Speaker 2>and that could easily catalyze into </v>
<v Speaker 2>horror mob,</v>

2502
02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:42.980
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

2503
02:19:42.981 --> 02:19:47.981
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that that's happening to some </v>

2504
02:19:47.981 --> 02:19:50.171
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it's satire and comedy and </v>

2505
02:19:50.171 --> 02:19:50.450
<v Speaker 2>as long as we can keep a sense of humor </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>

2506
02:19:50.451 --> 02:19:55.451
<v Speaker 2>then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we're not as close to disaster as </v>

2507
02:19:55.451 --> 02:19:56.890
<v Speaker 2>we might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ANd so one,</v>

2508
02:19:56.980 --> 02:20:01.980
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I have found </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather ominous is that there are </v>

2509
02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:01.980
<v Speaker 2>comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2510
02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:05.930
<v Speaker 2>being persecuted for under free speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>restriction legislation,</v>

2511
02:20:05.931 --> 02:20:07.490
<v Speaker 2>which I think is absolutely appalling.</v>

2512
02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:12.730
<v Speaker 2>But also that there were comedians now </v>
<v Speaker 2>who won't perform on university </v>

2513
02:20:12.730 --> 02:20:15.971
<v Speaker 2>campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John cleese won't seinfeld.</v>

2514
02:20:16.041 --> 02:20:16.490
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2515
02:20:16.491 --> 02:20:18.440
<v Speaker 2>you know how offensive he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no wonder that.</v>

2516
02:20:18.450 --> 02:20:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's like the straightest nicest </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian you could Possibly imagine.</v>

2517
02:20:23.031 --> 02:20:28.031
<v Speaker 2>he won't perform on college campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think louis ck won't perform an or or </v>

2518
02:20:28.031 --> 02:20:32.090
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bad sign.</v>

2519
02:20:32.091 --> 02:20:34.280
<v Speaker 2>But no humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humor is good.</v>

2520
02:20:34.281 --> 02:20:39.281
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of watching how I'm represented on </v>

2521
02:20:39.281 --> 02:20:43.901
<v Speaker 2>the web weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's all these memes that have </v>

2522
02:20:43.901 --> 02:20:43.901
<v Speaker 2>emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2523
02:20:43.901 --> 02:20:48.431
<v Speaker 2>thousands of the bloody things and most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them are comical and that's good.</v>

2524
02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Like people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2525
02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:54.650
<v Speaker 2>are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that they're doing,</v>

2526
02:20:54.651 --> 02:20:59.651
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's being done with a relatively </v>

2527
02:20:59.651 --> 02:20:59.960
<v Speaker 2>light touch and that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

2528
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:02.810
<v Speaker 2>that's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to have a sense of humor.</v>

2529
02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that makes life </v>

2530
02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:07.900
<v Speaker 2>bearable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2531
02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:09.890
<v Speaker 2>or maybe even better than bearable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you bet.</v>

2532
02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

2533

2535
02:21:28.470 --> 02:21:28.470

2536
02:21:28.470 --> 02:21:31.570
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just want to say this,</v>

2537
02:21:31.571 --> 02:21:33.780

<v Speaker 6>don't gEt too enthusiastic about that.</v>

2538
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:39.080
<v Speaker 6>I wrote you an essay of a question and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then I use the,</v>

2539
02:21:39.081 --> 02:21:44.081
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the lecture or the essay writing guide </v>

2540
02:21:44.081 --> 02:21:44.880
<v Speaker 6>on site to 30 to narrow it down to just </v>
<v Speaker 6>a few pages,</v>

2541
02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:47.690
<v Speaker 6>a few lines.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then during this,</v>

2542
02:21:47.700 --> 02:21:50.040
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this particular lecture,</v>

2543
02:21:50.130 --> 02:21:52.650
<v Speaker 6>like the zigzag slide manifest again and</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought,</v>

2544
02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:57.750
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>basically just had all my questions </v>

2545
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.750
<v Speaker 6>answered.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2546
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:59.760
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>basicaLly I just,</v>

2547
02:21:59.810 --> 02:22:00.840
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to ask,</v>

2548
02:22:00.841 --> 02:22:04.190
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea of a,</v>

2549
02:22:05.930 --> 02:22:08.550
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've made a lecture that was,</v>

2550
02:22:08.551 --> 02:22:11.550
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on youtube many years ago and uh,</v>

2551
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:14.460
<v Speaker 6>you keeP referring to cain and abel and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2552
02:22:14.461 --> 02:22:19.461
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the death of abel by cain and the curse </v>

2553
02:22:19.461 --> 02:22:19.730
<v Speaker 6>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think that that was the,</v>

2554
02:22:19.731 --> 02:22:22.430
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was the single brother,</v>

2555
02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:24.390
<v Speaker 6>two brothers conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2556
02:22:24.450 --> 02:22:29.450
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but here we have in the sense of jacob </v>

2557
02:22:29.450 --> 02:22:32.130
<v Speaker 6>the 12.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was one who was one who's good,</v>

2558
02:22:32.131 --> 02:22:36.720
<v Speaker 6>one who was enable archetype and there </v>
<v Speaker 6>are 1211 that came after him.</v>

2559
02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:39.570
<v Speaker 6>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2560
02:22:39.571 --> 02:22:43.510
<v Speaker 6>maybe there was something about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>division or a.</v>

2561
02:22:43.950 --> 02:22:45.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good observation.</v>

2562
02:22:45.301 --> 02:22:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2563
02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a bit of variability </v>

2564
02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:52.700
<v Speaker 2>because ruben and ruben isn't quite as </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad as the rest,</v>

2565
02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:54.930
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's probably easier for the</v>

2566
02:22:54.931 --> 02:22:56.370
<v Speaker 2>cane side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the multiply.</v>

2567
02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Luckily it's not as powerful because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't do anything like it.</v>

2568
02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2569
02:23:05.641 --> 02:23:06.660
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

2570
02:23:06.690 --> 02:23:11.690
<v Speaker 2>there's young was often included,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accused of manichaean isn't not </v>

2571
02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:14.790
<v Speaker 2>pronouncing that properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a,</v>

2572
02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:18.330
<v Speaker 2>there was a variant of christian dogma </v>
<v Speaker 2>that held that good and evil.</v>

2573
02:23:18.331 --> 02:23:22.710
<v Speaker 2>We're separate metaphysical realities </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they were battling for the,</v>

2574
02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:25.890
<v Speaker 2>for governance of the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2575
02:23:25.891 --> 02:23:30.891
<v Speaker 2>But they both had an independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence and the classical christian </v>

2576
02:23:30.891 --> 02:23:33.360
<v Speaker 2>idea which won out over that was the no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that good was real,</v>

2577
02:23:33.361 --> 02:23:38.361
<v Speaker 2>but evil was the absence of good now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that produced all sorts of the absence </v>

2578
02:23:38.361 --> 02:23:42.351
<v Speaker 2>of good produces all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences and it is interesting to </v>

2579
02:23:42.351 --> 02:23:45.921
<v Speaker 2>read young because he does get kinda </v>
<v Speaker 2>manichaean in his discussions and I </v>

2580
02:23:45.921 --> 02:23:50.490
<v Speaker 2>think it was partly because he was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned about what happened in nazi </v>

2581
02:23:50.490 --> 02:23:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Germany and then with a cold war </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards,</v>

2582
02:23:51.391 --> 02:23:56.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because evil seem to be a palpable </v>

2583
02:23:56.391 --> 02:23:56.391
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

2584
02:23:56.391 --> 02:23:57.780
<v Speaker 2>BuT I don't think that it's as powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>as good.</v>

2585
02:23:59.180 --> 02:24:04.180
<v Speaker 2>But I do think it's easier for it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiply because it's what's easier </v>

2586
02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:08.301
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to be resentful and hostile </v>

2587
02:24:08.301 --> 02:24:10.140
<v Speaker 2>and bitter and do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's easy.</v>

2588
02:24:10.650 --> 02:24:15.650
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible and it's hard on people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't require a tremendous </v>

2589
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:18.711
<v Speaker 2>amount of faith or effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe that is why it's multiplied in </v>

2590
02:24:18.711 --> 02:24:19.290
<v Speaker 2>the final story in genesis.</v>

2591
02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:20.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

2592
02:24:20.671 --> 02:24:25.671
<v Speaker 6>I've been reading ahead and for my own,</v>
<v Speaker 6>based on the interest of the present </v>

2593
02:24:26.570 --> 02:24:31.570
<v Speaker 6>presented stories and I keyed in on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>few other books and chapters in the </v>

2594
02:24:31.570 --> 02:24:33.320
<v Speaker 6>bible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>first corinthians 13,</v>

2595
02:24:33.321 --> 02:24:38.321
<v Speaker 6>which is the love chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that cycles through the idea of I </v>

2596
02:24:38.321 --> 02:24:40.020
<v Speaker 6>can have all things in life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2597
02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:41.300
<v Speaker 6>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 6>power,</v>

2598
02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:46.360
<v Speaker 6>but it's all passing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the law now and forever.</v>

2599
02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:47.930
<v Speaker 6>Faith,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hope and love.</v>

2600
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:51.080
<v Speaker 6>And then of course love trumps overall.</v>

2601
02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the love the issue.</v>

2602
02:24:52.780 --> 02:24:53.800
<v Speaker 2>See I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

2603
02:24:53.850 --> 02:24:58.850
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought a lot about the relationship </v>

2604
02:24:58.850 --> 02:25:00.481
<v Speaker 2>between love and truth because I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought and talked a lot more about </v>

2605
02:25:00.481 --> 02:25:03.991
<v Speaker 2>truth and I think partly that's because </v>
<v Speaker 2>love is a word that you can hardly even </v>

2606
02:25:03.991 --> 02:25:07.770
<v Speaker 2>say because it's been so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's being dragged behind a </v>

2607
02:25:07.770 --> 02:25:09.640
<v Speaker 2>car through mud puddles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

2608
02:25:10.330 --> 02:25:12.520
<v Speaker 2>But let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me Just finish it.</v>

2609
02:25:12.521 --> 02:25:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Liberating this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the,</v>

2610
02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:20.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the love idea is associated with w for </v>

2611
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:23.731
<v Speaker 2>me at least with what I discussed at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of this lecture with regards </v>

2612
02:25:23.731 --> 02:25:27.061
<v Speaker 2>to faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think you have to make a decision about </v>

2613
02:25:27.061 --> 02:25:30.991
<v Speaker 2>what your attitude towards being is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be and the proper attitude in </v>

2614
02:25:31.061 --> 02:25:34.720
<v Speaker 2>my estimation is that you're working for</v>
<v Speaker 2>its betterment,</v>

2615
02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:40.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so maybe maybe you have the same </v>

2616
02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:41.470
<v Speaker 2>attitude towards being as you do towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that you love,</v>

2617
02:25:41.471 --> 02:25:46.471
<v Speaker 2>like a son or a daughter or wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want things to be better and </v>

2618
02:25:46.471 --> 02:25:47.650
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's your aim.</v>

2619
02:25:47.651 --> 02:25:52.651
<v Speaker 2>So the aim is basically the aim is </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated by love.</v>

2620
02:25:53.650 --> 02:25:56.930
<v Speaker 2>You want things to be better because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's a good definition of law.</v>

2621
02:25:56.950 --> 02:26:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Like if you really care for someone you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell because you want things to be </v>

2622
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:06.271
<v Speaker 2>better for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think truth is nested inside </v>

2623
02:26:06.271 --> 02:26:07.720
<v Speaker 2>that because I think that truth is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best servant of love,</v>

2624
02:26:07.770 --> 02:26:08.680
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2625
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:18.790
<v Speaker 7>So I've been struggling with an idea </v>
<v Speaker 7>recently that I was thinking maybe you'd</v>

2626
02:26:18.791 --> 02:26:23.791
<v Speaker 7>be able to help me out with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Basically in a recent interview you </v>

2627
02:26:23.791 --> 02:26:27.601
<v Speaker 7>talked about how myth is meant to </v>
<v Speaker 7>reconcile inherent contradictions in </v>

2628
02:26:27.850 --> 02:26:28.840
<v Speaker 7>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2629
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:34.150
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm sort of stuck between two </v>

2630
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:37.620
<v Speaker 7>mythological or psychoanalytic ideas </v>
<v Speaker 7>that I think are both really important,</v>

2631
02:26:37.721 --> 02:26:41.440
<v Speaker 7>but they seem to have a inherent </v>
<v Speaker 7>contradiction within them that I've been</v>

2632
02:26:41.441 --> 02:26:46.441
<v Speaker 7>trying to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So on one hand you have this idea that </v>

2633
02:26:46.441 --> 02:26:48.040
<v Speaker 7>there's times in your life where you </v>
<v Speaker 7>have to identify things in yourself that</v>

2634
02:26:48.041 --> 02:26:53.041
<v Speaker 7>are insufficient or there's a problem </v>
<v Speaker 7>somehow that you have to kind of have a </v>

2635
02:26:53.471 --> 02:26:58.471
<v Speaker 7>controlled burn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or like a phoenix like transformation </v>

2636
02:26:58.471 --> 02:27:01.090
<v Speaker 7>where you discard part of yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 7>doesn't fit or it's not working.</v>

2637
02:27:01.570 --> 02:27:04.480
<v Speaker 7>But then on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have talked about this,</v>

2638
02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:08.260
<v Speaker 7>this union idea where as you become </v>
<v Speaker 7>really.</v>

2639
02:27:08.290 --> 02:27:12.070
<v Speaker 7>When you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you mature by reincorporating.</v>

2640
02:27:12.071 --> 02:27:17.071
<v Speaker 7>Things about yourself that you lost whEn</v>
<v Speaker 7>you were younger or that you're trying </v>

2641
02:27:17.071 --> 02:27:20.050
<v Speaker 7>to integrate your shadow or you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>trying to find parts of your personality</v>

2642
02:27:20.051 --> 02:27:23.110
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That maybe you've been rejecting and try</v>

2643
02:27:23.111 --> 02:27:26.040
<v Speaker 7>and figure out how to bring them into,</v>
<v Speaker 7>into the folder and whole.</v>

2644
02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:28.090
<v Speaker 7>so he's got this quote that I really </v>
<v Speaker 7>liked,</v>

2645
02:27:28.091 --> 02:27:31.330
<v Speaker 7>which is I'd rather be holding good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

2646
02:27:31.331 --> 02:27:32.320
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

2647
02:27:32.321 --> 02:27:37.321
<v Speaker 7>so on one hand you may identify </v>
<v Speaker 7>something as a problem and you want to </v>

2648
02:27:37.321 --> 02:27:40.300
<v Speaker 7>get rid of it or burn it off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then on the other hand it seems like</v>

2649
02:27:40.301 --> 02:27:45.301
<v Speaker 7>the path to being stronger is to figure </v>
<v Speaker 7>out how to put everything together.</v>

2650
02:27:48.250 --> 02:27:49.450
<v Speaker 2>So there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>

2651
02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:54.720
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you wrote about in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>works on alchemy was an explanation of </v>

2652
02:27:54.761 --> 02:27:59.761
<v Speaker 2>the prime l chemical dictum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was solve a coagula which meant </v>

2653
02:27:59.761 --> 02:28:02.860
<v Speaker 2>dissolve and integrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2654
02:28:02.861 --> 02:28:04.480
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine this,</v>

2655
02:28:04.510 --> 02:28:09.510
<v Speaker 2>imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you had a fairly hostile father </v>

2656
02:28:09.510 --> 02:28:12.550
<v Speaker 2>who was not very well controlled and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression,</v>

2657
02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:15.310
<v Speaker 2>decent person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

2658
02:28:15.311 --> 02:28:20.311
<v Speaker 2>but let's say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so your reaction is I'm never going </v>

2659
02:28:20.311 --> 02:28:21.470
<v Speaker 2>to be aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you've built a,</v>

2660
02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:26.760
<v Speaker 2>like a moral structure that's part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your personality and there's possibility</v>

2661
02:28:28.551 --> 02:28:30.050
<v Speaker 2>floating around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outside of that,</v>

2662
02:28:30.051 --> 02:28:32.390
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've denied an ethical,</v>

2663
02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:37.370
<v Speaker 2>you've denied any ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you say?</v>

2664
02:28:37.850 --> 02:28:41.870
<v Speaker 2>You've stripped the idea of aggression </v>
<v Speaker 2>of any ethical utility whatsoever?</v>

2665
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what happens?</v>

2666
02:28:43.551 --> 02:28:46.370
<v Speaker 2>This burns off and then that comes back </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2667
02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Now you still have to integrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's associated in some sense with </v>

2668
02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:51.920
<v Speaker 2>niches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

2669
02:28:52.460 --> 02:28:53.990
<v Speaker 2>morality as cowardice.</v>

2670
02:28:54.410 --> 02:28:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Because one of nature's most trenchant </v>
<v Speaker 2>critiques of traditional morality,</v>

2671
02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:03.680
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that most of what passes for morality</v>

2672
02:29:03.681 --> 02:29:05.630
<v Speaker 2>isn't reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just cowardice.</v>

2673
02:29:05.810 --> 02:29:08.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not that I'm a good person and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't hurt you.</v>

2674
02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:14.080
<v Speaker 2>It's that I'm afraid to hurt you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to admit that I'm </v>

2675
02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:17.531
<v Speaker 2>afraid to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I say I'm moral because then I can </v>

2676
02:29:17.531 --> 02:29:20.450
<v Speaker 2>mask my essential fear and cowardice in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a guise of morality.</v>

2677
02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:25.690
<v Speaker 2>And that happens far more often than you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would think because harmless and moral </v>

2678
02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:30.131
<v Speaker 2>are by no means the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of what you're burning off you </v>

2679
02:29:30.131 --> 02:29:34.871
<v Speaker 2>can sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is where freud was such a </v>

2680
02:29:34.871 --> 02:29:36.941
<v Speaker 2>genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is because he concentrated on </v>

2681
02:29:36.941 --> 02:29:37.790
<v Speaker 2>aggression in sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are perhaps the two most difficult</v>

2682
02:29:37.791 --> 02:29:40.280
<v Speaker 2>parts of a personality to integrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

2683
02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:42.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2684
02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:47.860
<v Speaker 2>the hyper simplified morality stops you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from tapping into deeper recesses of </v>

2685
02:29:54.081 --> 02:29:58.040
<v Speaker 2>your psyche and it's partly because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are primal forces.</v>

2686
02:29:58.490 --> 02:30:01.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not surprising that you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have anything to do with them,</v>

2687
02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:05.060
<v Speaker 2>that you stay away from situations where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might make themselves manifest.</v>

2688
02:30:05.061 --> 02:30:10.061
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is by denying the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>in yourself in that manner of </v>

2689
02:30:10.061 --> 02:30:12.290
<v Speaker 2>suPpressing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you preclude the possibility of the best</v>

2690
02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:17.740
<v Speaker 2>because no one can be a good person </v>
<v Speaker 2>without integrating their capacity for </v>

2691
02:30:17.740 --> 02:30:18.390
<v Speaker 2>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because without that capacity,</v>

2692
02:30:18.391 --> 02:30:23.391
<v Speaker 2>you have for aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot say no because no means if </v>

2693
02:30:23.721 --> 02:30:28.721
<v Speaker 2>you really say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no means there isn't anything that you </v>

2694
02:30:28.721 --> 02:30:30.130
<v Speaker 2>can do to me that will make me change my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind or,</v>

2695
02:30:30.170 --> 02:30:34.130
<v Speaker 2>or conversely it means I will play for </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher stakes than you will.</v>

2696
02:30:34.850 --> 02:30:38.930
<v Speaker 2>And unless you've got your aggression </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrated,</v>

2697
02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:41.600
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a chance you can say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you did,</v>

2698
02:30:41.601 --> 02:30:45.350
<v Speaker 2>no one would take you seriously because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd know it was just a show.</v>

2699
02:30:46.010 --> 02:30:49.490
<v Speaker 2>So one of the most useful things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>young did,</v>

2700
02:30:49.491 --> 02:30:52.940
<v Speaker 2>I think was to work on this idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>integration of the shadow because he was</v>

2701
02:30:52.941 --> 02:30:54.770
<v Speaker 2>really interested in the idea of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2702
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Especially working with trying to parcel</v>
<v Speaker 2>out what happened in nazi Germany and </v>

2703
02:30:59.770 --> 02:31:04.720
<v Speaker 2>during the second world war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with the part of you </v>

2704
02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:04.910
<v Speaker 2>that's aggressive and potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolent?</v>

2705
02:31:04.911 --> 02:31:09.911
<v Speaker 2>You just crush it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the super ego response in some </v>

2706
02:31:09.911 --> 02:31:12.971
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you just put it behind you so to </v>

2707
02:31:12.971 --> 02:31:13.580
<v Speaker 2>speak?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a possibility or do you admit to</v>

2708
02:31:13.581 --> 02:31:18.581
<v Speaker 2>its existence and bring it into the game</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's c for.</v>

2709
02:31:18.850 --> 02:31:20.460
<v Speaker 2>For freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>

2710
02:31:20.490 --> 02:31:25.490
<v Speaker 2>morality was super ego clamping down on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bed and there were fundamentally </v>

2711
02:31:25.490 --> 02:31:30.111
<v Speaker 2>opposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both young and piaget had a different </v>

2712
02:31:30.111 --> 02:31:30.111
<v Speaker 2>idea and I think they were right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2713
02:31:30.111 --> 02:31:30.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2714
02:31:30.591 --> 02:31:35.591
<v Speaker 2>you invite the bad guys out to play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you're an aggressive hockey </v>

2715
02:31:36.351 --> 02:31:41.351
<v Speaker 2>player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's disciplined aggression that </v>

2716
02:31:41.351 --> 02:31:45.571
<v Speaker 2>makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you access to a whole source of </v>

2717
02:31:45.571 --> 02:31:46.660
<v Speaker 2>energy you wouldn't otherwise have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then with regards to sexuality,</v>

2718
02:31:46.661 --> 02:31:51.661
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well untrammeled promiscuity doesn't </v>

2719
02:31:51.661 --> 02:31:54.010
<v Speaker 2>constitute a virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but neither does unavoidable virginity.</v>

2720
02:31:54.370 --> 02:31:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2721
02:31:55.481 --> 02:31:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I think that's worse because it also </v>
<v Speaker 2>masks itself with virtue,</v>

2722
02:31:59.970 --> 02:32:01.840
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you should be able to.</v>

2723
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:05.750
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to do things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't do.</v>

2724
02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:10.820
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the definition of a </v>

2725
02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:12.200
<v Speaker 2>genuinely moral person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could do it,</v>

2726
02:32:13.170 --> 02:32:16.380
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not cowardice.</v>

2727
02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:21.560
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you burn off the things that get in the </v>

2728
02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:21.560
<v Speaker 2>way of that integration.</v>

2729
02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:27.500
<v Speaker 7>When you say dissolve and integrating,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it'd be a good way to sort of bring the </v>

2730
02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:31.131
<v Speaker 7>two ideas together that the burning off </v>
<v Speaker 7>and the difficult processes necessary </v>

2731
02:32:31.651 --> 02:32:36.651
<v Speaker 7>because the elements of yourself are </v>
<v Speaker 7>structured together in a rigid way that </v>

2732
02:32:36.651 --> 02:32:37.900
<v Speaker 7>is not working properly.</v>

2733
02:32:38.170 --> 02:32:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens to Japan in the </v>

2734
02:32:43.170 --> 02:32:44.851
<v Speaker 2>belly of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so caught in his presuppositions </v>

2735
02:32:44.851 --> 02:32:45.670
<v Speaker 2>that he can't escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2736
02:32:45.671 --> 02:32:47.680
<v Speaker 2>And so pinocchio represents the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>forest.</v>

2737
02:32:47.681 --> 02:32:50.080
<v Speaker 2>So it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you watch pinocchio,</v>

2738
02:32:50.081 --> 02:32:55.081
<v Speaker 2>tried to rescue him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing joe petta does this </v>

2739
02:32:55.081 --> 02:32:55.750
<v Speaker 2>confuse pinocchio with a fish because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants something to eat.</v>

2740
02:32:55.960 --> 02:32:59.080
<v Speaker 2>But pinocchio is better than something </v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat because he could rescue him so he</v>

2741
02:32:59.081 --> 02:33:04.081
<v Speaker 2>doesn't need to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then pinocchio wants to make a fire </v>

2742
02:33:04.081 --> 02:33:05.410
<v Speaker 2>engine pedo objects because he's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to burn up all the furniture.</v>

2743
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:08.830
<v Speaker 2>So like we don't need the damn furniture</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're getting out of the whale,</v>

2744
02:33:08.890 --> 02:33:10.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

2745
02:33:10.210 --> 02:33:12.390
<v Speaker 2>so Japan and he's old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

2746
02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:13.120
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

2747
02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:18.510
<v Speaker 2>that's the rigid structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the old gear that has to die off </v>

2748
02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:21.601
<v Speaker 2>before the new year can be born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a forest fire that allows for new </v>

2749
02:33:21.601 --> 02:33:24.130
<v Speaker 2>growth and that's how those things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>put together and to see.</v>

2750
02:33:24.130 --> 02:33:26.890
<v Speaker 2>And it's useful to know too because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you burn something off,</v>

2751
02:33:26.891 --> 02:33:27.490
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2752
02:33:27.491 --> 02:33:29.170
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2753
02:33:29.171 --> 02:33:31.330
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's dead wood,</v>

2754
02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:36.360
<v Speaker 2>then you have room for new growth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be doing that on a fairly </v>

2755
02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:37.490
<v Speaker 2>regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

2756
02:33:38.180 --> 02:33:41.570
<v Speaker 2>that's the snake that sheds its skin and</v>
<v Speaker 2>transforms itself,</v>

2757
02:33:41.571 --> 02:33:42.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2758
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:46.220
<v Speaker 2>that's the death and resurrection from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological perspective,</v>

2759
02:33:46.221 --> 02:33:51.221
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we don't know the upper limit to </v>

2760
02:33:51.221 --> 02:33:51.221
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2761
02:33:51.221 --> 02:33:55.061
<v Speaker 2>Because we don't know what a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be like if they let everything </v>

2762
02:33:55.061 --> 02:33:58.210
<v Speaker 2>that they could let go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let go and only let in what was </v>

2763
02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:00.110
<v Speaker 2>seemingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

2764
02:34:01.070 --> 02:34:06.070
<v Speaker 2>But you can See that it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know that to some degree you </v>

2765
02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:09.581
<v Speaker 2>can see People very far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see people start to do that </v>

2766
02:34:09.581 --> 02:34:13.970
<v Speaker 2>without.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not an rare experience and people</v>

2767
02:34:14.761 --> 02:34:16.260
<v Speaker 2>improve very rapidly.</v>

2768
02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:19.420
<v Speaker 2>It can improve their very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it's low hanging fruit,</v>

2769
02:34:19.421 --> 02:34:23.950
<v Speaker 2>like if he just stopped doing really </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid things that you know are stupid,</v>

2770
02:34:23.951 --> 02:34:28.240
<v Speaker 2>your life improves a lot so and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it frees you up.</v>

2771
02:34:28.510 --> 02:34:33.510
<v Speaker 2>It also means there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an element there that's also </v>

2772
02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:36.061
<v Speaker 2>associated with pride because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to take pride in who they are and </v>

2773
02:34:36.061 --> 02:34:41.001
<v Speaker 2>that's a bad idea because that stops you</v>
<v Speaker 2>from becoming who you could be because </v>

2774
02:34:41.281 --> 02:34:46.281
<v Speaker 2>if you're proud of who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't let that go when it's </v>

2775
02:34:46.281 --> 02:34:46.440
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't step away from it,</v>

2776
02:34:46.940 --> 02:34:51.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you end up being your own </v>

2777
02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:51.940
<v Speaker 2>parody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

2778
02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:54.780
<v Speaker 2>That's also a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be continually stepping away</v>

2779
02:34:54.781 --> 02:34:59.781
<v Speaker 2>from your previous self and so big and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess part of that too is that you have </v>

2780
02:35:00.361 --> 02:35:01.290
<v Speaker 2>to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2781
02:35:01.291 --> 02:35:06.291
<v Speaker 2>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you order or chaos or you the </v>

2782
02:35:06.291 --> 02:35:09.801
<v Speaker 2>process that mediates between them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're the process that mediates </v>

2783
02:35:09.801 --> 02:35:09.801
<v Speaker 2>between them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2784
02:35:09.801 --> 02:35:14.210
<v Speaker 2>you are the thing that transforms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the right attitude for a human </v>

2785
02:35:14.210 --> 02:35:18.881
<v Speaker 2>being because that's what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the thing that voluntarily </v>

2786
02:35:18.881 --> 02:35:21.740
<v Speaker 2>confronts chaos and transforms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we are.</v>

2787
02:35:22.370 --> 02:35:24.520
<v Speaker 2>And so for better or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2788
02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:28.430
<v Speaker 2>that's our deepest biological essence </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

2789
02:35:28.910 --> 02:35:32.060
<v Speaker 2>and so you can let things go if you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's more growth to come.</v>

2790
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:34.810
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2791
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:42.690
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

2792
02:35:42.770 --> 02:35:47.770
<v Speaker 6>One more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you for your time and thank you </v>

2793
02:35:47.770 --> 02:35:47.810
<v Speaker 6>for spending your time with all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

2794
02:35:47.811 --> 02:35:49.250
<v Speaker 6>my pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's been a pleasure.</v>

2795
02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:53.090
<v Speaker 6>So if I could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>since we are at the end of genesis,</v>

2796
02:35:53.390 --> 02:35:58.390
<v Speaker 6>I liked the opportunity to challenge or </v>
<v Speaker 6>at least have you take another look at </v>

2797
02:35:58.390 --> 02:36:02.171
<v Speaker 6>your position you've held with regards </v>
<v Speaker 6>to reflection on the murder of evil.</v>

2798
02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:08.100
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bring this up because it's actually a </v>

2799
02:36:08.100 --> 02:36:10.121
<v Speaker 6>part of genesis that has bothered me for</v>
<v Speaker 6>awhile and it's not like because it's </v>

2800
02:36:10.121 --> 02:36:10.880
<v Speaker 6>not as straightforward as it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>presented,</v>

2801
02:36:10.881 --> 02:36:13.790
<v Speaker 6>usually in straight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been wrestling with it.</v>

2802
02:36:13.791 --> 02:36:18.230
<v Speaker 6>So in this series as well as in a couple</v>
<v Speaker 6>of your maps of meaning lectures,</v>

2803
02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:23.440
<v Speaker 6>you summarized it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something to the effect of cane coming </v>

2804
02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:26.531
<v Speaker 6>to the conclusion that what he did leads</v>
<v Speaker 6>to a punishment which is more than he </v>

2805
02:36:26.531 --> 02:36:30.491
<v Speaker 6>believes he can face,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I believe to be born out of a </v>

2806
02:36:30.491 --> 02:36:33.881
<v Speaker 6>natural reading,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a specific translation choices </v>

2807
02:36:33.881 --> 02:36:36.700
<v Speaker 6>incorrectly made entry innocently made </v>
<v Speaker 6>by editors Just for readability sake.</v>

2808
02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:42.880
<v Speaker 6>So in genesis four,</v>
<v Speaker 6>13 cane does not say my punishment is </v>

2809
02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:46.150
<v Speaker 6>greater than I can bear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He actually says they'll meat,</v>

2810
02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:50.700
<v Speaker 6>so my sIn is greater than I can bear,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is this,</v>

2811
02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:53.780
<v Speaker 6>which is to say it's not his past </v>
<v Speaker 6>actions.</v>

2812
02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:56.650
<v Speaker 6>We'll just say it's not as past </v>
<v Speaker 6>sections.</v>

2813
02:36:56.660 --> 02:37:01.660
<v Speaker 6>It's his future as consequences which a </v>
<v Speaker 6>past actions not as feature </v>

2814
02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:03.460
<v Speaker 6>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which he regrets for him to say,</v>

2815
02:37:03.461 --> 02:37:05.030
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>won't iniquity or sin.</v>

2816
02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:10.330
<v Speaker 6>That is far too much for him to bear as </v>
<v Speaker 6>a reflection on the reality of this </v>

2817
02:37:10.330 --> 02:37:11.720
<v Speaker 6>corruPtion and not a plea of mercy to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the dd despair him.</v>

2818
02:37:12.290 --> 02:37:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

2819
02:37:13.070 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be a deeper interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

2820
02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:22.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's more that's the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>line of reasoning that dusty see pursued</v>

2821
02:37:22.011 --> 02:37:23.960
<v Speaker 2>in crime and punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2822
02:37:23.961 --> 02:37:28.961
<v Speaker 2>Because in crime and punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skolnick of gets away with murder and </v>

2823
02:37:28.961 --> 02:37:32.681
<v Speaker 2>then he cannot stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He cannot stand that he did it because </v>

2824
02:37:32.681 --> 02:37:36.011
<v Speaker 2>he's no longer the same person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even more he cannot stand that he </v>

2825
02:37:36.011 --> 02:37:37.070
<v Speaker 2>got away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's more in keeping with the,</v>

2826
02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:39.370
<v Speaker 2>with that interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2827
02:37:39.690 --> 02:37:44.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this also is reflected in the following </v>

2828
02:37:44.690 --> 02:37:45.670
<v Speaker 2>verses for 14 where he states the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of his actions,</v>

2829
02:37:45.910 --> 02:37:50.910
<v Speaker 2>mainly that god's presence will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>hidden from him and that he will be </v>

2830
02:37:50.910 --> 02:37:51.760
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first opens with the word hain,</v>

2831
02:37:51.761 --> 02:37:56.761
<v Speaker 2>which means indeed more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to note the sense of acceptance and </v>

2832
02:37:56.761 --> 02:37:59.350
<v Speaker 2>not a complaint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the difference between saying,</v>

2833
02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:00.520
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well god,</v>

2834
02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:05.580
<v Speaker 2>now hide his face from me and will I be </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunted versus of course god will hide </v>

2835
02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:06.790
<v Speaker 2>his face for me and I will be hunted and</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed,</v>

2836
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:12.510
<v Speaker 2>which I've been wrestling lists and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken away to possibly mean that there </v>

2837
02:38:12.510 --> 02:38:16.270
<v Speaker 2>are sins that we can do that we'll just </v>
<v Speaker 2>push us too far.</v>

2838
02:38:16.530 --> 02:38:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2839
02:38:17.311 --> 02:38:17.940
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2840
02:38:17.941 --> 02:38:18.930
<v Speaker 2>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2841
02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:20.960
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the.</v>

2842
02:38:21.150 --> 02:38:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you see in </v>

2843
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:27.060
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder situations,</v>

2844
02:38:27.061 --> 02:38:32.061
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that people view themselves doing </v>

2845
02:38:32.061 --> 02:38:33.900
<v Speaker 2>something so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how to put it right.</v>

2846
02:38:34.530 --> 02:38:39.530
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say under those </v>

2847
02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:41.391
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the face of god is hidden from them </v>

2848
02:38:41.391 --> 02:38:43.170
<v Speaker 2>because they cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cannot atone for it.</v>

2849
02:38:43.171 --> 02:38:48.171
<v Speaker 2>They count reconciled themselves to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there all the time and they can't </v>

2850
02:38:48.171 --> 02:38:50.370
<v Speaker 2>see anything good beyond it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hell essentially.</v>

2851
02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:55.880
<v Speaker 2>And so in sometimes when you're working </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people with posttraumatic stress </v>

2852
02:38:55.880 --> 02:38:55.880
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2853
02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:00.681
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of initiatE them into a </v>

2854
02:39:00.681 --> 02:39:03.891
<v Speaker 2>philosophy of good and evil so that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can see when joseph talks to his </v>

2855
02:39:03.931 --> 02:39:06.180
<v Speaker 2>brothers and they've got all this guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2856
02:39:06.181 --> 02:39:11.181
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't want them to have more </v>

2857
02:39:11.181 --> 02:39:12.180
<v Speaker 2>guilt than necessary to fix themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it just burdens them.</v>

2858
02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:13.080
<v Speaker 2>otherwise he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2859
02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:14.670
<v Speaker 2>don't forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2860
02:39:14.671 --> 02:39:15.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was you.</v>

2861
02:39:15.301 --> 02:39:19.320
<v Speaker 2>But it's also god's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had a client once who,</v>

2862
02:39:19.350 --> 02:39:22.460
<v Speaker 2>who had obsessive compulsive disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2863
02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:26.610
<v Speaker 2>he was a very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also happened to work in a active lab</v>

2864
02:39:26.611 --> 02:39:31.611
<v Speaker 2>that hug a lot of radioactive materials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which wasn't the best place for someone </v>

2865
02:39:31.611 --> 02:39:34.881
<v Speaker 2>with ocd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was worried that he would make </v>

2866
02:39:34.881 --> 02:39:39.141
<v Speaker 2>some mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very common with ocd that would </v>

2867
02:39:39.141 --> 02:39:39.660
<v Speaker 2>result in someone's suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you will,</v>

2868
02:39:39.690 --> 02:39:40.620
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll do that.</v>

2869
02:39:40.980 --> 02:39:45.980
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't until I could get him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize himself and his life in </v>

2870
02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:50.931
<v Speaker 2>part as a force of nature that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to reconcile himself to the </v>

2871
02:39:51.570 --> 02:39:56.570
<v Speaker 2>possibility that an error on his part </v>
<v Speaker 2>would produce catastrophic consequences.</v>

2872
02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:02.200
<v Speaker 2>But people often find themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations where they just cannot </v>

2873
02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:04.410
<v Speaker 2>reconcile themselves to what they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done and that it makes sense to me that,</v>

2874
02:40:04.970 --> 02:40:08.620
<v Speaker 2>that the interpretation that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>describing that that makes,</v>

2875
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:14.050
<v Speaker 2>that makes plenty of sense from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological perspective that will push</v>

2876
02:40:14.431 --> 02:40:17.640
<v Speaker 2>us to like just beyond our limit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are too far,</v>

2877
02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:23.150
<v Speaker 2>but there are also no consequences to </v>
<v Speaker 2>our actions that are devoid of a truth </v>

2878
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:24.480
<v Speaker 2>we can accept and learn from.</v>

2879
02:40:24.890 --> 02:40:28.320
<v Speaker 2>And this is what I've kind of delved out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this a bit with cain and abel.</v>

2880
02:40:28.530 --> 02:40:31.890
<v Speaker 2>So this is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why then does it take us so long?</v>

2881
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:35.700
<v Speaker 2>And it was so much self to now before we</v>
<v Speaker 2>accept personal responsibility,</v>

2882
02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:38.930
<v Speaker 2>my face with tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it's self inflicted.</v>

2883
02:40:43.540 --> 02:40:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't think you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>underestimate the contribution of just </v>

2884
02:40:48.540 --> 02:40:50.940
<v Speaker 2>sheer dIfficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

2885
02:40:51.810 --> 02:40:55.740
<v Speaker 2>let's say you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2886
02:40:55.810 --> 02:40:57.900
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're grieving because someone close to</v>

2887
02:40:57.901 --> 02:40:59.870
<v Speaker 2>you died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2888
02:40:59.910 --> 02:41:01.590
<v Speaker 2>well it isn't just that you've lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2889
02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Although that's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that you have to rebuild yourself </v>

2890
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:11.420
<v Speaker 2>and it's really hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is sort of proportional to the </v>

2891
02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:16.010
<v Speaker 2>significance of your errors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you commit an error and then you </v>

2892
02:41:16.010 --> 02:41:18.120
<v Speaker 2>recognize that it's an error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a sort of surface area it's like</v>

2893
02:41:18.150 --> 02:41:23.150
<v Speaker 2>well you can just touch up the paint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes the whole under structure </v>

2894
02:41:23.151 --> 02:41:28.151
<v Speaker 2>is just rotten and then you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do.</v>

2895
02:41:30.290 --> 02:41:31.700
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one problem.</v>

2896
02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:34.920
<v Speaker 2>Just sheer bloody difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see this with people very often.</v>

2897
02:41:34.921 --> 02:41:37.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're at a point in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce,</v>

2898
02:41:37.171 --> 02:41:39.480
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know what to do.</v>

2899
02:41:39.660 --> 02:41:42.780
<v Speaker 2>They cannot solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too complicated.</v>

2900
02:41:43.470 --> 02:41:48.470
<v Speaker 2>They just don't have the resources and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they've squandered some of their </v>

2901
02:41:48.470 --> 02:41:51.201
<v Speaker 2>resources as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes they just don't have the </v>

2902
02:41:51.201 --> 02:41:53.451
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you add to that error and </v>

2903
02:41:53.451 --> 02:41:54.090
<v Speaker 2>sin and malevolence and blindness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all those other things.</v>

2904
02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:56.850
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named thomas says,</v>

2905
02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:01.880
<v Speaker 2>who wrote this really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>article in the 19 sixties and book </v>

2906
02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:01.980
<v Speaker 2>actually called the myth of mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness.</v>

2907
02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:07.460
<v Speaker 2>And it was classic reading for clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist when I was training.</v>

2908
02:42:08.220 --> 02:42:11.430
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds pointed out,</v>

2909
02:42:11.431 --> 02:42:16.431
<v Speaker 2>and this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that lots of times if you're a </v>

2910
02:42:16.431 --> 02:42:19.770
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't come to you because they </v>

2911
02:42:19.770 --> 02:42:21.861
<v Speaker 2>have mental illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had come to you because they have </v>

2912
02:42:21.861 --> 02:42:23.070
<v Speaker 2>insoluble problems in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2913
02:42:23.071 --> 02:42:26.370
<v Speaker 2>like maybe they've had a two year affair</v>
<v Speaker 2>at work,</v>

2914
02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:32.720
<v Speaker 2>their wife is alcoholic and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very and their father has alzheimer's </v>

2915
02:42:33.931 --> 02:42:34.440
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

2916
02:42:35.090 --> 02:42:36.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like they just don't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2917
02:42:37.650 --> 02:42:39.150
<v Speaker 2>It's too much now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2918
02:42:39.151 --> 02:42:44.151
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't have had the affair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a moral issue and maybe they </v>

2919
02:42:44.151 --> 02:42:44.970
<v Speaker 2>should have intervened in the alcoholism</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the family.</v>

2920
02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they use their wives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism as an excuse to have the </v>

2921
02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:50.120
<v Speaker 2>affair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2922
02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:51.060
<v Speaker 2>like these things get very tangled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2923
02:42:51.061 --> 02:42:53.850
<v Speaker 2>it's so bloody complicated that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't untangle it.</v>

2924
02:42:54.660 --> 02:42:59.660
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that's in keeping with </v>

2925
02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:02.271
<v Speaker 2>the interpretation that you laid forth </v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to cain is it sounds like </v>

2926
02:43:02.271 --> 02:43:05.070
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the reasons why it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful to read multiple translations,</v>

2927
02:43:05.071 --> 02:43:08.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because nuances matter.</v>

2928
02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:14.120
<v Speaker 2>it sounds to me from that descriPtion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he actually woke up at least </v>

2929
02:43:14.530 --> 02:43:16.570
<v Speaker 2>briefly and noticed what he did and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2930
02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:19.780
<v Speaker 2>there's no coming back from this and and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2931
02:43:19.810 --> 02:43:23.860
<v Speaker 2>You can easIly get places that you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>not know how to come back from.</v>

2932
02:43:23.890 --> 02:43:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2933
02:43:24.341 --> 02:43:24.880
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2934
02:43:24.881 --> 02:43:29.881
<v Speaker 2>all things are possible with god and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always the possibility of </v>

2935
02:43:29.881 --> 02:43:30.490
<v Speaker 2>redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter how serious the sin,</v>

2936
02:43:30.491 --> 02:43:35.491
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you is sometimes people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no idea how to get back from where </v>

2937
02:43:35.491 --> 02:43:39.391
<v Speaker 2>they went well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can understand often why people </v>

2938
02:43:40.121 --> 02:43:41.620
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2939
02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2940
02:43:42.940 --> 02:43:47.940
<v Speaker 2>that's a funny thing because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things Carl Rogers said too about </v>

2941
02:43:47.940 --> 02:43:50.971
<v Speaker 2>Psychotherapy is that you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy with someone who hasn't </v>

2942
02:43:50.971 --> 02:43:54.331
<v Speaker 2>recognized that they have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a massive thing to recognize </v>

2943
02:43:54.331 --> 02:43:58.090
<v Speaker 2>that you have a problem and it does open</v>
<v Speaker 2>the door perhaps to recovery,</v>

2944
02:43:58.390 --> 02:44:03.390
<v Speaker 2>but it also means that you've recognized</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have a problem and that can be </v>

2945
02:44:03.390 --> 02:44:03.390
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>

2946
02:44:03.430 --> 02:44:04.570
<v Speaker 2>it's the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2947
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:09.750
<v Speaker 2>You're out of the tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're in the desert and the sun's </v>

2948
02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:12.331
<v Speaker 2>beating down on you and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary reason to presume that you're </v>

2949
02:44:12.331 --> 02:44:13.800
<v Speaker 2>going to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So thank you.</v>

2950
02:44:13.810 --> 02:44:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Have guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you all.</v>

2951
02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
