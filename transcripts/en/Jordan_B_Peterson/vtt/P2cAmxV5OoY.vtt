WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Then the meme stream and then they later</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of took a joyless turn.</v>

2
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday on today.</v>

3
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Well it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.890
<v Speaker 1>So here's the strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of played,</v>

6
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.143
<v Speaker 1>let's say night on white horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Guardian yesterday published </v>

7
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:28.060
<v Speaker 1>the</v>
<v Speaker 1>astounding,</v>

8
00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:28.894
<v Speaker 1>really reprehensible article about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>boot know about the channel for </v>

9
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.680
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

11
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>they've done some nice interviews about </v>
<v Speaker 1>my book.</v>

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.303
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it'd been kind of all over the place </v>

13
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:38.074
<v Speaker 1>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>but the channel for people claim that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kathy has been targeted with threats.</v>

15
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.853
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a torrent of online abuse by </v>

16
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Internet trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 50,000 trolls,</v>

17
00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of trolls.</v>

18
00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>You might start thinking maybe they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not old trolls,</v>

19
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by Ms Dot logistic abuse and</v>

20
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.813
<v Speaker 1>threats and that they had called in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>security specialist to assess the level </v>

21
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:06.484
<v Speaker 1>of threat.</v>

22
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.473
<v Speaker 1>And so it was the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to twist the story around so </v>

23
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:15.820
<v Speaker 1>that the story became</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kathy Newman,</v>

24
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.343
<v Speaker 1>poor embattled channel four newscaster </v>
<v Speaker 1>was merely trying to do her job even </v>

25
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>though she might've been a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>provocative,</v>

26
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.293
<v Speaker 1>interviewed alt right hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Jordan Peterson in an honest manner </v>

27
00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:32.950
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to expose his agenda,</v>

28
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.383
<v Speaker 1>posted the results to youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was immediately mobbed by his army </v>

29
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 1>of Internet trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

30
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:42.244
<v Speaker 1>So she went from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my sense is she went from a </v>

31
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>journalist playing a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated games to,</v>

32
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

33
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.493
<v Speaker 1>to target of criticism online to heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embattled heroin in the panoply of </v>

34
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>martyrs to whom similar things have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the past and what's terrible</v>

35
00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:10.510
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

36
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.403
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I inadvertently I would say </v>

37
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>contributed to that because when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guardian story came out,</v>

38
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I read it and the story purported to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the threats that she had received.</v>

39
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.313
<v Speaker 1>But really the story because the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>opened with a description of me and the </v>

40
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:28.420
<v Speaker 1>description was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it far from flattery.</v>

41
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the same old thing.</v>

42
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a provocateur.</v>

43
00:02:32.681 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 1>He's has an army of trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anybody ever dares to challenge him,</v>

44
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:40.150
<v Speaker 1>let's say I know all they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly challenging.</v>

45
00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 1>The trolls come out and then they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fear for their lives and that was.</v>

46
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 1>That was the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the threat,</v>

47
00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:51.121
<v Speaker 1>the threats were just the pre requisite </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the story and then yeah,</v>

48
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:57.241
<v Speaker 1>like a dozen UK news media sources that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the newspapers in particular have picked</v>

49
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>us up some even more critical of me than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

50
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Some in a slightly more balanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion,</v>

51
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>but and see when the Guardian story </v>
<v Speaker 1>broke,</v>

52
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

53
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're.</v>

54
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.363
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at the tweet or the youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments and most of them were merely </v>

55
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:20.194
<v Speaker 1>criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're threatening her while </v>

56
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:23.360
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>because we had an exchange of words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what we're supposed to do.</v>

58
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I think this message to your front row </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the most liked tweet you ever</v>

59
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>put out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>but here's the terrible thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.703
<v Speaker 1>what happened was that the fact that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted that was instantly used as </v>

62
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>validation for the claim that there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>threats and that was just,</v>

63
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened.</v>

64
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:47.044
<v Speaker 1>And See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because when I wrote that I </v>

65
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:53.221
<v Speaker 1>thought was part of me that thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thought that that might happen.</v>

66
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>There was a little warning bell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>went off that said,</v>

67
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:56.734
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.993
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence that these threats </v>
<v Speaker 1>are credible and if you respond by by </v>

69
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.473
<v Speaker 1>asking people to back off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're also implying that there are </v>

70
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should back off that this is real.</v>

71
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.011
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

72
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it anyways because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been targeted.</v>

73
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.923
<v Speaker 1>She has been subject to a very large </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of very vitriolic comments and </v>

74
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

75
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to come out and say that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

76
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is it wasn't okay because </v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I did it,</v>

77
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.143
<v Speaker 1>then the fact that I did it was used as </v>
<v Speaker 1>proof that all of these claims were </v>

78
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>valid and that that just floored me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was very</v>

79
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.393
<v Speaker 1>distraught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is the right word about that </v>

80
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>this morning because I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that coming.</v>

81
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>But were there threats against her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen them?</v>

82
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.493
<v Speaker 1>Defined threat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no threats that were sufficient </v>

83
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>to get the police involved.</v>
