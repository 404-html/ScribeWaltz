1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.153
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the beginning of my introduction </v>

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.263
<v Speaker 1>of our first speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd be remiss not to mention my </v>

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>observation from the floor and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an overwhelming number of young</v>

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>faces in the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And considering that this is a Sunday,</v>

5
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>this is your time off from studies or </v>
<v Speaker 1>work for you to come out here to hear us</v>

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>talk about freedom of speech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness.</v>

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me is an indication that there is a,</v>

8
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>a zeitgeisty among millennials among </v>
<v Speaker 1>young people right now.</v>

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And I know we've got disciples of Pha </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>and orwell and Huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Bronc crowder,</v>

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>myself as a somewhat young Haig Alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but think that,</v>

12
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialectics is real.</v>

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.771
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

14
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main stream media,</v>

15
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the academic pulpit.</v>

16
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've been fed,</v>

17
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the thesis,</v>

18
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.723
<v Speaker 1>we're now pushing back and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new anti thesis that is forming and God </v>

19
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>willing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the synthesis that comes out of it,</v>

20
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>errs on the side of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not social justice,</v>

21
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>truth and not political correctness.</v>

22
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.203
<v Speaker 1>Our next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our first distinguished guests is a man </v>

23
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>who introduced neuroplasticity to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

24
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>The idea that our brains are not rigidly</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardwired as was once believed,</v>

25
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>but that they can change and indeed be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewired.</v>

26
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.963
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Norman Doidge is a Canadian born </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist psychoanalyst and a world </v>

27
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.320

<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto,</v>

32
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.033

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.753
<v Speaker 1>established in fact in laboratories </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a greater understanding of the </v>

45
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>ways in which circuits of neurons </v>
<v Speaker 1>function and are created by thought aunt</v>

<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rigorous thinker while the subjects on</v>

50
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:42.474
<v Speaker 1>which he writes or at the very edge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our current understanding of the mind </v>

51
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.583
<v Speaker 1>and body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please join me in welcoming Dr. Norman </v>

52
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:49.704
<v Speaker 1>Doidge.</v>

53
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you all hear me?</v>

54
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Thank you faith</v>

55
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 3>and thank you joffrey and thank all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you for coming to this talk,</v>

56
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:05.344
<v Speaker 3>which is a shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kind of civic mindedness and reaching </v>

57
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 3>beyond oneself.</v>

58
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.113
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

59
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.143
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to approach this subject from </v>
<v Speaker 3>a particular vantage point which links </v>

60
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:19.624
<v Speaker 3>up some things that are I think are very</v>
<v Speaker 3>important in classic political </v>

61
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 3>philosophy and but we know about </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology and the brain,</v>

62
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to call it the infallible </v>
<v Speaker 3>state of mind.</v>

63
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 3>And this is George Eliot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps the most philosophical of,</v>

64
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 3>of novelis in way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

65
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.043
<v Speaker 3>and in middle march,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her masterpiece or one of her </v>

66
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 3>masterpieces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this,</v>

67
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 3>and this is the epigraph in a way for my</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk,</v>

68
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.200
<v Speaker 3>her anger said as anger is apt to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that God was with her,</v>

69
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.573
<v Speaker 3>that all heaven must be on her side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can think about that as the talk </v>

70
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.244
<v Speaker 3>goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem we face today is really a </v>

71
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 3>very simple one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In an open society,</v>

72
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 3>people are different and so we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreements about important matters.</v>

73
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.193
<v Speaker 3>How do we sort through these </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreements and even perhaps benefit </v>

74
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:15.244
<v Speaker 3>from the different points of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also avoid splitting apart into </v>

75
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 3>warring factions or violence in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

76
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 3>These are the topics today that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to discuss.</v>

77
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.963
<v Speaker 3>First our freedom of speech and </v>
<v Speaker 3>political correctness mutually </v>

78
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:31.354
<v Speaker 3>exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm going to present the classical </v>

79
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:39.391
<v Speaker 3>liberal argument for freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just because I want to speak,</v>

80
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 3>that I ought to be allowed to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and why free speech,</v>

81
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 3>liberal democracy and individual liberty</v>
<v Speaker 3>are inseparable.</v>

82
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 3>Why you can't really have one without </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other.</v>

83
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.783
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to discuss why robust freedom </v>
<v Speaker 3>of speech is the best protection that </v>

84
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 3>exists for minorities and for marginal </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups,</v>

85
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.173
<v Speaker 3>and how the practice of political </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness intentionally undermines </v>

86
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:11.421
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech and unintentionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>undermines many of its own stated goals.</v>

87
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.233
<v Speaker 3>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to weave into this my </v>

88
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the infallible frame of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind that feels so confident in shutting</v>

89
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:21.334
<v Speaker 3>down others.</v>

90
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 3>So our freedom of speech and political </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness mutually exclusive,</v>

91
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.793
<v Speaker 3>this is our world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you'll notice that the free </v>

92
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:36.111
<v Speaker 3>countries are in green and the purple </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones are authoritarian or a towel.</v>

93
00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Terrian regimes and the yellow ones are </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat in the middle,</v>

94
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.123
<v Speaker 3>partly free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the first thing that strikes one is </v>

95
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:48.990
<v Speaker 3>that most of the green is kind of to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>west.</v>

96
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.450
<v Speaker 3>And the exceptions to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries like Israel,</v>

97
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.490
<v Speaker 3>India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>

98
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 3>even South Africa have had some impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

99
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 3>from have been influenced to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>extent,</v>

100
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 3>often in a major way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often as a colony,</v>

101
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are dominated by the British.</v>

102
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 3>And many of these ideas about freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 3>speech come from the British tradition.</v>

103
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 3>You'll also notice that there these are </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge landmass is,</v>

104
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:24.854
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seem almost equal in the countries </v>

105
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.913
<v Speaker 3>that are are purple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very limited equality of rights </v>

106
00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:36.060
<v Speaker 3>for women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for gays,</v>

107
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for various religious minorities.</v>

108
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.960
<v Speaker 3>Those rights exist in the countries that</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree.</v>

109
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.880
<v Speaker 3>So it looks like it's kind of 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 freedom versus authoritarianism.</v>

110
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.630
<v Speaker 3>But actually if you look at this by </v>
<v Speaker 3>population,</v>

111
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 3>only 9.9% of us live in democracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of shocking.</v>

112
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.253
<v Speaker 3>The rest of us live in highly flawed </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracies with limited rights or </v>

113
00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:02.064
<v Speaker 3>hybrid regimes and 34%,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so three and a half times live in </v>

114
00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:12.501
<v Speaker 3>authoritarian regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So democracy is not in fantastic shape.</v>

115
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.703
<v Speaker 3>If you look at things in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>population and ideas like freedom of </v>

116
00:07:19.921 --> 00:07:21.570
<v Speaker 3>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

117
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.613
<v Speaker 3>if they're only really substantiated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>9.9% of people on the planet arguably </v>

118
00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:32.640
<v Speaker 3>are an endangered species or the at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least can't be taken for granted.</v>

119
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.100
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons I'm here </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

120
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.753
<v Speaker 3>But why discuss this in the West?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a way we have more freedom of speech </v>

121
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 3>than ever before with the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone can publish a blog,</v>

122
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 3>can set up their own media company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>develop social media websites,</v>

123
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 3>and in some respects the taste for </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of expression is rising.</v>

124
00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.760
<v Speaker 3>And yet that same electronic media has </v>
<v Speaker 3>made it possible for everyone to monitor</v>

125
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your boss,</v>

126
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 3>to monitor you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your government monitor to you.</v>

127
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.720
<v Speaker 3>And so suddenly the temptation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>blocking expression is also,</v>

128
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to be taken very seriously.</v>

129
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.140
<v Speaker 3>Some recent examples of political </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness.</v>

130
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.983
<v Speaker 3>So President Obama responding to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rise of political correctness on campus </v>

131
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.310
<v Speaker 3>gave a speech in Iowa in September,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2015 in a way,</v>

132
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:37.244
<v Speaker 3>you might argue that he articulated in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>colloquial way the basic liberal </v>

133
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:43.340
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a liberal,</v>

134
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean the classical liberal argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>for liberty and freedom of speech.</v>

135
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.030
<v Speaker 3>The purpose of college is to create a </v>
<v Speaker 3>space where a lot of ideas are present.</v>

136
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 3>He said and collide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I went to college,</v>

137
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 3>suddenly there were some folks who </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't think at all like me and if I had</v>

138
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 3>an opinion about something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd look at me and they'd say,</v>

139
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:03.684
<v Speaker 3>well that's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they describe how they saw the </v>

140
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:06.594
<v Speaker 3>world and they might have had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different sense of politics or they </v>

141
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.043
<v Speaker 3>might have a different view about </v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty or they might have a different </v>

142
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.254
<v Speaker 3>perspective on race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes their views would be </v>

143
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:16.554
<v Speaker 3>infuriating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was because there was this space </v>

144
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.073
<v Speaker 3>where you could interact with people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't agree with you that I then </v>

145
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 3>started testing my own assumptions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I realized,</v>

146
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I've been too narrow minded.</v>

147
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:32.483
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I didn't take this into account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I should see this person's </v>

148
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:36.354
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what college in part is all </v>

149
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:42.120
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's him going on.</v>

150
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 3>Just after that,</v>

151
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.970
<v Speaker 4>I was just talking to a friend of mine </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>

152
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

153
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.793
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard some college campuses where </v>

154
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.160
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to have a guest speaker </v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

155
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.473
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is too conservative or they don't want </v>

156
00:09:58.601 --> 00:09:59.434
<v Speaker 4>to read a book if it has language that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is offensive to African Americans or </v>

157
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.720
<v Speaker 4>somehow sends a demeaning signal towards</v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

158
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

159
00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:15.790
<v Speaker 4>I gotta tell you I don't agree with that</v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

160
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.033
<v Speaker 4>I don't agree that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you become students at colleges </v>

161
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.260
<v Speaker 4>have to be coddled and protected from </v>
<v Speaker 4>different points of view.</v>

162
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.490
<v Speaker 2>It all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you should be able to</v>

163
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.160
<v Speaker 2>get off</v>

164
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.090
<v Speaker 4>use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should invite anybody,</v>

165
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 4>anybody who comes to speak to you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you disagree with,</v>

166
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:49.340
<v Speaker 4>you should have an argument with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you shouldn't silence them by saying</v>

167
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:53.230
<v Speaker 4>you can't come because you know my </v>
<v Speaker 4>senses.</v>

168
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm too sensitive to hear what you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say.</v>

169
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.560
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>

170
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.340
<v Speaker 4>that's not the way we learn either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do you think?</v>

171
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amen.</v>

172
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.970
<v Speaker 2>He said Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

173
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.133
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

174
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.313
<v Speaker 3>Now the president used the words coddled</v>
<v Speaker 3>and protected and not listening to </v>

175
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:21.720
<v Speaker 3>people because we are too sensitive to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear what you have to say.</v>

176
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.840
<v Speaker 3>And coddling and overprotecting it might</v>
<v Speaker 3>seem,</v>

177
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 3>would produce non resilient passive </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

178
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.483
<v Speaker 3>but coddling can also cause people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become self focused in title and </v>

179
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:36.450
<v Speaker 3>disrespectful of others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

180
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.650
<v Speaker 3>silencing gathers is not always a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty thing.</v>

181
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.380
<v Speaker 3>So there was the Yale Halloween crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

182
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.120
<v Speaker 3>and some Yale students complained to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>administration that it was offering very</v>

183
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:54.544
<v Speaker 3>heavy handed advice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling them that they would be </v>

184
00:11:56.501 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 3>insensitive to wear costumes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolize cultural appropriation.</v>

185
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 3>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Erika Christakis,</v>

186
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:04.324
<v Speaker 3>who was a Yale lecturer and a specialist</v>
<v Speaker 3>in childhood education and who had with </v>

187
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:14.491
<v Speaker 3>her husband been involved in supervising</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the residences at Yale.</v>

188
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.353
<v Speaker 3>She wrote an email encouraging students </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stand up for their own right to </v>

189
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:19.924
<v Speaker 3>decide what to wear and not cede control</v>
<v Speaker 3>to others to make moral decisions for </v>

190
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:25.660
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>

191
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 3>if you object to others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>costumes speak up.</v>

192
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:29.164
<v Speaker 3>By all means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now a faction of students then demanded </v>

193
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 3>that the Christakis is be fired.</v>

194
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:36.993
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

195
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.333
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that was happening is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were groups at Yale saying that </v>

196
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.480
<v Speaker 3>they felt there was not enough respect </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

197
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural diversity,</v>

198
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>along lines of race and so on.</v>

199
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.950
<v Speaker 3>But this was the event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

200
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Erika Christakis email that triggered </v>

201
00:12:56.721 --> 00:13:01.710
<v Speaker 3>things after she wrote that email,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her husband,</v>

202
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.700
<v Speaker 3>Nicholas</v>

203
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.103
<v Speaker 2>tweeted,</v>

204
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.520
<v Speaker 3>President Obama saying the things I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>showed you saying,</v>

205
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.773
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't try to overprotect </v>

206
00:13:13.221 --> 00:13:14.054
<v Speaker 3>students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in this very widely viewed </v>

207
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.110
<v Speaker 3>video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one young woman,</v>

208
00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:24.170
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm going to show you more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came up to,</v>

209
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicholas Christakis with about a hundred</v>

210
00:13:28.611 --> 00:13:31.310
<v Speaker 3>other students at a protest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

211
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.203
<v Speaker 3>to speak to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I used the word speak in quotation </v>

212
00:13:34.821 --> 00:13:39.821
<v Speaker 3>marks while you watched this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to analyze what's happening here.</v>

213
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.130
<v Speaker 5>The exception is because other people </v>
<v Speaker 5>have rights to not just what</v>

214
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.030
<v Speaker 5>you understand</v>
<v Speaker 5>that</v>

215
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.210
<v Speaker 5>your job please comfort and home for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>students.</v>

216
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.193
<v Speaker 5>So I have not done that by sending out </v>
<v Speaker 5>that email that goes against your </v>

217
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:12.590
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you understand that</v>

218
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.370
<v Speaker 5>I have a different vision if that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you think about being</v>

219
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.200
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are doing that.</v>

220
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.813
<v Speaker 5>They're going to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to transfer because you </v>

221
00:14:52.301 --> 00:14:57.301
<v Speaker 5>are up ports,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not sleep at night.</v>

222
00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.910
<v Speaker 5>We're out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We out are just stop thing.</v>

223
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.770
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

224
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.613
<v Speaker 3>so amongst the thing she said is you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to create an intellectual space </v>

225
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:12.670
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

226
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:16.180
<v Speaker 3>this should be a safe haven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be a home.</v>

227
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and where the function of college goats,</v>

228
00:15:21.721 --> 00:15:22.554
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one might argue this is just one </v>

229
00:15:25.481 --> 00:15:28.270
<v Speaker 3>person who had a bad day and was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

230
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.750
<v Speaker 3>was very upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't just one person.</v>

231
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Oops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

232
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.060
<v Speaker 3>It went on and for quite a while</v>

233
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.900
<v Speaker 5>do even for causing pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was looking for the right word.</v>

234
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:49.470
<v Speaker 5>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] violence.</v>

235
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:57.680
<v Speaker 5>I can disagree with that statement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is your name?</v>

236
00:15:57.681 --> 00:15:59.360
<v Speaker 5>You need to bend down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not bending.</v>

237
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.550
<v Speaker 5>What's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do not want you to take your,</v>

238
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.040
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do not want,</v>

239
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.450
<v Speaker 5>I do not respect you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to hear that.</v>

240
00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:07.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at this smirk in your face </v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm disgusting</v>

241
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.810
<v Speaker 5>and I'm sick watching them argue with </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

242
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.253
<v Speaker 5>We've been standing on stage literally </v>
<v Speaker 5>for at least five to six hours between </v>

243
00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 5>you and Halloween,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which wean last night.</v>

244
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.473
<v Speaker 5>To now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've been arguing with people who are </v>

245
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:26.360
<v Speaker 5>not willing to be listened to for a long</v>
<v Speaker 5>time and all I see from you is arrogance</v>

246
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 5>and ego.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am thick looking at you.</v>

247
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.740
<v Speaker 5>I am disgusted watching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>argue with you.</v>

248
00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.110
<v Speaker 5>You are not listening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are disgusting.</v>

249
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

250
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.370
<v Speaker 5>before I wasn't I before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was not angry per say.</v>

251
00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:47.204
<v Speaker 5>I was disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I thought maybe there was real </v>

252
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:49.964
<v Speaker 5>important before apology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've clearly told us that you did not </v>

253
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:54.560
<v Speaker 5>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Offer an apology for your words.</v>

254
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.290
<v Speaker 5>You left the meeting last night to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>home and vent.</v>

255
00:16:58.291 --> 00:16:59.124
<v Speaker 5>Tweak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do not interrupt me to tweet from your </v>

256
00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 5>twitter and then the filaments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twitter,</v>

257
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.873
<v Speaker 5>you showed no remorse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You tried to let your wife leave that </v>

258
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:09.200
<v Speaker 5>conversation without having answered for</v>
<v Speaker 5>herself.</v>

259
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.450
<v Speaker 5>That is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is sick.</v>

260
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.110
<v Speaker 5>And now I wasn't angry before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was not angry before,</v>

261
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:18.320
<v Speaker 5>but now I am actually angry sir.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do not interrupt me.</v>

262
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 5>I was not angry and now I want your job </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be taken from you.</v>

263
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:23.893
<v Speaker 5>I don't want them to have this job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am discussing knowing that she worked </v>

264
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.940
<v Speaker 5>at Yale University where I will get my </v>
<v Speaker 5>degree.</v>

265
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 5>I will look back and think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to argue with you.</v>

266
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Halloween problem had to do with </v>

267
00:17:34.571 --> 00:17:35.404
<v Speaker 3>cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people would be dressing up as </v>

268
00:17:38.561 --> 00:17:39.394
<v Speaker 3>different different groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural appropriations about who can </v>

269
00:17:43.931 --> 00:17:48.931
<v Speaker 3>say what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 2015 the University of Ottawa Student</v>

270
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Federation canceled a Free Yoga Class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been going on for about eight years.</v>

271
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 3>It was taught at the center for students</v>
<v Speaker 3>with disabilities.</v>

272
00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.123
<v Speaker 3>It was free again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say that and it was closed down </v>

273
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:02.904
<v Speaker 3>because some students were uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the cultural issues involved and </v>

274
00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:06.984
<v Speaker 3>when asked for explanations that had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with the fact that yoga was from </v>

275
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:10.523
<v Speaker 3>India and the instructor was not from </v>
<v Speaker 3>India and so she had no right to teach </v>

276
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:16.704
<v Speaker 3>it and it wasn't even clear that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the West had the right to teach yoga </v>

277
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:21.730
<v Speaker 3>to others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there were,</v>

278
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.810
<v Speaker 3>there was no right to offer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Offer that.</v>

279
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.143
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The PC issue about fiction is who can </v>

280
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:34.164
<v Speaker 3>write what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's argued that a person of one </v>

281
00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:37.404
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>race or gender cannot create a fiction </v>

282
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:40.584
<v Speaker 3>character of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is another religion or race or </v>

283
00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 3>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cultural appropriation,</v>

284
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.190
<v Speaker 3>it's identity theft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why?</v>

285
00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:51.024
<v Speaker 3>I would say stop it writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why following that reasoning should </v>

286
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:59.640
<v Speaker 3>anyone be permitted to read fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which involves recreating characters who</v>

287
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:01.950
<v Speaker 3>are different from ourselves in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>heads.</v>

288
00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:09.690
<v Speaker 3>This problem is important because </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading fiction as doctors Raymond Mark,</v>

289
00:19:11.021 --> 00:19:11.854
<v Speaker 3>he felt Lee and Professor Peterson here </v>
<v Speaker 3>today have shown actually increases </v>

290
00:19:15.791 --> 00:19:20.791
<v Speaker 3>empathy for readers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we wrote the kind of fiction demanded</v>

291
00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.780
<v Speaker 3>the art form would disappear and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>replaced by add nine memoir.</v>

292
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.033
<v Speaker 3>Me Talking about myself and I would add </v>
<v Speaker 3>to myself probably wouldn't be very </v>

293
00:19:31.481 --> 00:19:32.314
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So political correctness is not just </v>

294
00:19:35.201 --> 00:19:36.034
<v Speaker 3>about correct action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but correct thought and seeks to limit </v>

295
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.450
<v Speaker 3>the imagination.</v>

296
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:43.323
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

297
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.170
<v Speaker 3>so forgive me for quoting a novelist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

298
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.110
<v Speaker 3>therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but censorship is rarely self limiting.</v>

299
00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.610
<v Speaker 3>This is from Saul bellow's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Augie March 1st page.</v>

300
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knows there is no firmness or </v>
<v Speaker 3>accuracy of suppression.</v>

301
00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:02.140
<v Speaker 3>If you hold down one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hold down the adjoining.</v>

302
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:06.220
<v Speaker 3>If there's an idea that's forbidden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something similar to it.</v>

303
00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Or connected to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's arguably forbidden.</v>

304
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:09.663
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a kind of a hunt of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a kind of exercise of scrupulosity </v>

305
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.520
<v Speaker 3>that is not self limiting.</v>

306
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:17.420
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

307
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.600
<v Speaker 3>People have tried to understand what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on here.</v>

308
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>President Obama picked it up.</v>

309
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.283
<v Speaker 3>There's a kind of hypersensitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity afoot and this first showed </v>

310
00:20:27.681 --> 00:20:32.330
<v Speaker 3>itself in the 1990s and late 1980s and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Camille Paglia,</v>

311
00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:37.310
<v Speaker 3>the independently minded feminist </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinker art historian,</v>

312
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.710
<v Speaker 3>a student of literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote an article called the Nerc nursery</v>

313
00:20:42.711 --> 00:20:46.520
<v Speaker 3>school campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wondered what's new here.</v>

314
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.500
<v Speaker 3>She noted and has noted since the hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>protective helicopter parenting,</v>

315
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 3>it seems to undermine resilience and </v>
<v Speaker 3>independence over protected.</v>

316
00:20:57.281 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 3>People will turn to adults or the legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>system to protect them,</v>

317
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Speaker 3>encouraging authorities to regulate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensor,</v>

318
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.840
<v Speaker 3>others around them and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>encouraging them to,</v>

319
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.820
<v Speaker 3>as we saw with the Halloween costumes </v>
<v Speaker 3>censor themselves.</v>

320
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.830
<v Speaker 3>This is so different from the 60s where </v>
<v Speaker 3>students were seeking freedom.</v>

321
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 3>There are new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller one to two children families,</v>

322
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 3>which encourage a feeling in the child </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the world of adults revolves around</v>

323
00:21:23.021 --> 00:21:23.854
<v Speaker 3>the child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Compare that to families 150 years ago </v>

324
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:27.843
<v Speaker 3>or families in Quebec.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know 70 years ago where you have </v>

325
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:34.210
<v Speaker 3>five to 10 children and you're raised by</v>
<v Speaker 3>your siblings.</v>

326
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 3>They don't buy that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't think you're so special.</v>

327
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.083
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there are the dean natured urban </v>

328
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:43.973
<v Speaker 3>upbringings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people with limited experience in </v>

329
00:21:45.981 --> 00:21:46.814
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>farming rural life where self reliance </v>

330
00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:52.710
<v Speaker 3>as a key virtue think that most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life's upbringing,</v>

331
00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:55.430
<v Speaker 3>stem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not from nature but societal ills,</v>

332
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.310
<v Speaker 3>human decisions about how to distribute </v>
<v Speaker 3>goods,</v>

333
00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.700
<v Speaker 3>awards and status and how about the zero</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerance policies in schools incur,</v>

334
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
<v Speaker 3>they encourage and moderation and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>encourage ignoring context of,</v>

335
00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.760
<v Speaker 3>of difficulties that they're assessing.</v>

336
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.463
<v Speaker 3>Political correctness as a term of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved out of the Russian revolution </v>

337
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:23.883
<v Speaker 3>comes from Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was used by the land in this left to </v>

338
00:22:26.711 --> 00:22:27.544
<v Speaker 3>describe keeping to the party line or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the spirit of the party party most and </v>

339
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:36.130
<v Speaker 3>lending himself wrote a number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>articles about the importance of holding</v>

340
00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:36.964
<v Speaker 3>collect correct political views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there would be the baits and some </v>

341
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:41.710
<v Speaker 3>people would differ about certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

342
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.830
<v Speaker 3>but certain views were not politically </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

343
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.460
<v Speaker 3>They didn't go with doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now pc was then used by the left.</v>

344
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:54.603
<v Speaker 3>Later on with conscious irony is like as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kind of installed to describe someone </v>

345
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 3>on the left who had too much fervor </v>
<v Speaker 3>toeing the party line.</v>

346
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:07.830
<v Speaker 3>So there there are tendency to Dogma and</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine was so intense that it ups it,</v>

347
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.733
<v Speaker 3>it obscured their own humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that ironic use of pc and not as a </v>

348
00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:16.354
<v Speaker 3>compliment was became mainstream in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>1990s to more or less described the </v>

349
00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:25.210
<v Speaker 3>techniques and attitudes designed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>influence um,</v>

350
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:30.160
<v Speaker 3>society to tow the party line of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal portion of the left.</v>

351
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.233
<v Speaker 3>Not all of the left is a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are the techniques that are </v>

352
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:36.834
<v Speaker 3>familiar to all of us to attack freedom </v>
<v Speaker 3>of speech or expression or invalidate </v>

353
00:23:40.921 --> 00:23:44.190
<v Speaker 3>speakers and shut them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have speech codes that determine what</v>

354
00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:45.024
<v Speaker 3>people can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they prescribe or forbid we have forced </v>

355
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:49.724
<v Speaker 3>speech which mandates what people must </v>
<v Speaker 3>say it prescribes and puts words in </v>

356
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:54.794
<v Speaker 3>people's mouth.</v>

357
00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.490
<v Speaker 3>We have dress codes isn't the Halloween </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation or other,</v>

358
00:23:59.491 --> 00:24:00.130
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

359
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:00.963
<v Speaker 3>other examples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Non platforming the term not giving a </v>

360
00:24:04.121 --> 00:24:04.954
<v Speaker 3>person a platform which was I understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>originally used in Britain to describe </v>

361
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.593
<v Speaker 3>not giving violent fascists a platform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it was very quickly applied to </v>

362
00:24:15.011 --> 00:24:17.620
<v Speaker 3>not giving anyone from Israel a </v>
<v Speaker 3>platform.</v>

363
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.900
<v Speaker 3>And then it generalized to not giving a </v>
<v Speaker 3>platform to people we disagree with.</v>

364
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.500
<v Speaker 3>You can boycott lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can block entrances to lectures,</v>

365
00:24:26.501 --> 00:24:28.960
<v Speaker 3>you can drown out lecturers with noise </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines,</v>

366
00:24:28.961 --> 00:24:32.590
<v Speaker 3>shouting fire alarms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Professor Peterson's experienced much of</v>

367
00:24:32.591 --> 00:24:35.140
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can pour fallow human substances</v>

368
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:40.141
<v Speaker 3>on people if that's your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you can get a huge,</v>

369
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can organize to forbid institutional</v>

370
00:24:44.351 --> 00:24:45.184
<v Speaker 3>invitations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the bds movement to shut out all the </v>

371
00:24:48.431 --> 00:24:51.670
<v Speaker 3>attempt to shut out all was rarely </v>
<v Speaker 3>academics from having a right to speak,</v>

372
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:55.450
<v Speaker 3>mostly in Europe and North America would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be an example of that.</v>

373
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.200
<v Speaker 3>And then Internet flash mobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>petitions,</v>

374
00:24:59.201 --> 00:25:00.034
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty hard not to get a petition </v>

375
00:25:01.721 --> 00:25:04.750
<v Speaker 3>of 20,000 people objecting to something </v>
<v Speaker 3>or someone,</v>

376
00:25:04.751 --> 00:25:08.170
<v Speaker 3>it's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anonymous character assassination,</v>

377
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.573
<v Speaker 3>Internet misinformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at to the pro free speech rally at </v>

378
00:25:15.491 --> 00:25:16.324
<v Speaker 3>the University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone costed Professor Peterson and </v>

379
00:25:19.781 --> 00:25:21.700
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are they're Nazis at this?</v>

380
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:22.811
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

381
00:25:22.811 --> 00:25:27.010
<v Speaker 3>your rally peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there were no Nazis at the Raleigh.</v>

382
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:28.803
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that kind of thing just get getting </v>

383
00:25:31.031 --> 00:25:31.864
<v Speaker 3>repeated over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a kind of character </v>

384
00:25:33.911 --> 00:25:34.744
<v Speaker 3>assassination attempts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're here with the man who've </v>

385
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.040
<v Speaker 3>survived one character assassination </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempt.</v>

386
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.503
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there are threats of shaming to </v>

387
00:25:42.221 --> 00:25:45.130
<v Speaker 3>create a chill in classrooms campus in </v>
<v Speaker 3>society at large.</v>

388
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.790
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the reason I'm here today</v>

389
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:54.420
<v Speaker 3>because I have seen things written by </v>
<v Speaker 3>students that they feel they cannot even</v>

390
00:25:55.601 --> 00:25:59.750
<v Speaker 3>at my blessings university discuss many </v>
<v Speaker 3>diff,</v>

391
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.623
<v Speaker 3>many important subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those letters was actually </v>

392
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:03.164
<v Speaker 3>published in the varsity about a student</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was in a bioethics class and they </v>

393
00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:11.681
<v Speaker 3>were discussing sexuality and they even </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussed aspects of Chen transgendered.</v>

394
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:17.380
<v Speaker 3>And he wanted us to do a paper on it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very thoughtful.</v>

395
00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.740
<v Speaker 3>A decent professor basically just </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissuaded him.</v>

396
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.610
<v Speaker 3>So there are things that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to,</v>

397
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.620
<v Speaker 3>to talk about or think about.</v>

398
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:31.783
<v Speaker 3>Now privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 3>privilege is used to say the people who </v>

399
00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:34.544
<v Speaker 3>are not from a protected group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is often put into legislation or </v>

400
00:26:38.841 --> 00:26:39.674
<v Speaker 3>in the popular mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not entitled to speak on certain </v>

401
00:26:42.441 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain key issues.</v>

402
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.510
<v Speaker 3>So privilege limits who can speak and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's based on the assumption that people</v>

403
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:51.600
<v Speaker 3>from what is designated as a non,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

404
00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:52.623
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a non vulnerable group carry a kind </v>

405
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:58.440
<v Speaker 3>of original sin based on the group that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they come from.</v>

406
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.083
<v Speaker 3>It's usually buttressed by a narrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>stating that the person's ancestors did </v>

407
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:06.360
<v Speaker 3>terrible things and had life easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hence the privilege.</v>

408
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:11.840
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the word privilege also was used by my,</v>

409
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.030
<v Speaker 3>by the early communists to describe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bourgeois.</v>

410
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.400
<v Speaker 3>And in the early parts of the revolution</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was sufficient to be bourgeois,</v>

411
00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 3>to be rounded up and shot because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>had privilege.</v>

412
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.463
<v Speaker 3>And of course many people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many thoughtful people are scratching </v>

413
00:27:29.131 --> 00:27:29.964
<v Speaker 3>their heads because they find it hard to</v>
<v Speaker 3>distinguish this kind of categorization </v>

414
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.680
<v Speaker 3>from bigotry since it bree prejudges </v>
<v Speaker 3>people by the group they come from,</v>

415
00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

416
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.553
<v Speaker 3>One of the politically correct methods </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's evolving is what I call </v>

417
00:27:44.821 --> 00:27:45.654
<v Speaker 3>asymmetrical lawfare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So asymmetrical lawfare is writing law </v>

418
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:50.514
<v Speaker 3>or legal code or institutional code to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give an advantage to an accuser who </v>

419
00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:57.390
<v Speaker 3>would shut down the free expression of </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

420
00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.960
<v Speaker 3>And how do we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

421
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.573
<v Speaker 3>we reexamined evidentiary criteria and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what counts for some kind of </v>

422
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.920
<v Speaker 3>elicit act or problematic activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you can't prove aggression alleged</v>

423
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.470
<v Speaker 3>new category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>micro aggression,</v>

424
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.780
<v Speaker 3>this involves defining hate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speech,</v>

425
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:21.300
<v Speaker 3>discrimination and harassment down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

426
00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:24.990
<v Speaker 3>lowering the threshold of each of these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things are important things.</v>

427
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

428
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.730
<v Speaker 3>the definitions are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or sliding and changing.</v>

429
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.720
<v Speaker 3>If you can't improve mal intention or </v>
<v Speaker 3>any intention,</v>

430
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.973
<v Speaker 3>say the harm is done unintentionally and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be every bit as much a human </v>

431
00:28:38.401 --> 00:28:41.940
<v Speaker 3>rights violation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you define words up.</v>

432
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.750
<v Speaker 3>So words become action and a critical </v>
<v Speaker 3>word</v>

433
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.383
<v Speaker 3>becomes violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now his speech violence is speech </v>

434
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:54.210
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

435
00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:57.750
<v Speaker 3>you know at times speech is action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The philosopher Jl Austin,</v>

436
00:28:57.751 --> 00:28:58.584
<v Speaker 3>and how to do things with words pointed </v>
<v Speaker 3>out that language can have what he </v>

437
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:04.980
<v Speaker 3>called the performative aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when a bride or groom says,</v>

438
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.230
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a general says attack,</v>

439
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:11.610
<v Speaker 3>the speaker is doing something with </v>
<v Speaker 3>words that has a legal consequence.</v>

440
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:13.403
<v Speaker 3>But does the fact that some words can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>given a legal context sometimes mean </v>

441
00:29:16.201 --> 00:29:19.680
<v Speaker 3>that all words we disagree with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be seen as violent actions.</v>

442
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:23.670
<v Speaker 3>That is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now these are pc values,</v>

443
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.370
<v Speaker 3>inclusiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerance,</v>

444
00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 3>anti prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity,</v>

445
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.040
<v Speaker 3>openness to difference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kindness and compassion,</v>

446
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.890
<v Speaker 3>living together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonjudgmental ism,</v>

447
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 3>transparent transparency.</v>

448
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.243
<v Speaker 3>And increasingly one hears people </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking the language of seeking a </v>

449
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:42.574
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic culture where we create a </v>
<v Speaker 3>world where everyone feels good and </v>

450
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:46.624
<v Speaker 3>their feelings are valued and respected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the PC understanding of a </v>

451
00:29:50.111 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

452
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at these,</v>

453
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty clear that many </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadians support these values.</v>

454
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.323
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also clear that these are </v>
<v Speaker 3>placeholders that many people defined </v>

455
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:05.374
<v Speaker 3>somewhat differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when it gets down to the nitty </v>

456
00:30:07.571 --> 00:30:10.400
<v Speaker 3>gritty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you said something like diversity,</v>

457
00:30:10.401 --> 00:30:11.234
<v Speaker 3>but what exactly do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these words have a great plastic </v>

458
00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not neuroplastic,</v>

459
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 3>but just plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

460
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:23.100
<v Speaker 3>in the sense that they're very evocative</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a little lot of quote,</v>

461
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:24.760
<v Speaker 3>forgive the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dirty word,</v>

462
00:30:24.761 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 3>buy in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

463
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.030
<v Speaker 3>to these words if you just use these </v>
<v Speaker 3>words and don't think through how to use</v>

464
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:31.864
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing about them is </v>

465
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.840
<v Speaker 3>they're all about justice and equality.</v>

466
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:42.190
<v Speaker 3>They're all about good things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why the utterly intolerant behavior?</v>

467
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.463
<v Speaker 3>If these are your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it simply a case of weakness of will </v>

468
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:53.630
<v Speaker 3>people who are pc care for these values?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like many of the rest of us,</v>

469
00:30:53.631 --> 00:30:58.460
<v Speaker 3>they fail to live up to their values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why intolerant?</v>

470
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.870
<v Speaker 3>Is that a case of projection?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unable to be tolerant,</v>

471
00:31:02.871 --> 00:31:05.420
<v Speaker 3>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and open as much as they would sincerely</v>

472
00:31:05.421 --> 00:31:06.254
<v Speaker 3>wish to be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they have a guilty conscience and to </v>

473
00:31:09.111 --> 00:31:11.810
<v Speaker 3>deal with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the then project their faults on to</v>

474
00:31:11.811 --> 00:31:16.010
<v Speaker 3>others righteously condemn them feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves pure of heart.</v>

475
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.110
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of projection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

476
00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:19.123
<v Speaker 3>in the little video I showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember when wipe that smirk off your </v>

477
00:31:21.861 --> 00:31:23.570
<v Speaker 3>face?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that smirk?</v>

478
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.790
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could not see that smirk.</v>

479
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.163
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it must have been fun to give him </v>

480
00:31:29.331 --> 00:31:30.970
<v Speaker 3>the gears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

481
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.630
<v Speaker 3>now remember when you project one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your faults onto another person,</v>

482
00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.380
<v Speaker 3>you become blind to it and yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the purpose of projection.</v>

483
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:42.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

484
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.273
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the non-compassionate noninclusive </v>

485
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.040
<v Speaker 3>intolerant behavior or social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>warriors?</v>

486
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.023
<v Speaker 3>Simply opportunists using these commonly</v>
<v Speaker 3>shared values that I showed you as the </v>

487
00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:57.114
<v Speaker 3>ideal tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideal hammers to attack those </v>

488
00:31:59.941 --> 00:32:01.830
<v Speaker 3>they're competing with for political </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

489
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.953
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these values of inclusion are shared by </v>

490
00:32:05.671 --> 00:32:09.960
<v Speaker 3>many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why being accused of being racist</v>

491
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:15.500
<v Speaker 3>or sexist or something very much stings </v>
<v Speaker 3>and anyone with a good conscience,</v>

492
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.913
<v Speaker 3>anyone with a conscience is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a quickly frozen by such an </v>

493
00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:22.110
<v Speaker 3>accusation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interestingly,</v>

494
00:32:22.111 --> 00:32:22.944
<v Speaker 3>those who don't have much of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscience or not frozen by such an </v>

495
00:32:25.381 --> 00:32:29.010
<v Speaker 3>accusation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as the accusations are repeated over</v>

496
00:32:29.011 --> 00:32:32.880
<v Speaker 3>and over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they begin to lose their potency,</v>

497
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.970
<v Speaker 3>which is a problem because there is such</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing as racism.</v>

498
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.850
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of like a government that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>printing more and more money.</v>

499
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.183
<v Speaker 3>Soon your dollar doesn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's this question </v>

500
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:48.730
<v Speaker 3>considering how inclusive and Koombaya </v>
<v Speaker 3>these values are.</v>

501
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Why does social justice warriors call </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves warriors?</v>

502
00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:53.510
<v Speaker 3>They're not peacemakers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance.</v>

503
00:32:56.290 --> 00:33:01.290
<v Speaker 3>So let's turn now to the classic </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulation of freedom of speech.</v>

504
00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not the only stream.</v>

505
00:33:05.441 --> 00:33:07.060
<v Speaker 3>There are judicial streams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

506
00:33:07.061 --> 00:33:11.320
<v Speaker 3>but I actually prefer the philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 3>stream to the judicial stream.</v>

507
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:17.250
<v Speaker 3>So this is John Stuart mill who wrote on</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberty in 1859 and he prefaced the book</v>

508
00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.660
<v Speaker 3>with a quote of a sentence from another </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

509
00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:28.260
<v Speaker 3>but this sentence very much sums up much</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it on liberty is about,</v>

510
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.660
<v Speaker 3>so it's from the Greatville home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a von Humbolt,</v>

511
00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.513
<v Speaker 3>the grand leading principal towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>which every argument unfolded in these </v>

512
00:33:37.391 --> 00:33:38.224
<v Speaker 3>pages directly converges is the absolute</v>
<v Speaker 3>and essential importance of human </v>

513
00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:48.271
<v Speaker 3>development in its richest diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost as though it might have been</v>

514
00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:50.380
<v Speaker 3>written by a certain kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologist,</v>

515
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:56.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's about human flourishing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thriving and somehow or other liberty is</v>

516
00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:01.090
<v Speaker 3>about that in a very big way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

517
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.673
<v Speaker 3>he makes clear in the book that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fundamental opposition between </v>

518
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:10.110
<v Speaker 3>individual liberty and tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fundamentally opposed as liberty</v>

519
00:34:10.151 --> 00:34:12.700
<v Speaker 3>increases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>authoritarianism decreases,</v>

520
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:13.690
<v Speaker 3>and vice versa.</v>

521
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Your meal did get involved in political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the politics of his day.</v>

522
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.190
<v Speaker 3>He wrote the subject of women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first,</v>

523
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:31.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminist books he wrote on Uti,</v>

524
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uti on utilitarianism.</v>

525
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.030
<v Speaker 3>He wrote on liberty with his wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harriet Taylor,</v>

526
00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:41.920
<v Speaker 3>who very much influenced the book and </v>
<v Speaker 3>who passed away before it was published.</v>

527
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the book was obviously his,</v>

528
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.160
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he learned a lot from her.</v>

529
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:49.623
<v Speaker 3>He worked to extend the vote and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the best educated people in the </v>

530
00:34:52.871 --> 00:34:53.704
<v Speaker 3>19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He learned ancient Greek at the age of </v>

531
00:34:55.541 --> 00:34:59.080
<v Speaker 3>three and his autobiography is famous </v>
<v Speaker 3>for these kinds of things.</v>

532
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:06.390
<v Speaker 3>So whenever somebody wants to limit free</v>
<v Speaker 3>speech,</v>

533
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.393
<v Speaker 3>the first thing out of their mouth is I </v>
<v Speaker 3>love free speech Bot or we believe in </v>

534
00:35:12.271 --> 00:35:13.104
<v Speaker 3>free speech bought free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always has limits and mel would agree </v>

535
00:35:18.661 --> 00:35:19.494
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference is the railroad has </v>

536
00:35:23.341 --> 00:35:26.940
<v Speaker 3>booked to create a space for free speech</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be reasonable.</v>

537
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:28.223
<v Speaker 3>And often when people are limiting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to move in the other </v>

538
00:35:30.961 --> 00:35:35.010
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's look at one of the many ways he</v>

539
00:35:35.011 --> 00:35:35.844
<v Speaker 3>articulated this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one it actions should be as free as </v>

540
00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:41.670
<v Speaker 3>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the contrary,</v>

541
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.533
<v Speaker 3>even opinions lose their immunity when </v>
<v Speaker 3>the circumstances in which they're </v>

542
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.740
<v Speaker 3>expressed are such as to constitute </v>
<v Speaker 3>their expression,</v>

543
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.250
<v Speaker 3>a positive instigation to some ms gvs </v>
<v Speaker 3>act.</v>

544
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.013
<v Speaker 3>And then he gives examples like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive instigation of a ms gvs act </v>

545
00:35:58.441 --> 00:35:59.274
<v Speaker 3>would be the following.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of poor people and the </v>

546
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:05.490
<v Speaker 3>corn growers have stopped growing corn </v>
<v Speaker 3>to protect prices.</v>

547
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.613
<v Speaker 3>They assemble around the home of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corn grower and then you speak to them </v>

548
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 3>and yell and talk about how the corn </v>
<v Speaker 3>growers are starving to death.</v>

549
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.793
<v Speaker 3>That would be seen as incitement to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>angry group of people that's becoming a </v>

550
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:24.630
<v Speaker 3>mob and could immediately lead to </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

551
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.363
<v Speaker 3>So the threshold is fairly high there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also notice he says no one pretends </v>

552
00:36:30.361 --> 00:36:32.040
<v Speaker 3>that action should be as free as </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions.</v>

553
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.023
<v Speaker 3>It's very clear in his mind that actions</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not opinions and opinions are not </v>

554
00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 3>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Words are not actions.</v>

555
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.863
<v Speaker 3>They have to be distinguished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we are to get this space that </v>

556
00:36:42.061 --> 00:36:44.520
<v Speaker 3>President Obama says we need.</v>

557
00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:46.130
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

558
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Freedom of speech for mill is not just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

559
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:49.950
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

560
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:54.950
<v Speaker 3>It is a necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a necessity for the functioning of</v>

561
00:36:55.051 --> 00:36:55.884
<v Speaker 3>a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the oil that makes or the fuel </v>

562
00:36:58.501 --> 00:37:02.790
<v Speaker 3>that makes the engine grow and for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy functioning of the individual.</v>

563
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.193
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because human history is filled with </v>

564
00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:08.220
<v Speaker 3>error,</v>
<v Speaker 3>error,</v>

565
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:09.210
<v Speaker 3>error,</v>
<v Speaker 3>error,</v>

566
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.620
<v Speaker 3>error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coming from authority,</v>

567
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.000
<v Speaker 3>from faith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from religion,</v>

568
00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:13.710
<v Speaker 3>from political claims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from science,</v>

569
00:37:13.711 --> 00:37:17.820
<v Speaker 3>from ideologues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>augury prophecy and from common sense.</v>

570
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.390
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

571
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:20.223
<v Speaker 3>so this error must be examined and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to list all the scientific </v>

572
00:37:23.981 --> 00:37:28.030
<v Speaker 3>areas we've made over the years and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can list a few we're making right now,</v>

573
00:37:28.031 --> 00:37:28.864
<v Speaker 3>but this is not the time for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Free speech and inquiry are our best </v>

574
00:37:32.531 --> 00:37:36.460
<v Speaker 3>chance to overcome our extraordinary all</v>
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>

575
00:37:36.461 --> 00:37:37.294
<v Speaker 3>all too human proclivity for error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's important to understand how </v>

576
00:37:43.301 --> 00:37:46.180
<v Speaker 3>freedom and then how freedom of speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>emerges.</v>

577
00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:50.080
<v Speaker 3>And in a few elegant paragraphs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mills just lays this out.</v>

578
00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:51.723
<v Speaker 3>For most of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity has lived under tyranny or </v>

579
00:37:55.211 --> 00:37:56.044
<v Speaker 3>authoritarian rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you think of the map I just </v>

580
00:37:58.511 --> 00:37:59.344
<v Speaker 3>showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty close to that today as </v>

581
00:38:02.321 --> 00:38:06.130
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Authoritarian regimes are run by the few</v>

582
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.280
<v Speaker 3>whose who see their subjects as their </v>
<v Speaker 3>belongings,</v>

583
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:10.383
<v Speaker 3>their chattel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they use violence against them when </v>

584
00:38:12.371 --> 00:38:13.204
<v Speaker 3>they please take their property as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wish and prosecute and punish them at </v>

585
00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:20.920
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The law in this situation is as it has,</v>

586
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:21.963
<v Speaker 3>as Sadam Hussein said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law is the two lines above my </v>

587
00:38:25.721 --> 00:38:30.670
<v Speaker 3>signature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

588
00:38:30.671 --> 00:38:32.820
<v Speaker 3>why is free speech so frightening to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tire?</v>

589
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:36.760
<v Speaker 3>And he has a lot of power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It he rules through fear.</v>

590
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 3>And so he never really knows who he can </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust.</v>

591
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:41.410
<v Speaker 3>And that can include some of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>generals.</v>

592
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.750
<v Speaker 3>The tyrant and his crew are ultimately a</v>
<v Speaker 3>minority and the people are many.</v>

593
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.333
<v Speaker 3>And so it's important for the tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the people are not allowed to </v>

594
00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:52.624
<v Speaker 3>publicly share the extent to which they </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffer under his rule because then they </v>

595
00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 3>might organize against him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tyrant,</v>

596
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.640
<v Speaker 3>the emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dictator,</v>

597
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 3>and the odds are in their favor.</v>

598
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.510
<v Speaker 3>So if you think about the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emperor's new clothes,</v>

599
00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:11.344
<v Speaker 3>it's even pinker has argued when that </v>
<v Speaker 3>child speaks out and tells the truth in </v>

600
00:39:14.921 --> 00:39:17.230
<v Speaker 3>that story and says the emperor is </v>
<v Speaker 3>naked.</v>

601
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:22.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not that the adults have not seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he is naked as individuals,</v>

602
00:39:22.721 --> 00:39:23.554
<v Speaker 3>they have seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when the little boy ix speaks up in </v>

603
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Speaker 3>the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now everyone knows that everyone knows.</v>

604
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:35.980
<v Speaker 3>So emperors and tyrants create an </v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere of fear to silence people and</v>

605
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:39.790
<v Speaker 3>stop them from talking about things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>really everybody knows.</v>

606
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:41.870
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

607
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Now when the first democracy developed,</v>

608
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.170
<v Speaker 3>something happened to the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the people and their rulers.</v>

609
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.033
<v Speaker 3>It was reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people no longer worked for or were </v>

610
00:39:53.531 --> 00:39:56.560
<v Speaker 3>owned by the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the government worked for B,</v>

611
00:39:56.561 --> 00:39:59.080
<v Speaker 3>the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are John Locke's ideas,</v>

612
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:02.260
<v Speaker 3>very liberating ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Power is now with the people,</v>

613
00:40:02.261 --> 00:40:07.261
<v Speaker 3>a large group and they only lend it via </v>
<v Speaker 3>elections to some few of their number to</v>

614
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:08.614
<v Speaker 3>rule them temporarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of the people choose their </v>

615
00:40:11.801 --> 00:40:15.370
<v Speaker 3>rulers in elections,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they came to see themselves as both free</v>

616
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.233
<v Speaker 3>and self governing and self governing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People being a large group require free </v>

617
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.750
<v Speaker 3>speech to deliberate about their </v>
<v Speaker 3>options,</v>

618
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.240
<v Speaker 3>the laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war,</v>

619
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 3>peace who will represent them and so on.</v>

620
00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:29.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

621
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.113
<v Speaker 3>and free speech therefore involves </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenging ideas about what we should </v>

622
00:40:34.081 --> 00:40:34.914
<v Speaker 3>do as a community and it's essential </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're challenged over and over </v>

623
00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:44.820
<v Speaker 3>again to learn the strengths and </v>
<v Speaker 3>weaknesses of these monumental decisions</v>

624
00:40:44.821 --> 00:40:45.654
<v Speaker 3>that we make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This can only be done in dialogue where </v>

625
00:40:49.051 --> 00:40:49.560
<v Speaker 3>credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

626
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:54.560
<v Speaker 3>no criticisms are off limits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but elective officials with authority or</v>

627
00:40:54.811 --> 00:40:57.690
<v Speaker 3>other vested interests are always </v>
<v Speaker 3>tempted to limit the discussion.</v>

628
00:40:57.691 --> 00:41:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing I should say is that the</v>

629
00:41:01.081 --> 00:41:04.080
<v Speaker 3>liberal education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what universities are,</v>

630
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.033
<v Speaker 3>are supposed to be offering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was originally thought to be an </v>

631
00:41:07.981 --> 00:41:11.040
<v Speaker 3>education in liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Self governing.</v>

632
00:41:11.041 --> 00:41:15.270
<v Speaker 3>People need to be educated in some way </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the craft of leadership.</v>

633
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.493
<v Speaker 3>And the liberal education meant </v>
<v Speaker 3>familiarizing yourself with some of the </v>

634
00:41:19.591 --> 00:41:24.591
<v Speaker 3>core texts that helped people to become </v>
<v Speaker 3>free so that they can understand that.</v>

635
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:27.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

636
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:31.170
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even at great universities.</v>

637
00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:35.180
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like a boutique niche study</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this point,</v>

638
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:39.620
<v Speaker 3>but that's why they were called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal arts and education to liberty.</v>

639
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is very important for us today.</v>

640
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Democracies aren't perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

641
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.313
<v Speaker 3>we can be a great friend of democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the greatest of friends does not </v>

642
00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:57.401
<v Speaker 3>flatter his friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nil observed that in democracies,</v>

643
00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:58.643
<v Speaker 3>even though the people rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there can still be threats to free </v>

644
00:42:01.681 --> 00:42:02.514
<v Speaker 3>speech and liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is because strictly speaking in </v>

645
00:42:05.101 --> 00:42:08.220
<v Speaker 3>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all people rule at any one time.</v>

646
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:09.443
<v Speaker 3>Rather the majority rules and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>majority holds sway not just over </v>

647
00:42:13.021 --> 00:42:13.854
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but over large sectors of public </v>

648
00:42:15.841 --> 00:42:17.280
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As Tocqueville,</v>

649
00:42:17.281 --> 00:42:20.220
<v Speaker 3>Alexis de Tocqueville observed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy,</v>

650
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:25.670
<v Speaker 3>a tyranny of the majority can always </v>
<v Speaker 3>arise in which the many can suppress the</v>

651
00:42:26.431 --> 00:42:27.264
<v Speaker 3>few,</v>

652
00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:34.140
<v Speaker 3>the majority inflated by their power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their sense of self certainty,</v>

653
00:42:34.141 --> 00:42:34.974
<v Speaker 3>their sense of legitimacy brought about </v>
<v Speaker 3>by their greater number of their bulk </v>

654
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.520
<v Speaker 3>can begin to act with a reckless </v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence and indifference to others,</v>

655
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:42.683
<v Speaker 3>perhaps not unlike an absolute prince.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So following Tocqueville mill paid much </v>

656
00:42:48.151 --> 00:42:48.984
<v Speaker 3>attention to the fact that custom and </v>
<v Speaker 3>public opinion in common ideas can also </v>

657
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:56.280
<v Speaker 3>tyrannized over people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that in fact,</v>

658
00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.413
<v Speaker 3>often in our everyday life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these customs and these opinions can be </v>

659
00:43:02.461 --> 00:43:03.294
<v Speaker 3>actually more problematic than even </v>
<v Speaker 3>government and laws because it can put </v>

660
00:43:07.951 --> 00:43:11.340
<v Speaker 3>limits on liberty of those who think and</v>
<v Speaker 3>act differently from the rest.</v>

661
00:43:11.341 --> 00:43:13.450
<v Speaker 3>And it can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it by all measure.</v>

662
00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:18.570
<v Speaker 3>All I'll all different means shaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>ostracism and sober so that you can ruin</v>

663
00:43:19.891 --> 00:43:21.660
<v Speaker 3>a life with these things.</v>

664
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.350
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

665
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:29.060
<v Speaker 3>so why do I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom of speech,</v>

666
00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 3>especially in it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's essential for all of us.</v>

667
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.140
<v Speaker 3>We can't function without it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy.</v>

668
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.363
<v Speaker 3>But why is it especially important for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people who were from minorities and </v>

669
00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:43.850
<v Speaker 3>marginalized groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who carry minority opinions?</v>

670
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:45.163
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure many of you carry minority </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions in some areas it's this one </v>

671
00:43:50.601 --> 00:43:55.601
<v Speaker 3>person can't out vote 100 and minority </v>
<v Speaker 3>can never vote a majority,</v>

672
00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:02.380
<v Speaker 3>but one person or a minority with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>superior argument can publish,</v>

673
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.790
<v Speaker 3>write and speak to a hundred or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand or 10,000 or a million people.</v>

674
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.983
<v Speaker 3>And that gives them a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's falling for members of </v>

675
00:44:13.341 --> 00:44:15.470
<v Speaker 3>smaller groups to undermine freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>

676
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.580
<v Speaker 3>Absolute folly.</v>

677
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.013
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

678
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Now what about the psychology of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who's doing the undermining here?</v>

679
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:25.514
<v Speaker 3>Mill says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduces a theme to deny others for </v>

680
00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:33.700
<v Speaker 3>speech is to presume oneself fallible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A person,</v>

681
00:44:36.831 --> 00:44:37.664
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm denying you speech because you make </v>

682
00:44:38.961 --> 00:44:39.794
<v Speaker 3>me feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what you do will lead to </v>

683
00:44:41.691 --> 00:44:42.524
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're presuming it will lead to </v>

684
00:44:45.261 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to show it or prove it.</v>

685
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:50.183
<v Speaker 3>So here's what mel says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the opinion which is attempted to </v>

686
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 3>suppress by authority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they possibly be true.</v>

687
00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.030
<v Speaker 3>Those who desire to suppress it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course deny its truth,</v>

688
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:01.463
<v Speaker 3>but they are not infallible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have no authority to decide the </v>

689
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:05.004
<v Speaker 3>question for all mankind and exclude </v>
<v Speaker 3>every other person from the means of </v>

690
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:10.044
<v Speaker 3>judging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I submit to you that is a very </v>

691
00:45:11.821 --> 00:45:15.810
<v Speaker 3>democratic sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's respectful of other people.</v>

692
00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:18.220
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

693
00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:22.660
<v Speaker 3>He goes on about those who silence </v>
<v Speaker 3>others to refuse a hearing to an opinion</v>

694
00:45:22.661 --> 00:45:25.150
<v Speaker 3>because they are sure that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is false,</v>

695
00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:30.360
<v Speaker 3>is to assume that their certainty is </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely is the same thing as absolute</v>

696
00:45:31.001 --> 00:45:31.834
<v Speaker 3>certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All silencing of discussion is an </v>

697
00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:35.710
<v Speaker 3>assumption of infallibility.</v>

698
00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:38.500
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

699
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.333
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it so interesting that as the </v>

700
00:45:42.821 --> 00:45:47.821
<v Speaker 3>forced speech debate has developed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the public domain,</v>

701
00:45:48.311 --> 00:45:52.420
<v Speaker 3>there have been so few lawyers speaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>up for free speech.</v>

702
00:45:52.421 --> 00:45:56.230
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that 25 years ago it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would not have been the case.</v>

703
00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:01.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also interesting that you know,</v>

704
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.863
<v Speaker 3>our finest text,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our most comprehensive text I would say </v>

705
00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:06.813
<v Speaker 3>on liberty is written not by a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who loves order and seeks rules </v>

706
00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.890
<v Speaker 3>for ordering things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by a philosopher,</v>

707
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:16.623
<v Speaker 3>a man who knows that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is often hard to know things for </v>

708
00:46:18.971 --> 00:46:21.130
<v Speaker 3>certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who likes socrates,</v>

709
00:46:21.131 --> 00:46:21.964
<v Speaker 3>who influenced this book sometimes sees </v>
<v Speaker 3>that his greatest asset is knowing that </v>

710
00:46:26.111 --> 00:46:26.944
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the wisdom of acknowledging our </v>

711
00:46:30.251 --> 00:46:31.084
<v Speaker 3>ignorance when we have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In such wisdom has the effect of </v>

712
00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:34.624
<v Speaker 3>moderating us by creating intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 3>humility which can actually help people </v>

713
00:46:39.581 --> 00:46:40.414
<v Speaker 3>get along</v>

714
00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:42.890
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

715
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is really,</v>

716
00:46:44.421 --> 00:46:45.254
<v Speaker 3>really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know your side if you don't </v>

717
00:46:48.651 --> 00:46:51.590
<v Speaker 3>know their side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quote mill,</v>

718
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:55.910
<v Speaker 3>he who knows only his own side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>case knows little of that.</v>

719
00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.230
<v Speaker 3>His reasons may be good and no one may </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been able to refute them,</v>

720
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:04.160
<v Speaker 3>but if he has equally unable to refute </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reasons on the opposite side,</v>

721
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:07.340
<v Speaker 3>if he does not so much as know what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

722
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.250
<v Speaker 3>he has no grounds for preferring either </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>

723
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.360
<v Speaker 3>Tell that to your favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No at all.</v>

724
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:19.410
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

725
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:20.243
<v Speaker 3>This may be one of the two or three most</v>
<v Speaker 3>important points I'm going to make </v>

726
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.393
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If government wants to take away the </v>

727
00:47:28.201 --> 00:47:29.034
<v Speaker 3>speech of someone you dislike or force </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to say things and you agree with </v>

728
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:33.724
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worse to go along when you agree </v>

729
00:47:37.391 --> 00:47:38.224
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

730
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

731
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:40.800
<v Speaker 3>Mill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let us suppose.</v>

732
00:47:40.801 --> 00:47:41.634
<v Speaker 3>Therefore that the government is </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely at one with the people and </v>

733
00:47:44.731 --> 00:47:45.564
<v Speaker 3>never thinks of exerting any power of </v>
<v Speaker 3>coercion unless in agreement with what </v>

734
00:47:49.621 --> 00:47:50.454
<v Speaker 3>it conceives to be their voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I deny the right of the people to </v>

735
00:47:54.781 --> 00:47:59.220
<v Speaker 3>exercise such coersion either by </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves or by their government.</v>

736
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:02.190
<v Speaker 3>The power itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it legitimate?</v>

737
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.810
<v Speaker 3>The best government has no more title to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it than the worst.</v>

738
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:08.503
<v Speaker 3>It is as noxious or more noxious when </v>
<v Speaker 3>exerted in accordance with public </v>

739
00:48:12.541 --> 00:48:15.630
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then when in opposition to it,</v>

740
00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:21.390
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's more noxious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is why you shouldn't agree to be</v>

741
00:48:21.391 --> 00:48:22.224
<v Speaker 3>forced to do what you believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's even more noxious to give </v>

742
00:48:25.561 --> 00:48:26.394
<v Speaker 3>government power when it's doing so as </v>
<v Speaker 3>an accord with public opinion or yours </v>

743
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:30.893
<v Speaker 3>because the coercion is sweetened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that way can develop without </v>

744
00:48:35.551 --> 00:48:36.384
<v Speaker 3>opposition in this short sided way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we and feeble our chief protection </v>

745
00:48:40.531 --> 00:48:41.760
<v Speaker 3>against tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he liberty.</v>

746
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:48.470
<v Speaker 3>Now I want to switch to a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground and I'm going to talk about um,</v>

747
00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.200
<v Speaker 3>three different approaches to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>infallible mind,</v>

748
00:48:52.201 --> 00:48:55.950
<v Speaker 3>the divided brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a bit of a neuroscientific,</v>

749
00:48:55.951 --> 00:48:56.784
<v Speaker 3>take some things on psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>development and then something called </v>

750
00:49:00.331 --> 00:49:01.164
<v Speaker 3>the inability to mentalize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a series of clinical </v>

751
00:49:03.121 --> 00:49:03.954
<v Speaker 3>observations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is our brain and it's divided </v>

752
00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.490
<v Speaker 3>and it's divided for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people know it's divided,</v>

753
00:49:11.491 --> 00:49:14.970
<v Speaker 3>but don't think about the reason our </v>
<v Speaker 3>spleen doesn't seem to be divided,</v>

754
00:49:14.971 --> 00:49:17.760
<v Speaker 3>not every organ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our stomach is not divided in this way.</v>

755
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.290
<v Speaker 3>Not Every Oregon appears to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>symmetrical and divided</v>

756
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:25.413
<v Speaker 3>and the divided brain isn't about </v>
<v Speaker 3>language being on one side and </v>

757
00:49:28.211 --> 00:49:29.044
<v Speaker 3>creativity on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a simplification that came out </v>

758
00:49:31.511 --> 00:49:36.511
<v Speaker 3>of the 60s there's little bits of truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>

759
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.570
<v Speaker 3>but it's far too simplified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are actually some very,</v>

760
00:49:40.571 --> 00:49:43.180
<v Speaker 3>very significant differences between the</v>
<v Speaker 3>two sides of the brain.</v>

761
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:48.310
<v Speaker 3>And the person who put this together is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor Ian mcgilchrist.</v>

762
00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 3>He's a psychiatrist and he's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>outstanding intellect.</v>

763
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:54.760
<v Speaker 3>If he was a great student of literature </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>

764
00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:58.780
<v Speaker 3>and this is his book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the master and his emissary.</v>

765
00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:01.643
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

766
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Now if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is looking at the brain from below,</v>

767
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.320
<v Speaker 3>so you don't usually do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>

768
00:50:09.321 --> 00:50:14.321
<v Speaker 3>But if you were underneath the brain and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you looked at it very carefully,</v>

769
00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.633
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would find that it's broader at the </v>

770
00:50:18.201 --> 00:50:21.590
<v Speaker 3>right on the front and brought her on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the back of the left.</v>

771
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.753
<v Speaker 3>So you know it's only very grossly that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like the two hemispheres are </v>

772
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:31.220
<v Speaker 3>and inside the connections are also </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite different.</v>

773
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:32.083
<v Speaker 3>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the length of the connections between </v>

774
00:50:34.311 --> 00:50:35.144
<v Speaker 3>cells in the right hemisphere is much </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer and it goes deep into the </v>

775
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:42.320
<v Speaker 3>emotional parts of the brain and reads a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of what's going on in the body.</v>

776
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:44.180
<v Speaker 3>And the left brain connections are </v>
<v Speaker 3>short.</v>

777
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:45.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're all talking to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

778
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.670
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways to get at</v>

779
00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.113
<v Speaker 3>the very broad difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left hemisphere and the right sometimes </v>

780
00:50:56.261 --> 00:50:57.094
<v Speaker 3>called the left brain and the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine a bird pecking for seeds among </v>

781
00:51:00.221 --> 00:51:04.600
<v Speaker 3>these stones and grit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to eat,</v>

782
00:51:04.601 --> 00:51:05.434
<v Speaker 3>it's got to focus very narrowly on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>little seed and pick it out against the </v>

783
00:51:09.131 --> 00:51:14.131
<v Speaker 3>background grid narrow focus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also has to keep a wide focus and</v>

784
00:51:14.321 --> 00:51:15.154
<v Speaker 3>keep on the lookout for new dangerous or</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities that might come on the </v>

785
00:51:17.831 --> 00:51:20.410
<v Speaker 3>scene like predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>potential mates,</v>

786
00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.860
<v Speaker 3>or other food sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is more like reality.</v>

787
00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.630
<v Speaker 3>One of those birds is pecking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also aware that there's another</v>

788
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.230
<v Speaker 3>comrade bird nearby.</v>

789
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:34.850
<v Speaker 3>How does it do that?</v>

790
00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:39.383
<v Speaker 3>The narrow focus and the wide focus are </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually handled by different </v>

791
00:51:42.211 --> 00:51:43.044
<v Speaker 3>hemispheres of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is something very neat about a </v>

792
00:51:45.691 --> 00:51:46.524
<v Speaker 3>bird's brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wired so that let's say the right </v>

793
00:51:48.181 --> 00:51:52.290
<v Speaker 3>eye is completely processed by the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere.</v>

794
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.453
<v Speaker 3>So human beings aren't quite like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything that comes in the window </v>

795
00:51:56.101 --> 00:51:58.530
<v Speaker 3>or the right eye is processed in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left hemisphere.</v>

796
00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:03.900
<v Speaker 3>So the left hemisphere does all of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrow focus work to identify the little</v>

797
00:52:03.901 --> 00:52:05.520
<v Speaker 3>bits of seed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to trust me,</v>

798
00:52:05.521 --> 00:52:07.500
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be relevant to </v>
<v Speaker 3>political correctness.</v>

799
00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:13.650
<v Speaker 3>It focuses on something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It already knows this I've important.</v>

800
00:52:13.651 --> 00:52:15.540
<v Speaker 3>So this is a big thing about the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere.</v>

801
00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.630
<v Speaker 3>It focuses on what it already knows is </v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

802
00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Seeds</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the right hemisphere.</v>

803
00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:27.920
<v Speaker 3>It takes the world in as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's window to the world is the birds</v>

804
00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:29.244
<v Speaker 3>left eye.</v>

805
00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.620
<v Speaker 3>So it's vigilantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vigilantly searching for novelty,</v>

806
00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:38.760
<v Speaker 3>what's not already know a Predator her </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps a new me.</v>

807
00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:41.940
<v Speaker 3>It's looking for something new that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be of importance,</v>

808
00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.600
<v Speaker 3>but who knows what that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the right hemispheres,</v>

809
00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:46.733
<v Speaker 3>attention is open minded and broadminded</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't quite know what it's </v>

810
00:52:51.271 --> 00:52:52.104
<v Speaker 3>looking for and these things are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on at the same time through different </v>

811
00:52:55.981 --> 00:53:00.660
<v Speaker 3>eyes and different hemispheres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just switching back and forth.</v>

812
00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a bird.</v>

813
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:07.140
<v Speaker 3>What about humans?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our eyes are wired slightly differently,</v>

814
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.430
<v Speaker 3>but the right hemisphere in humans is </v>
<v Speaker 3>astoundingly similar.</v>

815
00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:12.323
<v Speaker 3>It sees holistically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So before things are digested into </v>

816
00:53:14.821 --> 00:53:16.440
<v Speaker 3>parts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes in the whole,</v>

817
00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:19.620
<v Speaker 3>it seeks novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seeks out the unknown,</v>

818
00:53:19.621 --> 00:53:22.560
<v Speaker 3>a new information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because it's holistic,</v>

819
00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:27.570
<v Speaker 3>it sees everything in context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a sustained broad,</v>

820
00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:30.690
<v Speaker 3>open alertness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sees relationships.</v>

821
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.560
<v Speaker 3>That's about context and very important </v>
<v Speaker 3>for our discussion today.</v>

822
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:38.340
<v Speaker 3>It sees individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sees if you,</v>

823
00:53:38.341 --> 00:53:42.870
<v Speaker 3>if you discover a human being and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see them as a unique individual in their</v>

824
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:44.730
<v Speaker 3>wholeness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in their parts,</v>

825
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:48.330
<v Speaker 3>but how they all come together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a right brain function.</v>

826
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.123
<v Speaker 3>It is not abstract at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you meet someone else who have you </v>

827
00:53:53.101 --> 00:53:56.250
<v Speaker 3>never met for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a unique experience.</v>

828
00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 3>You're not generalizing from it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the seat of empathy.</v>

829
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:02.933
<v Speaker 3>It's where we learn to read facial </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressions and the emotions of others </v>

830
00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:09.060
<v Speaker 3>and our own emotions and because it sees</v>
<v Speaker 3>context,</v>

831
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 3>it sees humor lighten up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It understands metaphor.</v>

832
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.490
<v Speaker 3>It perceives emotional subtlety and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuance</v>

833
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.060
<v Speaker 3>and the left hemisphere in humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrow,</v>

834
00:54:22.061 --> 00:54:22.894
<v Speaker 3>sharply focused attention to detail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is actually tasked by the right </v>

835
00:54:27.041 --> 00:54:27.874
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere when something new and </v>
<v Speaker 3>important is perceived to begin to map </v>

836
00:54:32.111 --> 00:54:32.944
<v Speaker 3>it in fine detail and then it's maps </v>
<v Speaker 3>produced isolated parts more than </v>

837
00:54:39.221 --> 00:54:40.054
<v Speaker 3>relationships or context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of that book drawing on the right </v>

838
00:54:42.731 --> 00:54:43.564
<v Speaker 3>side of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've ever taken that course and </v>

839
00:54:44.891 --> 00:54:46.270
<v Speaker 3>you'll understand what I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

840
00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:50.800
<v Speaker 3>It identifies things by abstract labels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not context,</v>

841
00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.620
<v Speaker 3>and it works with categories of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>categories,</v>

842
00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:58.810
<v Speaker 3>not individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whenever people are over generalizing</v>

843
00:54:58.811 --> 00:54:59.710
<v Speaker 3>about people,</v>

844
00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:02.123
<v Speaker 3>it has a left hemisphere flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Language is interpreted differently on </v>

845
00:55:05.911 --> 00:55:06.744
<v Speaker 3>the left and the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interpreted literally it's </v>

846
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:11.100
<v Speaker 3>humorless because there's no sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>

847
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:14.490
<v Speaker 3>It's abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It rest things from their context.</v>

848
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abstract is from the Latin draw away,</v>

849
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:20.160
<v Speaker 3>so what do I need?</v>

850
00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:22.533
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

851
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:23.583
<v Speaker 3>how did the things that the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere does when it makes this map </v>

852
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:31.200
<v Speaker 3>of the world is it confuses the map with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

853
00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:32.363
<v Speaker 3>We've all heard this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't confuse the map with the </v>

854
00:55:33.451 --> 00:55:34.284
<v Speaker 3>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good left hemisphere </v>

855
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:38.700
<v Speaker 3>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

856
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:41.063
<v Speaker 3>where is all of this data coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's coming from hundreds and hundreds </v>

857
00:55:44.171 --> 00:55:47.140
<v Speaker 3>of studies of patients with strokes who </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose Maine,</v>

858
00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.870
<v Speaker 3>right hemisphere function or left </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere is function.</v>

859
00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.013
<v Speaker 3>Or we can use certain kinds of magnetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>devices and apply it to the brain and </v>

860
00:55:54.521 --> 00:55:55.354
<v Speaker 3>shut down parts of the brain and see </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the remaining hemisphere is like </v>

861
00:55:58.301 --> 00:55:59.134
<v Speaker 3>and then give them all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive tests and we can actually </v>

862
00:56:01.571 --> 00:56:02.404
<v Speaker 3>inject anesthetic into certain arteries </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shut down a whole hemisphere of the </v>

863
00:56:05.471 --> 00:56:06.760
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's many,</v>

864
00:56:06.761 --> 00:56:11.140
<v Speaker 3>many ways that really thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of scientists have have gotten</v>

865
00:56:11.141 --> 00:56:14.650
<v Speaker 3>at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the map is felt,</v>

866
00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:17.320
<v Speaker 3>so when people have certain kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>left hemispheric strokes,</v>

867
00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:18.543
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they have certain kinds of right </v>

868
00:56:19.601 --> 00:56:22.420
<v Speaker 3>hemispheric strokes and they're left </v>
<v Speaker 3>just with the left hemisphere,</v>

869
00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:25.210
<v Speaker 3>we can see how concrete people are about</v>
<v Speaker 3>maps.</v>

870
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:26.793
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is with good map is as good </v>

871
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:32.320
<v Speaker 3>as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the world is always changing and maps</v>

872
00:56:32.321 --> 00:56:36.010
<v Speaker 3>become quickly out of date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few that may not come out of,</v>

873
00:56:36.011 --> 00:56:37.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go out of date quickly.</v>

874
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Like gravity seems to be what it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>always been.</v>

875
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:45.450
<v Speaker 3>But the left hemisphere is kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that person who when lost in,</v>

876
00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:47.963
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a,</v>

877
00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:52.810
<v Speaker 3>on a car ride says to his spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't be lost.</v>

878
00:56:52.811 --> 00:56:53.644
<v Speaker 3>It's right here on the map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in the right place and he says it </v>

879
00:56:56.711 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 3>over and over again even though they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

880
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.090
<v Speaker 3>So it's got to kind of know it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

881
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:03.670
<v Speaker 3>a flavor of infallibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>

882
00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:06.953
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you an example of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a literal versus non literal </v>

883
00:57:10.891 --> 00:57:11.724
<v Speaker 3>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine I was visiting your home and I </v>

884
00:57:14.371 --> 00:57:16.380
<v Speaker 3>started to breakout in a sweat and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

885
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be 90 degrees in here.</v>

886
00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:22.350
<v Speaker 3>Now a literal interpretation would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>norman has made a statement,</v>

887
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:23.203
<v Speaker 3>a meteor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a logical statement about the </v>

888
00:57:24.001 --> 00:57:24.834
<v Speaker 3>temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A non literal interpretation would be </v>

889
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:29.310
<v Speaker 3>normally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you like me to open the window?</v>

890
00:57:29.311 --> 00:57:30.144
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>
<v Speaker 3>that statement takes into account the </v>

891
00:57:33.431 --> 00:57:38.431
<v Speaker 3>context of my statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's relationship to me,</v>

892
00:57:38.811 --> 00:57:41.840
<v Speaker 3>the speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to the overall environment.</v>

893
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:46.550
<v Speaker 3>It requires indirect interpretation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>empathy.</v>

894
00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:50.630
<v Speaker 3>And these are right hemispheric </v>
<v Speaker 3>attributes.</v>

895
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:53.480
<v Speaker 3>So here they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference on the left,</v>

896
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:54.950
<v Speaker 3>isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no contacts,</v>

897
00:57:54.951 --> 00:57:56.750
<v Speaker 3>no relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sees categories,</v>

898
00:57:56.751 --> 00:57:59.960
<v Speaker 3>abstraction generalization tends to </v>
<v Speaker 3>infallibility.</v>

899
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:01.003
<v Speaker 3>Rigid maps are the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would suggest to you when there's </v>

900
00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:06.013
<v Speaker 3>bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's coming out of this kind of move </v>

901
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:11.650
<v Speaker 3>plus many other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it theology,</v>

902
00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.620
<v Speaker 3>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera.</v>

903
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:15.770
<v Speaker 3>But from a cognitive point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is</v>

904
00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:21.280
<v Speaker 3>part of it and the right is holistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sees individuals at once.</v>

905
00:58:21.281 --> 00:58:22.270
<v Speaker 3>New Information.</v>

906
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.413
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to link some of that up </v>

907
00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:28.563
<v Speaker 3>loosely with some things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>developmental psychology that are </v>

908
00:58:31.391 --> 00:58:33.820
<v Speaker 3>relevant for political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tie it together.</v>

909
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:38.270
<v Speaker 3>This is John Paij.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

910
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.273
<v Speaker 3>probably the greatest developmental </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologist who ever lived and one of </v>

911
00:58:43.451 --> 00:58:45.300
<v Speaker 3>the things he tried to do is describe </v>
<v Speaker 3>norm,</v>

912
00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:48.880
<v Speaker 3>normal cognitive development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he got a lot of it right.</v>

913
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:52.330
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it holds up very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even cross culturally,</v>

914
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:53.703
<v Speaker 3>there are some things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm into the plastic brain as you </v>

915
00:58:56.351 --> 00:58:57.184
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can happen slightly differently in </v>

916
00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 3>other places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he made very,</v>

917
00:59:01.631 --> 00:59:06.631
<v Speaker 3>very broad observations after years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of very fine detailed work.</v>

918
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:08.223
<v Speaker 3>So here's some things he found out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an early cognitive stage from </v>

919
00:59:11.411 --> 00:59:15.160
<v Speaker 3>two to seven where children don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the logic and they have a lot</v>

920
00:59:15.161 --> 00:59:18.370
<v Speaker 3>of magical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a limited sense that they have</v>

921
00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:20.770
<v Speaker 3>a mind that is perceiving the world from</v>
<v Speaker 3>their tick,</v>

922
00:59:20.771 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 3>from particular point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

923
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:25.490
<v Speaker 3>some of them probably don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of that.</v>

924
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.673
<v Speaker 3>And I'll go into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's this thing called </v>

925
00:59:29.961 --> 00:59:30.794
<v Speaker 3>centrism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can only focus on one aspect of a </v>

926
00:59:32.301 --> 00:59:33.350
<v Speaker 3>situation at a time.</v>

927
00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

928
00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:39.360
<v Speaker 3>And this is related to egocentrism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a kind of,</v>

929
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:43.200
<v Speaker 3>where do I fit in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

930
00:59:44.370 --> 00:59:45.203
<v Speaker 3>sort of concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just about selfishness during </v>

931
00:59:48.991 --> 00:59:49.824
<v Speaker 3>this stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their communication and thoughts are </v>

932
00:59:51.121 --> 00:59:51.954
<v Speaker 3>generally about themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat limited ability to see </v>

933
00:59:55.741 --> 00:59:56.574
<v Speaker 3>situations from another's point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tend to assume that others see the </v>

934
01:00:00.121 --> 01:00:00.954
<v Speaker 3>world is they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some people can remain egocentric </v>

935
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:06.570
<v Speaker 3>all their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

936
01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:07.583
<v Speaker 3>and many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not all of us can under great </v>

937
01:00:09.421 --> 01:00:10.254
<v Speaker 3>emotional pressure or physical illness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regress and show signs of egocentrism </v>

938
01:00:14.341 --> 01:00:17.130
<v Speaker 3>that we normally don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

939
01:00:17.131 --> 01:00:19.320
<v Speaker 3>why are children egocentric?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

940
01:00:19.321 --> 01:00:20.154
<v Speaker 3>there's a number of reasons for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one very simple reason that's hard </v>

941
01:00:23.461 --> 01:00:26.160
<v Speaker 3>to get out of your head once you get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your head is this,</v>

942
01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:27.593
<v Speaker 3>children at this age are quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitively focused on the external </v>

943
01:00:30.991 --> 01:00:31.824
<v Speaker 3>physical world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which can be observed and what they can </v>

944
01:00:35.281 --> 01:00:36.114
<v Speaker 3>observe of the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But our internal mental states are not </v>

945
01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:41.094
<v Speaker 3>directly observable period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the young child really has a concept </v>

946
01:00:45.181 --> 01:00:46.014
<v Speaker 3>of mental states or the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This means there's a kind of mind </v>

947
01:00:50.071 --> 01:00:52.860
<v Speaker 3>blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>limited awareness that other people have</v>

948
01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:53.694
<v Speaker 3>minds and more importantly there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>limited awareness that they themselves </v>

949
01:00:56.911 --> 01:01:01.500
<v Speaker 3>have an invisible mine that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpreting reality and each of you try</v>

950
01:01:01.501 --> 01:01:03.900
<v Speaker 3>to remember that moment in your life</v>

951
01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:07.810
<v Speaker 3>if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you realized,</v>

952
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:13.310
<v Speaker 3>actually this is me processing all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

953
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:19.570
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was in nursery school and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was looking at what if no,</v>

954
01:01:19.911 --> 01:01:22.880
<v Speaker 3>no divinity spoke to me at the time that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware of.</v>

955
01:01:22.881 --> 01:01:27.881
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at some sticks and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just right and I realized I'm looking at</v>

956
01:01:30.081 --> 01:01:34.250
<v Speaker 3>those sticks and other people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing those sticks and some or other.</v>

957
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:35.203
<v Speaker 3>It's self consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>self awareness and the awareness that I </v>

958
01:01:41.181 --> 01:01:42.014
<v Speaker 3>had in mind and that therefore other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people had mines crystallized at that </v>

959
01:01:45.441 --> 01:01:48.680
<v Speaker 3>moment for me and each of you probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>had that experience.</v>

960
01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Did they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do any of you remember that?</v>

961
01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.453
<v Speaker 3>Now what happens if you're not aware </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have a mind that's processing </v>

962
01:02:01.921 --> 01:02:02.754
<v Speaker 3>everything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your subjective experience of events </v>

963
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:05.873
<v Speaker 3>seems like the only reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are not aware that your experience </v>

964
01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:12.780
<v Speaker 3>is just your take on events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it might be a misinterpretation,</v>

965
01:02:12.781 --> 01:02:15.180
<v Speaker 3>a false belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a product of your experience.</v>

966
01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.300
<v Speaker 3>Interpretations are often centered on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the self.</v>

967
01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.940
<v Speaker 3>Think the child whose parents are </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting divorced,</v>

968
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:23.610
<v Speaker 3>who thinks it's my fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be my fault.</v>

969
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.200
<v Speaker 3>That's egocentrism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we gradually grow out of it.</v>

970
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:33.230
<v Speaker 3>The next stage from seven to 11 shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of new brain maturation.</v>

971
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.420
<v Speaker 3>The child begins to use inductive logic </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes,</v>

972
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:40.770
<v Speaker 3>becomes aware of the existence of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>minds.</v>

973
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:45.780
<v Speaker 3>And this can often happen when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that you can fool people,</v>

974
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:50.310
<v Speaker 3>that people can have false beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so piaget did experiments on this,</v>

975
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:54.510
<v Speaker 3>but for there to be a false belief means</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's gotta be an internal mental</v>

976
01:02:54.511 --> 01:02:59.511
<v Speaker 3>process in the person who has the false </v>
<v Speaker 3>belief that can be misled or mistaken is</v>

977
01:03:00.181 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 3>somehow different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is processing events.</v>

978
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 3>And then development proceeds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstract reasoning kicks in.</v>

979
01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Children can think logically and </v>
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

980
01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:15.240
<v Speaker 3>They don't take everything literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and children always love stories,</v>

981
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.790
<v Speaker 3>but at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this point in time,</v>

982
01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:18.624
<v Speaker 3>they can begin to analyze the literature</v>
<v Speaker 3>and get much more deeply into the minds </v>

983
01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:23.610
<v Speaker 3>of the characters</v>

984
01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:28.183
<v Speaker 3>so they're mentally rising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ability to appreciate the one has a </v>

985
01:03:30.531 --> 01:03:34.010
<v Speaker 3>mind that interprets reality and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people have such a mind</v>

986
01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.760
<v Speaker 3>when you mentally as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even know you're doing it.</v>

987
01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.980
<v Speaker 3>It's automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unconscious.</v>

988
01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:47.800
<v Speaker 3>We realize too that we make inferences </v>
<v Speaker 3>about reality all the time and are prone</v>

989
01:03:47.801 --> 01:03:48.634
<v Speaker 3>to error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We realize that the mental states of </v>

990
01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:51.964
<v Speaker 3>other people change rapidly and the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensible way to know what their feeling </v>

991
01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:59.350
<v Speaker 3>is to inquire or to take a curious </v>
<v Speaker 3>stance.</v>

992
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:02.680
<v Speaker 3>If Socrates was the smartest man in </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient Greece,</v>

993
01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:03.723
<v Speaker 3>why did he spend all of his time talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to other people were who were his </v>

994
01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.480
<v Speaker 3>arguably has inferiors much of the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because there's something moe toric</v>

995
01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:17.890
<v Speaker 3>about thinking and learning and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>why dialogue is a very important thing.</v>

996
01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.230
<v Speaker 3>So you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

997
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.780
<v Speaker 3>I'd be pretty good in a totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>regime.</v>

998
01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm very independently minded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just keep my mouth shut.</v>

999
01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.980
<v Speaker 3>And if there was no freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never expressed myself.</v>

1000
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:34.270
<v Speaker 3>And that might work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also you might get very,</v>

1001
01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:35.104
<v Speaker 3>very sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might get sick because it might be </v>

1002
01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.413
<v Speaker 3>that if thinking is so important to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>than expressing it and interacting with </v>

1003
01:04:44.861 --> 01:04:48.040
<v Speaker 3>people about it might just be the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you need.</v>

1004
01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:49.180
<v Speaker 3>The way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1005
01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.900
<v Speaker 3>some of us need to breathe air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1006
01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.780
<v Speaker 3>when we mentally as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can focus on others.</v>

1007
01:04:59.100 --> 01:04:59.933
<v Speaker 3>We can form stable relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all the opposite of the </v>

1008
01:05:04.351 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 3>infallible frame of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1009
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk about the absence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentalization in adults,</v>

1010
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:13.103
<v Speaker 3>not in kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are many situations where we lose </v>

1011
01:05:16.591 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 3>awareness that we have a mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpreting reality.</v>

1012
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.310
<v Speaker 3>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high states of stress and emotion.</v>

1013
01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:26.440
<v Speaker 3>And some people never develop the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to mentalize in the first place.</v>

1014
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:31.900
<v Speaker 3>And some have mental illnesses that make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hard to mentalize,</v>

1015
01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:35.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to think or imagine if you're trapped</v>

1016
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.580
<v Speaker 3>in a very intense delusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1017
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:42.610
<v Speaker 3>you are probably not mental ising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1018
01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.270
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we've learned about </v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

1019
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:47.133
<v Speaker 3>we've learned a lot about mentalizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's absence by studying the autistic </v>

1020
01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:55.090
<v Speaker 3>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for a number of autistic children,</v>

1021
01:05:55.091 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult.</v>

1022
01:05:56.621 --> 01:06:00.970
<v Speaker 3>It could be very high on the spectrum </v>
<v Speaker 3>and have difficulty reading,</v>

1023
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:04.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions and mentalizing other minds.</v>

1024
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:05.283
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the term mind blindness came out of the </v>

1025
01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:08.344
<v Speaker 3>literature on autism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And children with autism are teased </v>

1026
01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:13.570
<v Speaker 3>mercilessly as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

1027
01:06:13.571 --> 01:06:14.404
<v Speaker 3>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And imagine what it's like for them not </v>

1028
01:06:17.711 --> 01:06:20.800
<v Speaker 3>being able to understand other minds </v>
<v Speaker 3>when kids are teasing them,</v>

1029
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:21.634
<v Speaker 3>when they miss things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they will also misinterpret </v>

1030
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:26.950
<v Speaker 3>teasing or things that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were very gentle remarks.</v>

1031
01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Not to meant to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1032
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.180
<v Speaker 3>to tease the child if you can't mentally</v>
<v Speaker 3>wise.</v>

1033
01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:32.460
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1034
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:35.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another thing that happens,</v>

1035
01:06:35.771 --> 01:06:40.210
<v Speaker 3>which where people arguably can </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentalize but they don't.</v>

1036
01:06:40.211 --> 01:06:43.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's in extreme forms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>narcissism.</v>

1037
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:46.890
<v Speaker 3>So what the narcissist pers does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just imagine,</v>

1038
01:06:46.891 --> 01:06:49.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine I'm a big narcissist.</v>

1039
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I do is,</v>

1040
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.790
<v Speaker 3>and I'm dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you,</v>

1041
01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.393
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take all of my negative qualities and </v>

1042
01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.860
<v Speaker 3>I attribute to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them,</v>

1043
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.800
<v Speaker 3>to you rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep all my,</v>

1044
01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:04.750
<v Speaker 3>my good qualities.</v>

1045
01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 3>So now I'm very pure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't stop there.</v>

1046
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:13.801
<v Speaker 3>Then I plagiarize all your special </v>
<v Speaker 3>qualities and ti think their mine.</v>

1047
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.470
<v Speaker 3>So if you're in a meeting with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>narcissist,</v>

1048
01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.080
<v Speaker 3>you come up with a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

1049
01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:20.914
<v Speaker 3>what a great meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I came up with that </v>

1050
01:07:22.721 --> 01:07:23.630
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1051
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:24.963
<v Speaker 3>So imagine you're in a knowledge culture</v>
<v Speaker 3>or in a situation where knowledge is </v>

1052
01:07:29.471 --> 01:07:34.471
<v Speaker 3>important or an ethnic group or </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge is important and you can get a</v>

1053
01:07:34.961 --> 01:07:37.030
<v Speaker 3>lot of narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what all of them going on,</v>

1054
01:07:37.031 --> 01:07:38.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1055
01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.313
<v Speaker 3>people who never formed close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>secure attachments with others to help </v>

1056
01:07:44.681 --> 01:07:49.030
<v Speaker 3>them read their feelings</v>
<v Speaker 3>will have difficulty.</v>

1057
01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:54.031
<v Speaker 3>Mentalizing and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatric conditions where people have</v>

1058
01:07:55.811 --> 01:07:57.700
<v Speaker 3>grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without that input,</v>

1059
01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.133
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing malign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The parents may have had difficulty </v>

1060
01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:02.464
<v Speaker 3>reading emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the child has difficulty </v>

1061
01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:06.580
<v Speaker 3>reading emotions and difficulty </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentalizing.</v>

1062
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:12.760
<v Speaker 3>But you can see there's just many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different causes of metalizing and</v>

1063
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:16.270
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1064
01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:17.103
<v Speaker 3>so I've said that in autism there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>often a lot of right hemisphere damage </v>

1065
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.780
<v Speaker 3>that helps to explain some of the mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>ising problems.</v>

1066
01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:25.183
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in very high trauma in Ptsd for </v>

1067
01:08:27.621 --> 01:08:28.454
<v Speaker 3>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we now know that the right hemisphere </v>

1068
01:08:30.201 --> 01:08:34.280
<v Speaker 3>parts of it actually go offline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stopped processing.</v>

1069
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:37.880
<v Speaker 3>And remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the hemisphere that helps you pay</v>

1070
01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:40.490
<v Speaker 3>attention to novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're stuck in a trauma,</v>

1071
01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:43.070
<v Speaker 3>you're reliving it over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in a new situation,</v>

1072
01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:47.900
<v Speaker 3>but you can't even notice the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation and a lot of your feelings and</v>

1073
01:08:47.901 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 3>your cognition is cut down and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even read emotion properly.</v>

1074
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:55.730
<v Speaker 3>We need to be able to read emotion to </v>
<v Speaker 3>read minds.</v>

1075
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 3>When we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental wise,</v>

1076
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:03.500
<v Speaker 3>our mental reality becomes the outer </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

1077
01:09:03.501 --> 01:09:05.390
<v Speaker 3>They're equivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're isomorphic.</v>

1078
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.793
<v Speaker 3>Our internal world has all the power of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the external world and all our thoughts </v>

1079
01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:13.370
<v Speaker 3>feel real and as vivid as intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensory experience.</v>

1080
01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.310
<v Speaker 3>We can be terrified by our own mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

1081
01:09:16.311 --> 01:09:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Therefore it's so vivid and we lack the </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal ways of reassuring ourselves such</v>

1082
01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:21.543
<v Speaker 3>as saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just imagining this or it might not </v>

1083
01:09:23.691 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't happen.</v>

1084
01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.940
<v Speaker 3>It's all real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our negative thoughts about ourselves</v>

1085
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.680
<v Speaker 3>and others feel totally unalterable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're set in concrete and remember,</v>

1086
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be mentally ill to </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience this kind of thing.</v>

1087
01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Any of us can slip into my mentalizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>in extreme situations and we become mind</v>

1088
01:09:43.901 --> 01:09:44.734
<v Speaker 3>blind.</v>

1089
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.863
<v Speaker 3>How does that play out though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We become intolerant of alternative </v>

1090
01:09:51.261 --> 01:09:53.780
<v Speaker 3>perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are humorless.</v>

1091
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:55.623
<v Speaker 3>We are predisposed to massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>generalizations and speak in absolute </v>

1092
01:09:58.311 --> 01:10:00.080
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men are always,</v>

1093
01:10:00.081 --> 01:10:00.914
<v Speaker 3>women are always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we understand language literally and </v>

1094
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:08.810
<v Speaker 3>often misunderstand nuance and so we </v>
<v Speaker 3>tend to misinterpret others.</v>

1095
01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:12.230
<v Speaker 3>This is important because we can't read </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1096
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.273
<v Speaker 3>We see them as malevolent and we start </v>
<v Speaker 3>blaming and fault finding and we get </v>

1097
01:10:18.171 --> 01:10:19.004
<v Speaker 3>angry.</v>

1098
01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:25.830
<v Speaker 3>There's rigidity and external focus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you don't have an internal life,</v>

1099
01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:27.293
<v Speaker 3>we're prone to all or nothing thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>our thought processes rigidified we </v>

1100
01:10:30.841 --> 01:10:33.570
<v Speaker 3>stick to the first explanation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>occurs to us.</v>

1101
01:10:33.571 --> 01:10:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about all the arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1102
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:38.610
<v Speaker 3>where someone makes it silly first </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation and then they dig into it.</v>

1103
01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.253
<v Speaker 3>So there's a tendency to rigid quasi and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fallibility and little awareness of how </v>

1104
01:10:43.801 --> 01:10:47.100
<v Speaker 3>our behavior is impacting others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not mentalizing.</v>

1105
01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.093
<v Speaker 3>This is really important now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unable to perceive our internal states </v>

1106
01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:57.540
<v Speaker 3>as internal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We focused on externals for just school,</v>

1107
01:10:57.570 --> 01:10:58.560
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the job,</v>

1108
01:10:58.561 --> 01:11:03.561
<v Speaker 3>the neighbor and what others say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this causes a great problem for us.</v>

1109
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:07.363
<v Speaker 3>We become thin skin because when we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>over focused on externals and what </v>

1110
01:11:10.371 --> 01:11:11.204
<v Speaker 3>others say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're unable to step back and </v>

1111
01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:14.154
<v Speaker 3>reflect our self esteem regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes a prisoner of what others </v>

1112
01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:19.074
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

1113
01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:25.420
<v Speaker 3>When we don't mentalize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we become hyper responsive to the,</v>

1114
01:11:25.421 --> 01:11:26.254
<v Speaker 3>even the most benign criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are trapped in what we perceive as </v>

1115
01:11:30.011 --> 01:11:30.844
<v Speaker 3>their point of view about us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And critical words or disagreement can </v>

1116
01:11:34.031 --> 01:11:36.820
<v Speaker 3>feel like violence because we're so </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive.</v>

1117
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:40.180
<v Speaker 3>And that's why people say you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>validating my existence.</v>

1118
01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:46.650
<v Speaker 3>So to summarize this psychological brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>material for things contribute to moving</v>

1119
01:11:47.021 --> 01:11:47.854
<v Speaker 3>towards a state where we don't learn or </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize our points of other points of </v>

1120
01:11:51.191 --> 01:11:52.024
<v Speaker 3>view and tend to wear the infallible </v>
<v Speaker 3>frame of mind regression to earlier </v>

1121
01:11:54.851 --> 01:11:59.110
<v Speaker 3>states of functioning under pressure or </v>
<v Speaker 3>reliance on left brain categorization,</v>

1122
01:11:59.111 --> 01:12:01.600
<v Speaker 3>generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking things out of context,</v>

1123
01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:05.740
<v Speaker 3>and I can tell you I could teach a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person to become left brained.</v>

1124
01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.193
<v Speaker 3>I can take any number of ideologies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>train them to become left brained and </v>

1125
01:12:13.691 --> 01:12:14.524
<v Speaker 3>turn off their right brain functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we can have mind blindness for a </v>

1126
01:12:17.711 --> 01:12:20.230
<v Speaker 3>variety of causes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a reminder,</v>

1127
01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:25.260
<v Speaker 3>George Elliot showed anger makes us feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>divine justice is on our side,</v>

1128
01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:29.410
<v Speaker 3>so all the wisdom of the gods is with us</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we are angry.</v>

1129
01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:31.053
<v Speaker 3>Now this is the final section of my talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these are ancient insights into </v>

1130
01:12:35.711 --> 01:12:36.910
<v Speaker 3>justice and anger.</v>

1131
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.133
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1132
01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:41.283
<v Speaker 3>As we've said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>political correctness is focused on </v>

1133
01:12:42.461 --> 01:12:45.580
<v Speaker 3>justice and compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ancient philosophers,</v>

1134
01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aristotle,</v>

1135
01:12:46.991 --> 01:12:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Xena,</v>

1136
01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Fon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seneca,</v>

1137
01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.450
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thought a lot about justice,</v>

1138
01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:56.620
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't often speak about </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice in an of itself.</v>

1139
01:12:56.650 --> 01:12:59.140
<v Speaker 3>They saw it as one of four cardinal </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtues.</v>

1140
01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:03.250
<v Speaker 3>And the word for virtue in Greek is </v>
<v Speaker 3>Eritay and that means excellence.</v>

1141
01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:06.910
<v Speaker 3>So it's something you cultivate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an excellent you cultivate.</v>

1142
01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.373
<v Speaker 3>So the and the four cardinal virtues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at how they talked about </v>

1143
01:13:11.351 --> 01:13:12.550
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're often described,</v>

1144
01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:15.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are seen as interdependent.</v>

1145
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:16.623
<v Speaker 3>Cardinal comes from the Latin carto and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it means that on which something turns </v>

1146
01:13:20.351 --> 01:13:24.850
<v Speaker 3>or depends like a hinge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is that a good life for the</v>

1147
01:13:24.851 --> 01:13:25.684
<v Speaker 3>individual and the community depends on </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultivating these virtues and you have </v>

1148
01:13:30.371 --> 01:13:33.280
<v Speaker 3>to do all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they?</v>

1149
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Justice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom,</v>

1150
01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.020
<v Speaker 3>moderation and courage and virtue.</v>

1151
01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:40.353
<v Speaker 3>Definition of a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a way of behaving that's conducive </v>

1152
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:47.140
<v Speaker 3>to happiness over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to be cultivated and they have</v>

1153
01:13:47.141 --> 01:13:47.974
<v Speaker 3>to be practiced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Virtues or way of vices are ways of </v>

1154
01:13:50.651 --> 01:13:54.520
<v Speaker 3>behaving that are conducive to </v>
<v Speaker 3>unhappiness and they're also practiced.</v>

1155
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:56.103
<v Speaker 3>Now know this is an important point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Compassion was not thought to be a </v>

1156
01:14:00.401 --> 01:14:01.234
<v Speaker 3>virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only fairly recently in some </v>

1157
01:14:04.211 --> 01:14:09.211
<v Speaker 3>respects that compassion was thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has become a virtue for the ancients.</v>

1158
01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:13.570
<v Speaker 3>Compassion was a feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something available immediately.</v>

1159
01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Almost anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To a child that's,</v>

1160
01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:21.100
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't something that was cultivated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was part of the raw material of being</v>

1161
01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:22.773
<v Speaker 3>a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware that there are eastern </v>

1162
01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:28.240
<v Speaker 3>practices or compassion meditations </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in the east.</v>

1163
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Compassion was something that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>treated like a virtue,</v>

1164
01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:38.490
<v Speaker 3>so here's justice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justice is a good thing,</v>

1165
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.133
<v Speaker 3>so it's understood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a virtue till would seem the more </v>

1166
01:14:44.321 --> 01:14:45.700
<v Speaker 3>justice we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better,</v>

1167
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:46.563
<v Speaker 3>the more the merrier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this indeed is the assumption of </v>

1168
01:14:49.121 --> 01:14:49.954
<v Speaker 3>most social justice activism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you have too much of a good </v>

1169
01:14:52.691 --> 01:14:53.524
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ancients were interested in balance </v>

1170
01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:00.043
<v Speaker 3>and they saw that the virtues do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand each alone and in fact by </v>

1171
01:15:05.061 --> 01:15:08.570
<v Speaker 3>themselves they can actually in </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes even be problematic.</v>

1172
01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:13.070
<v Speaker 3>They observed that the practice of </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice for instance,</v>

1173
01:15:13.071 --> 01:15:17.390
<v Speaker 3>without wisdom or moderation often led </v>
<v Speaker 3>to terrible consequences.</v>

1174
01:15:17.391 --> 01:15:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Even in there in the democracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a painful truth.</v>

1175
01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:26.510
<v Speaker 3>History's greatest crimes have been con </v>
<v Speaker 3>emitted in the name of justice</v>

1176
01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:29.563
<v Speaker 3>in the name of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Spanish inquisition and name of </v>

1177
01:15:32.541 --> 01:15:33.374
<v Speaker 3>justice taking this man and anabaptists </v>
<v Speaker 3>and burning him alive for Harrison in </v>

1178
01:15:38.841 --> 01:15:42.080
<v Speaker 3>the name of rights are treasured human </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights.</v>

1179
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.840
<v Speaker 3>The name of the rights of man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the French revolutions,</v>

1180
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:48.110
<v Speaker 3>Raine of terror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this isis,</v>

1181
01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:51.290
<v Speaker 3>it's all about justice according to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1182
01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:54.693
<v Speaker 3>So for the Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>justice by itself could spin out of </v>

1183
01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:03.721
<v Speaker 3>control and moderation was needed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a picture of Delphi where</v>

1184
01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:10.030
<v Speaker 3>our ancient writings tell us nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>excess was inscribed.</v>

1185
01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:16.530
<v Speaker 3>So moderation is needed for justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>because justice is so closely related in</v>

1186
01:16:16.811 --> 01:16:21.010
<v Speaker 3>practice to the wish to punish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be harsh,</v>

1187
01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:21.933
<v Speaker 3>it can be vengeful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even those of Us Nice people who </v>

1188
01:16:25.001 --> 01:16:25.834
<v Speaker 3>restrain ourselves from unjust acts </v>
<v Speaker 3>often feel a strong resentment towards </v>

1189
01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:35.230
<v Speaker 3>lawbreakers and wished to get even we </v>
<v Speaker 3>say he got away with it kind of implying</v>

1190
01:16:35.231 --> 01:16:36.064
<v Speaker 3>we would've liked to have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we held back the wish to punish is </v>

1191
01:16:40.391 --> 01:16:41.224
<v Speaker 3>the wish to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Socrates points this out in several </v>

1192
01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:48.391
<v Speaker 3>dialogues very effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So justice must be tempered</v>

1193
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:51.910
<v Speaker 3>and it's tempered by moderation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom.</v>

1194
01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:53.410
<v Speaker 3>And the Bible would argue by mercy</v>

1195
01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:04.220
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1196
01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a side of it.</v>

1197
01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Justice can become suddenly harsh in </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>

1198
01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.013
<v Speaker 3>And Freud pointed out that people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups can readily regress and express </v>

1199
01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.080
<v Speaker 3>terrible hostility.</v>

1200
01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:25.503
<v Speaker 3>One of the things he said in group </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology and the analysis of the ego </v>

1201
01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.193
<v Speaker 3>was in groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People delegate their conscience to </v>

1202
01:17:31.991 --> 01:17:35.710
<v Speaker 3>their chosen leader of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if the leader sanctions,</v>

1203
01:17:35.711 --> 01:17:36.544
<v Speaker 3>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly civilized people can rapidly </v>

1204
01:17:39.671 --> 01:17:40.504
<v Speaker 3>become unbounded by conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can see the extraordinary </v>

1205
01:17:43.421 --> 01:17:44.254
<v Speaker 3>aggression that can be lurking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of antisemitism in the Middle </v>

1206
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Ages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just the sinners who sanctions</v>

1207
01:17:50.251 --> 01:17:53.500
<v Speaker 3>setting Jewish homes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>synagogues and people on fire,</v>

1208
01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:57.040
<v Speaker 3>but the saints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once a sate says kill,</v>

1209
01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.593
<v Speaker 3>there's little stopping the crowd from </v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming cruel because in a way their </v>

1210
01:18:01.931 --> 01:18:03.550
<v Speaker 3>conscience is permitting it.</v>

1211
01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:07.213
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just saw private junk Justice </v>

1212
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Simpson style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Private justice is relevant today.</v>

1213
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:17.833
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of changes I think in the </v>

1214
01:18:19.701 --> 01:18:22.560
<v Speaker 3>various tribunals and legal codes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1215
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:25.130
<v Speaker 3>that we're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1216
01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:29.150
<v Speaker 3>what's you're privileging subjectivity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1217
01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:32.870
<v Speaker 3>private justice can escalate false </v>
<v Speaker 3>claims.</v>

1218
01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.110
<v Speaker 3>One key reason historically for having </v>
<v Speaker 3>public justice,</v>

1219
01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:36.973
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>public justice system was to put an end </v>

1220
01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:39.373
<v Speaker 3>to private feuds and revenge bloodbaths </v>
<v Speaker 3>when people took justice in their own </v>

1221
01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:43.484
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course the original justice was </v>

1222
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.903
<v Speaker 3>people doing justice in their own hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So private fuse of course are driven by </v>

1223
01:18:50.871 --> 01:18:52.400
<v Speaker 3>each party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Subjective sense.</v>

1224
01:18:52.401 --> 01:18:53.234
<v Speaker 3>They're offended and they're non </v>
<v Speaker 3>systematic interpretation of events and </v>

1225
01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:57.164
<v Speaker 3>public justice at its best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Attempts to use more objective </v>

1226
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:02.810
<v Speaker 3>evidentiary criteria then private </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice.</v>

1227
01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:04.393
<v Speaker 3>But the PC justice tribunals by </v>
<v Speaker 3>reintroducing the subjective sense of </v>

1228
01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:08.414
<v Speaker 3>grievance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Professor Peterson is spoken about </v>

1229
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:12.770
<v Speaker 3>as a criterion for human rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>violations.</v>

1230
01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Actually I would argue returns us to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>perils of private justice.</v>

1231
01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:20.510
<v Speaker 3>But now with public approval and public </v>
<v Speaker 3>and procure,</v>

1232
01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:25.360
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is wisdom necessary?</v>

1233
01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't it be nice if those kids who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are shutting everyone down actually went</v>

1234
01:19:30.581 --> 01:19:32.680
<v Speaker 3>to university and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to be wise,</v>

1235
01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:37.380
<v Speaker 3>it would actually help their cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you are not wise,</v>

1236
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:39.670
<v Speaker 3>you really cannot know what is right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1237
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:43.060
<v Speaker 3>And you may think you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an easy thing to tell all the time.</v>

1238
01:19:43.330 --> 01:19:45.980
<v Speaker 3>But there's so many disputes about </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice through the world.</v>

1239
01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:48.940
<v Speaker 3>They clearly people are having trouble </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorting that out.</v>

1240
01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:52.630
<v Speaker 3>And in Plato's Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also called on the just,</v>

1241
01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:54.480
<v Speaker 3>he begins it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1242
01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:57.040
<v Speaker 3>with socrates asking people to define </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice.</v>

1243
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:58.240
<v Speaker 3>People are demanding it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>

1244
01:19:58.241 --> 01:19:59.470
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me what you want.</v>

1245
01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:03.160
<v Speaker 3>And none of them can define it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all fall apart.</v>

1246
01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:04.053
<v Speaker 3>I can't talk about it here today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the brilliant beginning of </v>

1247
01:20:06.491 --> 01:20:07.324
<v Speaker 3>Plato's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately he shows us the justice </v>

1248
01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 3>requires balance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire personality and in the city.</v>

1249
01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:15.543
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it relates to moderation and wisdom </v>

1250
01:20:16.861 --> 01:20:18.150
<v Speaker 3>and courage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1251
01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:19.170
<v Speaker 3>why courage?</v>

1252
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:21.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1253
01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:24.410
<v Speaker 3>Without courage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't stand up for what is just,</v>

1254
01:20:24.411 --> 01:20:26.690
<v Speaker 3>and not everyone agrees on what outcome </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1255
01:20:26.691 --> 01:20:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Just still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a fight.</v>

1256
01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:31.610
<v Speaker 3>And entering that fight requires grit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it entails risk.</v>

1257
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.333
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked you to think of all the </v>

1258
01:20:34.161 --> 01:20:34.994
<v Speaker 3>university administrators of our day who</v>
<v Speaker 3>have caved in across North America and </v>

1259
01:20:39.351 --> 01:20:40.184
<v Speaker 3>let one lecture after another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These shut down without a fight </v>

1260
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:44.693
<v Speaker 3>betraying their mission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their university mission and their </v>

1261
01:20:47.331 --> 01:20:51.440
<v Speaker 3>mission to their students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they agree with shutting these</v>

1262
01:20:51.441 --> 01:20:54.530
<v Speaker 3>things down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think more often it's,</v>

1263
01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:55.683
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lack of courage a and careerism mixed </v>

1264
01:20:59.061 --> 01:20:59.894
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But physical courage is not enough to </v>

1265
01:21:02.181 --> 01:21:07.181
<v Speaker 3>guarantee justice because you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual courage to have wisdom.</v>

1266
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:12.183
<v Speaker 3>Wisdom requires the willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 3>undertake free inquiry and take apart </v>

1267
01:21:14.801 --> 01:21:17.320
<v Speaker 3>and examine your own soothing fictions </v>
<v Speaker 3>and beliefs.</v>

1268
01:21:17.710 --> 01:21:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human morality,</v>

1269
01:21:19.210 --> 01:21:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Morat mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your limits mill.</v>

1270
01:21:22.061 --> 01:21:22.894
<v Speaker 3>Who drew very much from socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>argued the free inquiry was the major </v>

1271
01:21:26.170 --> 01:21:27.003
<v Speaker 3>basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the major bases for freedom of </v>

1272
01:21:28.421 --> 01:21:29.254
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So ultimately the virtues are </v>

1273
01:21:30.581 --> 01:21:32.680
<v Speaker 3>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justice depends on courage,</v>

1274
01:21:32.681 --> 01:21:36.580
<v Speaker 3>moderation and wisdom and wisdom depends</v>
<v Speaker 3>on intellectual courage.</v>

1275
01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:42.280
<v Speaker 3>For the ancients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics is not the only way,</v>

1276
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:45.520
<v Speaker 3>and at times not even the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve the world.</v>

1277
01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:50.410
<v Speaker 3>Their cultivation of your own virtue can</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a great impact on others.</v>

1278
01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.410
<v Speaker 3>What community would not be better off </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people who cultivate,</v>

1279
01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.640
<v Speaker 3>cultivate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom,</v>

1280
01:21:54.641 --> 01:21:56.590
<v Speaker 3>moderation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>courage and justice.</v>

1281
01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:04.780
<v Speaker 3>So I'm moving to a summation now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are our pc paradoxes.</v>

1282
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:08.680
<v Speaker 3>These are our goals on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these are methods on the right.</v>

1283
01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Inclusiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a goal method,</v>

1284
01:22:12.071 --> 01:22:13.690
<v Speaker 3>ostracism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>firing opponents,</v>

1285
01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:14.533
<v Speaker 3>Reza demanding resignations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a goal we'll tolerance and diversity </v>

1286
01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:19.413
<v Speaker 3>method,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intolerance of diversity of opinion as </v>

1287
01:22:21.581 --> 01:22:22.414
<v Speaker 3>Obama noted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>openness method close to aspects of </v>

1288
01:22:27.641 --> 01:22:30.280
<v Speaker 3>traditional society and religion and </v>
<v Speaker 3>many other things,</v>

1289
01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:36.310
<v Speaker 3>kindness and compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet they demand punishment of opponents,</v>

1290
01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:39.790
<v Speaker 3>even for unintentional discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>firing people,</v>

1291
01:22:39.791 --> 01:22:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Internet shaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slander and character assassination,</v>

1292
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:43.833
<v Speaker 3>living together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately now on us college </v>

1293
01:22:46.631 --> 01:22:49.030
<v Speaker 3>campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a number of student groups who</v>

1294
01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:51.490
<v Speaker 3>want to segregate themselves by ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 3>group</v>

1295
01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.033
<v Speaker 3>being nonjudgmental and non prejudiced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet using the idea of privilege to </v>

1296
01:22:58.631 --> 01:22:59.464
<v Speaker 3>condemn whole groups as guilty of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>original sin by their birth whole </v>

1297
01:23:02.681 --> 01:23:04.300
<v Speaker 3>group's called bigoted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>

1298
01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:07.480
<v Speaker 3>violent and judgmental of themselves by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>

1299
01:23:07.481 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 3>very judgmental of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just others.</v>

1300
01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.073
<v Speaker 3>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transparency and yet the endorsement of </v>

1301
01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:14.800
<v Speaker 3>anonymous complaints.</v>

1302
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1303
01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:20.650
<v Speaker 3>history shows the higher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more Utopian the goal,</v>

1304
01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:24.430
<v Speaker 3>the easier it becomes to justify </v>
<v Speaker 3>Barbara's ends to get there.</v>

1305
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:28.570
<v Speaker 3>The more unrealistic the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more likely the failure,</v>

1306
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.620
<v Speaker 3>the greater the inpatients and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>greater the need for scapegoats.</v>

1307
01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:36.220
<v Speaker 3>The greatest evils in human history in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of innocence,</v>

1308
01:23:36.221 --> 01:23:39.640
<v Speaker 3>murdered Mao's cultural revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet murder of its citizens,</v>

1309
01:23:39.641 --> 01:23:42.820
<v Speaker 3>the Holocaust were all done in the name </v>
<v Speaker 3>of justice.</v>

1310
01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:46.573
<v Speaker 3>You'll notice I haven't discussed it </v>
<v Speaker 3>theology because Professor Peterson's </v>

1311
01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.800
<v Speaker 3>going to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are many,</v>

1312
01:23:51.801 --> 01:23:52.634
<v Speaker 3>many deep strands to enrich this </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion when looking at the </v>

1313
01:23:55.461 --> 01:23:57.710
<v Speaker 3>narratives and what people are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1314
01:23:58.070 --> 01:24:00.170
<v Speaker 3>But just in terms of the infallibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

1315
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:01.333
<v Speaker 3>etiologies or belief systems based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>myth disguised as science or philosophy </v>

1316
01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:11.840
<v Speaker 3>that overly simplify our complex world </v>
<v Speaker 3>around one or two or several ideas.</v>

1317
01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.810
<v Speaker 3>And because they fail to account for its</v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity,</v>

1318
01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:20.140
<v Speaker 3>they tend to become doctrinaire and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>posed as infallible and challenged.</v>

1319
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:26.570
<v Speaker 3>There is even an idiot logic in etiology</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeking temperament.</v>

1320
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Eric Hoffer who wrote the true believer </v>
<v Speaker 3>described a very interesting phenomenon,</v>

1321
01:24:32.571 --> 01:24:33.404
<v Speaker 3>which is during Hitler's rise to power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there were Nazis and communists on </v>

1322
01:24:37.131 --> 01:24:37.964
<v Speaker 3>the street and after the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Second World War where there were still </v>

1323
01:24:41.811 --> 01:24:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Nazis about and communists in eastern </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe,</v>

1324
01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.353
<v Speaker 3>people would often switch from being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>communist to a Nazi or a Nazi to a </v>

1325
01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:51.614
<v Speaker 3>communist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though super officially these were </v>

1326
01:24:54.171 --> 01:24:55.910
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different ideologies that</v>

1327
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:58.303
<v Speaker 3>hated each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that hoffer was </v>

1328
01:25:00.531 --> 01:25:01.364
<v Speaker 3>able to point out when he analyze these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people as they were fanatics and </v>

1329
01:25:05.271 --> 01:25:08.240
<v Speaker 3>fanatics were people who had a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>self,</v>

1330
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:10.250
<v Speaker 3>which they completely detest it.</v>

1331
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1332
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.773
<v Speaker 3>So to say they had low self esteem </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't quite capture how hostile and </v>

1333
01:25:18.121 --> 01:25:18.954
<v Speaker 3>angry they were to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what the etiology did to them is it </v>

1334
01:25:23.011 --> 01:25:27.030
<v Speaker 3>didn't grow theirself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to grow that six self.</v>

1335
01:25:27.090 --> 01:25:30.720
<v Speaker 3>It obliterated theirself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted obliteration.</v>

1336
01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:36.500
<v Speaker 3>And there are other people that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen over the years who show signs,</v>

1337
01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:37.464
<v Speaker 3>not have it a terrible negative self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much as not having a strong sense of </v>

1338
01:25:41.311 --> 01:25:45.540
<v Speaker 3>self at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they can turn to ideology,</v>

1339
01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:49.500
<v Speaker 3>which gives them the structure they feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have internally.</v>

1340
01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:51.900
<v Speaker 3>And if they're not mentalizing it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very appealing.</v>

1341
01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1342
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:55.083
<v Speaker 3>So some final words on fourth speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>that triggered us getting together and </v>

1343
01:26:02.021 --> 01:26:04.520
<v Speaker 3>talking to you today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1344
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Professor Peterson pointed out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a tangle of laws in Canada which</v>

1345
01:26:11.811 --> 01:26:14.180
<v Speaker 3>if taken together can be red</v>

1346
01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.473
<v Speaker 3>as allowing the government to an if in </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect forced people to say things they </v>

1347
01:26:22.221 --> 01:26:25.400
<v Speaker 3>don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some people like to say,</v>

1348
01:26:25.401 --> 01:26:26.234
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that couldn't be possible or it didn't </v>

1349
01:26:27.021 --> 01:26:27.854
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Professor Peterson got two letters </v>

1350
01:26:30.381 --> 01:26:31.400
<v Speaker 3>from uft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1351
01:26:31.401 --> 01:26:32.234
<v Speaker 3>lawyers letters basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to change your position on </v>

1352
01:26:35.361 --> 01:26:37.460
<v Speaker 3>for speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

1353
01:26:37.461 --> 01:26:41.540
<v Speaker 3>they read it the way he did and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>debated a professor of law who basically</v>

1354
01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:42.051
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1355
01:26:42.051 --> 01:26:42.884
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possible that you could be called </v>

1356
01:26:45.351 --> 01:26:50.000
<v Speaker 3>before the tribunal if you don't go </v>
<v Speaker 3>along with saying words,</v>

1357
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:52.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we think are now mandated.</v>

1358
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:56.630
<v Speaker 3>And they headed the Ontario Human Rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>Commission when asked,</v>

1359
01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he in violation?</v>

1360
01:26:58.581 --> 01:27:00.140
<v Speaker 3>She repeated the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't say,</v>

1361
01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:02.570
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that couldn't happen here in Ontario.</v>

1362
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.170
<v Speaker 3>And then the lawyers he consulted in </v>
<v Speaker 3>other sense.</v>

1363
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:10.340
<v Speaker 3>So there's free speech and there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>forced speech.</v>

1364
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:17.870
<v Speaker 3>This is our charter section to be grants</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone freedom of thought,</v>

1365
01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:20.790
<v Speaker 3>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion and expression.</v>

1366
01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Notice expression comes last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first part is false belief.</v>

1367
01:27:25.921 --> 01:27:26.754
<v Speaker 3>Opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expression including freedom of the </v>

1368
01:27:29.431 --> 01:27:30.264
<v Speaker 3>press and other media of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rights are together because they're </v>

1369
01:27:36.791 --> 01:27:37.624
<v Speaker 3>connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Free expression is a necessity and </v>

1370
01:27:39.401 --> 01:27:40.234
<v Speaker 3>necessary condition for the free </v>
<v Speaker 3>formation of thought and belief in </v>

1371
01:27:43.631 --> 01:27:44.464
<v Speaker 3>anyone who wants to argue that </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelling a person to say things they </v>

1372
01:27:49.421 --> 01:27:54.421
<v Speaker 3>don't believe in is not a violation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their freedom of thought.</v>

1373
01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:57.933
<v Speaker 3>Belief and opinion</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to me very much stretching the </v>

1374
01:28:01.721 --> 01:28:02.554
<v Speaker 3>charter.</v>

1375
01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:07.203
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1376
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:11.570
<v Speaker 3>It's a case of government and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proponents of forced speech,</v>

1377
01:28:11.571 --> 01:28:12.404
<v Speaker 3>not trusting sufficiently in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>goodness of most Canadians and the fact </v>

1378
01:28:15.411 --> 01:28:19.100
<v Speaker 3>that they have diverse opinions and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can benefit as per president.</v>

1379
01:28:19.101 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Obama said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when opinions collide,</v>

1380
01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:23.570
<v Speaker 3>it is a lapse into the infallible state </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mind.</v>

1381
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:30.550
<v Speaker 3>But isn't it just a matter of etiquette,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it good manners?</v>

1382
01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:32.293
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be if government didn't bring </v>

1383
01:28:35.331 --> 01:28:36.164
<v Speaker 3>force into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when's the last time you were forced to </v>

1384
01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:41.024
<v Speaker 3>have good manners?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Government could command many things by </v>

1385
01:28:44.391 --> 01:28:47.990
<v Speaker 3>force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they cannot command respect even for</v>

1386
01:28:47.991 --> 01:28:51.500
<v Speaker 3>others with force and respect is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suggest,</v>

1387
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:52.783
<v Speaker 3>and I suspect precisely what the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in this controversy really </v>

1388
01:28:56.751 --> 01:28:57.584
<v Speaker 3>yearn for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's actually quite amazing </v>

1389
01:29:00.411 --> 01:29:05.411
<v Speaker 3>that those who drafted this legislation </v>
<v Speaker 3>have not summoned the creativity to find</v>

1390
01:29:06.481 --> 01:29:10.590
<v Speaker 3>a solution to this problem that does not</v>
<v Speaker 3>travel on other rights.</v>

1391
01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.820
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't believe or don't agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with anything I've said so far,</v>

1392
01:29:16.821 --> 01:29:17.654
<v Speaker 3>then I would say this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always think of the next government </v>

1393
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:24.860
<v Speaker 3>breaking the taboo in forcing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>endorsing for speech,</v>

1394
01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:29.540
<v Speaker 3>creating a taste or tolerance for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Habituating people to it as a legitimate</v>

1395
01:29:29.541 --> 01:29:33.710
<v Speaker 3>tool of power is handing your opponents </v>
<v Speaker 3>a new tool,</v>

1396
01:29:34.190 --> 01:29:35.023
<v Speaker 3>a shiny new tool and governments change </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you will have taught your opponents </v>

1397
01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.740
<v Speaker 3>that one can use force and get away with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1398
01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:46.490
<v Speaker 3>And especially if you're represented </v>
<v Speaker 3>minority or marginal group,</v>

1399
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:48.583
<v Speaker 3>and I bet you that many of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on how you dissect things out </v>

1400
01:29:51.591 --> 01:29:54.290
<v Speaker 3>can be seen as part of a minority or </v>
<v Speaker 3>marginal group.</v>

1401
01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:58.790
<v Speaker 3>It is far better to persuade people than</v>
<v Speaker 3>force them.</v>

1402
01:29:58.820 --> 01:29:59.653
<v Speaker 3>If you force the changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll only stay in place as long as </v>

1403
01:30:02.901 --> 01:30:04.610
<v Speaker 3>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your side holds government.</v>

1404
01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:07.340
<v Speaker 3>But if you persuade people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will be on your side.</v>

1405
01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Even when government changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forced speech is a robotic solution to a</v>

1406
01:30:13.761 --> 01:30:17.900
<v Speaker 3>problem that is best solved with two way</v>
<v Speaker 3>empathy and understanding.</v>

1407
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:23.530
<v Speaker 3>And in the historical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clinical and scientific literature,</v>

1408
01:30:23.531 --> 01:30:28.531
<v Speaker 3>I've read that studies people being </v>
<v Speaker 3>forced to say things in families,</v>

1409
01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:29.913
<v Speaker 3>in concentration camps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in unusual political situations in that </v>

1410
01:30:34.451 --> 01:30:36.670
<v Speaker 3>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which studies people who are not trusted</v>

1411
01:30:36.671 --> 01:30:39.730
<v Speaker 3>to be good enough to find their own way </v>
<v Speaker 3>and say what they think.</v>

1412
01:30:40.210 --> 01:30:44.560
<v Speaker 3>We see these people led into a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hopeless apathy and despair.</v>

1413
01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.053
<v Speaker 3>It leads to a kind of abdication of </v>
<v Speaker 3>authenticity and even their moral </v>

1414
01:30:49.751 --> 01:30:50.584
<v Speaker 3>development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said the political correctness </v>

1415
01:30:55.151 --> 01:30:55.984
<v Speaker 3>today</v>
<v Speaker 3>is indeed mutually exclusive with </v>

1416
01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:00.873
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a tragic irony that the PC </v>

1417
01:31:03.131 --> 01:31:06.370
<v Speaker 3>attack on free speech is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1418
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:11.170
<v Speaker 3>the tragic irony of the attack on free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech is that free speech is one of the</v>

1419
01:31:11.171 --> 01:31:15.070
<v Speaker 3>most durable protections minorities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>marginalized groups have ever had.</v>

1420
01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:16.953
<v Speaker 3>And the shutdown and invalidation </v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques undermine the very ideals </v>

1421
01:31:20.531 --> 01:31:21.364
<v Speaker 3>they purport to defend and are based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the proponents claiming and infallible </v>

1422
01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:26.830
<v Speaker 3>state of mind about what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate,</v>

1423
01:31:27.130 --> 01:31:27.911
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe,</v>

1424
01:31:27.911 --> 01:31:28.744
<v Speaker 3>and effective</v>

1425
01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.640
<v Speaker 3>in this kind of solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wins.</v>

1426
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:37.240
<v Speaker 3>Political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moral and scientific progress,</v>

1427
01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:38.493
<v Speaker 3>as well as our individual health require</v>
<v Speaker 3>a community that has a place for verbal </v>

1428
01:31:41.981 --> 01:31:42.814
<v Speaker 3>argument that's not violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the sublimation of our differences </v>

1429
01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:49.060
<v Speaker 3>into a verbal form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far less vicious than true violence.</v>

1430
01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:50.553
<v Speaker 3>So the very individuality that pc </v>
<v Speaker 3>proponents treasure derives from </v>

1431
01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:54.574
<v Speaker 3>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which itself must be protected from two </v>

1432
01:31:57.170 --> 01:32:01.420
<v Speaker 3>equally powerful human tendencies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>of authoritarianism and human,</v>

1433
01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.633
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all of Islam.</v>

1434
01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:03.813
<v Speaker 3>And I conclude my last slide with mills </v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom and his principles that mankind </v>

1435
01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:12.370
<v Speaker 3>are not infallible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That their truth,</v>

1436
01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are only half truths.</v>

1437
01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:16.593
<v Speaker 3>That unity of opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless resulting from the fullest and </v>

1438
01:32:19.721 --> 01:32:23.860
<v Speaker 3>freest comparison of opposite opinions </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not desirable.</v>

1439
01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:24.873
<v Speaker 3>And diversity is not an evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a good until mankind are much more </v>

1440
01:32:29.501 --> 01:32:33.490
<v Speaker 3>capable than at present of recognizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>all sides of the truth,</v>

1441
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:36.730
<v Speaker 3>our principals applicable to men's modes</v>
<v Speaker 3>of action,</v>

1442
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.100
<v Speaker 3>not less than their opinions.</v>

1443
01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:46.100
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
