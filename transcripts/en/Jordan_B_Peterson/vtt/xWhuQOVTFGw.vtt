00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.743
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm talking today with Dr. James </v>

3
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Lindsey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Peter Boghossian,</v>

4
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.453
<v Speaker 2>and Dr Helen pluck roads and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous or infamous depending on your </v>

5
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:34.604
<v Speaker 2>perspective as the authors of a series </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hoax articles that were published in </v>

6
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.603
<v Speaker 2>what purport to be academic journals in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last year following up work done by </v>

7
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 2>socal back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long ago was that?</v>

8
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Now it's gotta be like 25 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

9
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.483
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've all assumed or you've all </v>

10
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:55.910
<v Speaker 2>assumed that the situation hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>improved.</v>

11
00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:56.744
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I'm going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have an extended </v>

12
00:00:58.461 --> 00:00:59.294
<v Speaker 2>discussion about these articles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the motivation for producing them </v>

13
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.253
<v Speaker 2>and then the necessity for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the morality of that at the aftermath </v>

14
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:07.724
<v Speaker 2>and all of that in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I'm going to do is have </v>

15
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>each of you introduce yourself and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll launch right into a discussion of,</v>

16
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 2>let's call it the scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Lindsey.</v>

17
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good to be here.</v>

18
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 3>So I have a background in mathematics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and physics.</v>

19
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:25.274
<v Speaker 3>My Phds in math.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left academia in 2010 and had been </v>

20
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 3>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

21
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 3>mostly religious and moral philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and psychology since,</v>

22
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 3>and then got wrapped up in this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of was the,</v>

23
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>epicenter of the project.</v>

24
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 3>I did all the submissions and managed </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the emails and all of that.</v>

25
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.000
<v Speaker 3>And then Peter and Ellen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

26
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.910
<v Speaker 3>filled in all of my weaknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we spent,</v>

27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an 18,</v>

28
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 3>about 18 months working on this a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really 10 months writing papers.</v>

29
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 3>Then there was the getting ready to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>public.</v>

30
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

31
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of who I am and how I got </v>
<v Speaker 3>into this.</v>

32
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

33
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.723
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lapsed mathematician who gives a lot of </v>

34
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.533
<v Speaker 3>concern to how we produce knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what academic standards are and should </v>

35
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:17.870
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

36
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 3>why did you leave academia?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could say that it was like this</v>

37
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:22.844
<v Speaker 3>Prussian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the writing on the wall that it </v>

38
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:25.334
<v Speaker 3>was going mad and I wanted out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really it was just a number of </v>

39
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:28.724
<v Speaker 3>personal responsibilities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>commitments that led me to not want to </v>

40
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:32.950
<v Speaker 3>pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

41
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.250
<v Speaker 3>employment where I didn't know where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be placed from one post doc to the</v>

42
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:39.710
<v Speaker 3>next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was family commitments primarily.</v>

43
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 2>But you were still interested enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue with this project?</v>

44
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Interested enough in the academic world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:47.840
<v Speaker 2>I never really</v>

46
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 3>need to stop researching or reading and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking and coming up with new ideas.</v>

47
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.653
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to do mathematics </v>

48
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker 3>without some institutional backing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

49
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 3>math is hard as some people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>noticed.</v>

50
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.633
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't have the resources necessary</v>
<v Speaker 3>really to pursue mathematical research </v>

51
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.553
<v Speaker 3>independently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I found that I could dig into </v>

52
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 3>philosophy and I could dig into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology kind of on my own,</v>

53
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 3>not professionally of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

54
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.603
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's enough to get an idea of what I </v>

55
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:17.734
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was looking at in a philosophical sense </v>

56
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 3>to answer questions that I was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply interested in.</v>

57
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:27.511
<v Speaker 3>Mostly the question that drove me </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably from about 2011 forward was,</v>

58
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do people really mean?</v>

59
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 3>What are they talking about when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>say the word God?</v>

60
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 3>And so I really got involved in talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about they're thinking about religion.</v>

61
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what led me to religious and </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral psychology,</v>

62
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:41.000
<v Speaker 3>trying to understand why people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

63
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 3>believe things that they do and why </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

64
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 3>why they manifest their beliefs in </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain ways.</v>

65
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

66
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 3>that kind of a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to find out what I figure.</v>

67
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 3>I live in the southeast us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so really religious area.</v>

68
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 3>People talk to me about their belief in </v>
<v Speaker 3>God all the time.</v>

69
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I hear it constantly at different levels</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>

70
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

71
00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:05.750
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

72
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.583
<v Speaker 3>I kind of believe level all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the borderline insane level of </v>

73
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 3>conviction to very implausible </v>
<v Speaker 3>propositions level.</v>

74
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.223
<v Speaker 3>And I wanted to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the people talking about ideas </v>

75
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 3>like God means something when they saved</v>
<v Speaker 3>the term.</v>

76
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 3>It's something very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just do they mean something.</v>

77
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 3>They need something very important to </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

78
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.383
<v Speaker 3>And I wanted to figure out from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective that didn't rely upon the </v>

79
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:33.064
<v Speaker 3>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the theology or the religious mythology </v>

80
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:35.704
<v Speaker 3>or narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were speaking to as articles </v>

81
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 3>within,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the material world.</v>

82
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.253
<v Speaker 3>And so I became very interested in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and spent a number of years reading and </v>

83
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:44.344
<v Speaker 3>writing about it.</v>

84
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of culture war,</v>

85
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 3>if you want to call it that progressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's seeing what was happening to people</v>

86
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I was interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Sam Harris for example,</v>

87
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was certainly one of these people.</v>

88
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 3>You see these people get called racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>or sexist for what seemed to be nothing.</v>

89
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 3>And you try to dig into it again with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the interest in meaning of words,</v>

90
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 3>kept seeing these references back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

91
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>power dynamics and um,</v>

92
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.383
<v Speaker 3>sociological definitions that that only </v>
<v Speaker 3>see racism or sexism is structural </v>

93
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:19.231
<v Speaker 3>entities that allow basically people of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to be considered racist or sexist</v>

94
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 3>just because of their identity by just </v>
<v Speaker 3>by virtue of being,</v>

95
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a white male,</v>

96
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 3>you could be racist and sexist </v>
<v Speaker 3>inevitably are.</v>

97
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:29.730
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

98
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 3>So that's what led me to get curious </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the grievance studies.</v>

99
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately,</v>

100
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's hear,</v>

101
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.810
<v Speaker 3>let's hear from you and tell everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>who you are and what you're up to.</v>

102
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.663
<v Speaker 4>I'm currently teaching philosophy at </v>
<v Speaker 4>Portland State University in the </v>

103
00:05:45.381 --> 00:05:50.381
<v Speaker 4>philosophy department and I am up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>James Lindsey and I just finished a book</v>

104
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.083
<v Speaker 4>how to have impossible conversations </v>
<v Speaker 4>that will come out probably in 2019 </v>

105
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 4>decapo press</v>

106
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.233
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know what I'm up to now </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I made be looking at a career </v>

107
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 5>change very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

108
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we go get into that later.</v>

109
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 5>But the university filed charges against</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

110
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:15.090
<v Speaker 5>They found me guilty of not seeking irb </v>
<v Speaker 5>approval and that</v>

111
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 2>investigation is ongoing for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>falsifications.</v>

112
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 2>We better have quite a conversation as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well about IRB approval.</v>

113
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 2>That's another rabbit hole we can punch </v>
<v Speaker 2>down because that's another catastrophic</v>

114
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:26.624
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe that the University of has </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflicted upon itself over the last two </v>

115
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:30.464
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's something that's becoming </v>

116
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 2>increasingly politicized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very difficult to understand how</v>

117
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 2>you could get irb approval for a satire</v>

118
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.250
<v Speaker 5>or why you might need it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

119
00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:42.970
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

120
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.590
<v Speaker 5>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's hear from you.</v>

121
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.830
<v Speaker 5>But I have a background in literature </v>
<v Speaker 5>and early,</v>

122
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.150
<v Speaker 5>late medieval,</v>
<v Speaker 5>early modern studies.</v>

123
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm interested in how women use the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christian narrative to,</v>

124
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.223
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get all 30 and autonomy for </v>

125
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:10.330
<v Speaker 5>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of 1300 to 1700 things.</v>

126
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:14.560
<v Speaker 5>So I'm looking at how this change before</v>
<v Speaker 5>and after the reformation,</v>

127
00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:18.130
<v Speaker 5>how the narratives changed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

128
00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:20.950
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I left at the end of my masters.</v>

129
00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:25.951
<v Speaker 5>I was intending to go back and do my phd</v>
<v Speaker 5>in medieval manuscripts.</v>

130
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just got,</v>

131
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.153
<v Speaker 5>I keep going earlier and earlier because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is so difficult to get away from the </v>

132
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:34.450
<v Speaker 5>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

133
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm interested in medieval manuscripts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not overwhelmingly.</v>

134
00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:42.370
<v Speaker 5>I want to look at social history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's so difficult to do that because</v>

135
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:43.204
<v Speaker 5>there is a pressure now to do so </v>
<v Speaker 5>anachronistically to read it through </v>

136
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.460
<v Speaker 5>gender ideology of today.</v>

137
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.293
<v Speaker 5>So I have to accept that the reason I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was going to do medieval manuscripts is </v>

138
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:53.824
<v Speaker 5>because I can translate and transcribe </v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is something objective that I </v>

139
00:07:56.981 --> 00:07:57.814
<v Speaker 5>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can produce an edition of texts which </v>

140
00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:03.160
<v Speaker 5>aren't readily available and explain </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

141
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.520
<v Speaker 5>And that's the only real way that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to look at religious writing by and</v>

142
00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:13.660
<v Speaker 5>about women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>men and the objective way.</v>

143
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:17.860
<v Speaker 5>And it isn't really I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I stepped away for a year and in that</v>

144
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.280
<v Speaker 5>year I started writing about about </v>
<v Speaker 5>postmodernism,</v>

145
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:24.400
<v Speaker 5>about feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about liberalism and ideology.</v>

146
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.900
<v Speaker 5>And then it just got to be so much to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>

147
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.633
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't gone back at all so involved </v>

148
00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:34.294
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in writing about what's going on right </v>

149
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:37.690
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that is,</v>

150
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's interesting because you,</v>

151
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:42.724
<v Speaker 2>you talked about</v>

152
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.530
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your belief that women in the</v>

153
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 2>mid stages of development of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian Church we're using,</v>

154
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:53.660
<v Speaker 2>the idea is to actually liberate </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

155
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:54.963
<v Speaker 5>And too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the examples from margery Kempe to </v>

156
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:01.014
<v Speaker 5>Emilia Lania and we're looking at very </v>
<v Speaker 5>different ways in which you know it </v>

157
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 5>within the Catholic narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

158
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 5>women would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well God speaks directly to me.</v>

159
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:11.424
<v Speaker 5>He is the patriarch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gives me a certain or sovereignty to </v>

160
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:20.541
<v Speaker 5>disagree with a patriarchal if I'm with </v>
<v Speaker 5>my husband.</v>

161
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.283
<v Speaker 5>And then later after the reformation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a slightly different emphasis </v>

162
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:27.770
<v Speaker 5>in which women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

163
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 5>everyone can interpret the Bible and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that includes women.</v>

164
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 5>So there was a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>authority there too.</v>

165
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:35.154
<v Speaker 5>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's generally been what I've been </v>

166
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:38.244
<v Speaker 5>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>slightly different ways that women have </v>

167
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:44.530
<v Speaker 5>approached biblical texts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>biblical narratives and um,</v>

168
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.211
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and yes,</v>

169
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:46.044
<v Speaker 5>and use them to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to challenge sort of mainstream </v>

170
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.710
<v Speaker 5>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

171
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 5>I make some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make some pretty good arguments.</v>

172
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:52.854
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the Alanya certainly did not </v>

173
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:55.630
<v Speaker 5>recant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mostly sweetened.</v>

174
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.863
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why don't we start by why are you </v>

175
00:10:02.021 --> 00:10:04.850
<v Speaker 3>guys telling us what the genesis of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>project was?</v>

176
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.743
<v Speaker 3>Let's outline the project itself that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sequence of papers that you wrote </v>

177
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.920
<v Speaker 3>and let's talk about the genesis of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

178
00:10:11.921 --> 00:10:16.921
<v Speaker 3>So take that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really kind of kind of interesting.</v>

179
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if your audience would know</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

180
00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:23.200
<v Speaker 3>Jordan or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all three of us,</v>

181
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're writing a bit within what might've</v>

182
00:10:26.411 --> 00:10:29.830
<v Speaker 3>been considered the new atheist vein and</v>
<v Speaker 3>working within that.</v>

183
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.693
<v Speaker 3>And then I was working on a book trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to answer my big kind of early 2010 his </v>

184
00:10:35.681 --> 00:10:38.380
<v Speaker 3>research question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do people mean when they say,</v>

185
00:10:38.381 --> 00:10:39.214
<v Speaker 3>God?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was writing a book called that I </v>

186
00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:41.950
<v Speaker 3>eventually titled Everybody is wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>about God.</v>

187
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.233
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter called me one day while I was </v>

188
00:10:44.651 --> 00:10:47.530
<v Speaker 3>working on either the book itself or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>research for it.</v>

189
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't recall the specifics at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

190
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.660
<v Speaker 3>but he called me one day and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

191
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.361
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

192
00:10:52.361 --> 00:10:53.194
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep trying to tell people something </v>

193
00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:56.194
<v Speaker 3>that's as obvious as can be to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And somebody has to believe I'm not </v>

194
00:11:00.251 --> 00:11:01.630
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody thinks I'm nuts.</v>

195
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Please tell me I'm not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I said,</v>

196
00:11:03.911 --> 00:11:04.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

197
00:11:04.571 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

198
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:07.743
<v Speaker 3>I look at the way people in gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies use their scholarly can and the </v>

199
00:11:12.101 --> 00:11:15.130
<v Speaker 3>way they produce that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that they refer to it,</v>

200
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.510
<v Speaker 3>the fact that it seems disconnected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

201
00:11:19.511 --> 00:11:22.630
<v Speaker 3>in a literal sense from what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>in reality.</v>

202
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.003
<v Speaker 3>And it feels like it's their Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like it's a holy scripture for </v>

203
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.880
<v Speaker 3>something like a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I going nuts?</v>

204
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.120
<v Speaker 3>And as it turned out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason I started writing the book,</v>

205
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.553
<v Speaker 3>everybody's wrong about God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was partly to answer my big research </v>

206
00:11:38.081 --> 00:11:38.914
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was also because I noticed that </v>

207
00:11:40.421 --> 00:11:43.420
<v Speaker 3>the community built up around new </v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist activism,</v>

208
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.410
<v Speaker 3>which called a Selfie.</v>

209
00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 3>Atheism community showed almost all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the symptoms of qualifying as a religion</v>

210
00:11:50.981 --> 00:11:51.814
<v Speaker 3>at least from like Durkheim's </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective and maybe even from some </v>

211
00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:55.264
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I immediately latched onto what Pete </v>

212
00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 3>said and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

213
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 3>you're not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're probably right.</v>

214
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.683
<v Speaker 3>I think you are absolutely right that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the scholarly Canon in gender studies </v>

215
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:09.751
<v Speaker 3>and so on is operating like of book of </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith for something.</v>

216
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.123
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know exactly what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we got curious about that </v>

217
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:18.160
<v Speaker 3>scholarly cannon kind of from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

218
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.383
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't long after that that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>infamous feminist glaciology paper came </v>

219
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

220
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.960
<v Speaker 3>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

221
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:26.794
<v Speaker 3>few four or five researchers published a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very well funded study showing or </v>

222
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:32.434
<v Speaker 3>claiming to show that that glaciology is</v>
<v Speaker 3>inherently sexist all the way back to </v>

223
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:37.950
<v Speaker 3>its roots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

224
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.120
<v Speaker 3>back to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

225
00:12:40.121 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 3>the intrepid explorers of mountains and </v>
<v Speaker 3>polar regions.</v>

226
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.050
<v Speaker 3>And all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is justified by being a big,</v>

227
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 3>tough guy in the 19th century or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

228
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.780
<v Speaker 3>And that apparently somehow this </v>
<v Speaker 3>masculinist bias hangs over.</v>

229
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:55.984
<v Speaker 3>And so the answer to this is to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminist art projects as part of place </v>

230
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:01.990
<v Speaker 3>for science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just apologies as part of glacier</v>

231
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:06.260
<v Speaker 3>science or else it's racist and sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

232
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember reading the paper </v>
<v Speaker 3>lightly at the time and thinking there's</v>

233
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 3>no way this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Peter and I had a phone call,</v>

234
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.660
<v Speaker 3>we started looking at new peer review on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the twitter at the same time.</v>

235
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should never look at that.</v>

236
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

237
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.620
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've actually got two issues here.</v>

238
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Then let's say no all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>because yeah,</v>

239
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.740
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>

240
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.470
<v Speaker 2>there's the issue of what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

241
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.043
<v Speaker 2>social justice oriented academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines and then there's a deeper </v>

242
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:40.501
<v Speaker 2>issue of how people view the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>individually and collectively.</v>

243
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.243
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Through the lens of a belief system and </v>

244
00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:49.141
<v Speaker 2>the probability that that belief system </v>
<v Speaker 2>will take on something approximating the</v>

245
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:53.110
<v Speaker 2>trappings of a religious movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

246
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's a deeper question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

247
00:13:56.561 --> 00:14:00.580
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I discussed </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually with Sam Harris when we have</v>

248
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:01.414
<v Speaker 2>our series of debates was the question </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the inescapable realty of something </v>

249
00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:07.414
<v Speaker 2>approximating a religious framework to </v>
<v Speaker 2>orient people in relationship to action </v>

250
00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I like,</v>

251
00:14:12.341 --> 00:14:14.890
<v Speaker 2>I happen to believe that a framework </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is inescapable.</v>

252
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.350
<v Speaker 2>The question is not whether you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have one,</v>

253
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:20.570
<v Speaker 2>it's which one you're going to have and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it going to be rooted in.</v>

254
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.560
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I think that both meet</v>

255
00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:28.990
<v Speaker 2>you and Dostoyevsky warn people about in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the late 19th century was that,</v>

256
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

257
00:14:30.531 --> 00:14:32.530
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't a quote from either of them,</v>

258
00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:36.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's something approximating someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>else whose name I don't remember.</v>

259
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.433
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he who believes in nothing will end up </v>

260
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:42.940
<v Speaker 2>believing in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's something,</v>

261
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.313
<v Speaker 2>there's something in that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily deep as far as I'm </v>

262
00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:46.601
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

263
00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:47.434
<v Speaker 2>so you were interested in religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenology and then you guys started </v>

264
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:51.250
<v Speaker 2>to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

265
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>as</v>

266
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.640
<v Speaker 3>far as you were concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a variety of different causes.</v>

267
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.660
<v Speaker 3>I academic or academic movements were </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking on the trappings of a religious,</v>

268
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.393
<v Speaker 3>they were starting to look religious in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their approach and in their application </v>

269
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 3>of their beliefs right on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the social justice end of it.</v>

270
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.010
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Community for example,</v>

271
00:15:13.011 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 3>was definitely engaging in of course </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had kind of their uh,</v>

272
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:18.674
<v Speaker 3>their unique vocabulary that they speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>to one another end and identify one </v>

273
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:24.770
<v Speaker 3>another by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

274
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.260
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of like an ecclesiastical </v>
<v Speaker 3>vocabulary,</v>

275
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:32.261
<v Speaker 3>but if social justice and then they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely involved,</v>

276
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:34.724
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they call political correctness is </v>

277
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.810
<v Speaker 3>in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually identical to what you see with</v>

278
00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:39.890
<v Speaker 3>people crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blasphemy.</v>

279
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.663
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so these parallels started to stick out </v>

280
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.613
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that we started looking at the </v>

281
00:15:47.631 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 3>real peer review twitter account and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that they seem to be producing their</v>

282
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:56.350
<v Speaker 3>knowledge that they could then refer to </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually replicates special revelation,</v>

283
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they came up with their ideas,</v>

284
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.580
<v Speaker 3>they believe that they came from some </v>
<v Speaker 3>morally backed source of,</v>

285
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of goodness and then put them forth.</v>

286
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.113
<v Speaker 3>And then were they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were morally vetted and given an </v>

287
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:13.760
<v Speaker 3>epistemological status they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>deserve.</v>

288
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.670
<v Speaker 3>As a result can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you think the sources,</v>

289
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 3>the sources at the time I had no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now after having done the project,</v>

290
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:25.580
<v Speaker 3>I think the source is actually what I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>come to call a postmodern mythology.</v>

291
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.473
<v Speaker 3>That our social reality is conditioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>upon use of language and representation </v>

292
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:31.814
<v Speaker 3>and it's all done in service to power </v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamics that underlie how society </v>

293
00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:36.404
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those power dynamics are trapped up in </v>

294
00:16:38.091 --> 00:16:42.260
<v Speaker 3>identity and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mediated primarily through language in,</v>

295
00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:46.490
<v Speaker 3>in media</v>
<v Speaker 3>identified the sources of that.</v>

296
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.473
<v Speaker 3>And not only me obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've identified the sources of that </v>

297
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:53.330
<v Speaker 3>beliefs with the French postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>

298
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:54.164
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people trust some of it back </v>

299
00:16:55.881 --> 00:17:00.060
<v Speaker 3>farther to what's essentially something </v>
<v Speaker 3>approximating a Marxist doctrine,</v>

300
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.950
<v Speaker 3>which is the doctrine of which is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine of power relations,</v>

301
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.280
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

302
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.340
<v Speaker 3>We'll have any criticisms or further </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments on that.</v>

303
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Let's call it genealogy genealogy or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lynn or Helen.</v>

304
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Helen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Helen.</v>

305
00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:14.804
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

306
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.261
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

307
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:16.094
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I largely agree with the idea that we </v>

308
00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 5>had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

309
00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.493
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quite a profound epistemic shift in the </v>

310
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.880
<v Speaker 5>late sixties with the rise of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>postmodernists.</v>

311
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:31.330
<v Speaker 5>I disagree with people who crying kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of relate this closely to Marxism.</v>

312
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:35.290
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's clear that they,</v>

313
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 5>they have a common ancestor and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they have certain ideas in common.</v>

314
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:45.070
<v Speaker 5>But if we conflate Marxism and </v>
<v Speaker 5>postmodernism too close to the,</v>

315
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:48.020
<v Speaker 5>on more than those yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

316
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.410
<v Speaker 5>that sort of oppressor and oppressed </v>
<v Speaker 5>group,</v>

317
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 5>that surge of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

318
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:53.563
<v Speaker 5>false consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these sort of key ideas which really </v>

319
00:17:55.721 --> 00:17:59.050
<v Speaker 5>worth floating around at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they've come up in the same place.</v>

320
00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:00.243
<v Speaker 5>If we conflate those two closely and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>are not looking at the really profound </v>

321
00:18:03.551 --> 00:18:04.384
<v Speaker 5>differences in epidemiology in which </v>
<v Speaker 5>Marxism was really trying to continue </v>

322
00:18:09.071 --> 00:18:11.230
<v Speaker 5>and modernist project,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was totalitarian,</v>

323
00:18:11.231 --> 00:18:13.090
<v Speaker 5>it was objective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this most of the,</v>

324
00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:16.330
<v Speaker 5>and it went sort of in a straight line </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

325
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.840
<v Speaker 5>if there was a word for the extremes of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Marxism,</v>

326
00:18:19.841 --> 00:18:21.220
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this totalitarianism,</v>

327
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.920
<v Speaker 5>if there's a word for the extremes of </v>
<v Speaker 5>postmodernism,</v>

328
00:18:23.921 --> 00:18:26.500
<v Speaker 5>its disintegration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fragmentation.</v>

329
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.930
<v Speaker 5>So we're looking now at something very </v>
<v Speaker 5>different,</v>

330
00:18:28.931 --> 00:18:32.350
<v Speaker 5>something very intangible that is coming</v>
<v Speaker 5>in and,</v>

331
00:18:32.351 --> 00:18:35.860
<v Speaker 5>and it's saying we cannot access and </v>
<v Speaker 5>objective truth.</v>

332
00:18:35.861 --> 00:18:36.694
<v Speaker 5>Everything is created in discourses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>empowers us in systems of power and </v>

333
00:18:40.181 --> 00:18:40.900
<v Speaker 5>privilege.</v>

334
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 2>So why in the world is power privilege </v>
<v Speaker 2>then like,</v>

335
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.533
<v Speaker 2>I mean it still seems that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernists are willing to assume </v>

336
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.080
<v Speaker 2>that the pursuit of power is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

337
00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:54.900
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious that everyone's pursuing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

338
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's also okay for those who don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have it to pursue it.</v>

339
00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's not as if they've abandoned the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea as far as I can tell of a,</v>

340
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.370
<v Speaker 2>of a linear narrative towards some end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end seems to me to be power.</v>

341
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.180
<v Speaker 2>And so why is that justifiable from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern perspective,</v>

342
00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 2>given that linear movement and Mehta </v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives aren't justifiable</v>

343
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.663
<v Speaker 5>because of the change that happened in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the late eighties so when socal for </v>

344
00:19:22.601 --> 00:19:23.350
<v Speaker 5>example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

345
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.183
<v Speaker 5>he did his hopes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What he was looking at was this collect </v>

346
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:27.543
<v Speaker 5>sort of pure postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This I'm very sort of intangible idea </v>

347
00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.060
<v Speaker 5>that an objective reality context is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we can't grasp anything,</v>

348
00:19:34.061 --> 00:19:34.894
<v Speaker 5>that everything is a construct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what happened in the 80s gradually </v>

349
00:19:38.891 --> 00:19:42.760
<v Speaker 5>was that this just after prolific </v>
<v Speaker 5>amounts of writing,</v>

350
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:43.923
<v Speaker 5>it just kind of fizzled because once you</v>
<v Speaker 5>disintegrated and dismantled absolutely </v>

351
00:19:47.441 --> 00:19:49.300
<v Speaker 5>everything and it's all in a mess on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>floor,</v>

352
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.463
<v Speaker 5>you have got no where to go with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we started seeing then the rising </v>

353
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.260
<v Speaker 5>materialist feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

354
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.153
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then within sort of critical race </v>

355
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.173
<v Speaker 5>approaches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>intersectionality in queer theory in </v>

356
00:20:02.981 --> 00:20:07.030
<v Speaker 5>post-colonialism particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we started seeing a change towards,</v>

357
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.970
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so everything is a cultural construct,</v>

358
00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.253
<v Speaker 5>but we can't address anything if we </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't accept that a certain group of </v>

359
00:20:14.471 --> 00:20:18.250
<v Speaker 5>people in a certain place at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>time experience certain things.</v>

360
00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.383
<v Speaker 5>So what we're looking at now is an </v>
<v Speaker 5>objective reality that oppression and </v>

361
00:20:22.631 --> 00:20:25.270
<v Speaker 5>systems of power exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

362
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.410
<v Speaker 5>hmm,</v>

363
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 2>everything else is socially constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fundamental power,</v>

364
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.490
<v Speaker 5>but that construct has power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

365
00:20:37.491 --> 00:20:38.324
<v Speaker 5>it is objective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It true that power is benefiting </v>

366
00:20:40.971 --> 00:20:44.120
<v Speaker 5>straight white men and disadvantages </v>
<v Speaker 5>women of color,</v>

367
00:20:44.121 --> 00:20:45.620
<v Speaker 5>trans women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera.</v>

368
00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 5>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was the change that happened then.</v>

369
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 5>So now it's politically actionable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this,</v>

370
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:52.234
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it couldn't Kimberle crenshaw put this </v>

371
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 5>most explicitly when she said it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>politics applied to postmodern theory.</v>

372
00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:57.503
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we want to get this straight because </v>

373
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:01.980
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important.</v>

374
00:21:01.981 --> 00:21:02.814
<v Speaker 2>So you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you distinguish the postmodern movement </v>

375
00:21:06.061 --> 00:21:09.150
<v Speaker 2>from the Marxist movement because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxism Marxists,</v>

376
00:21:09.151 --> 00:21:11.820
<v Speaker 2>we're still moving in a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

377
00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:14.310
<v Speaker 2>And you considered that still a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the modernist project,</v>

378
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.580
<v Speaker 2>you acquainted Marxism and postmodernism</v>
<v Speaker 2>in so far as they both adult,</v>

379
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:21.960
<v Speaker 2>let's say an oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppression,</v>

380
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.100
<v Speaker 2>oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>

381
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although many other things do to,</v>

382
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.640
<v Speaker 2>and often that that's quite warranted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

383
00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.010
<v Speaker 2>the American revolution for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was an oppressor,</v>

384
00:21:32.011 --> 00:21:34.390
<v Speaker 2>oppressed revelations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no doubt,</v>

385
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.710
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt that power and power </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentials exists.</v>

386
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:38.603
<v Speaker 2>The issue is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other realities that might be </v>

387
00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:41.334
<v Speaker 2>considered</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly yes wallet and whether it's </v>

388
00:21:47.641 --> 00:21:50.850
<v Speaker 2>reasonable to reduce everything to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single dimension of motivation.</v>

389
00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:51.684
<v Speaker 2>So the postmodern project collapses into</v>
<v Speaker 2>its own nihilism and something emerges </v>

390
00:21:56.221 --> 00:21:57.054
<v Speaker 2>out of the ashes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the assumption that a </v>

391
00:21:59.911 --> 00:22:00.744
<v Speaker 2>transcendent reality does in fact exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they only defining feature of that </v>

392
00:22:04.801 --> 00:22:05.634
<v Speaker 2>transcendent reality is the existence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>power in the existence of power </v>

393
00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:13.041
<v Speaker 2>differential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's associated with identity.</v>

394
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.440
<v Speaker 2>But then then the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

395
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a question that goes underneath </v>
<v Speaker 2>that even,</v>

396
00:22:17.251 --> 00:22:18.240
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

397
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.133
<v Speaker 2>why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it that that is accepted as the </v>

398
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:25.620
<v Speaker 2>fundamental reality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's no rationale for that.</v>

399
00:22:25.621 --> 00:22:27.480
<v Speaker 2>And postmodernism itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

400
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 2>auditors should criticize them.</v>

401
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.850
<v Speaker 5>Did they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do they do it very much?</v>

402
00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:32.684
<v Speaker 5>And then this is the argument that goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>on repeatedly with the old style </v>

403
00:22:35.061 --> 00:22:37.520
<v Speaker 5>postmodernist saying this isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>postmodernism.</v>

404
00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.013
<v Speaker 5>And so are we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've tended to call it applied </v>

405
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.730
<v Speaker 5>postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Nurse to build it,</v>

406
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.420
<v Speaker 5>the poem wage cluster because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 5>a set of ideas about identity,</v>

407
00:22:49.551 --> 00:22:50.930
<v Speaker 5>about power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about privilege,</v>

408
00:22:50.931 --> 00:22:55.040
<v Speaker 5>about language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the importance of language and um,</v>

409
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:56.443
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and hierarchies and things which have </v>

410
00:22:57.921 --> 00:23:00.980
<v Speaker 5>come from postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which have got politicized.</v>

411
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.843
<v Speaker 5>And then within activism have got </v>
<v Speaker 5>condensed into kind of user friendly </v>

412
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.360
<v Speaker 5>chunks and further bastardized.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we can't,</v>

413
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.570
<v Speaker 5>we can't take this away from </v>
<v Speaker 5>postmodernism.</v>

414
00:23:11.571 --> 00:23:15.770
<v Speaker 5>It didn't come from anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But neither is it the,</v>

415
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.043
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pure sort of deconstructive or </v>

416
00:23:19.641 --> 00:23:20.474
<v Speaker 5>poststructuralist or any of that at that</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole sort of massive range of theory </v>

417
00:23:24.891 --> 00:23:29.891
<v Speaker 5>that that existed from the late sixties </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the mid eighties that that died.</v>

418
00:23:29.931 --> 00:23:30.920
<v Speaker 5>It sits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gone.</v>

419
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.860
<v Speaker 5>It's fragmented itself as it was always </v>
<v Speaker 5>bound to do.</v>

420
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:39.470
<v Speaker 2>So to drive to your question about why </v>
<v Speaker 2>or how they justified this change,</v>

421
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just say we called this,</v>

422
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 5>this set of disciplines</v>

423
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 3>or approaches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grievance studies for a reason.</v>

424
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.410
<v Speaker 3>It's about grievances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the politics of grievance.</v>

425
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.573
<v Speaker 3>So they feel aggrieved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore they feel justified in trying </v>

426
00:23:55.881 --> 00:23:56.714
<v Speaker 3>to disrupt power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They see that exists and declined power </v>

427
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:01.430
<v Speaker 3>for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's social revenge.</v>

428
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.630
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're animus is.</v>

429
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.840
<v Speaker 3>That's their moral justification for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for continuing to fragment and to chase.</v>

430
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.150
<v Speaker 3>The very thing they say is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

431
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.390
<v Speaker 3>the great corruptor of man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has power.</v>

432
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't,</v>

433
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.500
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't really matter if this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

434
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.440
<v Speaker 2>and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some sympathy with that claim.</v>

435
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.873
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical incoherencies within the </v>

436
00:24:28.061 --> 00:24:28.894
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the intellectual structure at </v>

437
00:24:30.491 --> 00:24:31.324
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What matters is that there's an animus </v>

438
00:24:34.121 --> 00:24:34.954
<v Speaker 2>and a motive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the motive is fundamentally </v>

439
00:24:36.071 --> 00:24:38.030
<v Speaker 2>something approximating revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

440
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Why would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

441
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.550
<v Speaker 2>why would you say revenge and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice?</v>

442
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.951
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

443
00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:44.590
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this goes to another issue,</v>

444
00:24:44.591 --> 00:24:48.070
<v Speaker 2>which is all the Asley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all three of you oppose this movement.</v>

445
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:49.933
<v Speaker 2>And we've already decided in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion that it's something like the </v>

446
00:24:53.611 --> 00:24:57.690
<v Speaker 2>revenge of the mar marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the marginalized could well object.</v>

447
00:24:57.691 --> 00:24:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't revenge.</v>

448
00:24:58.921 --> 00:24:59.754
<v Speaker 2>You only see it that way because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the privileged power group and </v>

449
00:25:02.851 --> 00:25:07.080
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a search or a search for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a search.</v>

450
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.943
<v Speaker 2>It's genuine search for justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice orientated that that's </v>

451
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:14.880
<v Speaker 2>what we have to remember.</v>

452
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.170
<v Speaker 2>This is speaking on behalf of women and </v>
<v Speaker 2>racial and sexual minorities.</v>

453
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Most members of every group did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not ascribe to it.</v>

454
00:25:23.101 --> 00:25:24.660
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're politically diverse.</v>

455
00:25:24.661 --> 00:25:25.494
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

456
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.760
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

457
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:29.603
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the reasons that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the claim for the pursuit of </v>

458
00:25:32.311 --> 00:25:36.480
<v Speaker 2>justice is invalidated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that there's no evidence whatsoever</v>

459
00:25:36.481 --> 00:25:37.314
<v Speaker 2>that the activist types who dominate </v>
<v Speaker 2>these disciplines are valid </v>

460
00:25:39.841 --> 00:25:43.830
<v Speaker 2>representatives of the communities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they purport to Stanford.</v>

461
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:44.883
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you surveyed the communities </v>

462
00:25:46.681 --> 00:25:51.390
<v Speaker 2>themselves in any reasonable manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the communities indicate their lack</v>

463
00:25:51.391 --> 00:25:54.330
<v Speaker 2>of agreement with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this way of looking at the world.</v>

464
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

465
00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.640
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is also the,</v>

466
00:25:58.641 --> 00:25:59.474
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the complicating element that nearly </v>

467
00:26:00.271 --> 00:26:01.104
<v Speaker 3>always appears that you do have kernels </v>
<v Speaker 3>of truth on both sides of that </v>

468
00:26:03.811 --> 00:26:04.644
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are legitimate questions of </v>

469
00:26:06.121 --> 00:26:07.800
<v Speaker 3>justice that are being tied up into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

470
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.143
<v Speaker 3>And then there are legitimate reasons to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see it as being motivated primarily by </v>

471
00:26:13.291 --> 00:26:14.124
<v Speaker 3>something approximating revenge or </v>
<v Speaker 3>grievance or reparations or something </v>

472
00:26:17.161 --> 00:26:19.680
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they get intertwined.</v>

473
00:26:19.681 --> 00:26:20.514
<v Speaker 3>And as you were mentioning with anytime </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're working with postmodern </v>

474
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.590
<v Speaker 3>epistemologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason to expect consistency.</v>

475
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.130
<v Speaker 3>They reject consistency as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

476
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.260
<v Speaker 3>as a bug in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

477
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.020
<v Speaker 3>they're unrepentant that unrepentant </v>
<v Speaker 3>about being inconsistent.</v>

478
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:36.830
<v Speaker 2>That's no small point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

479
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:41.140
<v Speaker 2>and I think people watching that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that point needs to be punched hole.</v>

480
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 2>So Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you speak to a little about that?</v>

481
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.091
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

482
00:26:45.091 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

483
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:50.460
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you would be consistent is</v>

484
00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.830
<v Speaker 3>one of the ideas that would be caught up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the western philosophical tradition,</v>

485
00:26:54.831 --> 00:26:55.664
<v Speaker 3>as they would phrase it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's caught up in the exact tradition </v>

486
00:26:58.671 --> 00:26:59.504
<v Speaker 3>that was bred of white and male power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that needs to be disrupted </v>

487
00:27:04.311 --> 00:27:08.540
<v Speaker 3>because that power inherently from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective of this Worldview,</v>

488
00:27:08.541 --> 00:27:09.374
<v Speaker 3>that power inherently corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly in inherently </v>

489
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.440
<v Speaker 3>always asked to preserve and maintain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and legitimize itself.</v>

490
00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.573
<v Speaker 3>So the demand for consistency becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself an act of oppression against </v>

491
00:27:20.961 --> 00:27:21.794
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

492
00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That all seems reasonable to me.</v>

493
00:27:24.451 --> 00:27:25.290
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so look,</v>

494
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:26.124
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's a peculiar thing and it's an </v>

495
00:27:29.041 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 2>observation of something approximating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's Friday,</v>

496
00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:33.294
<v Speaker 2>a notion of projection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who are pushing this </v>

497
00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:40.770
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

498
00:27:40.771 --> 00:27:41.604
<v Speaker 2>legitimate representatives of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities in any real sense of the </v>

499
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:44.964
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they push a particular viewpoint </v>

500
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 2>that has very little academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>credibility as far as I'm concerned.</v>

501
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:50.904
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is primarily concerned with </v>

502
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:52.703
<v Speaker 2>political activism and with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>obtaining or the justification of </v>

503
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.383
<v Speaker 2>obtaining power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we could assume that this is being </v>

504
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 2>done on behalf of the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting forward the doctrine.</v>

505
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 2>And so to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

506
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.090
<v Speaker 2>I've come to understand that part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason that people claim to their belief</v>

507
00:28:09.091 --> 00:28:14.091
<v Speaker 2>systems is because they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason they have the moral authority</v>

508
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.033
<v Speaker 2>to occupy the hierarchical position that</v>
<v Speaker 2>society has granted them is because </v>

509
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:24.570
<v Speaker 2>they're regarded as experts in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a belief structure.</v>

510
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.273
<v Speaker 2>And if the year that their claim to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>expertise is questioned in their moral </v>

511
00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:31.314
<v Speaker 2>justification for occupying their </v>
<v Speaker 2>position is eradicate it and it's their </v>

512
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:36.714
<v Speaker 2>position gives them purpose in life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that protects them from uncertainty and </v>

513
00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:42.720
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the belief structure itself.</v>

514
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:43.554
<v Speaker 2>You see it's for factor there experts in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the belief system and that justifies </v>

515
00:28:47.371 --> 00:28:48.204
<v Speaker 2>their position in the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they put forward this claim to </v>

516
00:28:50.551 --> 00:28:55.200
<v Speaker 2>continue justifying the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupied very perversely.</v>

517
00:28:55.201 --> 00:28:57.930
<v Speaker 2>And this is the fruit of the projection </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so very perversely,</v>

518
00:28:57.931 --> 00:29:02.070
<v Speaker 2>the very positions of power whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence a credit sucks.</v>

519
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.933
<v Speaker 2>This would be a university professor </v>
<v Speaker 2>types in particular that seems </v>

520
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:09.600
<v Speaker 2>reasonable to you or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is there something wrong with that?</v>

521
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the courts actually with what I've drawn</v>

522
00:29:12.111 --> 00:29:15.810
<v Speaker 3>from reading John Height for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who talks about psychosocial,</v>

523
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.763
<v Speaker 3>a psycho social evaluation and the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that human beings do that with one </v>

524
00:29:20.481 --> 00:29:21.314
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How we identify where we stand in our </v>

525
00:29:23.331 --> 00:29:25.360
<v Speaker 3>social and moral hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

526
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.593
<v Speaker 3>and how we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we position ourselves and others </v>

527
00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:29.743
<v Speaker 3>each other in relation to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that one of those three dimensions </v>

528
00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:33.404
<v Speaker 3>he named divinity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that would be the part you're </v>

529
00:29:36.381 --> 00:29:37.730
<v Speaker 3>speaking to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we gain,</v>

530
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.260
<v Speaker 3>we gained status in the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>through our closeness of kin.</v>

531
00:29:41.261 --> 00:29:42.094
<v Speaker 3>So if you and I are friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you rank me higher than I probably </v>

532
00:29:44.471 --> 00:29:45.304
<v Speaker 3>deserve because that's how humans do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we gain status by reputation and </v>

533
00:29:48.731 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 3>that's why we care what Michael Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinks about politics.</v>

534
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 3>And we gain status by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

535
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.903
<v Speaker 3>our moral standing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what John Height called </v>

536
00:29:56.651 --> 00:29:57.484
<v Speaker 3>divinity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course he explored it primarily </v>

537
00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Speaker 3>in the happiness hypothesis with regard </v>
<v Speaker 3>to his trips,</v>

538
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:02.434
<v Speaker 3>I think the India and seeing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional religion and then comparing </v>

539
00:30:05.231 --> 00:30:10.210
<v Speaker 3>that directly against the so called </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird societies in Western democracies.</v>

540
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:11.550
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

541
00:30:11.551 --> 00:30:12.384
<v Speaker 3>I think that what we're actually seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of these cases as we're seeing </v>

542
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:19.110
<v Speaker 3>partly at least people are acting out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

543
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.343
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what often gets conflated with religion </v>

544
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:22.294
<v Speaker 3>in fact is that they're acting out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to fulfill or participate in that </v>

545
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:31.150
<v Speaker 3>third dimension of psychosocial </v>
<v Speaker 3>evaluation.</v>

546
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Although in secular societies we throw </v>
<v Speaker 3>out the,</v>

547
00:30:34.241 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 3>the explicit religious structure for it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we have to find it in other ways.</v>

548
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 3>So that's what you're actually talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

549
00:30:39.911 --> 00:30:41.310
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they occupy a Mo,</v>

550
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.203
<v Speaker 3>a moral expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not more likes for TC gives them </v>

551
00:30:44.171 --> 00:30:47.770
<v Speaker 3>standing within the prevailing moral and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Social Maloo.</v>

552
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:48.873
<v Speaker 3>And then that defines their place in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>community as in both in terms of </v>

553
00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:53.440
<v Speaker 3>prestige and in terms of hierarchy</v>

554
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.443
<v Speaker 2>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're basically acting out precisely </v>

555
00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:58.630
<v Speaker 2>what they're accusing all other </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines of doing</v>

556
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.590
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irony and the differences to see.</v>

557
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.530
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference as far as I'm concerned,</v>

558
00:31:04.531 --> 00:31:07.630
<v Speaker 2>is that if you look at a discipline like</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering,</v>

559
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.950
<v Speaker 2>which I think is perhaps as close to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>polar opposite of this,</v>

560
00:31:10.951 --> 00:31:11.784
<v Speaker 2>this might be managed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that engineers do is </v>

561
00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:15.603
<v Speaker 2>look at the world in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But another thing they do is build </v>

562
00:31:17.971 --> 00:31:20.000
<v Speaker 2>bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>

563
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:24.010
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an objective real world,</v>

564
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction to their,</v>

565
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:27.543
<v Speaker 2>to their philosophizing and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs that results in something of </v>

566
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:31.204
<v Speaker 2>tangible and university recognize </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit to the community at March and </v>

567
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.310
<v Speaker 2>something that can fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

568
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:38.201
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

569
00:31:38.201 --> 00:31:38.860
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

570
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 2>that's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

571
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

572
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.260
<v Speaker 2>next issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the first issue,</v>

573
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.493
<v Speaker 2>first of the next two issues saying is </v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it that you three found herself </v>

574
00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:55.000
<v Speaker 2>in a position where you decided to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>this on as a critical project and why is</v>

575
00:31:55.001 --> 00:31:58.000
<v Speaker 2>it that so few other academics are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

576
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:04.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't have good answers for why so few</v>
<v Speaker 2>academics are doing so.</v>

577
00:32:04.061 --> 00:32:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Cause I don't want to just blatantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>call people cowards that I don't know.</v>

578
00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:10.470
<v Speaker 2>But you don't get treated well for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

579
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Let's dig into that a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

580
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think cowardice is one or fear.</v>

581
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.120
<v Speaker 2>And let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's start here.</v>

582
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.423
<v Speaker 2>Let's call it fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's also note that the fear is </v>

583
00:32:20.411 --> 00:32:21.970
<v Speaker 2>well justified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very justice.</v>

584
00:32:21.971 --> 00:32:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's correct.</v>

585
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.251
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Peter,</v>

586
00:32:24.251 --> 00:32:25.084
<v Speaker 2>you're in a great position to speak to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because look what's happening to </v>

587
00:32:27.071 --> 00:32:27.904
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

588
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.003
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know if you want to go down </v>

589
00:32:30.911 --> 00:32:32.890
<v Speaker 4>the path and what's happened to me yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

590
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.530
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our mutual friend,</v>

591
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.423
<v Speaker 4>Bret Weinstein said to me that academia </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we had a conversation about </v>

592
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:40.544
<v Speaker 4>academia self selecting for cowardice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's a process that people </v>

593
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 4>go through it before they have tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're afraid to buck the system,</v>

594
00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:48.524
<v Speaker 4>afraid to challenge ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're afraid to question because who </v>

595
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 4>they won't get tenure and then once they</v>
<v Speaker 4>do get tenure,</v>

596
00:32:54.171 --> 00:32:55.920
<v Speaker 4>then they won't make you a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 4>climate.</v>

597
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:56.773
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

598
00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:57.873
<v Speaker 2>That's the same thing happens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations at the middle manager </v>

599
00:33:00.131 --> 00:33:00.964
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not a disease that is endemic </v>

600
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.640
<v Speaker 2>to academia.</v>

601
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.331
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

602
00:33:04.331 --> 00:33:05.164
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's one variable in a suite of </v>

603
00:33:06.881 --> 00:33:08.740
<v Speaker 4>variables that we have to take a look </v>
<v Speaker 4>at.</v>

604
00:33:08.741 --> 00:33:12.760
<v Speaker 4>The other one is the culture in which </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cultural milieu that Jim spoke about</v>

605
00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.210
<v Speaker 4>in which people are terrified to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>called sexist,</v>

606
00:33:16.211 --> 00:33:17.080
<v Speaker 4>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bigot.</v>

607
00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:21.580
<v Speaker 4>So they don't challenge those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm even hesitant to say the things that</v>

608
00:33:21.581 --> 00:33:22.414
<v Speaker 4>don't challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll say it like race and Iq or </v>

609
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.520
<v Speaker 4>trans issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trans bathroom issues.</v>

610
00:33:27.521 --> 00:33:28.354
<v Speaker 4>If you teach an ethics class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people won't really dig into those </v>

611
00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:34.990
<v Speaker 4>issues in a substantive way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that there are many factors,</v>

612
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.403
<v Speaker 4>but not just one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just showing that people will </v>

613
00:33:37.871 --> 00:33:38.704
<v Speaker 4>come up to Jim and myself and I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>spoken explicitly to Helen about this </v>

614
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.030
<v Speaker 4>and they'll thank me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

615
00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.650
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you so much.</v>

616
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:45.191
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

617
00:33:45.191 --> 00:33:46.500
<v Speaker 4>Can you do that publicly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

618
00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:47.383
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

619
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:47.661
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

620
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:48.180
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

621
00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.013
<v Speaker 2>The same thing happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should talk about what's </v>

622
00:33:51.791 --> 00:33:55.060
<v Speaker 2>happening to you because we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

623
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.433
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about cowardice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about justifiable cause </v>

624
00:33:58.810 --> 00:33:59.643
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no pleasure in being isolated </v>

625
00:34:01.601 --> 00:34:04.870
<v Speaker 2>and moms and undermine and fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

626
00:34:04.871 --> 00:34:08.320
<v Speaker 2>So the apprehension of that is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>merely coward,</v>

627
00:34:08.321 --> 00:34:08.661
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

628
00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:09.760
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's realistic.</v>

629
00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.900
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not underestimating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential role,</v>

630
00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:13.893
<v Speaker 2>the additional role of cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's another issue too here </v>

631
00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:17.440
<v Speaker 2>and I'd be thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

632
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:18.933
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of these postmodern activist </v>

633
00:34:21.311 --> 00:34:22.144
<v Speaker 2>propositions are so fundamentally absurd</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so academically weak that most </v>

634
00:34:27.581 --> 00:34:32.470
<v Speaker 2>serious social scientists and pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>much all serious stem types,</v>

635
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.050
<v Speaker 2>the stem researchers have just ignored </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

636
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.760
<v Speaker 2>They thought they were beneath contempt </v>
<v Speaker 2>and right</v>

637
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.810
<v Speaker 2>seriously mean that because I look at an</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>

638
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a brilliant postmodern activist idea </v>

639
00:34:49.601 --> 00:34:50.434
<v Speaker 2>like intersectionality where like </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy theory or like white </v>

640
00:34:52.511 --> 00:34:53.344
<v Speaker 2>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is spend an hour </v>

641
00:34:55.361 --> 00:34:56.194
<v Speaker 2>thinking through those things critically</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you realize that there's out </v>

642
00:34:58.331 --> 00:35:01.930
<v Speaker 2>solutely nothing whatsoever to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>methodologically or conceptually</v>

643
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.363
<v Speaker 5>as jen was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that that can be a kernel of </v>

644
00:35:07.981 --> 00:35:10.680
<v Speaker 5>Chris in things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when they are theoretically built,</v>

645
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

646
00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:14.643
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are societies in which white </v>

647
00:35:16.291 --> 00:35:19.170
<v Speaker 5>people are regarded more positively on </v>
<v Speaker 5>average,</v>

648
00:35:19.171 --> 00:35:20.004
<v Speaker 5>but this is something that can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>measured in three which can be looked </v>

649
00:35:22.651 --> 00:35:23.790
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which can be talked about.</v>

650
00:35:23.791 --> 00:35:24.624
<v Speaker 5>And we don't actually have that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have imaginary knapsacks and talk of </v>

651
00:35:28.891 --> 00:35:29.724
<v Speaker 5>complicity and I'm an epistemological </v>
<v Speaker 5>environments in which white people </v>

652
00:35:34.681 --> 00:35:36.360
<v Speaker 5>literally can't understand what's going </v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

653
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.280
<v Speaker 5>So we it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we get a big mess</v>

654
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.780
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

655
00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.693
<v Speaker 2>there's a kernel of truth in that and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gives them the opportunity to kind </v>

656
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:45.780
<v Speaker 2>of retreat to this sensible space where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>

657
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:48.520
<v Speaker 2>but there is racism and that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism.</v>

658
00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes of course there is.</v>

659
00:35:49.501 --> 00:35:53.160
<v Speaker 2>But what you're doing here with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretical concepts is,</v>

660
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:57.420
<v Speaker 2>is not looking realistically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably at that</v>

661
00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:01.480
<v Speaker 2>adoption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

662
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:02.663
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay well racism is a problem in sexism </v>

663
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:05.184
<v Speaker 2>is a problem we'll say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And any form of discrimination that </v>

664
00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 2>isn't associated with the hypothetical </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome of the project is a problem.</v>

665
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.970
<v Speaker 2>But there are methods that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a decent social scientist knows to</v>

666
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:18.804
<v Speaker 2>measure those and to estimate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportion of the variance in the </v>

667
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.440
<v Speaker 2>outcome problem that those issues are </v>
<v Speaker 2>accounting for.</v>

668
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.410
<v Speaker 2>And the postmodern and activist types to</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely none of that.</v>

669
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean why would they?</v>

670
00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.730
<v Speaker 4>Because they don't care about their </v>
<v Speaker 4>agenda driven in their truth oriented.</v>

671
00:36:37.731 --> 00:36:41.150
<v Speaker 4>So there's going to be no point to even </v>
<v Speaker 4>think like that.</v>

672
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Well they also can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the methods training.</v>

673
00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:45.981
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

674
00:36:45.981 --> 00:36:46.814
<v Speaker 2>so that also provides additional impetus</v>
<v Speaker 2>for being motivated to criticize those </v>

675
00:36:50.381 --> 00:36:52.210
<v Speaker 2>that do because it's a lot easier than </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

676
00:36:52.211 --> 00:36:54.940
<v Speaker 2>seeing the reality and the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your own ignorance.</v>

677
00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:57.423
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about what's happening to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I want to know about the cost </v>

678
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:03.040
<v Speaker 2>that you're buried for this and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go back to why you guys decided to</v>

679
00:37:03.041 --> 00:37:03.874
<v Speaker 2>do what you did.</v>

680
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.760
<v Speaker 4>So psu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like many college campuses has become an</v>

681
00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:09.594
<v Speaker 4>ideological community and I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrated that I don't fit that mold </v>

682
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.620
<v Speaker 4>and I suspect that they're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>to great lengths to get rid of me.</v>

683
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 4>So what's happened is I've been found </v>
<v Speaker 4>guilty of Nazi he and Irb approval.</v>

684
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.750
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

685
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:26.670
<v Speaker 2>can you tell the viewers what that means</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and provide some background detail.</v>

686
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.460
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

687
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.563
<v Speaker 4>So our be approval is there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's to call the IRB Institutional </v>

688
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Review Board.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And whenever you do a,</v>

689
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.730
<v Speaker 4>an experiment on human subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings or animals,</v>

690
00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:43.923
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to go through the irb and you </v>

691
00:37:46.121 --> 00:37:46.954
<v Speaker 4>need to get permission and you detail </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what it is that you're going to </v>

692
00:37:49.631 --> 00:37:51.190
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they say to you,</v>

693
00:37:51.191 --> 00:37:52.720
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to change this.</v>

694
00:37:52.721 --> 00:37:54.190
<v Speaker 4>You have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do this,</v>

695
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.320
<v Speaker 4>etc. And then they give you permission.</v>

696
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These systems,</v>

697
00:37:58.201 --> 00:37:59.034
<v Speaker 2>just a little more background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these systems were originally set up </v>

698
00:38:00.721 --> 00:38:01.554
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally to monitor relatively or </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially dangerous medical </v>

699
00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:06.564
<v Speaker 2>experimentation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've expanded their per view so </v>

700
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:09.804
<v Speaker 2>that now it's impossible for anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's an academic in any institution to </v>

701
00:38:13.411 --> 00:38:14.244
<v Speaker 2>even interview people without seeking </v>
<v Speaker 2>permission from a very vast and rigid </v>

702
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.710
<v Speaker 2>bureaucratic structure that's easily </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicized.</v>

703
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:24.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They came out of,</v>

704
00:38:24.561 --> 00:38:28.010
<v Speaker 4>and they do exist for good reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Nuremberg trials may lay,</v>

705
00:38:28.011 --> 00:38:28.731
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

706
00:38:28.731 --> 00:38:32.180
<v Speaker 4>And people were in that envelope has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has,</v>

707
00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:33.163
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number of experiments or the number </v>

708
00:38:34.671 --> 00:38:35.504
<v Speaker 4>of things are calling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are under that umbrella continues to </v>

709
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:38.344
<v Speaker 4>increase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can talk about the ethics of the RV </v>

710
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.193
<v Speaker 4>more generally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in our case are particularly mind </v>

711
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:48.180
<v Speaker 4>that the IRB has no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim and James and Helen don't fall under</v>

712
00:38:48.231 --> 00:38:51.580
<v Speaker 4>the off season pses rv so they can't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>sanctioned.</v>

713
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.240
<v Speaker 4>I however,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allegedly can can be sanctioned,</v>

714
00:38:55.241 --> 00:38:58.570
<v Speaker 4>so I'd been found guilty on that first </v>
<v Speaker 4>charge,</v>

715
00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.833
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

716
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.490
<v Speaker 2>well now look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

717
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:05.120
<v Speaker 2>let's tell everybody what is published.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sequence of papers,</v>

718
00:39:05.121 --> 00:39:07.130
<v Speaker 2>how many papers in journals is it?</v>

719
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:12.000
<v Speaker 3>We wrote 27 of them were accepted and </v>
<v Speaker 3>four were published</v>

720
00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.900
<v Speaker 3>on the cusp of publication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

721
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get it straight here.</v>

722
00:39:19.351 --> 00:39:24.180
<v Speaker 2>These are satirical publications that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were published in hypothetically serious</v>

723
00:39:24.181 --> 00:39:25.014
<v Speaker 2>academic journals and now Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being gone after for not seeking </v>

724
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:33.740
<v Speaker 2>institutional review board permission to</v>
<v Speaker 2>publish studies that didn't exist.</v>

725
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:35.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

726
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:35.913
<v Speaker 4>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first thing I'd been found </v>

727
00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:38.014
<v Speaker 4>guilty of that and it's escalated to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>provost and the president of the </v>

728
00:39:41.591 --> 00:39:42.424
<v Speaker 4>university and I believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>provost is a former gender studies </v>

729
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 4>scholar and I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll let that sit there.</v>

730
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:50.950
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

731
00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:54.340
<v Speaker 4>I can't pronounce the president's name </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be blunt with you.</v>

732
00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.730
<v Speaker 4>And the provost is new provost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not avoiding the question.</v>

733
00:39:57.731 --> 00:39:58.520
<v Speaker 4>I just don't,</v>

734
00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.353
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can always put that in the </v>

735
00:40:00.061 --> 00:40:01.950
<v Speaker 2>description of the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

736
00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.580
<v Speaker 2>so what are you guilty of exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because these studies didn't exist.</v>

737
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.760
<v Speaker 2>You didn't undertake research on any </v>
<v Speaker 2>human subjects.</v>

738
00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:10.733
<v Speaker 3>They've decided that the journal editors</v>
<v Speaker 3>and peer reviewers are the human </v>

739
00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:17.410
<v Speaker 3>subjects that we were studying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not the studies themselves,</v>

740
00:40:17.411 --> 00:40:22.411
<v Speaker 3>but go up one level of Metta to the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we were studying the culture of um,</v>

741
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Journal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Journal Review and publication.</v>

742
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.863
<v Speaker 3>So the editors who are not anonymous and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the anonymous peer reviewers are </v>

743
00:40:31.771 --> 00:40:33.720
<v Speaker 3>considered to be the human subjects of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

744
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.420
<v Speaker 2>that's supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>

745
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:37.430
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's supposed to be distinguishable</v>

746
00:40:37.431 --> 00:40:38.264
<v Speaker 2>from you thinking and writing about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you encounter in your own </v>

747
00:40:40.851 --> 00:40:41.810
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

748
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:45.080
<v Speaker 2>which is also what now it's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be subject to irb approval.</v>

749
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.150
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so okay.</v>

750
00:40:49.151 --> 00:40:50.740
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of moving parts to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

751
00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:52.870
<v Speaker 4>So we need to break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder,</v>

752
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.660
<v Speaker 4>I want to continue with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

753
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.333
<v Speaker 4>guilty of not seeking irb approval.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can include turn up to termination </v>

754
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:05.530
<v Speaker 4>from my current position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

755
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.430
<v Speaker 4>I just want to speak to that before I </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about the data fabrication charges.</v>

756
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.413
<v Speaker 4>So I don't agree with the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I definitely understand the </v>

757
00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:16.450
<v Speaker 4>pressures that they have on them to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

758
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:18.370
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what's happening.</v>

759
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:19.743
<v Speaker 2>Pressures from a hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These activist types are a very tiny </v>

760
00:41:22.361 --> 00:41:24.360
<v Speaker 2>proportion of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

761
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.920
<v Speaker 2>and when we're talking about pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly do we mean?</v>

762
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:28.773
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was an anonymous hid piece by 12 </v>

763
00:41:30.851 --> 00:41:33.690
<v Speaker 4>or 11 of my colleagues published in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>student newspaper,</v>

764
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 4>the Portland Vanguard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they may be a small representation.</v>

765
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's unclear to me in academia,</v>

766
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:43.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there are a small </v>
<v Speaker 4>proportion of the pie.</v>

767
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.373
<v Speaker 4>They are a large and I think that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wield institutionalized power and have </v>

768
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:53.060
<v Speaker 4>weaponized things like title line </v>
<v Speaker 4>against people they don't like.</v>

769
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.250
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's that.</v>

770
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.103
<v Speaker 4>But I do want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know what's happening </v>

771
00:41:58.761 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 4>behind the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

772
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.710
<v Speaker 4>my guess is these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this group is extraordinarily vocal,</v>

773
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.053
<v Speaker 4>but what they're faced with now is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>decision for what kind of university </v>

774
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:08.144
<v Speaker 4>they want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it one that uses power to support </v>

775
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:10.904
<v Speaker 4>freedom of inquiry and pursuit of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth or do they want to protect social </v>

776
00:42:13.851 --> 00:42:14.684
<v Speaker 4>justice at all costs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fabrication of data thing is </v>

777
00:42:18.351 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 4>interesting because that's an ongoing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's currently ongoing investigation.</v>

778
00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:24.320
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are very,</v>

779
00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:25.370
<v Speaker 4>very serious charges.</v>

780
00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at it here too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a very big difference.</v>

781
00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Let's get this very clear between a self</v>
<v Speaker 2>admitted satire,</v>

782
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.020
<v Speaker 2>which had historical precedent and which</v>
<v Speaker 2>has ethical justification,</v>

783
00:42:39.021 --> 00:42:39.854
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't agree with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>justification data fabrication data </v>

784
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:44.144
<v Speaker 2>fabrication occurs when you put Devin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you claim that it's truthful </v>

785
00:42:47.421 --> 00:42:50.720
<v Speaker 2>representation of a real world </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

786
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously that's distinct from satire </v>

787
00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:56.280
<v Speaker 2>and comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone understands that distinction.</v>

788
00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:57.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>

789
00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.193
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that those rules were put in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there for very good reasons and that is </v>

790
00:43:04.231 --> 00:43:06.750
<v Speaker 4>people wouldn't use that to advance </v>
<v Speaker 4>their careers,</v>

791
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.870
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

792
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.040
<v Speaker 4>and they wanted to hide the results so </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

793
00:43:11.041 --> 00:43:11.874
<v Speaker 4>didn't want anybody to see what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the problem with that is that it </v>

794
00:43:15.361 --> 00:43:16.470
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as socal wrote,</v>

795
00:43:16.471 --> 00:43:19.340
<v Speaker 4>that it would contaminate the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

796
00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.193
<v Speaker 4>research lines in perpetuity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what the success of our project </v>

797
00:43:24.401 --> 00:43:25.234
<v Speaker 4>dependent upon it being revealed so that</v>
<v Speaker 4>no longer applies and the idea that we </v>

798
00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:33.330
<v Speaker 4>would somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only am I not benefited from this,</v>

799
00:43:33.331 --> 00:43:35.520
<v Speaker 4>but this is coming a tremendous cost to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

800
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.800
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

801
00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.450
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>

802
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.413
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a grow task abuse of what it means to </v>

803
00:43:44.771 --> 00:43:47.110
<v Speaker 4>fabricate data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

804
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it means be interesting to see.</v>

805
00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.013
<v Speaker 4>It'll be interesting to see what happens</v>
<v Speaker 4>and be in as you see when it goes to </v>

806
00:43:51.641 --> 00:43:52.210
<v Speaker 4>court.</v>

807
00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

808
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:53.663
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me about the proceedings when it </v>

809
00:43:56.501 --> 00:43:59.470
<v Speaker 2>goes to court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of card is it going to?</v>

810
00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

811
00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.570
<v Speaker 4>first let me even take a step back from </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

812
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:08.500
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at the timeline of events</v>
<v Speaker 4>when this occurred,</v>

813
00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.480
<v Speaker 4>and I don't have that off the top of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>

814
00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:11.680
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

815
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:12.790
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

816
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.490
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was falling guilty from the Irb,</v>

817
00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.090
<v Speaker 4>it's been a series of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

818
00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.060
<v Speaker 4>of Nazi need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>irb approval.</v>

819
00:44:19.061 --> 00:44:24.010
<v Speaker 4>There was a series of a time when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>university president could just end this</v>

820
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.170
<v Speaker 4>just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can say,</v>

821
00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.760
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to put a,</v>

822
00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.820
<v Speaker 4>a letter of reprimand in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

823
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:36.060
<v Speaker 4>we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it and it will</v>

824
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 3>guilty of who found you guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the IRB was December 14th.</v>

825
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.753
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the IRB is policing its own it's own </v>

826
00:44:48.491 --> 00:44:50.260
<v Speaker 3>policies here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

827
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:55.150
<v Speaker 3>So that was for the irb charge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the open data falsification charges open</v>

828
00:44:55.151 --> 00:44:56.660
<v Speaker 3>and still being investigated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

829
00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.160
<v Speaker 3>and that actually started I think like </v>
<v Speaker 3>two or three days after we went public.</v>

830
00:45:00.161 --> 00:45:02.290
<v Speaker 3>He got an email and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been summoned to a meeting.</v>

831
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.260
<v Speaker 3>And we were all in Portland together at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time in October.</v>

832
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.293
<v Speaker 3>The IRB,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which purports to be an ethics </v>

833
00:45:07.751 --> 00:45:09.760
<v Speaker 3>committee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have any problem with the ethics</v>

834
00:45:09.761 --> 00:45:10.594
<v Speaker 3>of policing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might want to point that out very </v>

835
00:45:16.001 --> 00:45:16.834
<v Speaker 3>strongly because they're not in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>position to be policing accordance with </v>

836
00:45:19.751 --> 00:45:22.450
<v Speaker 3>their own policies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conflict of interest.</v>

837
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Clearly there's something appalling </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

838
00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.013
<v Speaker 3>And it's not surprising because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>plenty of hauling about the </v>

839
00:45:27.581 --> 00:45:28.810
<v Speaker 3>institutional review boards.</v>

840
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.620
<v Speaker 4>Guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guilty.</v>

841
00:45:34.621 --> 00:45:36.630
<v Speaker 4>It's been escalated to the president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

842
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:40.110
<v Speaker 4>the president could just decide just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

843
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.963
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just going to put a letter in his </v>

844
00:45:41.791 --> 00:45:43.560
<v Speaker 4>file of reprimand and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>move on.</v>

845
00:45:43.561 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 4>And I think that the whole problem would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

846
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ended,</v>

847
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:51.990
<v Speaker 4>except my guess is that there are a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of people crying for vengeance right now</v>

848
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:52.824
<v Speaker 4>against me.</v>

849
00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:53.883
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they want to hang you out to dry as </v>

850
00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:55.814
<v Speaker 3>an object lesson to people who would </v>
<v Speaker 3>dare to do the things that you three </v>

851
00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.050
<v Speaker 3>have done.</v>

852
00:45:59.050 --> 00:45:59.883
<v Speaker 4>Because I'm a heretic and I'm a blast </v>
<v Speaker 4>femur and I have attack their cannons </v>

853
00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.180
<v Speaker 4>and there has to be some price that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>paid for this.</v>

854
00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:10.780
<v Speaker 4>That's my guests when they're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the fabrication of data charge,</v>

855
00:46:10.781 --> 00:46:11.614
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a very serious charge of okay </v>

856
00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:18.220
<v Speaker 4>data and those rules are put in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put in place for a reason.</v>

857
00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:19.653
<v Speaker 4>I don't think a court would find,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it would be interesting to see </v>

858
00:46:23.621 --> 00:46:25.690
<v Speaker 4>when this goes to quarter or if it does </v>
<v Speaker 4>even go to court.</v>

859
00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.333
<v Speaker 4>The idea that this was fabricated either</v>
<v Speaker 4>for personal gain or that would have to </v>

860
00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:32.254
<v Speaker 4>not be revealed at some time and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the future lines of literature would be </v>

861
00:46:35.951 --> 00:46:37.780
<v Speaker 4>contaminated and polluted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

862
00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.110
<v Speaker 4>it's just not true and I think that,</v>

863
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 3>well also a clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a career ended in charge,</v>

864
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 3>so that's partly why it's being brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>against you,</v>

865
00:46:46.231 --> 00:46:47.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Data fabrication,</v>

866
00:46:47.401 --> 00:46:48.810
<v Speaker 3>there isn't anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

867
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.050
<v Speaker 3>there isn't any same thing worse within </v>
<v Speaker 3>the domain of science,</v>

868
00:46:52.051 --> 00:46:53.550
<v Speaker 3>then you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do that.</v>

869
00:46:53.551 --> 00:46:54.384
<v Speaker 3>That</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really unfortunate and </v>

870
00:46:57.001 --> 00:46:57.834
<v Speaker 3>preposterous because the data </v>
<v Speaker 3>fabrication occurred intentionally in </v>

871
00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:04.080
<v Speaker 3>the sense that we wanted to find out if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they could detect,</v>

872
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:05.183
<v Speaker 3>because we suspected from the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning as we were kind of discussing </v>

873
00:47:07.801 --> 00:47:08.634
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these people who largely work in </v>

874
00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.480
<v Speaker 3>the humanities are not equipped to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>social science,</v>

875
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.700
<v Speaker 3>but that's ultimately what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically doing.</v>

876
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:15.953
<v Speaker 3>And so we wanted to see if they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>detect utterly ridiculous data or data </v>

877
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:23.940
<v Speaker 3>that were clearly cherry picked or data </v>
<v Speaker 3>or conclusions I should say,</v>

878
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:25.740
<v Speaker 3>that were drawn from data that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>warranted.</v>

879
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.920
<v Speaker 3>And so we wrote papers that included,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this case,</v>

880
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.450
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dog park paper,</v>

881
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:34.540
<v Speaker 3>just transparently ridiculous data.</v>

882
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first draft of that paper,</v>

883
00:47:36.431 --> 00:47:37.264
<v Speaker 3>even we knew the data were so bad that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were probably going to ask to see </v>

884
00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:42.910
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We thought that's the end of the road,</v>

885
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.440
<v Speaker 3>the papers then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll talk about the dog park paper.</v>

886
00:47:47.441 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you go through the papers that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been published just briefly</v>

887
00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:57.520
<v Speaker 3>and tell us why they're transparently </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous because that's also tension,</v>

888
00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:00.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

889
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dog park paper,</v>

890
00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:02.903
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the first one we had accepted in </v>

891
00:48:05.471 --> 00:48:09.770
<v Speaker 3>February.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it chronicles a,</v>

892
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.673
<v Speaker 3>it's a feminist scholar putatively </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's chronicling dog rape culture by </v>

893
00:48:14.861 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 3>examining dog humping in Portland dog </v>
<v Speaker 3>parks.</v>

894
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.210
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

895
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.463
<v Speaker 3>then draws conclusions from that using </v>
<v Speaker 3>black feminist criminology as a tool to </v>

896
00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:26.494
<v Speaker 3>conclude that it would be appropriate to</v>
<v Speaker 3>train men as we train dogs if only it </v>

897
00:48:29.951 --> 00:48:30.784
<v Speaker 3>were politically feasible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have to come up with a </v>

898
00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:32.960
<v Speaker 3>metaphorical equivalent.</v>

899
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:38.340
<v Speaker 3>And that concludes that oppression of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dogs based on perceived gender is real.</v>

900
00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:43.690
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that that was allegedly </v>
<v Speaker 3>concluded was we claimed that,</v>

901
00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans intervened in,</v>

902
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:50.950
<v Speaker 3>broke up a gay dog rate much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently in vigorously,</v>

903
00:48:50.951 --> 00:48:55.300
<v Speaker 3>then they broke up straight dog rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the paper,</v>

904
00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's already a bit weird about </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>

905
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.080
<v Speaker 3>The paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the paper included,</v>

906
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:02.943
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the detail that the scholar sat in the </v>

907
00:49:05.711 --> 00:49:08.920
<v Speaker 3>dog park for a thousand hours over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>course of a year,</v>

908
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:12.730
<v Speaker 3>but never in the heavy rain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>observed,</v>

909
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.863
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then examined personally closely </v>

910
00:49:15.491 --> 00:49:19.480
<v Speaker 3>examined the genitals of just short of </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000 dogs,</v>

911
00:49:19.481 --> 00:49:23.140
<v Speaker 3>which if you've been to a dog park,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've probably realized the same people</v>

912
00:49:23.141 --> 00:49:25.660
<v Speaker 3>bring their dogs almost every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

913
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.660
<v Speaker 3>there's not 10,000 dogs in any dog park </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a year,</v>

914
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:33.661
<v Speaker 3>but never mind to develop a reputation </v>
<v Speaker 3>for looking at dogs genitals.</v>

915
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:35.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

916
00:49:35.231 --> 00:49:38.140
<v Speaker 3>And then immediately turning to ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>their owners,</v>

917
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:38.993
<v Speaker 3>excuse me sir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you tell me your sexual </v>

918
00:49:40.121 --> 00:49:42.640
<v Speaker 3>orientation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what the paper says.</v>

919
00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000 dogs,</v>

920
00:49:45.401 --> 00:49:46.234
<v Speaker 3>Jen Genitals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 10,000 dogs and then interrogated </v>

921
00:49:48.551 --> 00:49:50.550
<v Speaker 3>their owners as to their sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>orientations.</v>

922
00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.013
<v Speaker 3>It includes details that are irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like weather dogs use the bathroom and </v>

923
00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:59.830
<v Speaker 3>the other dogs are in the food bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The water bowl,</v>

924
00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.540
<v Speaker 3>it talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

925
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.790
<v Speaker 3>the way people would break up dog </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights,</v>

926
00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:04.624
<v Speaker 3>like doing jumping jacks and singing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We thought this data was so absurd that </v>

927
00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:09.424
<v Speaker 3>we put in the first draft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which the journal saw align that said </v>

928
00:50:12.731 --> 00:50:13.564
<v Speaker 3>that we took the data and put it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>recycle bin so that they couldn't </v>

929
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:19.270
<v Speaker 3>possibly ask us to produce it because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

930
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.740
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they asked for this data,</v>

931
00:50:20.741 --> 00:50:22.420
<v Speaker 3>which is so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's over.</v>

932
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 3>So we said that we recycled the data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has already its own research,</v>

933
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 3>ms practice and no problem.</v>

934
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Write it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

935
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe we're having this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation</v>

936
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.110
<v Speaker 3>and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more we talk about this,</v>

937
00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:37.830
<v Speaker 3>the more ridiculous it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

938
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.220
<v Speaker 3>so let's go on to another paper that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just on unbearable.</v>

939
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:48.370
<v Speaker 3>But there was the paper where we argued </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if straight white straight man,</v>

940
00:50:48.741 --> 00:50:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter what their racist,</v>

941
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.930
<v Speaker 3>if straight men were to ainslie </v>
<v Speaker 3>penetrate themselves with sex toys,</v>

942
00:50:53.931 --> 00:50:56.000
<v Speaker 3>they'd become less transphobic and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminist.</v>

943
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:58.123
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which apparently got picked up the </v>

944
00:50:59.671 --> 00:51:00.504
<v Speaker 3>slack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They may not want to have that </v>

945
00:51:01.941 --> 00:51:04.440
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this data was this,</v>

946
00:51:04.441 --> 00:51:07.940
<v Speaker 3>this conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was called a truly marvelous paper</v>

947
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 3>and an important contribution to </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge by one of its reviewers.</v>

948
00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this paper was published,</v>

949
00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 3>this paper was based on interviews with </v>
<v Speaker 3>13 men,</v>

950
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:19.273
<v Speaker 3>only eight of whom were straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course it was all interview data </v>

951
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 3>and it was just people saying the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous things about their experience</v>

952
00:51:28.851 --> 00:51:29.684
<v Speaker 3>of sticking things in their own butts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then their feelings about feminism </v>

953
00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:37.660
<v Speaker 3>and a concern for rape culture and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>attitudes about trans people and so on,</v>

954
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:40.543
<v Speaker 3>including one so-called social </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative who was quoted saying he </v>

955
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:44.324
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to take part in some stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal study about sticking things up </v>

956
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:48.140
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

957
00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.120
<v Speaker 3>it's almost impossible to have looked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and not thought,</v>

958
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:55.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's going on here.</v>

959
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:59.110
<v Speaker 3>But instead they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly marvelous paper knowledge.</v>

960
00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:01.610
<v Speaker 3>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a second paper.</v>

961
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.340
<v Speaker 3>A third paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

962
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:04.633
<v Speaker 3>was an ethnography allegedly of a 70 </v>
<v Speaker 3>some odd year old man who went to </v>

963
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:09.254
<v Speaker 3>hooters with his Brazilian Jujitsu class</v>
<v Speaker 3>after workouts and sat there and </v>

964
00:52:13.521 --> 00:52:14.354
<v Speaker 3>basically just womanized for hours upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours recorded something like 10,000 </v>

965
00:52:20.271 --> 00:52:21.104
<v Speaker 3>hours or sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000 minutes of conversation at the </v>

966
00:52:24.771 --> 00:52:26.930
<v Speaker 3>table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which could all be summarized.</v>

967
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.240
<v Speaker 3>And this was an example of clear cherry </v>
<v Speaker 3>picking of data.</v>

968
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:33.050
<v Speaker 3>The only features of the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were relevant were the way that the</v>

969
00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:35.570
<v Speaker 3>guys hit on the surfers are talked about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the servers,</v>

970
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:36.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>various body parts or most importantly </v>

971
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.823
<v Speaker 3>how much they enjoyed the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hooters provides them a place that they </v>

972
00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:43.244
<v Speaker 3>can go and tell young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive women what to do in a </v>

973
00:52:46.101 --> 00:52:46.934
<v Speaker 3>situation in which they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>contractually obligated to fulfill </v>

974
00:52:49.911 --> 00:52:51.350
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those orders.</v>

975
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Like literally double entendre on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>work order.</v>

976
00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Like please,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like some beer that's an order.</v>

977
00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:58.730
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

978
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:01.003
<v Speaker 3>that was an example of clear cherry </v>
<v Speaker 3>picking and of course deriving </v>

979
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:05.400
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

980
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:06.523
<v Speaker 3>did you guys know while you were doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this that you are going to get yourself </v>

981
00:53:09.501 --> 00:53:11.480
<v Speaker 3>in like a boatload of trouble?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

982
00:53:11.481 --> 00:53:13.180
<v Speaker 3>and now I see when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

983
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.740
<v Speaker 3>you laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you still got a sense of humor,</v>

984
00:53:15.741 --> 00:53:17.900
<v Speaker 3>which is quite a remarkable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

985
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.610
<v Speaker 3>you did this for a long time and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

986
00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.100
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to believe actually that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>did manage,</v>

987
00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.650
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have some,</v>

988
00:53:26.651 --> 00:53:28.650
<v Speaker 3>some moments especially where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

989
00:53:28.651 --> 00:53:29.484
<v Speaker 3>I mean we were always aware that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be a backlash and then when I </v>

990
00:53:32.121 --> 00:53:35.030
<v Speaker 3>started actually signing the transfer of</v>
<v Speaker 3>copyright,</v>

991
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.630
<v Speaker 3>the documents to have the papers </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually published,</v>

992
00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.970
<v Speaker 3>I started to feel a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

993
00:53:40.971 --> 00:53:42.770
<v Speaker 3>we might really get in some trouble for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

994
00:53:42.771 --> 00:53:45.080
<v Speaker 3>but at this point we're kind of in deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

995
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:48.660
<v Speaker 3>might as well carry on and try to finish</v>
<v Speaker 3>the experiment we had intended to,</v>

996
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:53.670
<v Speaker 3>to try to write papers for 12 months and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then spend six to eight months kind of,</v>

997
00:53:53.991 --> 00:53:55.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>following up.</v>

998
00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.790
<v Speaker 3>The academic publishing process is slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do the review,</v>

999
00:53:58.791 --> 00:54:01.310
<v Speaker 3>you get it back a couple months later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to do edits.</v>

1000
00:54:01.311 --> 00:54:04.070
<v Speaker 3>It takes maybe another month or two </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they accept or whatever.</v>

1001
00:54:04.071 --> 00:54:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Then publication may be another couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of months later.</v>

1002
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:07.461
<v Speaker 3>So it all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's slow.</v>

1003
00:54:07.461 --> 00:54:08.720
<v Speaker 3>So we wanted to do a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1004
00:54:08.721 --> 00:54:09.554
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight months after 12 months of writing </v>

1005
00:54:11.151 --> 00:54:15.410
<v Speaker 3>and that was the intended duration that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we should be wrapping up the project now</v>

1006
00:54:15.411 --> 00:54:18.530
<v Speaker 3>if we didn't get busted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But about late summer,</v>

1007
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:21.360
<v Speaker 3>the dog park paper got picked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1008
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:23.023
<v Speaker 3>by some journalists and the real peer </v>
<v Speaker 3>review and got made fun of it and we </v>

1009
00:54:25.191 --> 00:54:26.024
<v Speaker 3>realized we were probably not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it to the end of our intended at </v>

1010
00:54:29.841 --> 00:54:30.674
<v Speaker 3>year and a half ish time span.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we ended up writing for 10 total </v>

1011
00:54:34.341 --> 00:54:36.350
<v Speaker 3>months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a bit of time and</v>

1012
00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:38.883
<v Speaker 4>still under review,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was really ashamed because I'm </v>

1013
00:54:41.021 --> 00:54:41.854
<v Speaker 4>fairly sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do want to speak to that Jordan </v>

1014
00:54:44.951 --> 00:54:47.140
<v Speaker 4>because somebody had to do this.</v>

1015
00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:50.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1016
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:53.803
<v Speaker 4>Because the ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because these professors are looking at </v>

1017
00:54:56.961 --> 00:54:57.794
<v Speaker 4>their classrooms as an ideology mill and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're attempting to indoctrinate </v>

1018
00:55:01.641 --> 00:55:06.170
<v Speaker 4>people into things about reality that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have nothing to do with reality.</v>

1019
00:55:06.171 --> 00:55:07.004
<v Speaker 4>They've placed an agenda ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth and it's corroding our </v>

1020
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:16.140
<v Speaker 4>institutions in it's eroding trust in </v>
<v Speaker 4>those universities and institutions.</v>

1021
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:21.000
<v Speaker 4>And you identified the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many people identified the problem,</v>

1022
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.073
<v Speaker 4>but something had to be done about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond identification and calling these </v>

1023
00:55:25.291 --> 00:55:26.124
<v Speaker 4>people out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We needed to show that needs to de </v>

1024
00:55:29.781 --> 00:55:30.614
<v Speaker 4>legitimize these cannons because there </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that they were coming to </v>

1025
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.633
<v Speaker 4>knowledges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just epistemologically to to say it's </v>

1026
00:55:37.731 --> 00:55:40.070
<v Speaker 4>not rigorous as chow is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is charitable.</v>

1027
00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:43.640
<v Speaker 3>So they're kind of a few pieces to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1028
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.000
<v Speaker 3>So you mentioned a little bit earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we touched upon,</v>

1029
00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:48.253
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is now familiar with the idea that </v>

1030
00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:50.383
<v Speaker 3>racism and sexism don't seem to mean the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing they meant 10 years ago you </v>

1031
00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:54.374
<v Speaker 3>used to be able to say racist and sexist</v>
<v Speaker 3>and amend discrimination based on race </v>

1032
00:55:56.991 --> 00:55:58.610
<v Speaker 3>or sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it could go in any direction.</v>

1033
00:55:58.611 --> 00:56:01.310
<v Speaker 3>But now it's got this power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamic,</v>

1034
00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:04.460
<v Speaker 3>privileged plus power stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's talking about privilege.</v>

1035
00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:05.294
<v Speaker 3>So that's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if that's one dimension and it's </v>

1036
00:56:07.371 --> 00:56:08.204
<v Speaker 3>impossible to avoid that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sociological or grievance studies </v>

1037
00:56:12.201 --> 00:56:15.080
<v Speaker 3>definitions for concepts are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are everywhere.</v>

1038
00:56:15.081 --> 00:56:17.000
<v Speaker 3>But there are also two other pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>

1039
00:56:17.001 --> 00:56:17.834
<v Speaker 3>One that we saw before we started that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be a paper that was done by </v>

1040
00:56:21.441 --> 00:56:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Charlotte,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stern who,</v>

1041
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:28.570
<v Speaker 3>how insular gender studies is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How they literally took</v>

1042
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:31.063
<v Speaker 3>the years since Steven pinker published </v>
<v Speaker 3>the blank slate 2003 until 2015 or 16 </v>

1043
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:37.624
<v Speaker 3>she looked at a bunch of papers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got us a sample of those papers and </v>

1044
00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:44.980
<v Speaker 3>determined whether or not they </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorporated or ignored the,</v>

1045
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information that pinker had shared as a,</v>

1046
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:48.603
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a test and found that there was an </v>

1047
00:56:49.931 --> 00:56:50.764
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming amount of just putting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>blinkers on and pretending that biology </v>

1048
00:56:53.501 --> 00:56:56.950
<v Speaker 3>still doesn't exist and that human </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature is totally social.</v>

1049
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:59.020
<v Speaker 3>Part of that's not a pretense either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that</v>

1050
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:02.020
<v Speaker 3>a pretense here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1051
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:05.530
<v Speaker 3>the reason it's not a pretense is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because as far as I can tell,</v>

1052
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:08.260
<v Speaker 3>the people who are in these disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1053
00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:11.640
<v Speaker 3>absolutely nothing whatsoever about </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology,</v>

1054
00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.610
<v Speaker 3>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more you don't want to know,</v>

1055
00:57:17.611 --> 00:57:20.590
<v Speaker 3>that you need to know because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>daunting task.</v>

1056
00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to speak to that for a moment.</v>

1057
00:57:22.811 --> 00:57:26.140
<v Speaker 4>If I may.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at my university,</v>

1058
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:29.410
<v Speaker 4>a course offered on the philosophy of </v>
<v Speaker 4>race,</v>

1059
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:30.543
<v Speaker 4>and it would seem to me that a minimum </v>
<v Speaker 4>qualification one would need to teach </v>

1060
00:57:35.411 --> 00:57:40.411
<v Speaker 4>that is that one would have to have some</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of degree in evolutionary biology.</v>

1061
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:45.900
<v Speaker 4>But that does not seem to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

1062
00:57:45.901 --> 00:57:48.090
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing consistently,</v>

1063
00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>race is such an explosive,</v>

1064
00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:51.933
<v Speaker 4>explosive topic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you start with the idea that </v>

1065
00:57:54.851 --> 00:57:58.300
<v Speaker 4>you have the truth and then you work </v>
<v Speaker 4>backward and Cherry pick the literature,</v>

1066
00:57:58.301 --> 00:58:01.420
<v Speaker 4>and in this case it's extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>easy because you just go to these,</v>

1067
00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:02.883
<v Speaker 4>the journals and the canons of </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature and then you start teaching </v>

1068
00:58:04.841 --> 00:58:05.674
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens then is the kind of the </v>

1069
00:58:07.571 --> 00:58:12.571
<v Speaker 4>self fulfillment of the postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 4>condition is that they then manufacturer</v>

1070
00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:16.420
<v Speaker 4>pieces of information that people take </v>
<v Speaker 4>as knowledge.</v>

1071
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.440
<v Speaker 4>We see that happening in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>institutions now and it's,</v>

1072
00:58:20.441 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 4>nobody's calling them out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's again,</v>

1073
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:25.090
<v Speaker 4>I say that because it speaks to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>point of why didn't we do this?</v>

1074
00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.373
<v Speaker 4>Because the public trust in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>institutions as being eroded and we're </v>

1075
00:58:29.381 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 4>teaching our kids things that are just </v>
<v Speaker 4>not true.</v>

1076
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.960
<v Speaker 4>They're just totally untethered to </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

1077
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:37.840
<v Speaker 4>Even though some of these people may be </v>
<v Speaker 4>very well meaning</v>

1078
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:40.070
<v Speaker 3>and there's always a citation and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned,</v>

1079
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:42.120
<v Speaker 3>there's always a cycle with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>citation.</v>

1080
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.260
<v Speaker 3>You want to find something that says </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything ridiculous about sex,</v>

1081
00:58:45.261 --> 00:58:49.180
<v Speaker 3>toys and anal taking care of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's questions,</v>

1082
00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:53.440
<v Speaker 3>power dynamics using that already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always this like that that maybe</v>

1083
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:54.343
<v Speaker 3>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the important thing to sort of </v>

1084
00:58:55.671 --> 00:58:57.740
<v Speaker 3>realize it about what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1085
00:58:57.741 --> 00:59:00.920
<v Speaker 3>all of that ridiculous stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Jim was saying earlier,</v>

1086
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:02.533
<v Speaker 3>we were able to say that because there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was already something out there which </v>

1087
00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:07.533
<v Speaker 3>led to it or set it itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're actually looking at </v>

1088
00:59:11.121 --> 00:59:11.954
<v Speaker 3>what our project is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's very important is our </v>

1089
00:59:14.571 --> 00:59:19.571
<v Speaker 3>references because to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it really,</v>

1090
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1091
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.490
<v Speaker 2>there's this humorous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very humorous element in it,</v>

1092
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:29.130
<v Speaker 2>but on a deeper level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>

1093
00:59:29.131 --> 00:59:32.540
<v Speaker 2>is just gathering so much of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense together,</v>

1094
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.033
<v Speaker 2>citing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it in there and then kind of </v>

1095
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:36.763
<v Speaker 2>making it do whatever it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we wanted it to do that that </v>

1096
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:41.630
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the project.</v>

1097
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:42.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's your point is that you have to </v>

1098
00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:49.871
<v Speaker 2>embed yourself tire within a preexistent</v>
<v Speaker 2>literature or it couldn't float and</v>

1099
00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:57.240
<v Speaker 2>like they really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of the,</v>

1100
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:58.543
<v Speaker 2>some of the academics have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we haven't been fooled because we </v>

1101
01:00:01.341 --> 01:00:02.174
<v Speaker 2>still stand by the papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you wrote was reasonable because </v>

1102
01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:05.984
<v Speaker 2>they are indistinguishable and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really was kind of the point we wanted </v>

1103
01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:10.970
<v Speaker 2>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1104
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:11.803
<v Speaker 2>we've ended up with a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>resource for anyone who wants to know </v>

1105
01:00:14.301 --> 01:00:17.630
<v Speaker 2>what is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can look at our references,</v>

1106
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:20.150
<v Speaker 2>they can look at the arguments that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>enabled us to make.</v>

1107
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:23.630
<v Speaker 2>They can look at how the reviewers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they rejected us for,</v>

1108
01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 2>what they accepted us for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they pushed us to do.</v>

1109
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.810
<v Speaker 2>There's a very clear pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because it is so complicated with so</v>

1110
01:00:29.811 --> 01:00:30.644
<v Speaker 2>few people have taken the time it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>take to read all of our papers to read </v>

1111
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:38.180
<v Speaker 2>all of the comments to follow up our rem</v>
<v Speaker 2>at references.</v>

1112
01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:43.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not always clear that what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is putting it right in the Canon.</v>

1113
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.533
<v Speaker 2>That is why</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has to do with the motivation of </v>

1114
01:00:48.501 --> 01:00:51.020
<v Speaker 2>other academics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to be bothered with this.</v>

1115
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:52.833
<v Speaker 2>The stuff that I'm most familiar with is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that about 80% of humanities papers get </v>

1116
01:00:57.261 --> 01:00:58.094
<v Speaker 2>cited zero times and the problem is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>even to go after very bad ideas in an </v>

1117
01:01:03.651 --> 01:01:04.484
<v Speaker 2>academically rigorous way is actually an</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily daunting task and it </v>

1118
01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.250
<v Speaker 2>might be daunting in direct proportion </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

1119
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:14.300
<v Speaker 2>to the appalling this of the ideas.</v>

1120
01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.393
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're creating a very bad </v>

1121
01:01:17.361 --> 01:01:18.194
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate essay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way more difficult to grade a d </v>

1122
01:01:22.161 --> 01:01:27.161
<v Speaker 2>paper than it is to grade a b d paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>has so many errors in it.</v>

1123
01:01:27.231 --> 01:01:29.030
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know where to start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1124
01:01:29.031 --> 01:01:31.190
<v Speaker 2>The words are wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sentences are wrong,</v>

1125
01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.530
<v Speaker 2>the sentences aren't organized in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>paragraphs.</v>

1126
01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:34.364
<v Speaker 2>The paragraphs are chaotic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disjointed and the whole thing makes no </v>

1127
01:01:36.801 --> 01:01:37.634
<v Speaker 2>sense and you actually have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a level of criticism that </v>

1128
01:01:41.721 --> 01:01:42.554
<v Speaker 2>can't be applied to a very bad paper and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's an absolutely exhausting </v>

1129
01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:51.140
<v Speaker 2>intellectually apart from the danger </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it poses personally</v>

1130
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:54.163
<v Speaker 2>before we assume that it's mirror lack </v>
<v Speaker 2>of character on the part of our fellow </v>

1131
01:01:58.761 --> 01:02:02.300
<v Speaker 2>academics that is stopping them from </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a stand against such things.</v>

1132
01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Although I do buy the sort of entrenched</v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

1133
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:06.644
<v Speaker 2>this idea that emerges as perhaps an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable consequence of participating </v>

1134
01:02:11.211 --> 01:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>in a structured hierarchy.</v>

1135
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.193
<v Speaker 2>It's there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many more reasons why this is </v>

1136
01:02:17.241 --> 01:02:19.650
<v Speaker 2>forged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the inappropriate,</v>

1137
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.753
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidization of these viewpoints for </v>

1138
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:25.300
<v Speaker 2>the last 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1139
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>

1140
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:30.180
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really painstaking to pour through these</v>

1141
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:31.920
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a,</v>

1142
01:02:31.921 --> 01:02:33.150
<v Speaker 2>as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1143
01:02:33.151 --> 01:02:35.400
<v Speaker 2>with a commitment to science and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>background in science,</v>

1144
01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:36.234
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just even painstaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually went into some pretty dark </v>

1145
01:02:40.071 --> 01:02:42.260
<v Speaker 2>places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological places.</v>

1146
01:02:42.261 --> 01:02:43.094
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mentioned reading the glaciology </v>

1147
01:02:45.861 --> 01:02:47.530
<v Speaker 2>paper earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feminists physiology,</v>

1148
01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.520
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't read it in depth when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>first found it.</v>

1149
01:02:49.521 --> 01:02:50.354
<v Speaker 2>But when we started to do this project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to emulate it and write one </v>

1150
01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:54.200
<v Speaker 2>about feminists astronomy.</v>

1151
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:59.600
<v Speaker 2>And I read the thing in tremendous depth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with great care,</v>

1152
01:02:59.601 --> 01:03:02.030
<v Speaker 2>taking notes all the way through and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1153
01:03:02.031 --> 01:03:04.310
<v Speaker 2>preparing so I could could write effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>similarly.</v>

1154
01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.430
<v Speaker 2>And I shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1155
01:03:06.431 --> 01:03:07.264
<v Speaker 2>I just almost locked myself in a room by</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself for three days in a dark </v>

1156
01:03:10.191 --> 01:03:15.191
<v Speaker 2>depression that</v>
<v Speaker 2>quoting</v>

1157
01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:26.390
<v Speaker 2>the same thing how to be when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing 12 rules for life,</v>

1158
01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.253
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a chapter called don't bother </v>
<v Speaker 2>children when they're skateboarding and </v>

1159
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:35.230
<v Speaker 2>it's about the discouragement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say of primarily of young men as a</v>

1160
01:03:35.301 --> 01:03:36.134
<v Speaker 2>direct consequence of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kind of rhetoric that we're </v>

1161
01:03:37.641 --> 01:03:41.630
<v Speaker 2>discussing and like that made me </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbearable for my family for about three</v>

1162
01:03:41.631 --> 01:03:42.464
<v Speaker 2>months because the more I studied it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more it has a really fragmented and </v>

1163
01:03:47.211 --> 01:03:49.850
<v Speaker 2>chaotic effect going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You psychologically,</v>

1164
01:03:49.851 --> 01:03:52.580
<v Speaker 2>and I've also seen this manifested in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>

1165
01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.550
<v Speaker 2>you know who undergo this kind of act of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this indoctrination.</v>

1166
01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.880
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a,</v>

1167
01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:03.710
<v Speaker 2>it's such a corrosive and cynical view </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world that all we're,</v>

1168
01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.593
<v Speaker 2>we're all in it in our groups and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the groups are fighting one another </v>

1169
01:04:07.341 --> 01:04:11.270
<v Speaker 2>for power and that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental transcendent reality.</v>

1170
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:12.463
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1171
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:13.680
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine,</v>

1172
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.573
<v Speaker 4>imagine the sort of person who looks at </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as an epistomological and moral </v>

1173
01:04:18.631 --> 01:04:21.600
<v Speaker 4>virtue and who teaches that to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>students,</v>

1174
01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.430
<v Speaker 4>who attempts to indoctrinate their </v>
<v Speaker 4>students into these,</v>

1175
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.770
<v Speaker 4>not even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't even arrive.</v>

1176
01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:32.850
<v Speaker 4>So level of being false in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these morally dangerous ideas.</v>

1177
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.670
<v Speaker 4>And then they think that they're better </v>
<v Speaker 4>people as a result.</v>

1178
01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:38.010
<v Speaker 4>And then they think that if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>calls them out on it,</v>

1179
01:04:38.011 --> 01:04:38.844
<v Speaker 4>they're evil.</v>

1180
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's look and look at this too.</v>

1181
01:04:41.201 --> 01:04:43.930
<v Speaker 2>So when high he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Lukey Nofx wrote the cognitive,</v>

1182
01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.793
<v Speaker 2>the American mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one point they pointed out as the </v>

1183
01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:49.923
<v Speaker 2>American Psychological Association and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the American Psychiatric Association </v>

1184
01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.033
<v Speaker 2>should have that all of the safe space </v>
<v Speaker 2>and doctrines and trigger warning </v>

1185
01:04:57.101 --> 01:04:58.420
<v Speaker 2>doctrines and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1186
01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.590
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1187
01:05:00.850 --> 01:05:04.020
<v Speaker 2>and the speech codes for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are increasingly forbidding,</v>

1188
01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:04.863
<v Speaker 2>even sarcasm are exactly the opposite of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the approach that you would take if you </v>

1189
01:05:09.341 --> 01:05:12.640
<v Speaker 2>were a trained psychologist trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce people who are more resilient.</v>

1190
01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:13.623
<v Speaker 2>You actually make them weaker and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety provoking and more anxiety </v>

1191
01:05:17.261 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 2>prone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more depressed,</v>

1192
01:05:18.521 --> 01:05:20.910
<v Speaker 2>and more hopeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the evidence for that,</v>

1193
01:05:20.911 --> 01:05:21.744
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely clear and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>appalling that it wasn't clinical </v>

1194
01:05:24.011 --> 01:05:29.011
<v Speaker 2>psychologists or psychiatrists who </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed it out and so it is that the,</v>

1195
01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:30.243
<v Speaker 2>these doctrines are being put forth for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefit of those who formulate the </v>

1196
01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:36.640
<v Speaker 2>doctrines and that the students are </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificial victims in that,</v>

1197
01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.020
<v Speaker 2>in that process.</v>

1198
01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:38.913
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one more piece that I think is </v>

1199
01:05:41.051 --> 01:05:43.090
<v Speaker 4>important that goes back to what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

1200
01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:48.091
<v Speaker 4>what Jim said about not seeing that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>contradiction is problematic because the</v>

1201
01:05:48.971 --> 01:05:49.804
<v Speaker 4>whole idea of contradiction is white </v>
<v Speaker 4>science or western science and that's </v>

1202
01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:54.123
<v Speaker 4>problematic is that we found that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>folks don't really value discourse and </v>

1203
01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:03.601
<v Speaker 4>dialogue and so they don't really value </v>
<v Speaker 4>having ideas challenged and questioned.</v>

1204
01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.590
<v Speaker 4>That's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their reason for teaching these ideas in</v>

1205
01:06:07.591 --> 01:06:10.020
<v Speaker 4>the first place and if I may give you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>quick example,</v>

1206
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:11.783
<v Speaker 4>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well in State University wants to </v>

1207
01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.080
<v Speaker 4>include or has included at this point a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a course on native American philosophy,</v>

1208
01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.940
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a great idea.</v>

1209
01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.493
<v Speaker 4>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody in the audience asked the </v>

1210
01:06:24.901 --> 01:06:25.734
<v Speaker 4>question and the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to a presentation and the </v>

1211
01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:32.160
<v Speaker 4>question is individual asked was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1212
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:36.000
<v Speaker 4>what do we do as settlers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as colonialists when we want to question</v>

1213
01:06:36.001 --> 01:06:39.510
<v Speaker 4>or challenge these ideas and native </v>
<v Speaker 4>American philosophy.</v>

1214
01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:42.540
<v Speaker 4>And the presenter said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1215
01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:45.210
<v Speaker 4>I've struggled with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult for me,</v>

1216
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:46.463
<v Speaker 4>but the bottom line was it shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be exempt from traditional </v>

1217
01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:53.150
<v Speaker 4>tools that we have used for other </v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplines.</v>

1218
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.450
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dialectic challenging.</v>

1219
01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.673
<v Speaker 4>And so that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that places me in an almost impossible </v>

1220
01:07:00.291 --> 01:07:01.320
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am,</v>

1221
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:02.990
<v Speaker 4>what am I supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>

1222
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:04.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is it exempt?</v>

1223
01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:05.923
<v Speaker 4>It should play by the rules that every </v>
<v Speaker 4>other philosophy because then I become </v>

1224
01:07:08.421 --> 01:07:11.390
<v Speaker 4>the guy who hates western,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who hates,</v>

1225
01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1226
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:15.560
<v Speaker 4>indigenous people who hates indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophy.</v>

1227
01:07:15.561 --> 01:07:16.394
<v Speaker 4>And then I'm the tool of the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which gets back to what you were </v>

1228
01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:19.813
<v Speaker 4>questioning or asking before is why do </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have this violence in academia and </v>

1229
01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:24.164
<v Speaker 4>what's the problem with it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think part of the problem is that </v>

1230
01:07:26.631 --> 01:07:29.540
<v Speaker 4>these folks don't value discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't value dialog,</v>

1231
01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:31.430
<v Speaker 4>they don't value open expression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

1232
01:07:31.431 --> 01:07:32.750
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they view that.</v>

1233
01:07:32.751 --> 01:07:33.980
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a paper for this,</v>

1234
01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.460
<v Speaker 4>they view that as a type of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Words are a type of mine,</v>

1235
01:07:37.461 --> 01:07:38.294
<v Speaker 4>so type of verbal violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then their students develop </v>

1236
01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:45.280
<v Speaker 4>brutal epistemologies because they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>never heard the other side of the story.</v>

1237
01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:46.183
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they develop them just when they </v>

1238
01:07:47.121 --> 01:07:49.070
<v Speaker 2>should be developing resilient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resilient</v>

1239
01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.290
<v Speaker 4>be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1240
01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:53.400
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as a litmus test,</v>

1241
01:07:53.401 --> 01:07:55.680
<v Speaker 4>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always ask folks why,</v>

1242
01:07:55.681 --> 01:07:58.470
<v Speaker 4>who are gender studies in my class or </v>
<v Speaker 4>study in the,</v>

1243
01:07:58.471 --> 01:08:00.560
<v Speaker 4>in the grievance studies fields,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1244
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:05.450
<v Speaker 4>why is it Martha Nussbaum is criticism </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Judith Butler taught hair,</v>

1245
01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.200
<v Speaker 4>single single students as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

1246
01:08:07.201 --> 01:08:09.360
<v Speaker 4>I've learned about that in my class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1247
01:08:09.361 --> 01:08:10.194
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't teach that because they have </v>

1248
01:08:11.851 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 4>a prevailing orthodoxy and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>indoctrinate with it and</v>

1249
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:18.380
<v Speaker 5>they've kind of hijack the </v>
<v Speaker 5>administration.</v>

1250
01:08:18.381 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 5>And as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've weaponized offices of diversity,</v>

1251
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:22.664
<v Speaker 5>inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>etc. To punish people who are heretics </v>

1252
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:26.220
<v Speaker 5>and who questioned or challenged.</v>

1253
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to run out of time.</v>

1254
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:31.220
<v Speaker 2>We're running down to about 10 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1255
01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:35.900
<v Speaker 2>So I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a question that I want to race to</v>

1256
01:08:35.901 --> 01:08:36.734
<v Speaker 2>all three of you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one is why in the world should </v>

1257
01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:42.020
<v Speaker 2>anybody outside of academia care about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

1258
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing and very careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer that.</v>

1259
01:08:45.141 --> 01:08:46.850
<v Speaker 2>And the second is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1260
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.883
<v Speaker 2>for each of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's been the personal consequence of </v>

1261
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:51.944
<v Speaker 2>this and would you have repeated it if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you knew what the consequences were </v>

1262
01:08:55.311 --> 01:08:56.520
<v Speaker 2>going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

1263
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 2>let's start with the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why in the world should they,</v>

1264
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.820
<v Speaker 2>why in the world should anyone care that</v>
<v Speaker 2>some half did?</v>

1265
01:09:01.821 --> 01:09:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Academic Journal published an insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper by three renegade,</v>

1266
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:08.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>academics about what,</v>

1267
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:11.870
<v Speaker 2>about dorm rate of all the absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1268
01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:12.421
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1269
01:09:12.421 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the observed observed topics.</v>

1270
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.903
<v Speaker 2>It's so surreal that it seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually in comprehensible sensible </v>

1271
01:09:23.271 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 2>people should avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the answer to that?</v>

1272
01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead Helen.</v>

1273
01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:33.480
<v Speaker 5>The university.</v>

1274
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1275
01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.253
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is our source of knowledge </v>

1276
01:09:37.161 --> 01:09:39.320
<v Speaker 5>production.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we look back through history,</v>

1277
01:09:39.321 --> 01:09:40.154
<v Speaker 5>when our cultures were Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the new knowledge about this was coming </v>

1278
01:09:43.341 --> 01:09:46.760
<v Speaker 5>from the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we had the scientific revolution,</v>

1279
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.840
<v Speaker 5>when we went into the enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was coming from the universities.</v>

1280
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.070
<v Speaker 5>These things don't stay in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>universities.</v>

1281
01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:54.953
<v Speaker 5>We have seen it is coming out in what is</v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially happened with the kind of </v>

1282
01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:01.543
<v Speaker 5>identity studies that we're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that it has been made directly </v>

1283
01:10:04.521 --> 01:10:05.354
<v Speaker 5>actionable by activists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has been tagged onto the end of the </v>

1284
01:10:09.141 --> 01:10:11.990
<v Speaker 5>civil rights movements and liberal </v>
<v Speaker 5>feminism and gay pride.</v>

1285
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:16.790
<v Speaker 5>When those movements have started to see</v>
<v Speaker 5>diminishing returns and people wanted to</v>

1286
01:10:16.791 --> 01:10:18.320
<v Speaker 5>continue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it's,</v>

1287
01:10:18.321 --> 01:10:22.160
<v Speaker 5>it's tacked onto the end of that to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>society which has just seeing the end of</v>

1288
01:10:22.161 --> 01:10:22.994
<v Speaker 5>empire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the end of Jim Crow and is geared </v>

1289
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:28.600
<v Speaker 5>towards towards social justice and it is</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1290
01:10:28.601 --> 01:10:29.930
<v Speaker 5>is it a c did here</v>

1291
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.963
<v Speaker 2>it's also a warning to the corporations </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's permeating the HR </v>

1292
01:10:34.581 --> 01:10:36.430
<v Speaker 2>departments don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1293
01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.213
<v Speaker 2>it's going to stay in the universities </v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't be thinking that you can </v>

1294
01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:43.760
<v Speaker 2>import 2% of it without importing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other 98% will.</v>

1295
01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:45.083
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People Leave University and they join </v>

1296
01:10:46.411 --> 01:10:47.430
<v Speaker 5>these industries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>

1297
01:10:47.431 --> 01:10:48.264
<v Speaker 5>there's pressure on corporations to </v>
<v Speaker 5>comply with the reigning moral </v>

1298
01:10:52.921 --> 01:10:53.790
<v Speaker 5>orthodoxy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1299
01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:54.683
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that the average business </v>
<v Speaker 5>owner or the average person in the </v>

1300
01:10:57.691 --> 01:11:02.691
<v Speaker 5>street knows anything about Sukkot or </v>
<v Speaker 5>crenshaw or even thinks much about this,</v>

1301
01:11:03.151 --> 01:11:07.110
<v Speaker 5>but it is in the air now and it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is affecting,</v>

1302
01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:08.483
<v Speaker 5>it is affecting everything and we do </v>
<v Speaker 5>need to take it seriously without sort </v>

1303
01:11:12.091 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 5>of having a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need to</v>

1304
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.810
<v Speaker 3>look at it calmly and empirically and </v>
<v Speaker 3>address it as it actually is.</v>

1305
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:20.063
<v Speaker 3>And what should we do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the next issue because the </v>

1306
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:25.030
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1307
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.741
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

1308
01:11:25.741 --> 01:11:28.830
<v Speaker 3>That's another point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the final question for all three of</v>

1309
01:11:28.831 --> 01:11:31.900
<v Speaker 3>you is and maybe one at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1310
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.940
<v Speaker 3>when you do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

1311
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:37.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely do it again.</v>

1312
01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1313
01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:41.040
<v Speaker 3>So we know that you're an unrepentant </v>
<v Speaker 3>troublemaker</v>

1314
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:45.210
<v Speaker 3>in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've also found like my one great talent</v>

1315
01:11:45.211 --> 01:11:48.450
<v Speaker 3>in the world and I feel like I've made </v>
<v Speaker 3>my own life obsolete now.</v>

1316
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful.</v>

1317
01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If anybody's looking for one,</v>

1318
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:56.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1319
01:11:56.161 --> 01:11:57.870
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worth the risk.</v>

1320
01:11:57.871 --> 01:11:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I think it needed to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Helen,</v>

1321
01:11:59.851 --> 01:12:02.040
<v Speaker 3>let's ask you next and then we'll get </v>
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

1322
01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:02.874
<v Speaker 3>Peter has the last word because he's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>one that's got the most on the line at </v>

1323
01:12:05.011 --> 01:12:05.844
<v Speaker 3>the moment.</v>

1324
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I was imagining all sorts of things from</v>
<v Speaker 3>being arrested under sort of hate speech</v>

1325
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:17.190
<v Speaker 3>acts to being physically attacked </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I have an uncommon name.</v>

1326
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:18.323
<v Speaker 3>I've had an awful lot online abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got some persistent store because </v>

1327
01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:23.773
<v Speaker 3>that has a sentiment that I probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't get into a phd program in my own </v>

1328
01:12:27.451 --> 01:12:28.051
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1329
01:12:28.051 --> 01:12:31.970
<v Speaker 3>somebody in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been,</v>

1330
01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been,</v>

1331
01:12:33.331 --> 01:12:37.220
<v Speaker 3>it's been quite nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1332
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.360
<v Speaker 3>Peter</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to be done.</v>

1333
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:43.223
<v Speaker 3>There's a crisis in the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does a crisis with knowledge production </v>

1334
01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:51.171
<v Speaker 3>is a crisis of confidence</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a heavy price to me.</v>

1335
01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:55.410
<v Speaker 3>And I have had to weigh out my family </v>
<v Speaker 3>obligations,</v>

1336
01:12:55.411 --> 01:12:58.090
<v Speaker 3>helping put my son through school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1337
01:12:58.530 --> 01:12:59.363
<v Speaker 3>being a part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>being in a relationship in which I </v>

1338
01:13:03.331 --> 01:13:07.230
<v Speaker 3>economically contribute to the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this had to be done.</v>

1339
01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:11.400
<v Speaker 3>And if I am a consequence of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then so be it.</v>

1340
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.500
<v Speaker 3>It had to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1341
01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter Work,</v>

1342
01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:14.394
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of us who are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly inclined to let you be a </v>

1343
01:13:16.981 --> 01:13:17.814
<v Speaker 3>sole sacrificial victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a university wants to get </v>

1344
01:13:20.341 --> 01:13:22.520
<v Speaker 3>too stupid with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then um,</v>

1345
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:23.993
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's assume that they're going to be </v>

1346
01:13:24.841 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sincerely appreciate your support from</v>

1347
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:29.430
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1348
01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:30.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well enough is enough.</v>

1349
01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:32.670
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well look guys,</v>

1350
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.440
<v Speaker 3>it was really good talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them.</v>

1351
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:35.753
<v Speaker 3>I think that you're quite the</v>
<v Speaker 3>surreal bunch of troublemakers and </v>

1352
01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:44.510
<v Speaker 3>perhaps exactly what this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation requires and</v>

1353
01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:48.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hope that,</v>

1354
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.793
<v Speaker 3>I hope Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that things work out for you </v>

1355
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:52.663
<v Speaker 3>properly over the next few years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a tough haul for a </v>

1356
01:13:54.641 --> 01:13:55.730
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt.</v>

1357
01:13:56.710 --> 01:13:59.400
<v Speaker 3>Are you getting any student support at </v>
<v Speaker 3>your university?</v>

1358
01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Getting a lot of students support the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>

1359
01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.140
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to be,</v>

1360
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:07.860
<v Speaker 3>people would threaten to attack me a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago.</v>

1361
01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:08.694
<v Speaker 3>Someone spit at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my colleagues literally while walked on </v>

1362
01:14:11.261 --> 01:14:12.160
<v Speaker 3>the card or they'll turn</v>

1363
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.993
<v Speaker 4>their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1364
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.290
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you know,</v>

1365
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:15.460
<v Speaker 4>the uncomfortable things,</v>

1366
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.430
<v Speaker 2>not much different from the typical </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

1367
01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:21.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1368
01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:25.860
<v Speaker 4>it has seem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>

1369
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:27.103
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1370
01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:28.793
<v Speaker 4>I want to be blunt with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a concern for my safety in </v>

1371
01:14:33.691 --> 01:14:36.240
<v Speaker 4>Portland when I leave the house now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1372
01:14:36.241 --> 01:14:37.074
<v Speaker 4>And I've now been Trenton on more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>one occasion by people and I'm </v>

1373
01:14:42.241 --> 01:14:43.074
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>

1374
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Do you find the threats credible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1375
01:14:46.271 --> 01:14:48.250
<v Speaker 2>I know every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every threat is upsetting,</v>

1376
01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:49.084
<v Speaker 2>but like are you actually in a situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you have some apprehension about </v>

1377
01:14:52.271 --> 01:14:53.110
<v Speaker 2>leaving your house</v>

1378
01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.710
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't have any apprehension.</v>

1379
01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.940
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1380
01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:00.021
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1381
01:15:00.021 --> 01:15:03.010
<v Speaker 4>I wake up in the morning and I get </v>
<v Speaker 4>emails and tweets,</v>

1382
01:15:03.011 --> 01:15:05.160
<v Speaker 4>people telling me how stupid I am and </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't,</v>

1383
01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.133
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad person I am and how I'm a homophobe </v>

1384
01:15:07.481 --> 01:15:08.271
<v Speaker 4>and racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera.</v>

1385
01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:10.300
<v Speaker 4>I then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't do anything to me.</v>

1386
01:15:10.301 --> 01:15:14.230
<v Speaker 4>But when I walk out in the street,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the bar a few weeks ago,</v>

1387
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.740
<v Speaker 4>or maybe a few months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know mine for timelines,</v>

1388
01:15:17.741 --> 01:15:18.640
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone,</v>

1389
01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:20.213
<v Speaker 4>someone came up to me and he started </v>
<v Speaker 4>harassing me as fortunately as with my </v>

1390
01:15:23.701 --> 01:15:25.150
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Davis,</v>

1391
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:27.833
<v Speaker 4>a black belt in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he immediately pulled up the chair </v>

1392
01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.080
<v Speaker 4>beside us and I kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's talk.</v>

1393
01:15:33.081 --> 01:15:34.490
<v Speaker 4>Let's have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1394
01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:37.520
<v Speaker 4>he followed me in the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came out of the bathroom.</v>

1395
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:38.481
<v Speaker 4>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1396
01:15:38.481 --> 01:15:40.190
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's happening.</v>

1397
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:42.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why you're so upset and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>happy to talk to you.</v>

1398
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:45.440
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to talk to Peter.</v>

1399
01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:46.950
<v Speaker 4>I want to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>

1400
01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.261
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty,</v>

1401
01:15:48.261 --> 01:15:49.490
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty serious.</v>

1402
01:15:49.690 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it happened again on the street</v>

1403
01:15:51.731 --> 01:15:55.690
<v Speaker 4>when I was surrounded about we can half </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago by people,</v>

1404
01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:01.080
<v Speaker 4>I assume they're anti for people or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something clearly wanted to hurt me.</v>

1405
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.920
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1406
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am,</v>

1407
01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:06.660
<v Speaker 4>I am concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am concerned about</v>

1408
01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.740
<v Speaker 2>those for people who haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>

1409
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:10.583
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard for people who haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been through that sort of thing to </v>

1410
01:16:12.291 --> 01:16:15.320
<v Speaker 2>understand just exactly how distressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of occurrence is.</v>

1411
01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Not only because it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because it could happen again and it</v>

1412
01:16:18.891 --> 01:16:21.560
<v Speaker 2>could become more serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really sorry to hear that.</v>

1413
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:23.380
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize it didn't come to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1414
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:24.800
<v Speaker 2>that's no laughing matter.</v>

1415
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:30.390
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got anything to do with you.</v>

1416
01:16:31.461 --> 01:16:32.294
<v Speaker 4>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this will stick because there's </v>

1417
01:16:33.141 --> 01:16:36.860
<v Speaker 4>insults,</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaflets and notices and yeah,</v>

1418
01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:40.693
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's when it's in the physical world </v>

1419
01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:46.760
<v Speaker 4>where I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel someone,</v>

1420
01:16:47.210 --> 01:16:49.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean if someone tells you they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to hurt you,</v>

1421
01:16:49.251 --> 01:16:50.630
<v Speaker 4>you should take their word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1422
01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:51.550
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

1423
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:53.890
<v Speaker 2>when it's that direct and when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>started in your face,</v>

1424
01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.960
<v Speaker 2>those threats are credible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's,</v>

1425
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:57.730
<v Speaker 2>that's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real danger.</v>

1426
01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.890
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

1427
01:16:59.891 --> 01:17:00.724
<v Speaker 2>I'm really sorry to hear that and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also sorry to hear that you're </v>

1428
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:05.103
<v Speaker 2>paying a substantial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to hear a general that you're </v>

1429
01:17:07.001 --> 01:17:09.140
<v Speaker 2>paying a substantial price for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1430
01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.333
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do what I can for what </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's worth to try to make sure that </v>

1431
01:17:13.401 --> 01:17:15.530
<v Speaker 2>people hear about this and that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not in it alone.</v>

1432
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Because I think you guys are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians.</v>

1433
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:19.693
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your canaries in the coal mine and </v>

1434
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:23.820
<v Speaker 2>whatever happens to you is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to a lot of other people if,</v>

1435
01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:28.370
<v Speaker 2>if it's allowed to happen to you so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be allowed to happen to you.</v>

1436
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:32.240
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So thank you for your support.</v>

1437
01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.130
<v Speaker 2>All right guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1438
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:36.230
<v Speaker 2>thanks a lot for talking to me all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1439
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:37.873
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a stupidly interesting talking </v>

1440
01:17:41.751 --> 01:17:42.584
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just did not believe it's come to </v>

1441
01:17:47.811 --> 01:17:48.321
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1442
01:17:48.321 --> 01:17:51.200
<v Speaker 2>it's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't,</v>

1443
01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.540
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't invent this in a bad piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fiction.</v>

1444
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:56.920
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so sad that,</v>

1445
01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:57.933
<v Speaker 2>that this is the sort of thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to occupy ourselves when there's </v>

1446
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.910
<v Speaker 2>serious work to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1447
01:18:04.911 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy new year,</v>

1448
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.453
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully this'll be a watershed year </v>

1449
01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.700
<v Speaker 2>and things will get more intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>from here on end.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 2>hoping that'll be the case me to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
