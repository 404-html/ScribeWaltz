1
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>since we haven't been at this for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile,</v>

3
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.013
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to briefly review what we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up to him and then where are we </v>

4
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:43.914
<v Speaker 1>going?</v>

5
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I guess the basic idea,</v>

7
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll start with something instead.</v>

8
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.853
<v Speaker 1>I guess we probably reviewed enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you something from </v>

9
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Tolstoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you probably read or theoretically</v>

10
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we're going to discuss</v>

11
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.743
<v Speaker 1>today please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which anomalous </v>

12
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:27.380
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's itself,</v>

13
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.313
<v Speaker 1>the different manners in which anomalous</v>
<v Speaker 1>information can present itself and how </v>

14
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:33.584
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how anomalous information as a category </v>

15
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>is represented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

16
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:38.144
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know already.</v>

17
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.473
<v Speaker 1>Anomalous inflammation tends to adopt </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolism associated with the feminine </v>

18
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>feminine with chaos because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal information,</v>

19
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.370
<v Speaker 1>which is information you don't expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

20
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.743
<v Speaker 1>that produces emotional chaos because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupts your versions of the emotional </v>

21
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:01.124
<v Speaker 1>significance of the present and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future and conceivably how to get from </v>

22
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:04.994
<v Speaker 1>one to the other.</v>

23
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.833
<v Speaker 1>Our whole discussion so far has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on the idea that you can look at </v>

24
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.134
<v Speaker 1>the world from two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives and when you're thinking </v>

25
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 1>about the constituent elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

26
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.710
<v Speaker 1>you can take the straight materialistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

27
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:23.480
<v Speaker 1>which is a perfectly reasonable thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

28
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>And talk about how things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed scientifically as if they're</v>

29
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.170
<v Speaker 1>independent object and we've got a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>way it's doing that.</v>

30
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.443
<v Speaker 1>But there's another way that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the world and that's as a place </v>

31
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.053
<v Speaker 1>that exists as experience and as a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists as a stage for action </v>

32
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is the case,</v>

33
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:51.974
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's well known and not frequently </v>

34
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.873
<v Speaker 1>disputed that the world as a place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act is not derived bubble as from the </v>

35
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:02.914
<v Speaker 1>world as it exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that you can accumulate </v>

36
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>all the facts you want about a given </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation or a thing.</v>

37
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.653
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't tell you how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you should conduct your behavior in </v>

38
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:14.464
<v Speaker 1>that situation or around that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that basically is </v>

39
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.064
<v Speaker 1>because you have to choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to make decisions about what </v>

40
00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:28.271
<v Speaker 1>constitutes the optimal solution to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular emotional problems.</v>

41
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.963
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

42
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.683
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said before and I've been thinking </v>

43
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:37.110
<v Speaker 1>about this a lot lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons that</v>

44
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.150
<v Speaker 2>average before,</v>

45
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.683
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nonacademic community has contempt </v>

46
00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:48.951
<v Speaker 1>for the academic community is because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been laboring under the presumption</v>

47
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing facts is,</v>

48
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.880
<v Speaker 1>is what intelligence is for and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not right.</v>

49
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence is to tell you how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate your emotions.</v>

50
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.553
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that by figuring out how to </v>

51
00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:04.194
<v Speaker 1>behave?</v>

52
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.460
<v Speaker 1>If you've explored something thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this perspective,</v>

53
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:25.440
<v Speaker 1>that means that you know how to act when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there.</v>

54
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.073
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you know everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the situation from the factual </v>

55
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:30.654
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's obvious because you'll never </v>

56
00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:34.074
<v Speaker 1>find yourself in a situation where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know everything from the factual </v>

57
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:36.984
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that brings up another interesting </v>

58
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:39.744
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>

59
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you can stop asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions since you're always surrounded</v>

60
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.284
<v Speaker 1>by an infinite number of mysteries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to that is as far as I can tell </v>

61
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:50.124
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stop asking the questions about a </v>

62
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:51.984
<v Speaker 1>situation when what you know is good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to get you where you want to be </v>

63
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:55.644
<v Speaker 1>in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that constitutes grounds for </v>

64
00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:01.980
<v Speaker 1>presuming that your exploratory behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that situation has gone far enough.</v>

65
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.053
<v Speaker 1>So if I want something from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that I don't know </v>

66
00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>everything about you or even anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>near anything and everything about you,</v>

67
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.333
<v Speaker 1>I know you sufficiently when my </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions with you produce the </v>

68
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>results that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

69
00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:17.364
<v Speaker 1>I desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that gives us some insight into </v>

70
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.270
<v Speaker 1>how it is that your knowledge can both </v>
<v Speaker 1>be limited but sufficient.</v>

71
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.703
<v Speaker 1>And that's a useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a useful piece of information to </v>

72
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:28.224
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

73
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.860
<v Speaker 1>You're to explored territory when what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do produces what you want.</v>

74
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.590
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the mythological perspective,</v>

75
00:05:36.591 --> 00:05:39.680
<v Speaker 1>explored territory is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituent elements of the universe,</v>

76
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the no,</v>

77
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>that's the patriarchal system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How unexplored territory,</v>

78
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>whenever something you do produce as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence,</v>

79
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>you don't expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

80
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.463
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting notion because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to think of territory as the place </v>

81
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>that you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is in a sense a way of making a</v>

82
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>leaf up into the idea of a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

83
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:06.971
<v Speaker 1>Because psychologically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be in the</v>

84
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>psychologically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that you're in the same</v>

85
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be in two different places.</v>

86
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

87
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 1>let me get this straight.</v>

88
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Even though even if I don't shift </v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

89
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I can be in two different places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm talking to you and what I want to</v>

90
00:06:32.941 --> 00:06:35.880
<v Speaker 1>happen happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one place.</v>

91
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.160
<v Speaker 1>And if I'm talking to you and something </v>
<v Speaker 1>or don't expect happens,</v>

92
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.290
<v Speaker 1>that's another place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I haven't moved,</v>

93
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.500
<v Speaker 1>the emotional significance of those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>places is entirely different.</v>

94
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.090
<v Speaker 1>So those are psychological places and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as myth,</v>

95
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.800
<v Speaker 1>mythology is concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's psychological places that are real.</v>

96
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.300
<v Speaker 1>That's at least with regards to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance for behavior,</v>

97
00:06:57.301 --> 00:07:00.330
<v Speaker 1>which is what myth is concerned with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genomic was concerned with morality.</v>

98
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.193
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's normal.</v>

99
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.070
<v Speaker 1>That's not names.</v>

100
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.143
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

101
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.293
<v Speaker 1>so there's the place that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with and that's the place that </v>

102
00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 1>you've explored sufficiently so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to happen is happening and</v>

103
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:17.624
<v Speaker 1>there's a place that you're unfamiliar </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and that's the place that emerges </v>

104
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.473
<v Speaker 1>when you make a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the process that turns </v>

105
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:25.484
<v Speaker 1>one into the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that if you make a </v>

106
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:29.414
<v Speaker 1>mistake and you continue to explore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to modify your </v>

107
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 1>behavior so that the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mistake vanish,</v>

108
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.463
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how you should have behaved </v>

109
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:38.804
<v Speaker 1>in that circumstance and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>rectify your behavior in the future or </v>

110
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>that you can smooth things over so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of your mistake go away</v>

111
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:45.224
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the capacity to turn chaos in </v>

112
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:49.544
<v Speaker 1>doored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case that you can turn </v>

113
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:52.664
<v Speaker 1>order into chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>by continuing to explore in territory </v>

114
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.630
<v Speaker 1>that other people have already defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>as sufficiently explored.</v>

115
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.720
<v Speaker 1>And that means that the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative exploration can bring order and</v>

116
00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:10.050
<v Speaker 1>it can also bring chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are forms of the normally here.</v>

117
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.823
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

118
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.550
<v Speaker 1>They're written down in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the manuscript.</v>

119
00:08:14.551 --> 00:08:15.384
<v Speaker 1>The revolutionary hero as a bringer of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally is someone who continues to </v>

120
00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:20.484
<v Speaker 1>explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When everyone else says we're getting </v>

121
00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:23.064
<v Speaker 1>where we want to be at the present time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just to say they're saying you </v>

122
00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:26.950
<v Speaker 1>should leave</v>

123
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.980
<v Speaker 2>well enough alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

124
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we've been trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

125
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.793
<v Speaker 1>we looked at mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the unknown and they </v>

126
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:46.450
<v Speaker 1>tend to take two forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

127
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:47.284
<v Speaker 1>they tend to manifest themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine shape and there's a lot of </v>

128
00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:53.950
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the basic reason is because</v>

129
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.450
<v Speaker 1>it's the unknown that everything comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

130
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 1>So when you explore something unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you generate new information.</v>

131
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>So it's reasonable to conceive of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown as a matrix.</v>

132
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.913
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of the Matrix is </v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminated cognitively speaking with </v>

133
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>quick notions of creation and notions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source.</v>

134
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's reasonable to think of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown as the source of all things.</v>

135
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:18.504
<v Speaker 1>It's reasonable as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of it hasn't in the same </v>

136
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:21.774
<v Speaker 1>category as feminine things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the unknown takes the unknown as a </v>

137
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:27.684
<v Speaker 1>feminine thing takes on two sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics and one is the creative </v>

138
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.323
<v Speaker 1>characteristics and the other is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive characteristics because the </v>

139
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 1>unknown can disrupt things and destroy </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and it,</v>

140
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 1>but it also serves as the ground for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

141
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 1>So it has it affectively ambivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>status that's permanent.</v>

142
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:47.454
<v Speaker 1>So that's a constituent element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced on don't always have to </v>

143
00:09:49.691 --> 00:09:50.524
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It frightens you and it makes you </v>

144
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:54.744
<v Speaker 1>hopeful and it does both of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and that puts you into a </v>

145
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 1>state of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get conflict,</v>

146
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.823
<v Speaker 1>so which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has really nothing to do with </v>

147
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:04.014
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your psychological state as an </v>

148
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:07.854
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically means that no matter who </v>

149
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:12.114
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you encounter something I'm known </v>

150
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.620
<v Speaker 1>those two sets of emotions are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be generated.</v>

151
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.993
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing we tried to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>was to think about how the gnome itself </v>

152
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 1>is structured and that brought us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea</v>

153
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>which which is in its sort of elaborated</v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

154
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.243
<v Speaker 1>which is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know where you're at and what </v>

155
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:38.184
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that you have a stable view of </v>

156
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 1>who you are.</v>

157
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.353
<v Speaker 1>And also where you're going and and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get there and that's all one </v>

158
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:47.100
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one story,</v>

159
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.670
<v Speaker 1>but you're cooperating with someone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something.</v>

160
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Then your story shared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've hammered out your differences and</v>

161
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.333
<v Speaker 1>you have to find a territory that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>founded basically where almost nothing </v>

162
00:10:56.911 --> 00:10:57.744
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we tried to do was to </v>

163
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:04.390
<v Speaker 1>figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the simple one was the,</v>

164
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a theory about where you want to go</v>

165
00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:08.214
<v Speaker 1>and the theory about where you are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a series of plans to get from </v>

166
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:15.540
<v Speaker 1>one to the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we also have discussed the fact that</v>

167
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 1>the plans themselves are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories of the same sword.</v>

168
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>that diagram presents what are basically</v>

169
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.223
<v Speaker 1>nested stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a small ambitions are </v>

170
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:31.780
<v Speaker 1>nested in your bigger ambitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take,</v>

171
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.713
<v Speaker 1>do you come to a class to graduate from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the class to graduate from the class in </v>

172
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>order to get your degree in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue your career,</v>

173
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.070
<v Speaker 1>your career as part of your duties as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen,</v>

174
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:44.963
<v Speaker 1>so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the stories and to become nested in </v>

175
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:48.474
<v Speaker 1>one another and this nesting also has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the form of a dominance hierarchy </v>

176
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.943
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

177
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:57.663
<v Speaker 3>if we're engaged in a dominance dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that basically means is that we're </v>

178
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 3>arguing about whose stories could occupy</v>
<v Speaker 3>a superordinate position.</v>

179
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.843
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might also both the arguing in order </v>

180
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 3>to construct the third story that we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>both agree to,</v>

181
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:15.580
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't happen very often if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of a brute force dominant,</v>

182
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:16.414
<v Speaker 3>struggled at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just whoever has the most effective </v>

183
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tools at hand,</v>

184
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:22.564
<v Speaker 3>which could also involve physical force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was writing my story takes </v>

185
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 3>precedence or at least in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

186
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a dominance hierarchy and</v>

187
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.183
<v Speaker 3>the known which is explored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also equivalent to culture is </v>

188
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.330
<v Speaker 3>constructed of the Internet of sequences</v>
<v Speaker 3>of internets.</v>

189
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.183
<v Speaker 3>That stories that have been arranged in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of the relative importance over </v>

190
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.113
<v Speaker 3>spans thousands and thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things we've been trying </v>

191
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 3>to do is to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if you're,</v>

192
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.880
<v Speaker 3>if you're in the same culture as someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

193
00:12:57.881 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 3>that means that you share at least a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain set of stories with that person.</v>

194
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 3>And we've been trying to figure out is </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those stories consist of and also</v>

195
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:10.480
<v Speaker 3>what might be the most superordinate </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

196
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Write the story that governs all other </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>

197
00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:14.680
<v Speaker 3>which you might think of as the king of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all stories.</v>

198
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:15.853
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of the reason why I told</v>
<v Speaker 3>you about the mess of the table and </v>

199
00:13:18.721 --> 00:13:19.554
<v Speaker 3>creation myth</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Mesopotamian creation at the </v>

200
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Martech</v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily confronts time map who's the</v>

201
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:30.604
<v Speaker 3>agent of chaos and considered thesis and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes the world and for the </v>

202
00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamians that was the rule of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>king who came as long as the king.</v>

203
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:43.750
<v Speaker 3>He acted out Marta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the culture progress properly.</v>

204
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.250
<v Speaker 3>And so the Mesopotamians sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except they didn't say it,</v>

205
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:50.770
<v Speaker 3>they acted it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they act it out.</v>

206
00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:53.620
<v Speaker 3>The idea that the most super story </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be</v>

207
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.730
<v Speaker 3>respect for the process that generates </v>
<v Speaker 3>all stories.</v>

208
00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

209
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.860
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of a paradox.</v>

210
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 3>I guess we represented that</v>

211
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.773
<v Speaker 4>this way.</v>

212
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.343
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a story when you're a child </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's basically an authoritarian </v>

213
00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:20.024
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't it someone else's is God </v>

214
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.220
<v Speaker 3>usually your parents at least if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>lucky,</v>

215
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.463
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't work forever because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>soon becomes evident not because your </v>

216
00:14:31.131 --> 00:14:34.910
<v Speaker 3>parents failed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because you change that your parents</v>

217
00:14:34.911 --> 00:14:35.744
<v Speaker 3>aren't Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's problems that they can </v>

218
00:14:37.591 --> 00:14:38.424
<v Speaker 3>solve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say that there are unknown </v>

219
00:14:39.741 --> 00:14:40.574
<v Speaker 3>or anomalous phenomena that emerge that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your parents can attribute the term </v>

220
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:43.843
<v Speaker 3>meaning to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And usually what that means is that you </v>

221
00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:46.484
<v Speaker 3>have to adopt the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it means is that you come to adopt </v>

222
00:14:50.301 --> 00:14:55.301
<v Speaker 3>the beliefs of the then</v>
<v Speaker 3>initiation rituals,</v>

223
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.790
<v Speaker 3>which usually involve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well Elliot,</v>

224
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 3>he says all initiation rituals involved </v>
<v Speaker 3>the regression to the beginnings.</v>

225
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.873
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iliana was convinced that all archaic </v>

226
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.773
<v Speaker 3>people's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever they attempted to create </v>

227
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:11.091
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new,</v>

228
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:11.924
<v Speaker 3>whenever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always construed the creation of </v>

229
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:14.210
<v Speaker 3>something new.</v>

230
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.430
<v Speaker 3>In terms of reference to the cosmo going</v>
<v Speaker 3>with myth,</v>

231
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:21.431
<v Speaker 3>which is</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos gives birth to the original set of</v>

232
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:26.290
<v Speaker 3>parents who in turn give birth to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>divine son who in turn separates them</v>

233
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.370
<v Speaker 3>from the archaic people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every act of creation replaced the cause</v>

234
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:32.204
<v Speaker 3>with money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet we know a little bit about why that </v>

235
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:34.424
<v Speaker 3>is now too because it does seem that </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you rearrange any aspects of </v>

236
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:38.744
<v Speaker 3>your story at any level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do go through a routine like that </v>

237
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.943
<v Speaker 3>says your presumptions are wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically means that the meaning </v>

238
00:15:45.531 --> 00:15:46.364
<v Speaker 3>that you attribute to things is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>stable and you have to readjust those </v>

239
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:50.174
<v Speaker 3>and during that period of readjustment</v>
<v Speaker 3>your emotions are dysregulated and the </v>

240
00:15:56.451 --> 00:15:59.120
<v Speaker 3>mythological way of referring to that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sense,</v>

241
00:15:59.121 --> 00:15:59.954
<v Speaker 3>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you return to the state preceding the </v>

242
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:07.691
<v Speaker 3>division of order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every act of creation is</v>

243
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.470
<v Speaker 4>has the mythological structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>construction of the world.</v>

244
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.043
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

245
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.073
<v Speaker 3>the group tells you how to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it provides a good answer when </v>

246
00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:21.694
<v Speaker 3>you're an adolescent to the problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>that poses that are posed to you as a </v>

247
00:16:24.881 --> 00:16:26.680
<v Speaker 3>consequence of your development that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

248
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.523
<v Speaker 3>Karen's cannot answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is is that a group provides </v>

249
00:16:32.471 --> 00:16:35.200
<v Speaker 3>a determined a dancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a list of rules.</v>

250
00:16:35.201 --> 00:16:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Essentially it says that good is such </v>
<v Speaker 3>and such and that bad or evil,</v>

251
00:16:39.461 --> 00:16:40.294
<v Speaker 3>it's such in session,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is perfectly fine under most </v>

252
00:16:42.611 --> 00:16:46.990
<v Speaker 3>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does upon location ochre that the</v>

253
00:16:46.991 --> 00:16:47.824
<v Speaker 3>fact of the group presents a problem or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the group's notion of how to adapt to </v>

254
00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.150
<v Speaker 3>the environment is wrong.</v>

255
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.360
<v Speaker 3>That happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

256
00:16:55.361 --> 00:16:56.194
<v Speaker 3>when if you have a group belief that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very strong and I have one that's very </v>

257
00:16:59.381 --> 00:17:00.214
<v Speaker 3>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we engage in a dispute that results in </v>

258
00:17:02.231 --> 00:17:07.231
<v Speaker 3>our mutual the minds and for me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicates that there's a problem.</v>

259
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.993
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a strange situation because it </v>

260
00:17:11.501 --> 00:17:12.334
<v Speaker 3>isn't the case that under many </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions people will risk their own </v>

261
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.940
<v Speaker 3>extinction in order to maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of their roots.</v>

262
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.343
<v Speaker 3>So there you can take the position that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the best thing to do is to die </v>

263
00:17:25.061 --> 00:17:27.640
<v Speaker 3>for the fatherland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically means that</v>

264
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:30.603
<v Speaker 3>even the problem as extreme as the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that your group identification might </v>

265
00:17:33.101 --> 00:17:33.934
<v Speaker 3>kill you isn't sufficient problem to </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicate that there's something wrong </v>

266
00:17:36.761 --> 00:17:37.594
<v Speaker 3>with its structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have some extreme authoritarian </v>

267
00:17:40.181 --> 00:17:41.014
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to take the position </v>

268
00:17:41.741 --> 00:17:42.574
<v Speaker 3>that the fact that group</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our caused conflict is an indication </v>

269
00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:48.964
<v Speaker 3>that there's something wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that the group is the final </v>

270
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:55.200
<v Speaker 3>solution to all of your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a choice</v>

271
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.943
<v Speaker 3>if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that you have to have group </v>

272
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:05.304
<v Speaker 3>identification in order to make sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your emotional experience because you </v>

273
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:09.474
<v Speaker 3>need a way of limiting the meaning the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things offered to you to some </v>

274
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.473
<v Speaker 3>comprehensive aligned acceptable domain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we also know that group </v>

275
00:18:18.871 --> 00:18:22.200
<v Speaker 3>identification has its own set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>

276
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:23.303
<v Speaker 3>so what we need is a solution that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the advantages of group </v>

277
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:28.020
<v Speaker 3>identification without any of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>disadvantages.</v>

278
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.603
<v Speaker 3>Positive parents are the positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative three to this chart as the </v>

279
00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:37.374
<v Speaker 3>capacity not to identify with the group</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to move to a state where giving due </v>

280
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:49.491
<v Speaker 3>respect to the group you identify with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the process that brings it into being,</v>

281
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.970
<v Speaker 3>which makes you the agent that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

282
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.153
<v Speaker 3>which makes you determine that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>process that constructs the group is </v>

283
00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 3>actually more important than the group </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself and that gives you,</v>

284
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.353
<v Speaker 3>that gives you a way to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically means a structure that </v>

285
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.473
<v Speaker 3>regulates your emotions and also </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that attributes to determine </v>

286
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:14.480
<v Speaker 3>the meaning to all of them.</v>

287
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.300
<v Speaker 4>All of these experiences</v>
<v Speaker 4>first and adolescence.</v>

288
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.050
<v Speaker 4>That's identification with her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the second one,</v>

289
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.010
<v Speaker 4>the identification,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the group hero.</v>

290
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.243
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the first case it's not </v>

291
00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 3>identification with the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's reliance on their word dependence.</v>

292
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on the crew.</v>

293
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.423
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that would be identification with </v>

294
00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:53.190
<v Speaker 3>the parents are actually in the second </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage because that's basically,</v>

295
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.880
<v Speaker 3>if you think of the group as sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstract,</v>

296
00:19:55.881 --> 00:19:56.714
<v Speaker 3>that parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a perfectly reasonable way of </v>

297
00:19:57.871 --> 00:19:58.704
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact usually what your parents are </v>

298
00:20:00.421 --> 00:20:01.254
<v Speaker 3>when you're a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not so much of your parents as </v>

299
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:06.210
<v Speaker 3>those representatives of the group that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to come into contact with.</v>

300
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.793
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the reason I think why </v>

301
00:20:08.491 --> 00:20:09.324
<v Speaker 3>it's often difficult because this comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>up frequently with people who have the </v>

302
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:14.223
<v Speaker 3>dependent type of neurotic personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they can't disassociate themselves </v>

303
00:20:17.161 --> 00:20:17.994
<v Speaker 3>from their parents because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that their parents know that what </v>

304
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:25.560
<v Speaker 3>they see in their parents isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 3>group and not the parents.</v>

305
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.810
<v Speaker 3>This is especially true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the father,</v>

306
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 3>your father is more than an individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a sense.</v>

307
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:32.124
<v Speaker 3>He's also the intermediary that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>first encountered who embodies all of </v>

308
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:39.390
<v Speaker 3>culture and as a consequence he's a fit </v>
<v Speaker 3>a finger.</v>

309
00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:40.224
<v Speaker 3>In a sense that's much more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>than P is when construed simply as an </v>

310
00:20:44.551 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

311
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 4>Where is the identification and we kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of stuff.</v>

312
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:53.463
<v Speaker 4>If the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the goal of the journey is a dedication </v>

313
00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.900
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a particular,</v>

314
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.950
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your event and it's on the parents,</v>

315
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.940
<v Speaker 4>which is also a culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where is it?</v>

316
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:08.590
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It depended on the,</v>

317
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.573
<v Speaker 4>on the cell.</v>

318
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by the cell?</v>

319
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.030
<v Speaker 3>I think in terms of their guys in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different form of neurotic.</v>

320
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you mean selfishness?</v>

321
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

322
00:21:25.231 --> 00:21:26.430
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you mean.</v>

323
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.340
<v Speaker 4>We're being being filled by themself </v>
<v Speaker 4>like self dependence,</v>

324
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.423
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

325
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.500
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I was reading something about</v>

326
00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:34.334
<v Speaker 3>that just before we came down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a newspaper article about when </v>

327
00:21:36.771 --> 00:21:39.830
<v Speaker 3>the free ball moisture's new papers for </v>
<v Speaker 3>my sister</v>

328
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:45.380
<v Speaker 3>has been making the claim recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The aggressive behaviors associated with</v>

329
00:21:45.381 --> 00:21:48.140
<v Speaker 3>inflated self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he puts that,</v>

330
00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.230
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting paper because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>puts that in the following context.</v>

331
00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:52.483
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in elementary schools and junior high </v>

332
00:21:53.451 --> 00:21:58.280
<v Speaker 3>schools across the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the self esteem movement has been making</v>

333
00:21:58.281 --> 00:22:03.281
<v Speaker 3>great inroads and the self esteem </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement basically proposes that as long</v>

334
00:22:03.831 --> 00:22:06.230
<v Speaker 3>as you feel good about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing else matters.</v>

335
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.093
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with that is that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>uses indiscriminate positive </v>

336
00:22:10.071 --> 00:22:10.904
<v Speaker 3>reinforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I regard actually as a form of </v>

337
00:22:12.621 --> 00:22:13.454
<v Speaker 3>abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it makes the world unpredictable or </v>

338
00:22:15.511 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 3>reward you regardless of what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm telling you essentially is that</v>

339
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.030
<v Speaker 3>what you do has zero meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

340
00:22:23.031 --> 00:22:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Because it's not informative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You change your behavior,</v>

341
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.840
<v Speaker 3>nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means you had,</v>

342
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.680
<v Speaker 3>that means you're powerless basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>

343
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw an article in the globe about</v>

344
00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:35.930
<v Speaker 3>that they were saying come studies done </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they had the head,</v>

345
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.823
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask a group of Japanese students of </v>

346
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.700
<v Speaker 3>American students who had both taken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

347
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.553
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the same article taking math </v>

348
00:22:44.391 --> 00:22:45.224
<v Speaker 3>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they felt about themselves in the </v>

349
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.473
<v Speaker 3>Japanese and scored a considerable </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of higher and they feel so good </v>

350
00:22:51.981 --> 00:22:54.920
<v Speaker 3>about themselves or the American kids at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that point I felt great.</v>

351
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:55.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

352
00:22:55.721 --> 00:22:56.450
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

353
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:57.283
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

354
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

355
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.023
<v Speaker 4>but that's another point that if the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole point of behaviors to regulate </v>

356
00:23:06.281 --> 00:23:09.280
<v Speaker 4>your emotions and you're able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulate your emotion that way,</v>

357
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:10.660
<v Speaker 4>why bother with,</v>

358
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:11.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they'd only,</v>

359
00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.090
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good,</v>

360
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:13.923
<v Speaker 3>that's a perfectly good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that ties into some other social </v>

361
00:23:16.301 --> 00:23:18.330
<v Speaker 3>psychological research on self </v>
<v Speaker 3>deception.</v>

362
00:23:18.331 --> 00:23:19.164
<v Speaker 3>You actually feeling good about yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite the actual environment only </v>

363
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:26.380
<v Speaker 3>worked with for a very short period of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

364
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good short term solution.</v>

365
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:30.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can,</v>

366
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.220
<v Speaker 3>if you fail an exam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>

367
00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:34.360
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>

368
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

369
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

370
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Except that failing the exam might </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually mean that you don't get through</v>

371
00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:43.620
<v Speaker 3>graduate school for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sooner or later these,</v>

372
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.500
<v Speaker 3>let's say these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

373
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.363
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things that you're not going to </v>

374
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:50.540
<v Speaker 3>pay attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've decided not to pay attention</v>

375
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:52.810
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to accumulate and,</v>

376
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 3>and beat you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the problem.</v>

377
00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 3>We know neurotic solutions work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people use them,</v>

378
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that it's true.</v>

379
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:02.863
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is they don't work in the </v>

380
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:08.510
<v Speaker 3>long term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why,</v>

381
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.613
<v Speaker 3>let me read you some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have answer answered your </v>

382
00:24:11.271 --> 00:24:12.930
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just sort of zipped around.</v>

383
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.913
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a complicated question and that's </v>

384
00:24:18.141 --> 00:24:20.510
<v Speaker 3>why I'm sort of hitting it from </v>
<v Speaker 3>different perspectives.</v>

385
00:24:20.511 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 3>And I know you addressed this issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

386
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:27.723
<v Speaker 3>The thing that you're talking about has </v>
<v Speaker 3>more to do with presuming that you're </v>

387
00:24:29.711 --> 00:24:32.080
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite all evidence to the contrary.</v>

388
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.410
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

389
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.393
<v Speaker 3>that's worship of the self in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you mean and I'm not going to talk </v>

390
00:24:40.181 --> 00:24:43.270
<v Speaker 3>about that anymore because the starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>next week,</v>

391
00:24:43.271 --> 00:24:44.104
<v Speaker 3>everything that we discussed for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of the course is directly related </v>

392
00:24:46.571 --> 00:24:47.920
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>

393
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.203
<v Speaker 3>We've given this diagram here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've talked a little bit about the </v>

394
00:24:53.351 --> 00:24:54.184
<v Speaker 3>structure of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chaos that exists prior to the </v>

395
00:24:55.961 --> 00:24:59.070
<v Speaker 3>division of things into order in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's represented by the drag.</v>

396
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:00.503
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about the unknown and it's </v>

397
00:25:01.931 --> 00:25:04.210
<v Speaker 3>caused of aspect and it's negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect.</v>

398
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:05.763
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about the known in its </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial and secure aspect and as </v>

399
00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:10.774
<v Speaker 3>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've only talked about the </v>

400
00:25:13.601 --> 00:25:16.510
<v Speaker 3>individual in terms of the positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect,</v>

401
00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.403
<v Speaker 3>which is the process that separates the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky and the earth or that distinguishes </v>

402
00:25:21.821 --> 00:25:22.654
<v Speaker 3>between order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've never talked about the negative </v>

403
00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:25.114
<v Speaker 3>aspect of the individual and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably why this question keeps </v>

404
00:25:28.841 --> 00:25:29.674
<v Speaker 3>popping up in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the census we only have five sixths </v>

405
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:33.364
<v Speaker 3>of the story and there's a big hole </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the other sixth should be and </v>

406
00:25:37.841 --> 00:25:39.790
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're going to start to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about next week.</v>

407
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.390
<v Speaker 3>So part of the part of the question is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

408
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.350
<v Speaker 3>why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it that?</v>

409
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.433
<v Speaker 3>Why would you ever say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put yourself in a situation where you </v>

410
00:25:49.961 --> 00:25:52.330
<v Speaker 3>tell yourself a story that you know not </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be true?</v>

411
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a very peculiar idea because </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals don't do that.</v>

412
00:25:56.291 --> 00:25:57.124
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzees will use a little bit of </v>

413
00:25:58.001 --> 00:25:58.834
<v Speaker 3>deception on other chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's about as developed as </v>

414
00:26:03.761 --> 00:26:05.450
<v Speaker 3>deception seems to be in the animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>came.</v>

415
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.083
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever that animal's actually ever </v>

416
00:26:11.051 --> 00:26:15.450
<v Speaker 3>fooled themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we do that all the time now.</v>

417
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:19.480
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the path it's defined in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythology is a very dangerous one.</v>

418
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.993
<v Speaker 3>Part of what we want to figure out is </v>
<v Speaker 3>why would people be motivated to do </v>

419
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:26.420
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like part of it.</v>

420
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:27.423
<v Speaker 3>Part of the problem is is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're cruising along your track and a </v>

421
00:26:31.451 --> 00:26:32.284
<v Speaker 3>piece of information emerges and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that piece of information is so </v>

422
00:26:37.031 --> 00:26:39.360
<v Speaker 3>terrible that I can't deal with it.</v>

423
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 3>So it's just shunted aside and you're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a box,</v>

424
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 3>which is your story that you know to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>insufficient,</v>

425
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.900
<v Speaker 3>but you're also not sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced of your own adaptive potential</v>

426
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:52.973
<v Speaker 3>to risk stepping outside of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you're in in the little trap </v>

427
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.220
<v Speaker 3>that gets smaller and smaller all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

428
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:00.953
<v Speaker 3>There's a story in this manuscript about</v>
<v Speaker 3>a north African tribe called the mayor </v>

429
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.693
<v Speaker 3>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they do this interesting little </v>

430
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:12.144
<v Speaker 3>ritual to Scorpion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this is a true story or </v>

431
00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:16.074
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might just be a matter that doesn't </v>

432
00:27:17.971 --> 00:27:18.804
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take a scarf and they put it in the </v>

433
00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 3>sand and they draw a big circle around </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

434
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.703
<v Speaker 3>And the Scorpion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's sort of upset about being </v>

435
00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:29.670
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by these larger creatures </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempts to escape.</v>

436
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:32.610
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as it comes up to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the groove in the sand,</v>

437
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.940
<v Speaker 3>it just runs around the circle and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>cross the border.</v>

438
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:40.680
<v Speaker 3>So then the mayor both takes the circle </v>
<v Speaker 3>and divides it in half and the skirt and</v>

439
00:27:40.681 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 3>zips around inside the half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>

440
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.003
<v Speaker 3>And then the mirror divides the circle </v>
<v Speaker 3>into quarters and the Scorpion is </v>

441
00:27:48.031 --> 00:27:49.770
<v Speaker 3>getting more and more frantic all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

442
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.350
<v Speaker 3>confined to the smaller and smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

443
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bisect the area so drastically that</v>

444
00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.570
<v Speaker 3>the Scorpion can't move and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>stings itself.</v>

445
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.463
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

446
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.953
<v Speaker 3>That's a good story of what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you if you constantly believe that </v>

447
00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:09.144
<v Speaker 3>you're in a position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually better than the one that </v>

448
00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 3>you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

449
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.243
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you that story again because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think it's related directly to the </v>

450
00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:18.530
<v Speaker 3>question that you're at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're asking.</v>

451
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

452
00:28:24.091 --> 00:28:26.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you started reading paradise lost?</v>

453
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:28.523
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a story about what happens when </v>

454
00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 3>you think that what you know is all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to be.</v>

455
00:28:31.381 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

456
00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:33.204
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the adoption of the position of </v>

457
00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:35.484
<v Speaker 3>false on students and the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that are that you ended up in a </v>

458
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.960
<v Speaker 3>situation that's very much analogous to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that of the skirting.</v>

459
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.633
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

460
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know whether to close who</v>

461
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.190
<v Speaker 3>was in this discussion and start the new</v>
<v Speaker 3>section when you finish it.</v>

462
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.153
<v Speaker 3>Cause we haven't talked about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different forms of the normalist </v>

463
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:11.274
<v Speaker 3>information yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we should just go to the next </v>

464
00:29:19.521 --> 00:29:22.750
<v Speaker 3>section.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take a look into</v>

465
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.130
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess what we'll do,</v>

466
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.023
<v Speaker 3>I'll be</v>

467
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:31.303
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

468
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:41.603
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that we discussed just</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the class broke was how and why </v>

469
00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 3>is it the stories came to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructive and it's part of the reason</v>

470
00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:49.624
<v Speaker 3>that we were interested in you because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's obvious that some of the stories </v>

471
00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:53.650
<v Speaker 3>that you tell yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't actually know.</v>

472
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:59.050
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you would have read Mark Mesopotamian</v>

473
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:02.670
<v Speaker 3>creation myth three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my guess is that</v>

474
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:05.303
<v Speaker 3>it would obstruct you as bizarre tale of</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as something that had any meaning </v>

475
00:30:10.931 --> 00:30:14.170
<v Speaker 3>that was relevant to the present time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that easy to figure out what it</v>

476
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:15.004
<v Speaker 3>might mean for sort of go on to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>elected as the highest of all the gods </v>

477
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:20.314
<v Speaker 3>and then go out and kind of have to drag</v>
<v Speaker 3>it from the purely a literal </v>

478
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:27.310
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't seem to be a story that has</v>

479
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:29.040
<v Speaker 3>very much meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

480
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very old story.</v>

481
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 3>And if you track its development </v>
<v Speaker 3>historically,</v>

482
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.850
<v Speaker 3>you can see how the idea is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>embedded in that story</v>

483
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:42.723
<v Speaker 3>conditioned all sorts of behaviors that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually engaging in as far as this </v>

484
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:52.681
<v Speaker 3>is of course open to to any about </v>
<v Speaker 3>historical interpretation.</v>

485
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.990
<v Speaker 3>But it seems to me that you can make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable case that the Mesopotamian,</v>

486
00:30:56.991 --> 00:30:57.824
<v Speaker 3>the idea that there's something divine </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the capacity of conquer the </v>

487
00:31:00.971 --> 00:31:01.804
<v Speaker 3>unknown and to construct things as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence developed into the Egyptian </v>

488
00:31:06.491 --> 00:31:09.650
<v Speaker 3>idea that the optimal pharaoh with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's similar,</v>

489
00:31:09.651 --> 00:31:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Paisley embodied the state and updated </v>
<v Speaker 3>the state.</v>

490
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:17.850
<v Speaker 3>And it's not much of a leap from that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Judeo Christian perspective,</v>

491
00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:21.040
<v Speaker 3>which says that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>eternal,</v>

492
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.320
<v Speaker 3>immortal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and divine about each person.</v>

493
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.640
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you accept that line of logic,</v>

494
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.780
<v Speaker 3>then you have to also accept the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can act out stories by yourself</v>

495
00:31:34.031 --> 00:31:39.010
<v Speaker 3>and with others in huge groups without </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding what the stories mean.</v>

496
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.583
<v Speaker 3>And the next step of logic after that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you don't understand what the </v>

497
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:47.170
<v Speaker 3>stories mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what form did they make?</v>

498
00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:51.010
<v Speaker 3>How is it that they're coded?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how is it that they exist?</v>

499
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 3>They're not part of the objective world </v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

500
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.400
<v Speaker 3>They're not something that you can talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about unless you tell stories.</v>

501
00:31:57.401 --> 00:32:01.870
<v Speaker 3>They're not something you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least you don't know them well enough</v>

502
00:32:01.871 --> 00:32:02.704
<v Speaker 3>to say what they mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nonetheless they conditioned all of </v>

503
00:32:04.971 --> 00:32:05.804
<v Speaker 3>your behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question then is what form did </v>

504
00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:10.090
<v Speaker 3>that take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what this diagram was adapting.</v>

505
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.940
<v Speaker 3>Illustrate</v>
<v Speaker 3>every level of analysis.</v>

506
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:17.733
<v Speaker 3>The story you tell yourself is informed </v>
<v Speaker 3>by a variety of sources of information </v>

507
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:27.610
<v Speaker 3>ranging from the purely behavioral to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the entirely abstract,</v>

508
00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:28.773
<v Speaker 3>which is to say how your question is how</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it that I should have and the answer </v>

509
00:32:33.341 --> 00:32:38.341
<v Speaker 3>is well you should act and here's a list</v>
<v Speaker 3>of rules that are explicit or you should</v>

510
00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:40.154
<v Speaker 3>act like person a acts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that you should imitate </v>

511
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:43.394
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you'll do naturally </v>

512
00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:48.650
<v Speaker 3>anyways or all act out some hypothetical</v>
<v Speaker 3>sequences and you can,</v>

513
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 3>you can coffee them and that would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole drama.</v>

514
00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Or I can tell you a story and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>absorb whatever information you can from</v>

515
00:32:54.801 --> 00:32:56.980
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use that to govern your behavior instead</v>

516
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.023
<v Speaker 3>of the stories you tell yourself are </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructed as a consequence of your </v>

517
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:02.684
<v Speaker 3>encounter with information at all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of different levels of analysis and </v>

518
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 3>different stories are coded at different</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels of analysis.</v>

519
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.260
<v Speaker 3>And it strikes me that the farther out </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

520
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.890
<v Speaker 3>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the farther out you know,</v>

521
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:23.480
<v Speaker 3>which is the more superordinate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story is the less</v>

522
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.473
<v Speaker 3>explicit the story becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say it's more coated in </v>

523
00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:31.850
<v Speaker 3>procedural knowledge and also the older </v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets,</v>

524
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.923
<v Speaker 3>which is I do think it's reasonable to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that as you move up the hierarchy </v>

525
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.513
<v Speaker 3>he moved back in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of looking at it so </v>

526
00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:43.730
<v Speaker 3>that the stories that you act out at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most superordinate level of analysis are</v>

527
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:45.740
<v Speaker 3>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what does that mean?</v>

528
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:46.963
<v Speaker 3>It means that everyone just act them out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and could hardly even describe them or </v>

529
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:55.370
<v Speaker 3>we have some stories about them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best we've been able to do.</v>

530
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.490
<v Speaker 3>And no one actually says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is what that story means.</v>

531
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 3>We just act as if the story's true and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we act as if it's true because,</v>

532
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 3>well that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough question at least because</v>

533
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:06.884
<v Speaker 3>it works.</v>

534
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:07.993
<v Speaker 3>And the funny thing is is that the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>story keeps emerging in culture after </v>

535
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:12.644
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it kind of leads you to the </v>

536
00:34:13.431 --> 00:34:14.264
<v Speaker 3>conclusion that there is actually one </v>
<v Speaker 3>story that works only who knows if </v>

537
00:34:18.231 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

538
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we tried to tie that,</v>

539
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:27.080
<v Speaker 3>this idea to the idea that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>different memory systems.</v>

540
00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:28.803
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean did the under d the understand </v>

541
00:34:30.801 --> 00:34:31.634
<v Speaker 3>how it is that you can figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>behave without being able to come up </v>

542
00:34:34.461 --> 00:34:36.440
<v Speaker 3>with a description of how it is that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>behave?</v>

543
00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.420
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems reasonably clear to everyone.</v>

544
00:34:41.421 --> 00:34:42.254
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are conditioning each other's </v>

545
00:34:42.771 --> 00:34:45.020
<v Speaker 3>behavior all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the basic idea.</v>

546
00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.213
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever we're engaged in any sort of </v>

547
00:34:48.051 --> 00:34:50.840
<v Speaker 3>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're modifying our own behavior and the</v>

548
00:34:50.841 --> 00:34:51.674
<v Speaker 3>behavior of others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we do that to everyone we encounter </v>

549
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.003
<v Speaker 3>and everyone does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone does it over a huge expanse of </v>

550
00:34:57.051 --> 00:34:58.640
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a consequence,</v>

551
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.590
<v Speaker 3>a pattern emerges that we more or less </v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

552
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.890
<v Speaker 3>etc. And when we don't accept that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a big fight and someone wins and</v>

553
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:07.730
<v Speaker 3>someone loses and whoever wins their </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior continues in the future.</v>

554
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:13.400
<v Speaker 3>So we gathered patterns of behavior over</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and integrate them into a statement</v>

555
00:35:13.401 --> 00:35:16.640
<v Speaker 3>that's more or less coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we're trying to do is to figure</v>

556
00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:19.870
<v Speaker 3>out what's the essence of that coherent </v>
<v Speaker 3>and long lasting statement.</v>

557
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.733
<v Speaker 5>I agree with what you're saying that um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people can't come up with a conscious </v>

558
00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:28.090
<v Speaker 5>representation of how they act,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

559
00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.520
<v Speaker 5>or a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think they do know,</v>

560
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.180
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of ways of acquiring,</v>

561
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:34.820
<v Speaker 5>even if they can't consciously say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

562
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:38.120
<v Speaker 5>somebody else is doing and then they </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to give it those behaviors</v>

563
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.880
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know that they should imitate other</v>

564
00:35:40.881 --> 00:35:41.850
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

565
00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:42.693
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems to me that's a very peculiar </v>

566
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:45.624
<v Speaker 3>thing and it's the thing that I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>provides the strongest evidence for the </v>

567
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 3>existence of something like humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>archetype.</v>

568
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.210
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the things you could say </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

569
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.890
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you admire someone?</v>

570
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Well you might say it's because they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>get something that you want.</v>

571
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a pretty mechanistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation and you don't really have to</v>

572
00:36:03.391 --> 00:36:04.224
<v Speaker 3>pause at any underlying predisposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that you have to want </v>

573
00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:11.610
<v Speaker 3>something and you have to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>observe that someone else gets it.</v>

574
00:36:11.611 --> 00:36:12.444
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that's sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it strikes me that the capacity do </v>

575
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.030
<v Speaker 3>admire someone is more deeply rooted </v>
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

576
00:36:18.031 --> 00:36:22.290
<v Speaker 3>And it's not purely driven by </v>
<v Speaker 3>observations that someone else gets what</v>

577
00:36:22.291 --> 00:36:23.124
<v Speaker 3>you want more effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems to me that that's actually </v>

578
00:36:25.411 --> 00:36:28.710
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that bootstrap to </v>
<v Speaker 3>children's development can.</v>

579
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.380
<v Speaker 3>I can remember when I was very young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well not all that,</v>

580
00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get some great one.</v>

581
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 3>How much I admired the boy across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street who was in grade three and for me</v>

582
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:41.400
<v Speaker 3>that was a huge gap at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was someone I want it to be like.</v>

583
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:45.510
<v Speaker 3>And I don't really think it was perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was at least in part because he could</v>

584
00:36:45.511 --> 00:36:46.344
<v Speaker 3>do things I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seemed to be something that was </v>

585
00:36:47.971 --> 00:36:50.130
<v Speaker 3>more global than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

586
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.233
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't built up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think from repeated observations that </v>

587
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:54.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

588
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.440
<v Speaker 3>he could ride a bike faster than me or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

589
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.040
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that was,</v>

590
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:02.730
<v Speaker 3>do you think it's just that same sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea but didn't buy it in a more general</v>

591
00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:04.200
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he knows what to do.</v>

592
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

593
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:07.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm comfortable in doing that.</v>

594
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Well true enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>true enough.</v>

595
00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:11.184
<v Speaker 3>But like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you sense that his story is better </v>

596
00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:18.444
<v Speaker 3>than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

597
00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.770
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>

598
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.053
<v Speaker 3>But it is also the case that children </v>
<v Speaker 3>start to imitate at such an early age </v>

599
00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:24.774
<v Speaker 3>that it's hard to believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason they're doing it is because they </v>

600
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.830
<v Speaker 3>drawn an inference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

601
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 3>Because like kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>

602
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.360
<v Speaker 3>there is some evidence that newborns can</v>
<v Speaker 3>imitate.</v>

603
00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.210
<v Speaker 3>You may want to take facial gestures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's debatable,</v>

604
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:40.710
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't take very long after that</v>
<v Speaker 3>to find,</v>

605
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.790
<v Speaker 3>it isn't much after birth that children </v>
<v Speaker 3>do imitate.</v>

606
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:45.893
<v Speaker 3>And you can say that's because they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>driven by these sorts of mechanistic </v>

607
00:37:49.771 --> 00:37:50.604
<v Speaker 3>inferences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it looks to me like it's something </v>

608
00:37:51.511 --> 00:37:53.250
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more profound.</v>

609
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:54.203
<v Speaker 3>I want to just tell you one other piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of evidence that's something equivalent </v>

610
00:37:57.331 --> 00:38:00.000
<v Speaker 3>to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will have to Rett Syndrome,</v>

611
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.343
<v Speaker 3>types of disinhibition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disinhibition of procedural memory </v>

612
00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:05.820
<v Speaker 3>habits is what it looks like.</v>

613
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.043
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you feed them little bits of </v>

614
00:38:09.121 --> 00:38:12.450
<v Speaker 3>antipsychotic medication alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often damp and out there motor ticks,</v>

615
00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:14.820
<v Speaker 3>but they're called techs and the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>take them a ticket,</v>

616
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:17.820
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that ticks can be very complex.</v>

617
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:18.654
<v Speaker 3>Like people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have tourette's syndrome can do very </v>

618
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:20.994
<v Speaker 3>complex things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a film once of a sculptor who had </v>

619
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:26.880
<v Speaker 3>two rats and he was a realistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>sculpture and he was very,</v>

620
00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:27.714
<v Speaker 3>very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had two nets unbelievably badly and </v>

621
00:38:30.401 --> 00:38:34.380
<v Speaker 3>his motor behaviors completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>dysregulated and basically he'd sit down</v>

622
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:37.840
<v Speaker 3>and kind of motor tic would get them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he'd get up and walk over and then he</v>

623
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:41.890
<v Speaker 3>could sort of control it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we adjust the stereo and that was it.</v>

624
00:38:41.891 --> 00:38:42.724
<v Speaker 3>Like it was all involuntary behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>until they go up near the Stereo and </v>

625
00:38:44.881 --> 00:38:45.714
<v Speaker 3>then you can control it enough to to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just add his twist to the behavior and </v>

626
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:49.534
<v Speaker 3>then he'd come back and sit down and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like bouncing up and down like this </v>

627
00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:53.330
<v Speaker 3>all the time and that's how we do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>sculpture.</v>

628
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.233
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd be sitting and he'd have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tick and he'd get up and he move and </v>

629
00:38:57.311 --> 00:38:59.930
<v Speaker 3>then has gone from being over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pick up his knife and make it</v>

630
00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.550
<v Speaker 3>two rats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason I'm telling you this story is</v>

631
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.130
<v Speaker 3>because people with Tourette's syndrome </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very,</v>

632
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very imitative.</v>

633
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:11.933
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a story actually where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to live in northern Alberta a </v>

634
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:16.930
<v Speaker 3>little bit farther north.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a group of how to rights.</v>

635
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.080
<v Speaker 3>I think they were a hunter rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might've been mennonites.</v>

636
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.953
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with these isolated </v>

637
00:39:21.521 --> 00:39:24.250
<v Speaker 3>religious populations as they tend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get someone in bread,</v>

638
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 3>and one of the consequences of this in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this northern colony was very high rates</v>

639
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:29.260
<v Speaker 3>of Tourette Syndrome.</v>

640
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.130
<v Speaker 6>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the stories I remember about that</v>

641
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:34.510
<v Speaker 6>was all of these,</v>

642
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.960
<v Speaker 3>I think you were mennonites sitting in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>church together.</v>

643
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.460
<v Speaker 3>A bird flew into the church and they all</v>
<v Speaker 3>flat,</v>

644
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.123
<v Speaker 3>large proportion of population </v>
<v Speaker 3>involuntary flap their hands because </v>

645
00:39:45.031 --> 00:39:47.250
<v Speaker 3>they were imitating the bird and two </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights.</v>

646
00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.533
<v Speaker 3>One of the things the two reds also does</v>
<v Speaker 3>to people is give them an uncanny </v>

647
00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:52.283
<v Speaker 3>ability to mimic and caricatures or </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people by copying their motor </v>

648
00:39:55.531 --> 00:39:56.750
<v Speaker 3>habits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

649
00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:58.043
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason I'm telling you this is </v>

650
00:39:59.851 --> 00:40:04.230
<v Speaker 3>because it looks like the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mimic is something that's underneath the</v>

651
00:40:04.231 --> 00:40:06.750
<v Speaker 3>capacity to form abstract </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations.</v>

652
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.060
<v Speaker 3>It's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more primordial.</v>

653
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is,</v>

654
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.140
<v Speaker 3>this is just to say that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological.</v>

655
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.330
<v Speaker 3>It's hard wiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

656
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.510
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I was talking about the why.</v>

657
00:40:18.511 --> 00:40:19.344
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some support for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>union notion of an architect with </v>

658
00:40:21.691 --> 00:40:22.524
<v Speaker 3>regards to the mutation is you can come </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with a good explanation for why </v>

659
00:40:25.471 --> 00:40:29.640
<v Speaker 3>people imitated by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see that what you do is more efficient</v>

660
00:40:29.641 --> 00:40:30.474
<v Speaker 3>than what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that does drive invitation </v>

661
00:40:32.341 --> 00:40:33.174
<v Speaker 3>to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also another level of </v>

662
00:40:34.261 --> 00:40:36.000
<v Speaker 3>invitation and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more</v>

663
00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.150
<v Speaker 6>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you select what?</v>

664
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.850
<v Speaker 6>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's the selection process?</v>

665
00:40:40.851 --> 00:40:42.320
<v Speaker 6>Why the boy that you focused on?</v>

666
00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good,</v>

667
00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:44.670
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

668
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:45.703
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I don't know what level of </v>

669
00:40:47.941 --> 00:40:50.850
<v Speaker 3>analysis you're asking that question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean in general,</v>

670
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.840
<v Speaker 3>why do people do it?</v>

671
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:56.340
<v Speaker 6>You're the way you're describing </v>
<v Speaker 6>mutation without the inferential part.</v>

672
00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:57.903
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not as a result then what's the </v>

673
00:41:00.241 --> 00:41:00.920
<v Speaker 6>process?</v>

674
00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.070
<v Speaker 3>That's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that's it.</v>

675
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.250
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I would,</v>

676
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.793
<v Speaker 6>hm.</v>

677
00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I would.</v>

678
00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I would surmise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did I ever show you that picture,</v>

679
00:41:15.621 --> 00:41:18.750
<v Speaker 3>that eastern picture of the recurrent </v>
<v Speaker 3>artists sat?</v>

680
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

681
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.543
<v Speaker 3>The image of basically the image of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>savior that's constantly recurring </v>

682
00:41:24.681 --> 00:41:27.050
<v Speaker 3>throughout time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

683
00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.093
<v Speaker 3>I think that the notion that we have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>innate sense of what's appropriate </v>

684
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 3>globally is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would say that,</v>

685
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

686
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.780
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like with gray leg geese I guess is</v>

687
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 3>a great like goose will attach itself to</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

688
00:41:46.311 --> 00:41:49.850
<v Speaker 3>So it has the capacity to develop an </v>
<v Speaker 3>exceptional attachment,</v>

689
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.583
<v Speaker 3>but it also has to see something in its </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment for that capacity to </v>

690
00:41:55.941 --> 00:41:56.990
<v Speaker 3>manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

691
00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:57.824
<v Speaker 3>That same printing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I suspect that's what our general </v>

692
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:00.824
<v Speaker 3>proclivity is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like say it's analogous to the </v>

693
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.413
<v Speaker 3>notion of the possibility for developing</v>
<v Speaker 3>condition fears more easily to some </v>

694
00:42:08.391 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal than others.</v>

695
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.630
<v Speaker 3>So like if I want to make you afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

696
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.183
<v Speaker 3>say I take you into the lab and I show </v>
<v Speaker 3>you some pictures of an electric outlet </v>

697
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.993
<v Speaker 3>and I give you an electric shock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time you see one or I show you a </v>

698
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:21.560
<v Speaker 3>picture of a snake and I give you an </v>
<v Speaker 3>electric shock,</v>

699
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.453
<v Speaker 3>every time you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll develop conditioned fear to the </v>

700
00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:28.040
<v Speaker 3>picture of the snake faster than to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture of the electric outlet.</v>

701
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.413
<v Speaker 3>So it's not exactly as if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>innately afraid of the snake is just </v>

702
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:33.674
<v Speaker 3>that in the presence of a snake you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easier for you to develop fear and </v>

703
00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:39.224
<v Speaker 3>my guess is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we kind of have the same or similar </v>

704
00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:45.260
<v Speaker 3>sort of mechanism operating with regards</v>
<v Speaker 3>to heroic behavior.</v>

705
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.430
<v Speaker 3>It's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have the capacity this to no one when</v>

706
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:54.431
<v Speaker 3>we see it and it's at the level of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>global pattern recognition.</v>

707
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.610
<v Speaker 3>So that's a speculation</v>

708
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.003
<v Speaker 4>isn't everything that we know how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Irritation or their child learns how to </v>

709
00:43:04.401 --> 00:43:06.490
<v Speaker 4>speak by imitating.</v>

710
00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:07.883
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another good example of the same </v>

711
00:43:09.571 --> 00:43:13.470
<v Speaker 3>sort of things the child does not </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly learn to speak by imitating.</v>

712
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:18.720
<v Speaker 3>Child has to have the capacity to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you take a chimpanzee,</v>

713
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:20.820
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chimpanzee,</v>

714
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.220
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to learn to be a concert </v>
<v Speaker 3>pianist.</v>

715
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:24.803
<v Speaker 3>It's because the chimpanzee doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the capacity to imitate that sort of </v>

716
00:43:27.541 --> 00:43:28.374
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also the case that no matter what </v>

717
00:43:29.911 --> 00:43:30.744
<v Speaker 3>you do with chimpanzee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's start going to learn to talk </v>

718
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.210
<v Speaker 3>because the chimpanzee doesn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>capacity to imitate speech.</v>

719
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.073
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people say that's because of the </v>

720
00:43:37.831 --> 00:43:41.490
<v Speaker 3>structure of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the morphology of its speech unit,</v>

721
00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.980
<v Speaker 3>but they're not very good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulating symbols either.</v>

722
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can get a little ways,</v>

723
00:43:46.171 --> 00:43:49.680
<v Speaker 3>but not very far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A child will pick up language very,</v>

724
00:43:49.681 --> 00:43:50.550
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>

725
00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:56.010
<v Speaker 3>What's that never hears?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then no,</v>

726
00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.350
<v Speaker 3>and there also seems to be a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>critical period,</v>

727
00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.400
<v Speaker 3>like if a child isn't exposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>language within a certain span of time,</v>

728
00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:03.653
<v Speaker 3>say at least by the age of 13 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not gonna be any language </v>

729
00:44:06.361 --> 00:44:08.230
<v Speaker 3>development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

730
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.350
<v Speaker 3>and it's not just imitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

731
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.800
<v Speaker 3>because the grammatical children make </v>
<v Speaker 3>standard types of grammatical errors</v>

732
00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:19.620
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't hear their parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>make.</v>

733
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.370
<v Speaker 3>So it isn't straight invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what skinner thought.</v>

734
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:29.000
<v Speaker 3>Part of the way it's not true because </v>
<v Speaker 3>children don't hear what Bait,</v>

735
00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.960
<v Speaker 3>the grammatical errors that children </v>
<v Speaker 3>make.</v>

736
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:31.943
<v Speaker 3>Parents don't make.</v>

737
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:36.600
<v Speaker 4>So they</v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

738
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 4>They act as if they learned moles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

739
00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.930
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's different,</v>

740
00:44:39.931 --> 00:44:40.770
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's different.</v>

741
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That language is,</v>

742
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:43.824
<v Speaker 4>the language is not invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I have a problem with them is very </v>

743
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:52.401
<v Speaker 4>much a and hardwired right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Capacity Children's say words or coach,</v>

744
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.030
<v Speaker 4>they have syntax ability that they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>never heard from them.</v>

745
00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:57.923
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can put him down and work together </v>

746
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.043
<v Speaker 4>and create sentences that spontaneously </v>
<v Speaker 4>they know that they've never heard </v>

747
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.393
<v Speaker 4>before in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Therefore I don't think it's really </v>

748
00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.670
<v Speaker 4>comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

749
00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.840
<v Speaker 4>just that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

750
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.353
<v Speaker 4>I think that both language and the myths</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we understand that we about layout </v>

751
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:22.110
<v Speaker 4>or don't understand fully tap into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious because you know,</v>

752
00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:22.944
<v Speaker 4>like these men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we understand them have symbols just </v>

753
00:45:26.281 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Speaker 4>like the snake now and that tax more </v>
<v Speaker 4>into our unconscious.</v>

754
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:31.190
<v Speaker 4>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the electric,</v>

755
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Noam Chomsky,</v>

756
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:39.190
<v Speaker 3>whose name you're undoubtedly familiar </v>
<v Speaker 3>with is very famous nyt.</v>

757
00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:40.523
<v Speaker 3>He's positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the existence of a language acquisition </v>

758
00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:45.400
<v Speaker 3>device,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not really all that informative</v>

759
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:48.000
<v Speaker 3>at the top concept because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really say what it is,</v>

760
00:45:48.001 --> 00:45:49.260
<v Speaker 3>but he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

761
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.273
<v Speaker 3>you need the capacity to develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>language as well as exposure to the </v>

762
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 3>appropriate environmental stimuli </v>
<v Speaker 3>nights.</v>

763
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do thing.</v>

764
00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:01.320
<v Speaker 3>But something similar operates at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological level.</v>

765
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.303
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're hardwired to appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 3>the structure of a narrative we now </v>

766
00:46:07.661 --> 00:46:08.820
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

767
00:46:08.821 --> 00:46:12.300
<v Speaker 3>how else do you explain the capacity of </v>
<v Speaker 3>children to be interested in stories?</v>

768
00:46:12.301 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you teach them that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

769
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.980
<v Speaker 3>if they weren't bloody well interested </v>
<v Speaker 3>in stories,</v>

770
00:46:16.981 --> 00:46:17.814
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't teach them anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's the precondition what </v>

771
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:24.810
<v Speaker 3>you can grab that and then use it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>final information into them.</v>

772
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.030
<v Speaker 3>But you don't teach that it's their </v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

773
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:28.440
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

774
00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:32.440
<v Speaker 3>well I think that's a form of grammar </v>
<v Speaker 3>and really what we're looking at in,</v>

775
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 3>in large part because the grammar of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythologies.</v>

776
00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:39.840
<v Speaker 3>So like your recognition of your Roy boy</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like a pattern.</v>

777
00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:40.853
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a process of inference </v>

778
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:46.620
<v Speaker 3>from just discrete behaviors right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy does this and I know.</v>

779
00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:47.251
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

780
00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:48.084
<v Speaker 3>I mean that may contribute to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's around it's recognition of a </v>

781
00:46:50.071 --> 00:46:51.750
<v Speaker 3>pattern of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

782
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:53.573
<v Speaker 3>He matches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right cause he matches a </v>

783
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:56.994
<v Speaker 3>pattern that's late in the ideas or </v>
<v Speaker 3>could it be a pattern you learn as a </v>

784
00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:05.970
<v Speaker 3>child with your parents?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it could be.</v>

785
00:47:05.971 --> 00:47:07.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah you can't.</v>

786
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:12.750
<v Speaker 3>You can make a plausible case for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanistic,</v>

787
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.113
<v Speaker 3>for the mechanistic acquisition of some </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this sort of thing except for the </v>

788
00:47:17.551 --> 00:47:22.551
<v Speaker 3>fact that imitative behavior seems in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some ways pre abstract and also that</v>

789
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't think children learn to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in stories.</v>

790
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:31.390
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they have that first.</v>

791
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.033
<v Speaker 3>Do you have anything useful comes to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the form of a story or a pattern of </v>

792
00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:37.054
<v Speaker 3>some sorts and it makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionarily that there's going to be </v>

793
00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:41.650
<v Speaker 3>huge selective pressure to be interested</v>
<v Speaker 3>in patterns and stories.</v>

794
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's how they,</v>

795
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.680
<v Speaker 3>that's how you learned to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

796
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:46.420
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't the case that,</v>

797
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's an example.</v>

798
00:47:48.671 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 3>This is a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went into Montreal last week and talk,</v>

799
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.093
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on an experimental project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're dealing with children who fight </v>

800
00:47:57.911 --> 00:47:58.744
<v Speaker 3>in school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have a population of kids that </v>

801
00:48:00.341 --> 00:48:03.940
<v Speaker 3>were tracked from kindergarten right </v>
<v Speaker 3>till they graduated basically.</v>

802
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:05.163
<v Speaker 3>And in six of the first 10 years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their schooling they were rated by </v>

803
00:48:08.531 --> 00:48:09.364
<v Speaker 3>teachers for fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can identify kids who are stable </v>

804
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:16.400
<v Speaker 3>fighters over the long term travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting about these kids,</v>

805
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.553
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear the standard routine about </v>

806
00:48:18.581 --> 00:48:20.020
<v Speaker 3>antisocial personalities.</v>

807
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.650
<v Speaker 3>They don't feel any anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

808
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:29.220
<v Speaker 3>But these kids are extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxious and I just had an honors student</v>

809
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:31.263
<v Speaker 3>write me a thesis about men who abused </v>
<v Speaker 3>their wives enough to be brought to the </v>

810
00:48:35.591 --> 00:48:37.870
<v Speaker 3>attention of courts and convicted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

811
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:40.930
<v Speaker 3>they tend to be criminal as you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspect,</v>

812
00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:42.610
<v Speaker 3>have lower Iqs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're very,</v>

813
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:44.650
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very anxious and depressed,</v>

814
00:48:44.651 --> 00:48:46.950
<v Speaker 3>which again doesn't fit very well with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the classic picture that he,</v>

815
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.793
<v Speaker 3>social personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks more like an antisocial </v>

816
00:48:50.021 --> 00:48:52.210
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feels anxious,</v>

817
00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:55.030
<v Speaker 3>but can't use that anxiety to regulate </v>
<v Speaker 3>their behavior.</v>

818
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Those two phenomena being separable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to say you could be very,</v>

819
00:48:58.631 --> 00:48:59.464
<v Speaker 3>very anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unless you know what to do with the </v>

820
00:49:00.611 --> 00:49:03.040
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not very useful and there's a lot</v>

821
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:04.620
<v Speaker 3>of reasons for believing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

822
00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

823
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.660
<v Speaker 3>I still want to stay focused on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

824
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have these kids.</v>

825
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:14.050
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to figure out what are these </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids like?</v>

826
00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.113
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're aggressive because they fight </v>

827
00:49:16.811 --> 00:49:17.644
<v Speaker 3>and teachers rate them is fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one thing we really know </v>

828
00:49:19.121 --> 00:49:19.954
<v Speaker 3>about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're very anxious and they're </v>

829
00:49:20.531 --> 00:49:21.364
<v Speaker 3>very depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the gentleman I'm working with </v>

830
00:49:23.981 --> 00:49:27.430
<v Speaker 3>there has been studying antisocial </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior in children for a long time.</v>

831
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:29.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

832
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.190
<v Speaker 3>I've told you before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the children's aggressive behavior peaks</v>

833
00:49:32.191 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 3>at two and then goes down hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From there.</v>

834
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:35.583
<v Speaker 3>You're more aggressive at two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you are at any other time in your </v>

835
00:49:37.001 --> 00:49:37.834
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets socialized somewhere around </v>

836
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:41.950
<v Speaker 3>between two and three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You learn these behavioral patterns.</v>

837
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.220
<v Speaker 3>What happens if you don't learn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the question.</v>

838
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what's relevant to your topic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

839
00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.630
<v Speaker 3>trump Nye said he's the character who </v>
<v Speaker 3>rented this study said,</v>

840
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:53.883
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're an adult and you don't fit </v>

841
00:49:54.851 --> 00:49:56.860
<v Speaker 3>into your peer group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you really don't fit in,</v>

842
00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.360
<v Speaker 3>you get put in prison said these kids in</v>
<v Speaker 3>kindergarten,</v>

843
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:02.470
<v Speaker 3>they're already in prison.</v>

844
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:04.383
<v Speaker 3>There's just no walls around them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just to say that because they </v>

845
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:09.880
<v Speaker 3>haven't learned the proper behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 3>rituals,</v>

846
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:11.403
<v Speaker 3>they're ostracized by their peer groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>so they don't fit into the standard </v>

847
00:50:16.181 --> 00:50:17.014
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy outside that hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They build their own hierarchy and it's </v>

848
00:50:21.431 --> 00:50:24.640
<v Speaker 3>based on force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the toughest kid.</v>

849
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:29.670
<v Speaker 3>So all the kids who get thrown out </v>
<v Speaker 3>cluster and the toughest kid wins.</v>

850
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:31.003
<v Speaker 3>And that's the genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going only the anti social </v>

851
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:36.150
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that whole anti social lifestyle,</v>

852
00:50:36.151 --> 00:50:36.984
<v Speaker 3>it's the same in prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dominant tire can prison is the </v>

853
00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.380
<v Speaker 3>meanest son of a bitch rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

854
00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 3>that's because outside of the proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy,</v>

855
00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:46.383
<v Speaker 3>the property development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to be normal socialized </v>

856
00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:48.554
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the default strategy for the </v>

857
00:50:50.841 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 3>erection of dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Higher at the most mackerel,</v>

858
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moral system.</v>

859
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what needs are as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most,</v>

860
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:58.390
<v Speaker 3>it's the most natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're,</v>

861
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.400
<v Speaker 3>if you're very impaired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the sort of freeze the motion.</v>

862
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.231
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

863
00:51:02.231 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 3>it's the most primitive then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

864
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.030
<v Speaker 3>in a sense it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

865
00:51:07.031 --> 00:51:09.080
<v Speaker 3>it's what you'll come to if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>given anything else.</v>

866
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

867
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:11.563
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what you'll come to if you're not </v>

868
00:51:12.981 --> 00:51:14.870
<v Speaker 3>given anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of putting it.</v>

869
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.670
<v Speaker 3>So when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

870
00:51:16.671 --> 00:51:19.990
<v Speaker 3>it's very important to pick up on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate sorts of behaviors as well.</v>

871
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:22.880
<v Speaker 3>Just an a story about why it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

872
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.110
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't learn to be properly </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosocial,</v>

873
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:27.020
<v Speaker 3>like these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

874
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.390
<v Speaker 3>if someone else has heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they won't go over to comfort them.</v>

875
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:33.170
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're highly aggressive and you</v>

876
00:51:33.171 --> 00:51:35.120
<v Speaker 3>find a load and you're quite anxious and</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed,</v>

877
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.100
<v Speaker 3>if you're helpful and you know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>share,</v>

878
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.670
<v Speaker 3>that's enough to get you into the group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

879
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:40.643
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're lacking even the most </v>

880
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 3>rudimentary forms of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of nonaggressive social behavior,</v>

881
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:46.610
<v Speaker 3>then you were an outcast.</v>

882
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:47.443
<v Speaker 3>And that's the consequence of not </v>
<v Speaker 3>picking up these initial for whatever </v>

883
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:50.930
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

884
00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:54.380
<v Speaker 3>the consequences are very severe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these kids,</v>

885
00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:55.214
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're the ones that are </v>

886
00:51:56.151 --> 00:51:58.570
<v Speaker 3>indiscriminate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforced because that's how you ruined</v>

887
00:51:58.571 --> 00:52:01.880
<v Speaker 3>a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you make sure that the rewards</v>

888
00:52:01.881 --> 00:52:02.714
<v Speaker 3>and punishments they received are </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely uncorrelated with their </v>

889
00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:09.821
<v Speaker 3>behavior because that makes them </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerless completely and makes the world</v>

890
00:52:11.031 --> 00:52:11.864
<v Speaker 3>very frustrating place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I had a friend in </v>

891
00:52:14.271 --> 00:52:15.104
<v Speaker 3>adolescence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he drove a white truck and that truck </v>

892
00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:20.114
<v Speaker 3>was dented on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every quarter panel was a pickup truck </v>

893
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:23.623
<v Speaker 3>including insight quarter panels where </v>
<v Speaker 3>various parts of people's bodies had </v>

894
00:52:27.291 --> 00:52:30.830
<v Speaker 3>come into contact with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the dash or the roof or whatever</v>

895
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:35.780
<v Speaker 3>before he was 16 he racked four or five </v>
<v Speaker 3>vehicles.</v>

896
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:41.270
<v Speaker 3>The most dramatic example of which was </v>
<v Speaker 3>one day I went and a job and on the main</v>

897
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:44.090
<v Speaker 3>street of our small town in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>of winter,</v>

898
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.790
<v Speaker 3>I looked up the street about three </v>
<v Speaker 3>blocks in.</v>

899
00:52:46.791 --> 00:52:51.791
<v Speaker 3>There was a small convenience store </v>
<v Speaker 3>there with a truck parked halfway inside</v>

900
00:52:53.301 --> 00:52:54.134
<v Speaker 3>of it covered with the tarp and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>white truck and I thought that's very </v>

901
00:52:57.381 --> 00:52:59.150
<v Speaker 3>likely my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

902
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:04.570
<v Speaker 3>he was indiscriminately reinforced </v>
<v Speaker 3>because every time he wrecked the truck,</v>

903
00:53:04.791 --> 00:53:07.940
<v Speaker 3>he just gotten underway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what ever said stop.</v>

904
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.400
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

905
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:15.800
<v Speaker 3>so back now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were there other,</v>

906
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:19.340
<v Speaker 3>are there other questions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

907
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:20.450
<v Speaker 3>let's have a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

908
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.793
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the difference between someone </v>

909
00:53:23.931 --> 00:53:25.590
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know much about would happen,</v>

910
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 3>maybe Jesus</v>

911
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.700
<v Speaker 5>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

912
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:29.103
<v Speaker 5>Could you say that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>behaviors that they learned came from </v>

913
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 5>their parents and then they added to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that in their,</v>

914
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.393
<v Speaker 5>in their lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So is the difference between that and a </v>

915
00:53:37.481 --> 00:53:40.380
<v Speaker 5>and a and a child who doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's antisocial,</v>

916
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:41.214
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is that they are there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are not given the opportunity to </v>

917
00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:44.560
<v Speaker 5>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

918
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:48.480
<v Speaker 5>those adaptive behaviors or social </v>
<v Speaker 5>behaviors,</v>

919
00:53:48.481 --> 00:53:50.500
<v Speaker 5>whatever the cause of the peer group </v>
<v Speaker 5>ostracized.</v>

920
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:51.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

921
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:53.500
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess if you,</v>

922
00:53:53.501 --> 00:53:55.500
<v Speaker 3>if you thought about it in this terms,</v>

923
00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.730
<v Speaker 3>well those kids are even followed up at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this point.</v>

924
00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:05.690
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to say because they don't ever</v>

925
00:54:05.691 --> 00:54:07.760
<v Speaker 3>have anyone reliably that they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>depend on.</v>

926
00:54:07.761 --> 00:54:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Even in Charlotte.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like this</v>

927
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.350
<v Speaker 3>success here is a precondition for </v>
<v Speaker 3>success here.</v>

928
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:17.693
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These kids are identifiable at </v>

929
00:54:18.801 --> 00:54:19.634
<v Speaker 3>kindergarten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they didn't even get to the </v>

930
00:54:21.141 --> 00:54:23.180
<v Speaker 3>point where they're acceptable to a peer</v>
<v Speaker 3>group,</v>

931
00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:28.370
<v Speaker 3>so the question is what happens to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't even make it here?</v>

932
00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.790
<v Speaker 3>I guess what happens is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown out into chaos where you organize</v>

933
00:54:31.791 --> 00:54:34.400
<v Speaker 3>yourself according to the principal we </v>
<v Speaker 3>just discussed,</v>

934
00:54:34.401 --> 00:54:37.430
<v Speaker 3>which is what can you do when you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>do anything else?</v>

935
00:54:37.431 --> 00:54:40.340
<v Speaker 3>The answer being hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

936
00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.260
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that,</v>

937
00:54:42.261 --> 00:54:43.094
<v Speaker 3>of course it's pretty much just </v>
<v Speaker 3>dependent on your on how mean you are </v>

938
00:54:45.651 --> 00:54:47.060
<v Speaker 3>and your size I guess.</v>

939
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:51.063
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

940
00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:58.523
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to read you something from </v>

941
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.073
<v Speaker 3>tolstoy in this will help us discuss the</v>
<v Speaker 3>different sorts of different manners in </v>

942
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:09.420
<v Speaker 3>which and the homeless inflammation can </v>
<v Speaker 3>present itself.</v>

943
00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.040
<v Speaker 3>This is in toasters convention </v>
<v Speaker 3>confessions.</v>

944
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:15.413
<v Speaker 3>I remember that when I was 11 years old </v>
<v Speaker 3>at high school boy named Devola Dinka </v>

945
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:19.343
<v Speaker 3>now long since dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>visited us one Sunday with an </v>

946
00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:24.240
<v Speaker 3>announcement of the latest discovery </v>
<v Speaker 3>made at school.</v>

947
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:29.340
<v Speaker 3>If discovery was that there is no god </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the things they were teaching us,</v>

948
00:55:29.341 --> 00:55:30.174
<v Speaker 3>we're nothing but fairy tales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was in 1838 I remember how this </v>

949
00:55:33.781 --> 00:55:34.614
<v Speaker 3>news captured the interest of my older </v>
<v Speaker 3>brothers even let me in on their </v>

950
00:55:37.771 --> 00:55:40.980
<v Speaker 3>discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that we were all very excited</v>

951
00:55:40.981 --> 00:55:44.040
<v Speaker 3>that we took this news to be both </v>
<v Speaker 3>engaging in entirely possible,</v>

952
00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:48.493
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

953
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.333
<v Speaker 3>tolstoy's confession or basically a </v>
<v Speaker 3>description of the consequences of </v>

954
00:55:53.281 --> 00:55:58.281
<v Speaker 3>having been exposed to that piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information on his entire life and it is</v>

955
00:55:58.411 --> 00:56:02.820
<v Speaker 3>the case or it was the case for him that</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least by his own interpretation,</v>

956
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:05.843
<v Speaker 3>the dramatic consequences of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovery didn't manifest themselves </v>

957
00:56:08.401 --> 00:56:11.760
<v Speaker 3>fully in his consciousness until he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle aged and well,</v>

958
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:15.960
<v Speaker 3>well established.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a successful author say,</v>

959
00:56:15.961 --> 00:56:18.510
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hit a piece of,</v>

960
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:19.493
<v Speaker 3>he hit a piece of anomalous information </v>
<v Speaker 3>while he was pursuing some relatively </v>

961
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:23.733
<v Speaker 3>trivial task and was unable to determine</v>
<v Speaker 3>the proper magnitude of that anomalous </v>

962
00:56:29.261 --> 00:56:30.094
<v Speaker 3>information for perhaps 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kept moving up the hierarchy of </v>

963
00:56:34.511 --> 00:56:37.030
<v Speaker 3>stories destroying them as it went</v>

964
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:41.990
<v Speaker 3>because his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Nietzsche pointed out,</v>

965
00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:45.163
<v Speaker 3>Judeo Christian morality which </v>
<v Speaker 3>characterized the behavior of the </v>

966
00:56:49.641 --> 00:56:54.641
<v Speaker 3>Russians in 1838 is predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that there is a god.</v>

967
00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:58.730
<v Speaker 3>If that's the most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>presupposition,</v>

968
00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:02.540
<v Speaker 3>and if you blow that presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you blow the morality.</v>

969
00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may not know that it's gone,</v>

970
00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:06.793
<v Speaker 3>but the fact just the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know that it's gone doesn't </v>

971
00:57:09.021 --> 00:57:09.854
<v Speaker 3>necessarily mean that it will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll disappear whether you know it's </v>

972
00:57:16.341 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 3>gone or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neat.</v>

973
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:19.910
<v Speaker 3>You said at one point that if you kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>the roots of a tree,</v>

974
00:57:19.911 --> 00:57:23.270
<v Speaker 3>eventually the branches will die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might take a long period of time.</v>

975
00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:24.943
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolstoy said since ancient times when </v>

976
00:57:28.941 --> 00:57:29.774
<v Speaker 3>the life of which I do know something </v>
<v Speaker 3>began people who knew the arguments </v>

977
00:57:32.901 --> 00:57:33.734
<v Speaker 3>concerning the vanity of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the arguments that reveal to me its </v>

978
00:57:36.621 --> 00:57:41.060
<v Speaker 3>meaninglessness live nonetheless </v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing to life a meaning of their own.</v>

979
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Since the time when people somehow began</v>
<v Speaker 3>to live,</v>

980
00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:48.380
<v Speaker 3>this meaning of life is being with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have led this life up to my own</v>

981
00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:49.214
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything that is in me and around me </v>

982
00:57:51.321 --> 00:57:52.154
<v Speaker 3>is the fruit of their knowledge of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The very tools of thought by which I </v>

983
00:57:56.691 --> 00:57:59.240
<v Speaker 3>judge life and condemn it were created </v>
<v Speaker 3>not by me,</v>

984
00:57:59.241 --> 00:58:00.074
<v Speaker 3>but by them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born educated and have grown up </v>

985
00:58:02.631 --> 00:58:05.270
<v Speaker 3>thanks to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They dug the iron,</v>

986
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.193
<v Speaker 3>taught us how to cut the timber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tamed the cattle and the horses showed </v>

987
00:58:08.841 --> 00:58:09.674
<v Speaker 3>us how to sow crops and live together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They brought order to our lives as the </v>

988
00:58:13.641 --> 00:58:14.474
<v Speaker 3>mythological ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They taught me how to think and how to </v>

989
00:58:17.751 --> 00:58:18.584
<v Speaker 3>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had their offspring nurse by them </v>

990
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:22.123
<v Speaker 3>reared by the talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by them I think according to their </v>

991
00:58:24.621 --> 00:58:27.270
<v Speaker 3>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their words and their,</v>

992
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.480
<v Speaker 3>I have proved to them that it is all </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningless.</v>

993
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:32.973
<v Speaker 3>I mean have them with me as it happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>with everyone who contracts that fatal </v>

994
00:58:35.521 --> 00:58:36.354
<v Speaker 3>internal disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At first there were the insignificant </v>

995
00:58:38.431 --> 00:58:41.190
<v Speaker 3>symptoms of an ailment which the patient</v>
<v Speaker 3>ignores.</v>

996
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:44.803
<v Speaker 3>Then these symptoms recur more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently until they merge into one </v>

997
00:58:47.151 --> 00:58:47.984
<v Speaker 3>continuous duration of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The suffering increases and before he </v>

998
00:58:52.491 --> 00:58:54.980
<v Speaker 3>can turn around the patient discovers </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he already knew.</v>

999
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:56.803
<v Speaker 3>The thing he had taken for a mere in </v>
<v Speaker 3>disposition is in fact the most </v>

1000
00:58:59.571 --> 00:59:02.050
<v Speaker 3>important thing on earth to him is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact,</v>

1001
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:05.030
<v Speaker 3>and that's the story of the information </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving up.</v>

1002
00:59:05.031 --> 00:59:10.031
<v Speaker 3>Thy are historics I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is conference there.</v>

1003
00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.013
<v Speaker 3>You could draw an analogy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to discovering that you have a fatal </v>

1004
00:59:14.331 --> 00:59:15.200
<v Speaker 3>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1005
00:59:15.201 --> 00:59:18.470
<v Speaker 3>let's say you wake up one morning and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1006
00:59:18.471 --> 00:59:20.270
<v Speaker 3>and he makes them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he uses the metaphor,</v>

1007
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:24.350
<v Speaker 3>you have a stitch in your side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1008
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Well that's going to make it much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to get to work.</v>

1009
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 3>So you construe the anomalous event with</v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to to a particular story.</v>

1010
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:35.083
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1011
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:38.630
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing which I am now in calibrating</v>

1012
00:59:38.631 --> 00:59:42.000
<v Speaker 3>has the status of a minor inconvenience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1013
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:46.880
<v Speaker 3>When you say it's only going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>interfere with a story that's nested way</v>

1014
00:59:46.881 --> 00:59:47.714
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't go away and perhaps it </v>

1015
00:59:50.061 --> 00:59:51.860
<v Speaker 3>gets worse and you start to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1016
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:54.290
<v Speaker 3>perhaps it's more serious than I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

1017
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:55.124
<v Speaker 3>which means there's more to this bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous information that first met the </v>

1018
00:59:58.161 --> 00:59:58.994
<v Speaker 3>eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sort enough the next day so that you </v>

1019
01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:03.800
<v Speaker 3>have to stay in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you start thinking,</v>

1020
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:04.903
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the proper level of analysis to </v>

1021
01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:09.320
<v Speaker 3>consider this anomalous information with</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect to,</v>

1022
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.593
<v Speaker 3>and you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they need to go to the doctor and </v>

1023
01:00:12.681 --> 01:00:15.560
<v Speaker 3>the doctor says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you need some more tests.</v>

1024
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:18.830
<v Speaker 3>While this information is starting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of it,</v>

1025
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:20.003
<v Speaker 3>this is the best way to think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only metaphor that it's only </v>

1026
01:00:22.341 --> 01:00:25.580
<v Speaker 3>metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wherever something anomalous occurs,</v>

1027
01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.460
<v Speaker 3>there's a hole in the way that you look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the world.</v>

1028
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:29.743
<v Speaker 3>And that whole can widen or narrow </v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on your interpretation and </v>

1029
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:34.610
<v Speaker 3>what you see through the whole is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unknown.</v>

1030
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.640
<v Speaker 3>And your job in a sense is to keep all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the holes covered.</v>

1031
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.863
<v Speaker 3>Now here's something the unknown is </v>
<v Speaker 3>peaking its head through and you don't </v>

1032
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:42.254
<v Speaker 3>know how big the thing that's keeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>his head through is it's just the tail </v>

1033
01:00:44.931 --> 01:00:45.764
<v Speaker 3>of a dragon or just the nose of a drag </v>
<v Speaker 3>as about whether you're trying to do is </v>

1034
01:00:48.651 --> 01:00:49.484
<v Speaker 3>to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess interject came out maybe </v>

1035
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.960
<v Speaker 3>because the way and find out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's dominance hierarchy is.</v>

1036
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you mean?</v>

1037
01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1038
01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.190
<v Speaker 5>use the example of a good example of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>athlete.</v>

1039
01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.013
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say that you get the stitch and </v>

1040
01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:06.640
<v Speaker 5>you get some stitching your side at </v>
<v Speaker 5>first you think to yourself,</v>

1041
01:01:06.641 --> 01:01:07.474
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know this,</v>

1042
01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.313
<v Speaker 5>this make it difficult for me to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>through my day and you keep going and </v>

1043
01:01:11.261 --> 01:01:15.040
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gets worse and worse and you see what</v>

1044
01:01:15.041 --> 01:01:17.530
<v Speaker 5>level of analysis they take it to next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do they next day,</v>

1045
01:01:17.531 --> 01:01:18.364
<v Speaker 5>well I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this will because this will interfere </v>

1046
01:01:21.251 --> 01:01:24.100
<v Speaker 5>with my schoolwork.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do I need to,</v>

1047
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.540
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my off my sports?</v>

1048
01:01:25.541 --> 01:01:27.610
<v Speaker 5>Or is it the other way around that,</v>

1049
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:33.100
<v Speaker 3>that me with the status of the various </v>
<v Speaker 3>nested goals and stuff,</v>

1050
01:01:33.541 --> 01:01:34.374
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to see that by forcing </v>

1051
01:01:35.731 --> 01:01:38.010
<v Speaker 3>someone into the novel or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>

1052
01:01:38.011 --> 01:01:41.100
<v Speaker 3>So if I put a limitation on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior or if one emerges,</v>

1053
01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.353
<v Speaker 3>you're going to determine what's worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>tossing and that'll give you what's </v>

1054
01:01:45.721 --> 01:01:47.050
<v Speaker 3>worth throwing away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically.</v>

1055
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:50.760
<v Speaker 3>If you can only do 90% of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're doing right now,</v>

1056
01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.450
<v Speaker 3>what falls into the category of the 10% </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be eliminated?</v>

1057
01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think more along the lines of what are</v>

1058
01:01:57.001 --> 01:01:59.520
<v Speaker 3>the order in which you would consider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1059
01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:00.330
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>

1060
01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:01.770
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

1061
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.260
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1062
01:02:04.261 --> 01:02:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Well I think that's perhaps part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why,</v>

1063
01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:07.441
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1064
01:02:07.441 --> 01:02:08.274
<v Speaker 3>people who have recovered from a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious illness or sometimes people who </v>

1065
01:02:11.671 --> 01:02:13.590
<v Speaker 3>aren't even going to be covers say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1066
01:02:13.591 --> 01:02:15.540
<v Speaker 3>at least this has taught me what was </v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

1067
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:17.063
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a perfectly reasonable </v>

1068
01:02:18.421 --> 01:02:20.760
<v Speaker 3>observation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1069
01:02:20.761 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Speaker 3>you go to the doctor and what your </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempt is,</v>

1070
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:26.160
<v Speaker 3>when you ask the doctor what is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1071
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.293
<v Speaker 3>what you're basically saying is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what subsection of my nested stories is </v>

1072
01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:34.170
<v Speaker 3>this event going to destroy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1073
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.740
<v Speaker 3>That's what you want to determine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read this is quite interesting.</v>

1074
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 3>You see and that's a terrible situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

1075
01:02:40.201 --> 01:02:41.034
<v Speaker 3>And so you're at the doctor and you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>faced with something that's unknown so </v>

1076
01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:46.170
<v Speaker 3>that then you're very anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high red,</v>

1077
01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:49.653
<v Speaker 3>all the educational attempts so far to </v>
<v Speaker 3>convince homosexual men to use condoms </v>

1078
01:02:53.831 --> 01:02:56.820
<v Speaker 3>have resulted in failure globally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1079
01:02:57.490 --> 01:02:58.323
<v Speaker 3>when AIDS first manifested itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a decrease in the kind of </v>

1080
01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:05.110
<v Speaker 3>behavior that spreads aged and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>increase in use of condoms for,</v>

1081
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.120
<v Speaker 3>for a substantial period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1082
01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.630
<v Speaker 3>the days is sort of running the mail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

1083
01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.420
<v Speaker 3>The behaviors have basically returned to</v>
<v Speaker 3>baseline level.</v>

1084
01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.373
<v Speaker 3>And there is some studies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrate that men who engage in </v>

1085
01:03:16.931 --> 01:03:17.764
<v Speaker 3>extremely high risk sexual behavior are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more anxious and depressed before they </v>

1086
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:24.010
<v Speaker 3>are diagnosed with aids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after.</v>

1087
01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:30.690
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that I think is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>any possibility has been,</v>

1088
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:32.350
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1089
01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Any defined actuality is better than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

1090
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.480
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good story for illustrating how</v>

1091
01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:38.314
<v Speaker 3>that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's better to know than not to </v>

1092
01:03:42.071 --> 01:03:42.904
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter what it is that you know </v>

1093
01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:48.130
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely the breath is worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>than yes.</v>

1094
01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:50.170
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means.</v>

1095
01:03:50.171 --> 01:03:51.004
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why in psychotherapy people will </v>

1096
01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:53.704
<v Speaker 3>always will continue to do things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know will hurt them rather than </v>

1097
01:03:57.071 --> 01:03:59.650
<v Speaker 3>risk change cause threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1098
01:03:59.651 --> 01:04:00.484
<v Speaker 3>That's what people do like hope it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>better than reward and punishment is </v>

1099
01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.270
<v Speaker 3>better than threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1100
01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.250
<v Speaker 3>so our primary reinforcers are less </v>
<v Speaker 3>salient then our secondary reinforcers.</v>

1101
01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:15.010
<v Speaker 3>It is peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is peculiar,</v>

1102
01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:15.903
<v Speaker 3>but I think that is the case because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is drugs that for a while it is drugs </v>

1103
01:04:19.091 --> 01:04:19.924
<v Speaker 3>that activate are the systems that </v>
<v Speaker 3>mediate hope that we find most </v>

1104
01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:23.793
<v Speaker 3>enthralling and it is the key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do believe that like the devil you </v>

1105
01:04:27.971 --> 01:04:28.804
<v Speaker 3>know is the better one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't that it's the oldest though </v>

1106
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:33.523
<v Speaker 3>that that's one of the reasons why this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of theoretical approach is so </v>

1107
01:04:35.561 --> 01:04:38.290
<v Speaker 3>useful is because it gives you insight </v>
<v Speaker 3>into why people won't change,</v>

1108
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.510
<v Speaker 3>but why won't they change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1109
01:04:40.511 --> 01:04:43.990
<v Speaker 3>in order to change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to stop believing in it.</v>

1110
01:04:43.991 --> 01:04:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Stopped doing what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1111
01:04:45.791 --> 01:04:46.870
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1112
01:04:46.871 --> 01:04:49.180
<v Speaker 3>it means for an intermediary period of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1113
01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:55.510
<v Speaker 3>all things are novel and all normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>things produce anxiety.</v>

1114
01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:58.990
<v Speaker 3>And if you're terrified of anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't believe that you can cope with</v>

1115
01:04:58.991 --> 01:04:59.824
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1116
01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:02.623
<v Speaker 4>you can't do it.</v>

1117
01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:04.293
<v Speaker 3>So what are the jobs you have as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychotherapist is not to minimize the </v>

1118
01:05:07.841 --> 01:05:08.674
<v Speaker 3>anxiety that you're a patient feels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to endeavor to demonstrate to them </v>

1119
01:05:12.311 --> 01:05:14.650
<v Speaker 3>that they can tolerate more of it than </v>
<v Speaker 3>they think.</v>

1120
01:05:14.651 --> 01:05:15.484
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1121
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.983
<v Speaker 3>that's catalog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your attempt to capitalize </v>

1122
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:22.084
<v Speaker 3>identification with the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the fact of anxiety isn't so </v>

1123
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:26.254
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the fact that you think that you </v>

1124
01:05:27.371 --> 01:05:29.680
<v Speaker 3>can deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so bad.</v>

1125
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:31.023
<v Speaker 3>Cause you're never going to convince </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody that the world is not a </v>

1126
01:05:32.651 --> 01:05:35.110
<v Speaker 3>threatening place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1127
01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:38.680
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

1128
01:05:38.681 --> 01:05:39.514
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you engage in exploratory behavior </v>

1129
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:42.604
<v Speaker 3>is trying to figure out at what level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis that particular normals piece </v>

1130
01:05:46.121 --> 01:05:46.954
<v Speaker 3>of information actually where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually most appropriately conceived </v>

1131
01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:51.773
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say what does it mean that </v>

1132
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:55.030
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to fit it into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>framework?</v>

1133
01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:55.864
<v Speaker 3>While it store basically says that his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this piece of information that he </v>

1134
01:06:00.731 --> 01:06:04.000
<v Speaker 3>accidentally encountered at school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty much inevitable.</v>

1135
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:05.853
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Russians in 1838 we're still pretty </v>

1136
01:06:07.001 --> 01:06:10.840
<v Speaker 3>backwards society compared to the rest </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Europe in Europe had gone through.</v>

1137
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:11.673
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great contact with the idea that </v>

1138
01:06:13.871 --> 01:06:17.200
<v Speaker 3>God was dead as early as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the,</v>

1139
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:19.980
<v Speaker 3>as the times when Galileo came into </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict with,</v>

1140
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:21.423
<v Speaker 3>with the Catholic church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this would be going on in Europe </v>

1141
01:06:22.841 --> 01:06:23.674
<v Speaker 3>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for 400 years before the news washed in </v>

1142
01:06:27.461 --> 01:06:28.294
<v Speaker 3>from western Europe over Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia was a feudal society that was </v>

1143
01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:35.740
<v Speaker 3>tottering on very on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on shaky legs,</v>

1144
01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:38.320
<v Speaker 3>just read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just waiting in a sense for something to</v>

1145
01:06:38.321 --> 01:06:39.154
<v Speaker 3>push it over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The news from western Europe pushed it </v>

1146
01:06:40.961 --> 01:06:41.794
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took to a story 30 years to figure </v>

1147
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.353
<v Speaker 3>out or for the information to have its </v>
<v Speaker 3>full impact on total store and I would </v>

1148
01:06:47.141 --> 01:06:47.974
<v Speaker 3>say that I think it's reasonable to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that what that information did to </v>

1149
01:06:52.121 --> 01:06:52.954
<v Speaker 3>Tolstoy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did to the whole culture 50 years </v>

1150
01:06:55.451 --> 01:06:56.284
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I want you to read those Dsq </v>

1151
01:06:58.081 --> 01:06:58.914
<v Speaker 3>is the devils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Dostoevsky's writing about a </v>

1152
01:07:02.711 --> 01:07:07.711
<v Speaker 3>Russia that had held on to feudalism 200</v>
<v Speaker 3>300 years longer than it actually should</v>

1153
01:07:09.611 --> 01:07:10.444
<v Speaker 3>have the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a peon country to undergo a modern </v>

1154
01:07:13.751 --> 01:07:14.584
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we know the consequences of the </v>

1155
01:07:15.821 --> 01:07:17.380
<v Speaker 3>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Orthodox.</v>

1156
01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:18.214
<v Speaker 3>Christianity was pushed over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left a huge void in the Russian psyche </v>

1157
01:07:21.191 --> 01:07:24.940
<v Speaker 3>that was filled by Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

1158
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.983
<v Speaker 3>tolstoy was a genius and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of being a genius is that </v>

1159
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.230
<v Speaker 3>those things that eventually happened to</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone have to you first.</v>

1160
01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:33.663
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1161
01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.990
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting thing.</v>

1162
01:07:38.991 --> 01:07:40.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that</v>

1163
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.270
<v Speaker 3>we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do.</v>

1164
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:47.650
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a strange,</v>

1165
01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:50.700
<v Speaker 3>strange thing to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess we tend to think that the future</v>

1166
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:52.833
<v Speaker 3>happens everywhere at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we all come into contact with </v>

1167
01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:57.970
<v Speaker 3>the future at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not really true.</v>

1168
01:07:57.971 --> 01:08:00.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that we think of as geniuses,</v>

1169
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.950
<v Speaker 3>our people in whom the future happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>first and then usually isolates them.</v>

1170
01:08:04.951 --> 01:08:06.580
<v Speaker 3>That's why they look like profits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1171
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:10.030
<v Speaker 3>I think in a sense it's almost as if the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future pours through them first,</v>

1172
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.530
<v Speaker 3>then out into the culture.</v>

1173
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1174
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.233
<v Speaker 3>I mean it depends on what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on what you think of </v>

1175
01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:19.694
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think I'm thinking of something </v>

1176
01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:21.674
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that whole line of argument is </v>

1177
01:08:24.141 --> 01:08:24.974
<v Speaker 3>nonsensical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you think of thoughts as </v>

1178
01:08:26.051 --> 01:08:27.320
<v Speaker 3>something you encounter,</v>

1179
01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:29.973
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1180
01:08:30.010 --> 01:08:31.990
<v Speaker 3>then it starts to make it a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>more sense.</v>

1181
01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:37.063
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1182
01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:38.493
<v Speaker 3>the thing that had taken for a myriad </v>
<v Speaker 3>disposition is in fact the most </v>

1183
01:08:40.331 --> 01:08:44.410
<v Speaker 3>important is in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is exactly what happened to me.</v>

1184
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.920
<v Speaker 3>I realized that this was northern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely element,</v>

1185
01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.093
<v Speaker 3>but something very serious ended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the same question should continue to </v>

1186
01:08:50.381 --> 01:08:51.214
<v Speaker 3>recur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to answer them and I tried </v>

1187
01:08:53.111 --> 01:08:55.810
<v Speaker 3>to answer the questions seem to be such </v>
<v Speaker 3>foolish,</v>

1188
01:08:55.811 --> 01:08:57.220
<v Speaker 3>simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>childish westerns.</v>

1189
01:08:57.570 --> 01:08:59.710
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as I laid my hands on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>try and resolve them,</v>

1190
01:08:59.711 --> 01:09:02.020
<v Speaker 3>I was immediately convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1191
01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:02.993
<v Speaker 3>but they were not childish and foolish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the most vital and profound </v>

1192
01:09:05.561 --> 01:09:08.560
<v Speaker 3>questions in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I couldn't believe that no matter</v>

1193
01:09:08.561 --> 01:09:10.870
<v Speaker 3>how much I bought them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no way I could resolve.</v>

1194
01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.633
<v Speaker 3>So tolstoy had not only thought here he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the paradigmatic example of having </v>

1195
01:09:22.271 --> 01:09:23.770
<v Speaker 3>gone there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1196
01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:24.723
<v Speaker 3>He was as successful as you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly be within the confines of a </v>

1197
01:09:28.381 --> 01:09:29.214
<v Speaker 3>group and even perhaps have made some </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements towards the next stage of </v>

1198
01:09:33.371 --> 01:09:34.204
<v Speaker 3>development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given that he was undoubtedly a very </v>

1199
01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:37.930
<v Speaker 3>creative individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he says it,</v>

1200
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.920
<v Speaker 3>he says himself,</v>

1201
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:46.550
<v Speaker 3>I should have been considered a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely happy man.</v>

1202
01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:48.830
<v Speaker 3>This was when I was not yet 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

1203
01:09:48.831 --> 01:09:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I had a good loving and beloved wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>find children and largest state that was</v>

1204
01:09:51.981 --> 01:09:55.580
<v Speaker 3>growing and expanding without any effort</v>
<v Speaker 3>on my card or the never before.</v>

1205
01:09:55.581 --> 01:09:57.620
<v Speaker 3>I was respected by friends and </v>
<v Speaker 3>acquaintances,</v>

1206
01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.513
<v Speaker 3>praised by strangers and could claim a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain renown without really diluting </v>

1207
01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:03.044
<v Speaker 3>myself were over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was not physically and mentally </v>

1208
01:10:05.271 --> 01:10:06.104
<v Speaker 3>unhealthy on the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I enjoyed the physical and mental </v>

1209
01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:11.360
<v Speaker 3>vigor such as I have rarely encountered </v>
<v Speaker 3>among others my age</v>

1210
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:15.290
<v Speaker 3>physically I could keep up with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>peasants working in the fields.</v>

1211
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.153
<v Speaker 3>Mentally I could work eight and 10 hours</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a stretch that's suffering any after </v>

1212
01:10:19.491 --> 01:10:22.610
<v Speaker 3>effects from the strain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in such a state of affairs,</v>

1213
01:10:22.611 --> 01:10:24.200
<v Speaker 3>I came to a point where I could not </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

1214
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:25.483
<v Speaker 3>And even though I fear death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to employ ruses against myself to </v>

1215
01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:29.570
<v Speaker 3>keep from committing suicide.</v>

1216
01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Perfect example of an entirely well </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptive matt,</v>

1217
01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:35.363
<v Speaker 3>he encountered with a piece of anomalous</v>
<v Speaker 3>information that blew his ability to </v>

1218
01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:38.864
<v Speaker 3>believe in all of the determinant </v>
<v Speaker 3>meanings that his group identification </v>

1219
01:10:42.291 --> 01:10:45.080
<v Speaker 3>have provided for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a consequence,</v>

1220
01:10:45.081 --> 01:10:50.081
<v Speaker 3>he descended in voluntarily into chaos </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just about died as a consequence.</v>

1221
01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:51.493
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and details this to some degree in his </v>

1222
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 3>confessions made tolstoy literally was </v>
<v Speaker 3>suicidal for a long period of time.</v>

1223
01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:00.640
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was three,</v>

1224
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:03.330
<v Speaker 3>one of the tragic consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstraction.</v>

1225
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:04.183
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1226
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:07.500
<v Speaker 3>it's coming from the top down there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no right.</v>

1227
01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:11.060
<v Speaker 3>You should be unhappy from a practical </v>
<v Speaker 3>point of view.</v>

1228
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:13.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

1229
01:11:13.411 --> 01:11:16.070
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of deal with today is,</v>

1230
01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this story,</v>

1231
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:21.690
<v Speaker 3>this story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>

1232
01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.313
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1233
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.113
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what toss do I encountered was a </v>

1234
01:11:25.841 --> 01:11:28.150
<v Speaker 3>stranger idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the problem with an idea.</v>

1235
01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:32.020
<v Speaker 3>This is why the pen is mightier than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sword.</v>

1236
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:37.470
<v Speaker 3>The problem with an idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that once it's up here,</v>

1237
01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:42.390
<v Speaker 3>you can just say it like you can make </v>
<v Speaker 3>your point in,</v>

1238
01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.860
<v Speaker 3>in a paragraph or two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say if the point is uh,</v>

1239
01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:47.763
<v Speaker 3>it's absurd to believe in religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions and you buttress that </v>

1240
01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:52.803
<v Speaker 3>with page of or to have documentation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reasons why it's absolutely obvious </v>

1241
01:11:57.761 --> 01:12:00.750
<v Speaker 3>that it's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're,</v>

1242
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:03.383
<v Speaker 3>you're providing information who's ease </v>
<v Speaker 3>of communication belies its danger and </v>

1243
01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:11.680
<v Speaker 3>also obscures how difficult it was for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the information to have being generated.</v>

1244
01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:12.993
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about abstraction is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that for me to make a statement like </v>

1245
01:12:17.411 --> 01:12:22.411
<v Speaker 3>that</v>
<v Speaker 3>mapped over a long span of time that any</v>

1246
01:12:22.901 --> 01:12:23.734
<v Speaker 3>number of people may have had to die in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to make that information in order </v>

1247
01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:29.290
<v Speaker 3>to generate that information.</v>

1248
01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:30.243
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>why we're so constantly interested in </v>

1249
01:12:33.461 --> 01:12:34.294
<v Speaker 3>the story of Galileo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was someone who produced a piece of </v>

1250
01:12:37.871 --> 01:12:42.871
<v Speaker 3>anomalous information and was branded </v>
<v Speaker 3>the heretic by the Catholic Church.</v>

1251
01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:44.253
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a person who opened the doorway </v>

1252
01:12:46.121 --> 01:12:46.954
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the scientific overthrew religious </v>

1253
01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:49.864
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that we can commonly </v>

1254
01:12:52.751 --> 01:12:53.584
<v Speaker 3>discuss issues like that now is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of the fact that centuries </v>

1255
01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:00.170
<v Speaker 3>of battles about ideas like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if taking me,</v>

1256
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:03.490
<v Speaker 3>have taken place in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes purely intellectually,</v>

1257
01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.593
<v Speaker 3>sometimes as the consequence of actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>wars all compacted up into a few </v>

1258
01:13:08.681 --> 01:13:11.410
<v Speaker 3>abstracted phrases that can easily be </v>
<v Speaker 3>delivered,</v>

1259
01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:14.170
<v Speaker 3>also delivered across cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's</v>

1260
01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:17.403
<v Speaker 3>so will you can see the actions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>strangers can become abstracted up into </v>

1261
01:13:21.941 --> 01:13:26.830
<v Speaker 3>words and then transmitted well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that's so funny is that</v>

1262
01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:27.933
<v Speaker 3>once it's abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be a very ineffectual </v>

1263
01:13:31.931 --> 01:13:32.764
<v Speaker 3>personality and nonetheless have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>capability to have a huge impact on </v>

1264
01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:38.314
<v Speaker 3>things because you can serve as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>carrier of information that you could </v>

1265
01:13:42.011 --> 01:13:42.844
<v Speaker 3>not possibly have generated yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of the reason why our </v>

1266
01:13:46.001 --> 01:13:48.880
<v Speaker 3>technological power makes us so </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly dangerous.</v>

1267
01:13:48.881 --> 01:13:49.714
<v Speaker 3>I think because we have access to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the power that people have developed in </v>

1268
01:13:54.101 --> 01:13:58.270
<v Speaker 3>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of whether or not we have the</v>

1269
01:13:58.271 --> 01:14:02.550
<v Speaker 3>kind of personalities that are capable </v>
<v Speaker 3>of using that power wisely.</v>

1270
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:07.360
<v Speaker 3>So there's politics in a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1271
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.033
<v Speaker 3>Not just politics though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the case with every field of </v>

1272
01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:11.404
<v Speaker 3>endeavor.</v>

1273
01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:16.000
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter where you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the case.</v>

1274
01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:17.763
<v Speaker 3>And as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we develop our technological power </v>

1275
01:14:19.451 --> 01:14:22.120
<v Speaker 3>more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's increasingly the case.</v>

1276
01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:24.670
<v Speaker 3>That's why someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember his name,</v>

1277
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:25.563
<v Speaker 3>a character in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Southeast Asia who brought down </v>

1278
01:14:27.911 --> 01:14:28.744
<v Speaker 3>Barings Bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good example of the power of </v>

1279
01:14:30.821 --> 01:14:32.320
<v Speaker 3>abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1280
01:14:32.321 --> 01:14:33.154
<v Speaker 3>He's playing with nothing and devastated</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole community because he's just </v>

1281
01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 3>playing with abstractions and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>just numbers.</v>

1282
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.373
<v Speaker 3>They're bits even.</v>

1283
01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.620
<v Speaker 6>But because things hadn't been </v>
<v Speaker 6>abstracted upsell so tremendously,</v>

1284
01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.053
<v Speaker 6>his casual movements had huge impact.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What makes it an homeless idea of </v>

1285
01:14:51.671 --> 01:14:56.671
<v Speaker 6>threatened and not just a ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean why go go?</v>

1286
01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:01.670
<v Speaker 6>It was so positions would threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why were they perceived of as,</v>

1287
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:02.683
<v Speaker 6>I mean not as substitute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That'll be the speculations are just </v>

1288
01:15:04.251 --> 01:15:05.610
<v Speaker 6>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was considered.</v>

1289
01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:08.230
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good question.</v>

1290
01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:10.300
<v Speaker 3>I suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1291
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:16.230
<v Speaker 3>that's a really good question because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>also ties in with other peculiarities.</v>

1292
01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.073
<v Speaker 3>Like you pointed out for example that </v>
<v Speaker 3>well and everyone knows this to be the </v>

1293
01:15:20.871 --> 01:15:21.704
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know sometimes you're a prophet </v>

1294
01:15:25.151 --> 01:15:25.984
<v Speaker 3>crying in the wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically means that you have a </v>

1295
01:15:27.581 --> 01:15:30.130
<v Speaker 3>message that no one listened to and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason for that is,</v>

1296
01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:31.930
<v Speaker 3>well it might be because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1297
01:15:31.931 --> 01:15:32.764
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fundamentally deranged and what </v>

1298
01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:35.614
<v Speaker 3>you have to say has no relevance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also may be that you're so far </v>

1299
01:15:39.281 --> 01:15:40.114
<v Speaker 3>ahead of your time so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that no one that you talked to can </v>

1300
01:15:42.401 --> 01:15:43.234
<v Speaker 3>understand what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very much related to the </v>

1301
01:15:45.131 --> 01:15:45.964
<v Speaker 3>question that you're asking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I would say that there must be </v>

1302
01:15:48.671 --> 01:15:50.500
<v Speaker 3>an op then this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1303
01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.650
<v Speaker 3>this ties into the last chapter that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll discuss,</v>

1304
01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:54.543
<v Speaker 3>which has to do the ability to use your </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest as a motive regulating your </v>

1305
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:00.634
<v Speaker 3>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gods ski said there's a zone of </v>

1306
01:16:02.921 --> 01:16:03.754
<v Speaker 3>proximal development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a complicated thing to try and </v>

1307
01:16:07.881 --> 01:16:11.420
<v Speaker 3>understand and I really haven't gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>it completely straightened out.</v>

1308
01:16:11.421 --> 01:16:13.040
<v Speaker 3>All of this diagram helps a bit.</v>

1309
01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.660
<v Speaker 3>You're saying if you're faced with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>anomalous piece of information,</v>

1310
01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:21.420
<v Speaker 3>what makes it meaningful instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>incomprehensible?</v>

1311
01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:27.770
<v Speaker 3>And it must be that there must be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if the idea is here,</v>

1312
01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.120
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's pretty easy to move it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1313
01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:36.410
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it's pretty difficult to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>it to here if it's here.</v>

1314
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:41.040
<v Speaker 3>So I would say like the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason that the Russians,</v>

1315
01:16:41.041 --> 01:16:41.874
<v Speaker 3>tolstoy for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was so overwhelmed by the idea from </v>

1316
01:16:45.121 --> 01:16:48.810
<v Speaker 3>Europe is because at other levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis,</v>

1317
01:16:48.811 --> 01:16:49.644
<v Speaker 3>they already knew the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like dropping us a seed </v>

1318
01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:58.140
<v Speaker 3>crystal into a supersaturated solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the ground was already prepared.</v>

1319
01:16:59.010 --> 01:16:59.843
<v Speaker 3>And I also think that's why people </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes experience things as </v>

1320
01:17:01.801 --> 01:17:04.650
<v Speaker 3>revelations is they already know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You already know.</v>

1321
01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell you a piece of information.</v>

1322
01:17:06.241 --> 01:17:10.970
<v Speaker 3>This is very much relevant to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological teaching because again,</v>

1323
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:16.390
<v Speaker 3>what we're discussing in this class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows at least up to about here</v>

1324
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:20.420
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you say move it to here,</v>

1325
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:24.350
<v Speaker 3>well I can always make reference to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you already know here</v>

1326
01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.270
<v Speaker 6>also.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's</v>

1327
01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:31.043
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sit with my children and I watched </v>

1328
01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:35.940
<v Speaker 3>bugs bunny cartoons or any movie for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that matter.</v>

1329
01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:37.023
<v Speaker 3>They're the oldest one is four and I see</v>
<v Speaker 3>by watching my daughter how much of </v>

1330
01:17:41.761 --> 01:17:42.594
<v Speaker 3>what's portrayed in the movie is opaque </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and that's because she </v>

1331
01:17:46.921 --> 01:17:48.750
<v Speaker 3>doesn't understand any of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>references.</v>

1332
01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Like yesterday we were watching Casper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't know.</v>

1333
01:17:52.141 --> 01:17:55.890
<v Speaker 3>What it goes to is now you can really </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain to anyone when it goes to is,</v>

1334
01:17:55.891 --> 01:17:57.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because while you think about it,</v>

1335
01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.540
<v Speaker 3>that's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's really complicated.</v>

1336
01:18:00.541 --> 01:18:01.374
<v Speaker 3>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of presuppositions </v>

1337
01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:05.070
<v Speaker 3>involved in understanding what it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1338
01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:06.203
<v Speaker 3>For her that's just opaque information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cause she doesn't share like the </v>

1339
01:18:09.841 --> 01:18:10.674
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the movie presumes a certain shared </v>

1340
01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.840
<v Speaker 3>frame of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1341
01:18:15.841 --> 01:18:18.060
<v Speaker 3>A shared background knowledge</v>

1342
01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.610
<v Speaker 6>and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's</v>

1343
01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:22.973
<v Speaker 6>is it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it related to the way of knowing and </v>

1344
01:18:24.341 --> 01:18:26.880
<v Speaker 6>not just the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean</v>

1345
01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:34.450
<v Speaker 6>the church had a way of knowing God all </v>
<v Speaker 6>day or in a different way of knowing.</v>

1346
01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:37.660
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't just the idea that was new.</v>

1347
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:39.400
<v Speaker 6>It was a way of knowing.</v>

1348
01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was certainly true in his case.</v>

1349
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:44.830
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's because the,</v>

1350
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:46.363
<v Speaker 3>the church I think was most concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it didn't know that explicit </v>

1351
01:18:49.361 --> 01:18:51.650
<v Speaker 3>and being with the knowing as knowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to behave.</v>

1352
01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.053
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Galileo was on the track of </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing as knowing facts and well we </v>

1353
01:18:57.891 --> 01:18:59.690
<v Speaker 3>know what the consequences of that of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

1354
01:18:59.691 --> 01:19:01.670
<v Speaker 3>we haven't been able to distinguish them</v>
<v Speaker 3>very well.</v>

1355
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.313
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1356
01:19:03.450 --> 01:19:07.130
<v Speaker 3>I noticed wandering through various art </v>
<v Speaker 3>museums in Europe,</v>

1357
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:07.993
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand many of the </v>

1358
01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:14.480
<v Speaker 3>renaissance paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't mean to me,</v>

1359
01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:15.373
<v Speaker 3>they don't even look to me like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>look to the people who painted them </v>

1360
01:19:17.301 --> 01:19:19.310
<v Speaker 3>because I don't know the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>reference.</v>

1361
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:20.203
<v Speaker 3>Even the Christian ones for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the paintings lost on me and </v>

1362
01:19:24.111 --> 01:19:24.944
<v Speaker 3>that's because</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we share a community that means our </v>

1363
01:19:28.281 --> 01:19:32.390
<v Speaker 3>unconscious presuppositions are </v>
<v Speaker 3>identical and so we can communicate at a</v>

1364
01:19:32.391 --> 01:19:37.391
<v Speaker 3>level where having those shared </v>
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions as implicitly accepted,</v>

1365
01:19:37.941 --> 01:19:38.774
<v Speaker 3>we can toss information back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like at the level of abstraction </v>

1366
01:19:42.531 --> 01:19:43.850
<v Speaker 3>where we don't yet agree.</v>

1367
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:47.660
<v Speaker 3>I guess that must be the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1368
01:19:47.661 --> 01:19:48.494
<v Speaker 3>if you and I are talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole bunch of things we're </v>

1369
01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:54.620
<v Speaker 3>not talking about that we already agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>about and so we don't have to talk about</v>

1370
01:19:54.621 --> 01:19:56.810
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we talk about are those things that</v>

1371
01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.380
<v Speaker 3>add a level of analysis where there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>still some dispute.</v>

1372
01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:05.060
<v Speaker 3>And I guess that as things become </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly beyond dispute,</v>

1373
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.930
<v Speaker 3>they all go also get encoded farther </v>
<v Speaker 3>back down the hierarchy.</v>

1374
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:14.010
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this class for example,</v>

1375
01:20:14.011 --> 01:20:15.870
<v Speaker 3>we're not at each other's throats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amber,</v>

1376
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:17.603
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we don't ever argue about the </v>

1377
01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 3>propriety of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1378
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:23.130
<v Speaker 3>it's so much accepted that it's not even</v>
<v Speaker 3>an issue.</v>

1379
01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.990
<v Speaker 3>There's no aggressive behavior.</v>

1380
01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:29.760
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that part of this year </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1381
01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:30.983
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of anomaly must come from a recognition </v>

1382
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.730
<v Speaker 3>or an unconscious recognition perhaps of</v>
<v Speaker 3>human nature,</v>

1383
01:20:38.731 --> 01:20:41.020
<v Speaker 3>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1384
01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:43.470
<v Speaker 3>exploration is intrinsically rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1385
01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.840
<v Speaker 3>would you agree that that is true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems that</v>

1386
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:51.280
<v Speaker 3>exploration for explorations sake seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be something that motivates people.</v>

1387
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:52.123
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I noticed one of the things that </v>

1388
01:20:52.471 --> 01:20:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Tulsa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said was that Venus and his brothers,</v>

1389
01:20:55.170 --> 01:20:57.990
<v Speaker 3>they brought the strain chai idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>home from school.</v>

1390
01:20:57.991 --> 01:20:59.910
<v Speaker 3>One of the first things he says is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we were more than,</v>

1391
01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:02.310
<v Speaker 3>we're more than happy to entertain this </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

1392
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1393
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.190
<v Speaker 3>But simply because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's new.</v>

1394
01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:07.920
<v Speaker 3>Anything that's new is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1395
01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:10.733
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1396
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:12.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1397
01:21:12.781 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 3>they were definitely interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1398
01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Partly I think because it told them </v>
<v Speaker 3>something they already suspected.</v>

1399
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:19.280
<v Speaker 3>So to some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1400
01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.570
<v Speaker 3>it was a receptivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1401
01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:22.463
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ground was busy that it's almost as </v>

1402
01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:28.760
<v Speaker 3>if it was an unarticulated experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1403
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.693
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It provides a way of articulating and </v>

1404
01:21:32.761 --> 01:21:35.010
<v Speaker 3>that's the crystal hits the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1405
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:39.520
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't put the experience there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It articulates great.</v>

1406
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:40.363
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long.</v>

1407
01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1408
01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:42.323
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll see this later in the </v>

1409
01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.410
<v Speaker 3>manuscript too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1410
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:49.500
<v Speaker 3>when Moses gets the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 10 commandments from God,</v>

1411
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:52.283
<v Speaker 3>he's on the top of a mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a standard place of </v>

1412
01:21:54.721 --> 01:21:57.060
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment when he comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or illumination,</v>

1413
01:21:57.061 --> 01:21:57.894
<v Speaker 3>when he comes down the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his face is glowing so brightly that no </v>

1414
01:22:01.081 --> 01:22:05.760
<v Speaker 3>one can look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what Moses did like he's,</v>

1415
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.920
<v Speaker 3>let's assume for the present time that </v>
<v Speaker 3>if he is not a mythological figure,</v>

1416
01:22:10.921 --> 01:22:13.620
<v Speaker 3>he's at least a myth of sized historical</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure.</v>

1417
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:18.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean the notion of the law giver is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly prevalent in archaic communities.</v>

1418
01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean the same role is played by Hammer</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hammer,</v>

1419
01:22:21.581 --> 01:22:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Rab die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1420
01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.850
<v Speaker 3>someone who codifies the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While the notion there is again,</v>

1421
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.013
<v Speaker 3>like what Moses did basically could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>construed as having observed how </v>

1422
01:22:32.911 --> 01:22:36.540
<v Speaker 3>everyone behaved in essence anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he codafide it,</v>

1423
01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:38.243
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he took information that existed at </v>

1424
01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.990
<v Speaker 3>the level of creative behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imitation,</v>

1425
01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:43.771
<v Speaker 3>play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ritual,</v>

1426
01:22:43.771 --> 01:22:44.610
<v Speaker 3>drought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a myth,</v>

1427
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.310
<v Speaker 3>religion and maybe even literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1428
01:22:47.311 --> 01:22:49.680
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we're doing.</v>

1429
01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:50.733
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the consequences that that appeared </v>

1430
01:22:53.291 --> 01:22:55.640
<v Speaker 3>as a revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think part of the reason I'd be,</v>

1431
01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.960
<v Speaker 3>I'd be trying to figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you do this in therapy too.</v>

1432
01:22:58.590 --> 01:23:00.660
<v Speaker 3>You say to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look here,</v>

1433
01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:03.360
<v Speaker 3>here's a pattern of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1434
01:23:03.361 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 3>that in itself could be revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say the person says,</v>

1435
01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've noticed myself doing that.</v>

1436
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:10.420
<v Speaker 3>They're quite interested in that piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of information.</v>

1437
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 3>I think the asset that's generated as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of encountering that sort of</v>

1438
01:23:15.971 --> 01:23:16.804
<v Speaker 3>information is partly due to </v>
<v Speaker 3>apprehension of all the possibilities </v>

1439
01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:25.561
<v Speaker 3>that are then revealed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the more as you move information up</v>

1440
01:23:25.781 --> 01:23:26.614
<v Speaker 3>the hierarchy of abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the information becomes more and more </v>

1441
01:23:29.141 --> 01:23:29.974
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically means that you can do </v>

1442
01:23:31.241 --> 01:23:33.640
<v Speaker 3>more with it with less work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1443
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.390
<v Speaker 3>That's why money is more powerful than </v>
<v Speaker 3>barter.</v>

1444
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:39.040
<v Speaker 3>It's more abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

1445
01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:41.423
<v Speaker 3>so it's more flexible and I think when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you move information up a level of </v>

1446
01:23:45.071 --> 01:23:45.904
<v Speaker 3>abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it produces a release of an effect </v>

1447
01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:49.084
<v Speaker 3>because you get an intimation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities that are released as a </v>

1448
01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:53.380
<v Speaker 3>consequence of the increase in </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstraction.</v>

1449
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:57.520
<v Speaker 3>I also think it's the case that if I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you,</v>

1450
01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:00.130
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your story is such and such,</v>

1451
01:24:00.131 --> 01:24:02.470
<v Speaker 3>but you act this way and this is your </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>

1452
01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:03.843
<v Speaker 3>Well then you have the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving those three levels of analysis </v>

1453
01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:12.300
<v Speaker 3>into an isomorphic arrangement so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your north three people anymore,</v>

1454
01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.300
<v Speaker 3>one who act some way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you have?</v>

1455
01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:19.240
<v Speaker 3>A badge is another way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the plans,</v>

1456
01:24:19.241 --> 01:24:20.074
<v Speaker 3>a third way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're one person who all of whose </v>

1457
01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:24.350
<v Speaker 3>efforts are devoted towards attaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll say,</v>

1458
01:24:24.351 --> 01:24:26.200
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think that that's,</v>

1459
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:27.383
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1460
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:30.610
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the utility of the integration.</v>

1461
01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:34.330
<v Speaker 3>And I think when one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we admire in people naturally,</v>

1462
01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:35.853
<v Speaker 3>I think is the consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unification of the operation of those </v>

1463
01:24:41.141 --> 01:24:42.520
<v Speaker 3>three systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say,</v>

1464
01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.590
<v Speaker 3>who do you admire?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1465
01:24:44.591 --> 01:24:47.500
<v Speaker 3>someone who doesn't say anything more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than is necessary,</v>

1466
01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.440
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and who acts out what they tell you.</v>

1467
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:55.690
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was about to say that I think at times</v>

1468
01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:56.883
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about positive ethic and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that how's it of apic works in </v>

1469
01:25:00.011 --> 01:25:00.844
<v Speaker 5>this direction if you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>procedural as the outside and that </v>

1470
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:05.780
<v Speaker 5>attraction towards the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Andy,</v>

1471
01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.020
<v Speaker 5>because I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1472
01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:11.770
<v Speaker 5>I think when you present,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once you have a level of abstraction,</v>

1473
01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:16.210
<v Speaker 5>the best way to present to somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 5>is not by,</v>

1474
01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:17.493
<v Speaker 5>by telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but about presenting it in as </v>

1475
01:25:18.911 --> 01:25:21.670
<v Speaker 5>procedural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They need as big a,</v>

1476
01:25:21.671 --> 01:25:23.860
<v Speaker 5>a circle as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is probably is,</v>

1477
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:25.650
<v Speaker 5>which is probably more difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1478
01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:30.680
<v Speaker 3>well this sort of the okay information </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's behavioral anyways.</v>

1479
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's Freud thought that merely </v>

1480
01:25:33.801 --> 01:25:34.634
<v Speaker 3>becoming conscious of something was </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficient to bring about a cure or at </v>

1481
01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:37.964
<v Speaker 3>least at the early stages of his career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by the end he realized that unless </v>

1482
01:25:40.491 --> 01:25:41.324
<v Speaker 3>it had to be transformed from pure </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious awareness back down to the </v>

1483
01:25:44.871 --> 01:25:47.170
<v Speaker 3>level of behavior did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't know it.</v>

1484
01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.553
<v Speaker 3>Knowing it means that it's embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the point that you're </v>

1485
01:25:50.961 --> 01:25:51.794
<v Speaker 3>making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What Tulsa was doing is that he was </v>

1486
01:25:53.301 --> 01:25:54.134
<v Speaker 3>moving from abstraction maybe into </v>
<v Speaker 3>procedural and that produce negative </v>

1487
01:25:58.010 --> 01:25:59.530
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1488
01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.800
<v Speaker 3>but it wouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1489
01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 3>and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

1490
01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.533
<v Speaker 3>I would say that your interpretation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate but that it wouldn't </v>

1491
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:09.190
<v Speaker 3>necessarily have to produce negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

1492
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.033
<v Speaker 3>The problem is is the tolstoy encounter </v>
<v Speaker 3>that information and voluntarily was </v>

1493
01:26:12.981 --> 01:26:16.970
<v Speaker 3>sort of accidental in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was walking along as it's a hell of a</v>

1494
01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:19.250
<v Speaker 3>piece of information for a 12 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>school boy.</v>

1495
01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:21.043
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's a piece of information </v>

1496
01:26:22.371 --> 01:26:24.830
<v Speaker 3>that you can say in one sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go on his dad.</v>

1497
01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.393
<v Speaker 3>That took like literally thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of concentrated effort and any </v>

1498
01:26:30.231 --> 01:26:33.980
<v Speaker 3>number of wars to produce and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can hand it to someone on a plate.</v>

1499
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:36.410
<v Speaker 3>This is also part of the reason why are </v>
<v Speaker 3>this this,</v>

1500
01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.940
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of a leap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes it,</v>

1501
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:38.833
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the same sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's why a lot of foreign aid projects </v>

1502
01:26:41.811 --> 01:26:42.644
<v Speaker 3>don't work is because there's a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 3>information embedded in the things that </v>

1503
01:26:46.941 --> 01:26:47.774
<v Speaker 3>we distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we think that there's a good </v>

1504
01:26:49.401 --> 01:26:51.350
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1505
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:54.980
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the South Pacific islands,</v>

1506
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:56.323
<v Speaker 3>the introduction of steel axis to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stone age population devastated their </v>

1507
01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:02.480
<v Speaker 3>whole culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of it was missionary work.</v>

1508
01:27:03.230 --> 01:27:06.710
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is these colleges had </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressed to the point where if you are</v>

1509
01:27:06.711 --> 01:27:07.544
<v Speaker 3>at the top of the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had access to a stone ax and we </v>

1510
01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:12.170
<v Speaker 3>think about a stone ax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1511
01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.300
<v Speaker 3>who cares basically.</v>

1512
01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:15.493
<v Speaker 3>But when there aren't that many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when that's the thing that's the </v>

1513
01:27:18.061 --> 01:27:18.894
<v Speaker 3>hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most technologically advanced </v>

1514
01:27:21.171 --> 01:27:22.004
<v Speaker 3>product you have still an ax is a symbol</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ultimate value as well as the stone </v>

1515
01:27:26.801 --> 01:27:29.330
<v Speaker 3>Max.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you distribute steel axes,</v>

1516
01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:31.760
<v Speaker 3>which the missionaries did relatively </v>
<v Speaker 3>indiscriminately,</v>

1517
01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.960
<v Speaker 3>it was very hard on the story that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pacific Islanders told cause you think,</v>

1518
01:27:37.431 --> 01:27:38.690
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1519
01:27:38.691 --> 01:27:39.890
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a steel ax.</v>

1520
01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:42.680
<v Speaker 3>What's a steel ax for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's for cutting down trees and you</v>

1521
01:27:42.681 --> 01:27:45.350
<v Speaker 3>can do a better job with the steel ax </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can with a stone ax.</v>

1522
01:27:45.650 --> 01:27:48.380
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Elvis Presley's guitar,</v>

1523
01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elvis Presley's guitar is just,</v>

1524
01:27:50.691 --> 01:27:52.550
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a thing to make music </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1525
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:57.610
<v Speaker 3>It's also Elvis Presley's guitar and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>steel ax is not just a thing to cut down</v>

1526
01:27:57.621 --> 01:28:02.621
<v Speaker 3>trees with its a cultural artifact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has sort of embedded in it a whole bunch</v>

1527
01:28:02.661 --> 01:28:03.494
<v Speaker 3>of implicit messages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partly about the relative power of two </v>

1528
01:28:06.051 --> 01:28:06.600
<v Speaker 3>cultures.</v>

1529
01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.433
<v Speaker 3>And in large part that it's like if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to work your whole life to get a </v>

1530
01:28:11.151 --> 01:28:11.984
<v Speaker 3>stone ax and then your four year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>child walks down the street and brings </v>

1531
01:28:13.941 --> 01:28:14.774
<v Speaker 3>home the steel ax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be somewhat hard on </v>

1532
01:28:17.001 --> 01:28:18.290
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your,</v>

1533
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:21.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your frame of references.</v>

1534
01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:22.363
<v Speaker 3>Hey Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people down the street or getting </v>

1535
01:28:23.991 --> 01:28:28.730
<v Speaker 3>away machines that create money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1536
01:28:28.731 --> 01:28:32.090
<v Speaker 3>so when we introduce our artifacts into </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative cultures,</v>

1537
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.313
<v Speaker 3>we are putting a lot more into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture than we actually think because </v>

1538
01:28:35.901 --> 01:28:36.734
<v Speaker 3>the artifact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Marshall Mcluhan said the </v>

1539
01:28:39.951 --> 01:28:40.784
<v Speaker 3>medium is the message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Artifact is something other than just </v>

1540
01:28:43.371 --> 01:28:46.250
<v Speaker 3>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a story that's embedded in it.</v>

1541
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:48.163
<v Speaker 3>So now you're tolstoy's case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost the artifact was rather a </v>

1542
01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:52.490
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

1543
01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:53.973
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an idea crystallized that </v>

1544
01:28:55.251 --> 01:28:57.140
<v Speaker 3>experience that was already there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1545
01:28:57.830 --> 01:29:00.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1546
01:29:00.021 --> 01:29:00.821
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was something,</v>

1547
01:29:00.821 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 3>it something abstract it up anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1548
01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:05.850
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1549
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:10.410
<v Speaker 3>well normally seen information can come </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the form of a strange idea.</v>

1550
01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I was trying to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this with,</v>

1551
01:29:15.331 --> 01:29:16.164
<v Speaker 3>this is something I didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize until this morning when I was </v>

1552
01:29:19.381 --> 01:29:20.460
<v Speaker 3>working on this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1553
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:25.880
<v Speaker 3>anomalous information can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can enter your purview at every,</v>

1554
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.753
<v Speaker 3>at any level of abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that sort of leads is that </v>

1555
01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:30.413
<v Speaker 3>someone can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone acts differently than you </v>

1556
01:29:32.251 --> 01:29:33.090
<v Speaker 3>act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1557
01:29:33.091 --> 01:29:34.860
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does that bother you so much?</v>

1558
01:29:34.861 --> 01:29:37.230
<v Speaker 3>The beer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take the Germans for example,</v>

1559
01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.420
<v Speaker 3>prior to the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1560
01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:41.990
<v Speaker 3>Their culture is a little unstable as </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of dance,</v>

1561
01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:46.740
<v Speaker 3>very high rates and London,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible inflation and immense threat of</v>

1562
01:29:46.741 --> 01:29:50.880
<v Speaker 3>communism from the east and a nontrivial</v>
<v Speaker 3>threat.</v>

1563
01:29:50.881 --> 01:29:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean the communists took over Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>after all.</v>

1564
01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.370
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's enough novelty,</v>

1565
01:29:56.371 --> 01:29:58.350
<v Speaker 3>enough normally floating around in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>air,</v>

1566
01:29:58.351 --> 01:29:59.184
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make everyone perfectly well </v>

1567
01:30:00.301 --> 01:30:01.630
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1568
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:04.103
<v Speaker 3>under those circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody who acted differently with a </v>

1569
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:09.263
<v Speaker 3>additional anomaly that I think it </v>
<v Speaker 3>appeared as pretty much as something </v>

1570
01:30:11.971 --> 01:30:14.130
<v Speaker 3>pretty much intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1571
01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:18.023
<v Speaker 3>under normal circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possible that the alternative </v>

1572
01:30:20.341 --> 01:30:23.460
<v Speaker 3>behaviors of someone who's different </v>
<v Speaker 3>than you aren't doing the pose that much</v>

1573
01:30:23.461 --> 01:30:24.294
<v Speaker 3>of a problem to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all you have to do is perturb the </v>

1574
01:30:26.851 --> 01:30:31.350
<v Speaker 3>system to some degree to make that sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of anomalous information,</v>

1575
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:32.663
<v Speaker 3>that much more intolerable state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone's from a culture that's </v>

1576
01:30:36.211 --> 01:30:37.044
<v Speaker 3>different than you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't talk to them and even </v>

1577
01:30:38.551 --> 01:30:40.710
<v Speaker 3>if they don't come into contact with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>that much,</v>

1578
01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:41.753
<v Speaker 3>the mere fact that there are around is </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitive evidence that a story that </v>

1579
01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:51.180
<v Speaker 3>isn't your story can be as success can </v>
<v Speaker 3>make someone as successful as you are or</v>

1580
01:30:51.181 --> 01:30:52.014
<v Speaker 3>perhaps even more successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you can tolerate that and </v>

1581
01:30:54.421 --> 01:30:58.710
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anomalous information can come in the</v>

1582
01:30:58.711 --> 01:31:02.310
<v Speaker 3>form of pure procedure that's acted out </v>
<v Speaker 3>by someone else.</v>

1583
01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes that's not a problem but </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it is</v>

1584
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:12.960
<v Speaker 3>the final.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is even less abstract.</v>

1585
01:31:12.961 --> 01:31:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I guess I wanted to read you something </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I can't,</v>

1586
01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:21.530
<v Speaker 3>I can't make the argument is well is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a road</v>

1587
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:28.363
<v Speaker 3>page one 68</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question here is what can disrupt </v>

1588
01:31:36.031 --> 01:31:40.950
<v Speaker 3>you I guess and the things that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrupt the,</v>

1589
01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.350
<v Speaker 3>we can come in the form of direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenges,</v>

1590
01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:45.083
<v Speaker 3>indirect challenges to your cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure and these are all things that </v>

1591
01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:53.930
<v Speaker 3>are other cultures basically agree</v>
<v Speaker 3>or sorry.</v>

1592
01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:58.890
<v Speaker 3>These two things are other cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stranger and the stranger.</v>

1593
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:05.070
<v Speaker 3>This is schismatic movement within your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own culture and this is the unknown.</v>

1594
01:32:05.771 --> 01:32:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Doing its thing more or less all by </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

1595
01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:13.870
<v Speaker 3>So cultures come to a halt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1596
01:32:13.871 --> 01:32:16.330
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're a culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a good example,</v>

1597
01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 3>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You raise goats.</v>

1598
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:25.420
<v Speaker 3>So you have an agrarian culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The prime with goats is theirs that they</v>

1599
01:32:25.421 --> 01:32:26.254
<v Speaker 3>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They produce environmental </v>

1600
01:32:27.491 --> 01:32:30.130
<v Speaker 3>transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goats like to live in deserts.</v>

1601
01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:34.540
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about guns is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>put them out somewhere soon,</v>

1602
01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:35.374
<v Speaker 3>what you have is a desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with deserts is that </v>

1603
01:32:38.021 --> 01:32:41.140
<v Speaker 3>they don't support that many goats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the point is,</v>

1604
01:32:41.141 --> 01:32:43.930
<v Speaker 3>is that if you have an adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of one source,</v>

1605
01:32:44.170 --> 01:32:45.003
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of that adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure can be the transformation of </v>

1606
01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:48.394
<v Speaker 3>the environment in such a way so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the adapter structure no longer no </v>

1607
01:32:51.221 --> 01:32:52.090
<v Speaker 3>longer works.</v>

1608
01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:53.673
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

1609
01:32:54.690 --> 01:32:55.523
<v Speaker 3>Now this took me a long time to work out</v>
<v Speaker 3>because mythological representations of </v>

1610
01:33:01.050 --> 01:33:01.883
<v Speaker 3>the emergence of the negative unknown </v>
<v Speaker 3>are always contaminated with </v>

1611
01:33:07.410 --> 01:33:11.010
<v Speaker 3>mythological representations of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyranny of the known.</v>

1612
01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:14.300
<v Speaker 3>And it's almost as if from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological perspective of it,</v>

1613
01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:19.460
<v Speaker 3>there's no difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>the over dominance of this.</v>

1614
01:33:20.650 --> 01:33:21.483
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1615
01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:23.900
<v Speaker 3>And the emergence.</v>

1616
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:29.923
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1617
01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.470
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the hell could that be?</v>

1618
01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Why would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just read you something here.</v>

1619
01:33:46.730 --> 01:33:50.600
<v Speaker 3>The insufficiency of cultural adaptation</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot easily distinguished from natural</v>

1620
01:33:50.601 --> 01:33:53.510
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This society light on its feet,</v>

1621
01:33:53.511 --> 01:33:54.344
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is constantly in a position to adapt to </v>

1622
01:33:55.791 --> 01:33:56.624
<v Speaker 3>the unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even to the rapid and catastrophic kind </v>

1623
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:59.583
<v Speaker 3>of expected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even to transform such change into </v>

1624
01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:05.810
<v Speaker 3>something positively beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Likewise,</v>

1625
01:34:05.811 --> 01:34:09.030
<v Speaker 3>this means that that affect and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognition earns more than with that.</v>

1626
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:12.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it this way.</v>

1627
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:18.590
<v Speaker 3>Germany and Japan lost the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 3>War in England.</v>

1628
01:34:18.591 --> 01:34:20.540
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd never know it now,</v>

1629
01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:23.680
<v Speaker 3>and that's partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1630
01:34:23.690 --> 01:34:27.590
<v Speaker 3>it's part of it because the Americans in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fit of historical anomaly,</v>

1631
01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:29.253
<v Speaker 3>it gave their enemies money instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing the ball and their last </v>

1632
01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:37.040
<v Speaker 3>historically as lose to lose the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The United States,</v>

1633
01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:38.053
<v Speaker 3>the only country that ever really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them were against us as Vietnam </v>

1634
01:34:40.621 --> 01:34:42.030
<v Speaker 3>and look where they are now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1635
01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:44.330
<v Speaker 3>Whereas you're looking at Japan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany.</v>

1636
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we made it.</v>

1637
01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:48.913
<v Speaker 3>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good example of of the Integra </v>

1638
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.880
<v Speaker 3>relationship between this and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Germans,</v>

1639
01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:02.080
<v Speaker 3>the Japanese underwent a catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sociological catastrophe.</v>

1640
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Who's consequence was something very </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial in the final analysis.</v>

1641
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:10.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is is that</v>

1642
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:13.663
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't necessarily distinguish the </v>

1643
01:35:18.081 --> 01:35:18.914
<v Speaker 3>valence of unexpected phenomenon from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pattern of behavior that's </v>

1644
01:35:23.301 --> 01:35:28.301
<v Speaker 3>manifested in its presence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say that it's very difficult</v>

1645
01:35:28.821 --> 01:35:33.821
<v Speaker 3>to specify a particular situation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is in and of itself negative</v>

1646
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:41.330
<v Speaker 3>without any relationship to how you act </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the face of that thing.</v>

1647
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:44.370
<v Speaker 3>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me read you the,</v>

1648
01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:48.170
<v Speaker 3>you have to think about this from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the perspective of image,</v>

1649
01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:51.730
<v Speaker 3>myth and literature constantly represent</v>
<v Speaker 3>the parch kingdom.</v>

1650
01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:55.280
<v Speaker 3>This society victim on its most </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently by drought,</v>

1651
01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:59.310
<v Speaker 3>which is the absence of water concretely</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the water of life or spirit.</v>

1652
01:35:59.330 --> 01:36:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Symbolically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it scorched as a consequence of the over</v>

1653
01:36:02.931 --> 01:36:05.120
<v Speaker 3>prolonged the dominance of the ruling </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>

1654
01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:09.110
<v Speaker 3>this idea in the narrative and </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently in there as well.</v>

1655
01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:09.944
<v Speaker 3>And he is the king,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ancestral spirit representative of </v>

1656
01:36:12.831 --> 01:36:15.890
<v Speaker 3>his people made tyrannical by age or </v>
<v Speaker 3>pride,</v>

1657
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:16.783
<v Speaker 3>unbearable disappointment or we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the influence of some malevolent </v>

1658
01:36:19.930 --> 01:36:23.750
<v Speaker 3>and advising force development of such </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances.</v>

1659
01:36:23.751 --> 01:36:24.531
<v Speaker 3>Call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1660
01:36:24.531 --> 01:36:28.010
<v Speaker 3>for the entrance of the hero who's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lost son of the true king,</v>

1661
01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.950
<v Speaker 3>raised in secrecy by alternative </v>
<v Speaker 3>parrots,</v>

1662
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.903
<v Speaker 3>the rightful ruler of the kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose authority was undermine during </v>

1663
01:36:34.641 --> 01:36:37.280
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable youth or who had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>journeying in far off lands.</v>

1664
01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:41.750
<v Speaker 3>It was presumed yet here overturns the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tire and regains his proper place.</v>

1665
01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.430
<v Speaker 3>The gods please by the reestablishment </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the proper order,</v>

1666
01:36:45.431 --> 01:36:49.340
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the rain once more to fall and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the story of this type,</v>

1667
01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:50.503
<v Speaker 3>the creative aspect of the unknown or </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature is locked away metaphorically by </v>

1668
01:36:54.441 --> 01:36:58.010
<v Speaker 3>the totalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No opinion of the current culture such a</v>

1669
01:36:58.011 --> 01:37:00.470
<v Speaker 3>state of affairs might be represented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

1670
01:37:00.471 --> 01:37:04.070
<v Speaker 3>by the sleeping princess in the kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought to a standstill.</v>

1671
01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.490
<v Speaker 3>What by some alternative variant of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence of the treasure,</v>

1672
01:37:07.491 --> 01:37:08.324
<v Speaker 3>hard to attain paralyzed by patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 3>despotism or frequently by fear of the </v>

1673
01:37:13.431 --> 01:37:14.264
<v Speaker 3>terrible mother kingdom remained </v>
<v Speaker 3>stagnant while the princess nature and </v>

1674
01:37:17.781 --> 01:37:18.614
<v Speaker 3>your benevolent guys waits for the kiss </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the hero two week her awakened and </v>

1675
01:37:21.951 --> 01:37:24.200
<v Speaker 3>revitalize beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Subsequently we animate,</v>

1676
01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:25.093
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>

1677
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:27.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1678
01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.830
<v Speaker 3>See these stories basically say that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>the unknown,</v>

1679
01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:42.533
<v Speaker 3>if the environment is turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the environment has turned against </v>

1680
01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:48.494
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1681
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:51.840
<v Speaker 2>kill the king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1682
01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:54.570
<v Speaker 3>Because whether you know it or know him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a tyrant.</v>

1683
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:58.860
<v Speaker 3>And so from the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

1684
01:38:01.650 --> 01:38:05.220
<v Speaker 3>there's no such thing as the negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of the unknown as such.</v>

1685
01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:09.210
<v Speaker 3>It's always only maybe it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to a ruling idea.</v>

1686
01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:12.150
<v Speaker 3>And the mythological idea is that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's negative,</v>

1687
01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:14.150
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't idea.</v>

1688
01:38:14.690 --> 01:38:17.130
<v Speaker 3>That's the basic notion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange idea.</v>

1689
01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:18.960
<v Speaker 3>And let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously the circling the wagons,</v>

1690
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:22.510
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to elaborate on like,</v>

1691
01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:23.570
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1692
01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:26.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming more rigidly holding onto you,</v>

1693
01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.570
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When facebook,</v>

1694
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:32.430
<v Speaker 3>it's not precisely the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not precisely the officer because,</v>

1695
01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:37.551
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'll,</v>

1696
01:38:37.551 --> 01:38:39.180
<v Speaker 3>I'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get back to this.</v>

1697
01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:46.260
<v Speaker 3>If the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the environment has become,</v>

1698
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:48.053
<v Speaker 3>has turned against you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's a sign that it's time to </v>

1699
01:38:52.261 --> 01:38:57.261
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice the cake because</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1700
01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:01.770
<v Speaker 3>the unknown is only negative in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to an idea.</v>

1701
01:39:01.890 --> 01:39:02.910
<v Speaker 3>We already know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1702
01:39:02.911 --> 01:39:03.744
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we've been talking about </v>

1703
01:39:04.201 --> 01:39:06.000
<v Speaker 3>with regards to the structure of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

1704
01:39:06.001 --> 01:39:06.834
<v Speaker 3>All lawns that you construe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation valence of something with </v>

1705
01:39:10.891 --> 01:39:15.660
<v Speaker 3>respect to your current story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the mythological story basically says</v>

1706
01:39:15.661 --> 01:39:18.690
<v Speaker 3>if negative things are happening all </v>
<v Speaker 3>around you,</v>

1707
01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:23.130
<v Speaker 3>it's not the environment as an objective</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1708
01:39:23.131 --> 01:39:24.840
<v Speaker 3>There's something wrong with the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're living.</v>

1709
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.950
<v Speaker 3>That's why well say in an archaic exists</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an archaic society.</v>

1710
01:39:28.951 --> 01:39:33.060
<v Speaker 3>It's actually frequently happen is if </v>
<v Speaker 3>things aren't working out,</v>

1711
01:39:33.061 --> 01:39:35.820
<v Speaker 3>like there's a foot long drought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's time to kill the king.</v>

1712
01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:37.860
<v Speaker 3>When you think about a stupid idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1713
01:39:37.861 --> 01:39:38.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they quit,</v>

1714
01:39:38.371 --> 01:39:40.350
<v Speaker 3>the Kale is the king has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug.</v>

1715
01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.633
<v Speaker 3>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point of the story is that the </v>

1716
01:39:44.881 --> 01:39:49.170
<v Speaker 3>environment in large part is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of your adaptive response.</v>

1717
01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:53.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a presence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in terms of its valence.</v>

1718
01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:54.713
<v Speaker 3>So it's a very intelligent to kill the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cane when things aren't going well </v>

1719
01:39:56.611 --> 01:39:59.610
<v Speaker 3>because after all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the king is the pattern of behavior that</v>

1720
01:39:59.611 --> 01:40:00.444
<v Speaker 3>constitutes the kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if the kingdom isn't going very </v>

1721
01:40:02.521 --> 01:40:03.354
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that the negative space of </v>

1722
01:40:04.351 --> 01:40:06.870
<v Speaker 3>the great mother is constantly a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1723
01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:10.330
<v Speaker 3>And who do you sacrifice when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice them to the grapevine?</v>

1724
01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:11.553
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In hopes that her causative facebook </v>

1725
01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:15.450
<v Speaker 3>reappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the funny thing is it works.</v>

1726
01:40:15.690 --> 01:40:17.760
<v Speaker 3>This is another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't,</v>

1727
01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:19.970
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like you,</v>

1728
01:40:19.971 --> 01:40:23.550
<v Speaker 3>you people are going to have to evaluate</v>
<v Speaker 3>these ideas over a longer time,</v>

1729
01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.830
<v Speaker 3>I suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll tell you,</v>

1730
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.903
<v Speaker 3>I've never read anything anywhere that </v>
<v Speaker 3>explains why people engaged in </v>

1731
01:40:29.731 --> 01:40:32.970
<v Speaker 3>sacrificial rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing that ever made any sense to</v>

1732
01:40:32.971 --> 01:40:34.160
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although people did it all.</v>

1733
01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:37.290
<v Speaker 3>So this makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

1734
01:40:37.291 --> 01:40:38.124
<v Speaker 3>The thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>participate in activities like that in </v>

1735
01:40:42.001 --> 01:40:45.780
<v Speaker 3>so many places over such long periods of</v>
<v Speaker 3>time for no reason whatsoever.</v>

1736
01:40:45.810 --> 01:40:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Well this is not ideally interact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1737
01:40:47.311 --> 01:40:49.800
<v Speaker 3>cause like if what you're doing isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>working,</v>

1738
01:40:50.350 --> 01:40:52.350
<v Speaker 3>kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do something else.</v>

1739
01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:54.063
<v Speaker 3>Good thinking.</v>

1740
01:40:57.870 --> 01:41:02.650
<v Speaker 3>So I don't understand why you'd have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>why in that diagram,</v>

1741
01:41:02.970 --> 01:41:04.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are the opposite each other?</v>

1742
01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:05.803
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the positive aspect of our culture </v>

1743
01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:09.450
<v Speaker 3>that protects you from the negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of it.</v>

1744
01:41:10.050 --> 01:41:12.110
<v Speaker 3>But it was like snacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1745
01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:13.990
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're stacked discs.</v>

1746
01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:18.520
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be better if you had to do four</v>

1747
01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:20.043
<v Speaker 4>more faces so that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the positive aspects of the Cape </v>

1748
01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.540
<v Speaker 4>couldn't line up with the positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspect.</v>

1749
01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:27.743
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

1750
01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:30.413
<v Speaker 3>because in that case you'll have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot him if he'll sketch that or </v>

1751
01:41:33.111 --> 01:41:36.690
<v Speaker 3>appreciate because I know the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something like there's something</v>

1752
01:41:36.691 --> 01:41:38.580
<v Speaker 3>missing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a receipt where the</v>

1753
01:41:39.630 --> 01:41:41.400
<v Speaker 4>indicating king where the negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>sinus.</v>

1754
01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:44.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll just make it a go</v>

1755
01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:56.370
<v Speaker 4>here</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the no weekend and also,</v>

1756
01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:20.850
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1757
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:22.223
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1758
01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about</v>

1759
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:32.200
<v Speaker 3>the idea that since there are stack </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1760
01:42:32.201 --> 01:42:35.560
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the known blocks you from the,</v>

1761
01:42:35.710 --> 01:42:36.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's still works,</v>

1762
01:42:36.851 --> 01:42:37.684
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is still inscribed inside </v>

1763
01:42:39.371 --> 01:42:41.470
<v Speaker 3>the circle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then this,</v>

1764
01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1765
01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:44.051
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1766
01:42:44.051 --> 01:42:45.910
<v Speaker 3>but then you have them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the positive,</v>

1767
01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>

1768
01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:49.120
<v Speaker 3>if it's not something that works by </v>
<v Speaker 3>blocking,</v>

1769
01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:51.210
<v Speaker 3>then you have the positive aspect of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>known you.</v>

1770
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:52.123
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1771
01:42:52.170 --> 01:42:53.950
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Positive aspect of the unknown,</v>

1772
01:42:55.210 --> 01:42:56.980
<v Speaker 3>which is what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other way to help them there.</v>

1773
01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:58.360
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1774
01:42:58.361 --> 01:43:00.880
<v Speaker 3>The negative because the negative of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative of the,</v>

1775
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:02.490
<v Speaker 3>but that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're more blacks.</v>

1776
01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:05.200
<v Speaker 3>The positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is true too though because they say</v>

1777
01:43:05.201 --> 01:43:09.130
<v Speaker 3>that good is the enemy of the better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say that you know,</v>

1778
01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:12.410
<v Speaker 3>well</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want a divorce,</v>

1779
01:43:12.411 --> 01:43:13.244
<v Speaker 3>you had keyboard is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well a divorce you might keep the </v>

1780
01:43:16.151 --> 01:43:16.984
<v Speaker 3>keyboard on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a computer is laid out so that you can </v>

1781
01:43:18.461 --> 01:43:19.294
<v Speaker 3>type slowly.</v>

1782
01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:20.463
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was designed on a for a manual type </v>

1783
01:43:23.631 --> 01:43:26.740
<v Speaker 3>partner and really fast typists with jam</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the keys.</v>

1784
01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:31.360
<v Speaker 3>So some bright character figured out how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to separate the most commonly used keys.</v>

1785
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:32.643
<v Speaker 3>So that really fast type is good and Jim</v>
<v Speaker 3>and manual type Rick horshack keyboard </v>

1786
01:43:36.821 --> 01:43:37.654
<v Speaker 3>where the key is that use most are laid </v>
<v Speaker 3>out very close to each other and you </v>

1787
01:43:39.971 --> 01:43:43.470
<v Speaker 3>hardly have to move your fingers at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I would like to,</v>

1788
01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.240
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to learn to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>divorce,</v>

1789
01:43:46.241 --> 01:43:49.030
<v Speaker 3>Shaq keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I already know how to use the qwerty</v>

1790
01:43:49.031 --> 01:43:50.800
<v Speaker 3>keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't,</v>

1791
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.023
<v Speaker 3>and that means that what I know stops me</v>
<v Speaker 3>from learning something because what I </v>

1792
01:43:56.061 --> 01:43:56.894
<v Speaker 3>know is good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stops me from learning something </v>

1793
01:43:58.461 --> 01:44:00.260
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm off to say,</v>

1794
01:44:00.261 --> 01:44:02.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean I see your objection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>

1795
01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:05.450
<v Speaker 3>It's sometimes it's hard to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>jump.</v>

1796
01:44:05.451 --> 01:44:06.284
<v Speaker 3>Not saying that it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that there's sort of </v>

1797
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:09.560
<v Speaker 3>mixing the metaphor of blocking with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphor of,</v>

1798
01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:11.480
<v Speaker 3>of revealing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1799
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:12.350
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1800
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:13.703
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have to keep this in mind and see </v>

1801
01:44:15.681 --> 01:44:18.890
<v Speaker 3>if there's a way of balancing both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then we're,</v>

1802
01:44:18.891 --> 01:44:21.980
<v Speaker 3>the reaction to threat in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment is to clean.</v>

1803
01:44:21.981 --> 01:44:24.660
<v Speaker 3>You are rigidly to the kid as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill the kid.</v>

1804
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Right now it would be the negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>

1805
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:37.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1806
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:39.080
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you mean.</v>

1807
01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what happens.</v>

1808
01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:41.293
<v Speaker 3>Good short term solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no walk in the long term cause </v>

1809
01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:44.810
<v Speaker 3>damage to your father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1810
01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:49.610
<v Speaker 3>all you're doing is accumulating is knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is like here's a whole</v>

1811
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:52.760
<v Speaker 3>bunch of disasters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have them one at a time,</v>

1812
01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:58.120
<v Speaker 3>over a long span of time or you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>shove them all into a clump out there in</v>

1813
01:44:58.281 --> 01:44:59.114
<v Speaker 3>the future and go along merrily until </v>
<v Speaker 3>you fall into them and have them all at </v>

1814
01:45:01.941 --> 01:45:02.720
<v Speaker 3>once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1815
01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.050
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's basically the,</v>

1816
01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:06.140
<v Speaker 3>that's the authoritarian answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>

1817
01:45:06.141 --> 01:45:08.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That may certainly the way that's right.</v>

1818
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1819
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:09.913
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things I want to make </v>

1820
01:45:10.731 --> 01:45:12.990
<v Speaker 3>more clear in the second half of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>manuscript,</v>

1821
01:45:13.110 --> 01:45:14.830
<v Speaker 3>which isn't very well laid out right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1822
01:45:14.831 --> 01:45:18.200
<v Speaker 3>it's that there are three patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 3>response to a normal.</v>

1823
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:22.160
<v Speaker 3>One is face it and do something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1824
01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.370
<v Speaker 3>which is basically admitted there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>number one,</v>

1825
01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:26.413
<v Speaker 3>and then engage in whatever modification</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your story is necessary to produce </v>

1826
01:45:31.401 --> 01:45:33.440
<v Speaker 3>something positive from your encounter </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

1827
01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:34.933
<v Speaker 3>The second one is circle the wagons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say some anomaly is facing </v>

1828
01:45:39.891 --> 01:45:40.724
<v Speaker 3>me from outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid of the known because I've </v>

1829
01:45:42.821 --> 01:45:45.920
<v Speaker 3>sacrificed my relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hero.</v>

1830
01:45:46.670 --> 01:45:47.503
<v Speaker 3>That's what an authoritarian does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not creative like the emperor's </v>

1831
01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:54.980
<v Speaker 3>creative for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just do what he says.</v>

1832
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:57.163
<v Speaker 3>When you circle the wagons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you also restrict the amount of novelty </v>

1833
01:45:59.931 --> 01:46:04.931
<v Speaker 3>that exists within your constricted </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and dampen down your aspect,</v>

1834
01:46:05.801 --> 01:46:06.890
<v Speaker 3>act as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1835
01:46:06.891 --> 01:46:09.980
<v Speaker 3>Because you make everyone the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what authoritarians too.</v>

1836
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:12.890
<v Speaker 3>So that's one way of going about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wrong.</v>

1837
01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:13.933
<v Speaker 3>The other way of going about it wrong is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it supposed to be the king is dead long </v>

1838
01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:19.874
<v Speaker 3>live the king.</v>

1839
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:23.750
<v Speaker 3>The wrong way of going about it is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>king is dead period,</v>

1840
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:26.750
<v Speaker 3>period and people are motivated to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1841
01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:27.920
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you'd say,</v>

1842
01:46:27.921 --> 01:46:28.754
<v Speaker 3>why the hell would someone do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we already know that you need </v>

1843
01:46:30.621 --> 01:46:32.660
<v Speaker 3>the king around or you're flooded with </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>

1844
01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:35.780
<v Speaker 3>so why kill him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While the thing is people do that,</v>

1845
01:46:35.781 --> 01:46:36.614
<v Speaker 3>you know that's that artistic or </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebellious sort of sort of style of </v>

1846
01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:40.604
<v Speaker 3>adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with having a king is </v>

1847
01:46:42.831 --> 01:46:43.664
<v Speaker 3>that you have to do what he says and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the price you pay for your </v>

1848
01:46:45.681 --> 01:46:46.514
<v Speaker 3>security.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be willing to get rid them if </v>

1849
01:46:49.411 --> 01:46:52.560
<v Speaker 3>you can't stand any responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>

1850
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:55.740
<v Speaker 3>that's the alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>improper mode that a patient,</v>

1851
01:46:55.741 --> 01:47:00.741
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where you get this right </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Chinese medicine there order</v>

1852
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:05.303
<v Speaker 3>and chaos and if you're ill it's because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have too much yin and Yang or you </v>

1853
01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.513
<v Speaker 3>have too much Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You note about the end and the job that </v>

1854
01:47:14.611 --> 01:47:18.120
<v Speaker 3>the Chinese doctor is to analyze you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

1855
01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:22.440
<v Speaker 3>to ensure that the balance between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>two phenomena is optimal,</v>

1856
01:47:22.441 --> 01:47:23.274
<v Speaker 3>which means that you're here instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>over here in the authoritarian zone of </v>

1857
01:47:27.571 --> 01:47:29.570
<v Speaker 3>the world are over here in the chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>zone.</v>

1858
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:36.863
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so next week we start talking about </v>

1859
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:42.750
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The final part of the story,</v>

1860
01:47:42.751 --> 01:47:45.660
<v Speaker 3>which is</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1861
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:49.710
<v Speaker 3>which is I'm interested in you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we know,</v>

1862
01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:55.020
<v Speaker 3>we know that you have a very good reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>for protecting your culture,</v>

1863
01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.390
<v Speaker 3>which is that it regulates your </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions.</v>

1864
01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:01.613
<v Speaker 3>What I'm interested in is given that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's necessary for you to maintain your </v>

1865
01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:05.814
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in the face of threats from other </v>

1866
01:48:06.991 --> 01:48:07.824
<v Speaker 3>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there patterns of personal behavior </v>

1867
01:48:11.221 --> 01:48:12.054
<v Speaker 3>that amplify it's are there patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal behavior and amplified the </v>

1868
01:48:17.251 --> 01:48:20.880
<v Speaker 3>danger of culture and patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior that reduce it?</v>

1869
01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:22.253
<v Speaker 3>So is there something about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to your culture that can </v>

1870
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:29.520
<v Speaker 3>either exacerbate intrinsic problems of </v>
<v Speaker 3>group identification or reduce them?</v>

1871
01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:32.430
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we're going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out in the last part of the course.</v>

1872
01:48:32.850 --> 01:48:33.683
<v Speaker 3>It's like culture's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with the necessity of </v>

1873
01:48:36.511 --> 01:48:41.280
<v Speaker 3>culture is that it virtually ensures the</v>
<v Speaker 3>existence of conflict.</v>

1874
01:48:41.970 --> 01:48:42.803
<v Speaker 3>Given that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a way to act to make it worse </v>

1875
01:48:44.821 --> 01:48:47.700
<v Speaker 3>or to make it better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what we're going to talk</v>

1876
01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:50.203
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
