1
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Because we're in Vancouver</v>
<v Speaker 1>is daunting.</v>

2
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Who here for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan and</v>

3
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.393
<v Speaker 2>given me the honor of moderating this </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate or discussion depending on how </v>

4
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:55.741
<v Speaker 2>you view it and I think that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>creates a certain kind of responsibility</v>

5
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 2>and I want to talk to you about my </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and who I see it in my.</v>

6
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 2>My sense of how you all have </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility in this as well.</v>

7
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that what's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight is actually historical,</v>

8
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't necessarily make it good </v>
<v Speaker 2>as lots of</v>

9
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 3>bad history.</v>

10
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 2>It could be good though and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping will happen.</v>

11
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.413
<v Speaker 2>So the reason I say I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical is that we are existing in a </v>

12
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:22.134
<v Speaker 2>moment where all of the systems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have helped us make sense are breaking </v>

13
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 2>down the university.</v>

14
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.670
<v Speaker 3>The students are breaking down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalism is breaking down</v>

15
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 2>and at that same moment we have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>network of people who are trying to make</v>

16
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:40.364
<v Speaker 2>sense in an alternative way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have to say I think beating the </v>

17
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 2>odds for the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the problem.</v>

18
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.873
<v Speaker 2>That network is not entirely in </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement with itself about some </v>

19
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 2>significant issues in Sam and have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

20
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what could happen tonight is we could</v>

21
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:01.880
<v Speaker 2>have some sort of a failure where things</v>
<v Speaker 2>get even more muddled.</v>

22
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.910
<v Speaker 2>We could tread water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're nothing gets clearer.</v>

23
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.190
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it would be entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it wouldn't,</v>

24
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.413
<v Speaker 2>but best case scenario is that we figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to make sense of things that </v>

25
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:13.124
<v Speaker 2>have gotten in our way before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if that happens then you all will </v>

26
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.330
<v Speaker 2>leave here and as you talk in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>various networks,</v>

27
00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:21.164
<v Speaker 2>you will have something to say about in </v>
<v Speaker 2>what way we upgraded our software so </v>

28
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:28.220
<v Speaker 2>that we could talk more deeply about </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult issues.</v>

29
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.113
<v Speaker 2>So and to that end we would ask that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>not film tonight's discussion and </v>

30
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:38.690
<v Speaker 2>broadcast and online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that we want to hide this.</v>

31
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:43.691
<v Speaker 2>In fact we encourage you to discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we would like to have all of us feel</v>

32
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.593
<v Speaker 2>maximally free to speak here to try out </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions that we haven't tried out </v>

33
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:52.610
<v Speaker 2>before in the hopes that we can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere new.</v>

34
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.823
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

35
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.073
<v Speaker 2>see if we can head towards some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions that have difficult in the </v>

36
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.263
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

37
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

38
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.383
<v Speaker 5>I think I'll just start by saying that</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we first had the idea to do this </v>

39
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:30.090
<v Speaker 5>now some months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm getting a little reverb,</v>

40
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.800
<v Speaker 5>so if you can dial down then there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>white one,</v>

41
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.350
<v Speaker 5>Jordan I first designed to do is you do </v>
<v Speaker 5>an event together was after we did those</v>

42
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.063
<v Speaker 5>somewhat ill fated podcasts and I joke </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we would probably need a safe word </v>

43
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.250
<v Speaker 5>for this event.</v>

44
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.083
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

45
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.920
<v Speaker 5>that safe word as will come as no </v>
<v Speaker 5>surprise is lobster.</v>

46
00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.100
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

47
00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.741
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll know,</v>

48
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 5>things are dire when one of us says says</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

49
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.413
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

50
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.943
<v Speaker 5>I just want to express my motive for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>helping to stage these events into it </v>

51
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.640
<v Speaker 5>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

52
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.490
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I reached out to Jordan,</v>

53
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.533
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

54
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.083
<v Speaker 5>it really was born of him in </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation with people other than </v>

55
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.820
<v Speaker 5>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw him do a podcast with Joe Rogan.</v>

56
00:04:22.821 --> 00:04:23.654
<v Speaker 5>I saw him speak to Dave Rubin as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking with Brett on Rogan's podcast </v>

57
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.323
<v Speaker 5>and I had so much admiration for him in </v>
<v Speaker 5>those conversations is 90 percent of </v>

58
00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:35.264
<v Speaker 5>what he said in those conversations </v>
<v Speaker 5>struck me as really wise and useful and </v>

59
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:43.730
<v Speaker 5>well intentioned and 10 percent didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And but I,</v>

60
00:04:43.731 --> 00:04:44.564
<v Speaker 5>and I noticed that it was clear to me </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I am seeing these successful </v>

61
00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:51.090
<v Speaker 5>conversations with other people who I </v>
<v Speaker 5>respect.</v>

62
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 5>I began to wonder that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

63
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 5>I might be the problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

64
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.680
<v Speaker 5>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I am the problem.</v>

65
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.090
<v Speaker 5>Before you applied,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I didn't mean that quite the way</v>

66
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.043
<v Speaker 4>took it.</v>

67
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.063
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a good sort of problem for </v>

68
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:14.334
<v Speaker 5>Jordan to have because it's what happens</v>
<v Speaker 5>on those 10 percent moments and what </v>

69
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:24.120
<v Speaker 5>doesn't happen that I think made our </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversations so hard and,</v>

70
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.120
<v Speaker 5>and I think there is stuff to clarify </v>
<v Speaker 5>between us.</v>

71
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:29.760
<v Speaker 5>So I look forward to doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And thank you Jordan,</v>

72
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:30.594
<v Speaker 5>for agreeing to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an honor to share the stage with </v>

73
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:35.040
<v Speaker 5>you and needless to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having Brett as a moderator is a,</v>

74
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.683
<v Speaker 5>almost an obscene underestimation of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>role he should be playing at any stage </v>

75
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:42.894
<v Speaker 5>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you know,</v>

76
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.020
<v Speaker 5>he's been on my podcast and that was one</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the best conversations I've ever had.</v>

77
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:47.370
<v Speaker 5>So thank you for doing this.</v>

78
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.810
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

79
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 7>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I'm going to jump right into it.</v>

80
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 7>I think you're.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So look,</v>

81
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:09.404
<v Speaker 7>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I put up a poll a couple of days ago to </v>

82
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:12.254
<v Speaker 7>find out what people broadly speaking </v>
<v Speaker 7>might want us to discuss and I'd been </v>

83
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:17.570
<v Speaker 7>taking a look at that and I took a lot </v>
<v Speaker 7>of notes,</v>

84
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 7>which is why I have my computer here by </v>
<v Speaker 7>the way on my phone.</v>

85
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:22.180
<v Speaker 7>It's not to check my email.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

86
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.053
<v Speaker 7>the debates going on the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought what I might do is just lay </v>

87
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 7>out some places that I think Sam and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>agree and because there's lots of places</v>

88
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 7>we agree and so and then I want to </v>
<v Speaker 7>figure out where we disagree,</v>

89
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 7>which I've been trying to sort out and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then I want to see if we can hash it out</v>

90
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 7>a little bit and move forward on that a </v>
<v Speaker 7>bit.</v>

91
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 7>So I'm going to lay out.</v>

92
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 7>See,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the things that Carl Rogers said,</v>

93
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:47.804
<v Speaker 7>this psych psych psychologist was that </v>
<v Speaker 7>one good way to have a discussion with </v>

94
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:51.674
<v Speaker 7>someone is to tell them what you think </v>
<v Speaker 7>they think until they think that what </v>

95
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:58.570
<v Speaker 7>you said reflects what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'd like.</v>

96
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.413
<v Speaker 7>This is really useful thing to know if </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're ever having a discussion with an </v>

97
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:02.324
<v Speaker 7>intimate partner for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that you have to put their argument </v>

98
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 7>back to them in terms they agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's very difficult.</v>

99
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.160
<v Speaker 7>So I'm going to try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so.</v>

100
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 7>So the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

101
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.640
<v Speaker 7>I think that partly what's driving you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if,</v>

102
00:07:15.641 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 7>if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if this is accurate,</v>

103
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:21.911
<v Speaker 7>is that you want to ground a structure </v>
<v Speaker 7>of ethics in something solid and,</v>

104
00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:23.674
<v Speaker 7>and there's two,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's two things you want to avoid to </v>

105
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:27.734
<v Speaker 7>catastrophes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's say one is the catastrophe that </v>

106
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:30.494
<v Speaker 7>you identified with religious </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamentalism and the other is the </v>

107
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 7>catastrophe that's associated with moral</v>
<v Speaker 7>relativism.</v>

108
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 7>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that reasonable?</v>

109
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:37.724
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's good.</v>

110
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>good.</v>

111
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 7>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

112
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:40.184
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

113
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.053
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's crucially crucially important </v>

114
00:07:46.561 --> 00:07:47.394
<v Speaker 7>that we get this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's something that I think we </v>

115
00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:51.324
<v Speaker 7>really agree on because I've </v>
<v Speaker 7>conceptualized that slightly different </v>

116
00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:55.074
<v Speaker 7>than you and that might be relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think of that as a pathology of </v>

117
00:07:58.021 --> 00:07:58.854
<v Speaker 7>order and a pathology of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the terminology is slightly </v>

118
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:02.424
<v Speaker 7>different,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think we're working on the same </v>

119
00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:04.860
<v Speaker 7>axis.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

120
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.720
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so that's the first thing.</v>

121
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:07.643
<v Speaker 7>And then in order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it seems to me that's your first </v>

122
00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:12.804
<v Speaker 7>priority.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then maybe your second priority is </v>

123
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.440
<v Speaker 7>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

124
00:08:16.441 --> 00:08:20.430
<v Speaker 7>you see undue suffering in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>plenty of it,</v>

125
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:21.983
<v Speaker 7>and you would think that things would be</v>
<v Speaker 7>better if that wasn't the case and that </v>

126
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:27.743
<v Speaker 7>this morality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever it's going to be is at least </v>

127
00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:31.554
<v Speaker 7>going to ground itself in part on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>presupposition that the less undue </v>

128
00:08:36.151 --> 00:08:37.740
<v Speaker 7>suffering in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the better.</v>

129
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.020
<v Speaker 7>So is that also reasonable?</v>

130
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 8>I would just add to that the positive </v>
<v Speaker 8>side of the continuum as well.</v>

131
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:44.984
<v Speaker 8>So as you know the phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I use the word I use for this as well </v>

132
00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:51.920
<v Speaker 8>being,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I know from having.</v>

133
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 8>I don't think we spoke about this on my </v>
<v Speaker 8>podcast,</v>

134
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 8>but from having seen in other </v>
<v Speaker 8>interviews,</v>

135
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:56.604
<v Speaker 8>I think you think that phrase doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>capture everything one could reasonably </v>

136
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 8>want,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I think it does.</v>

137
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 8>I mean I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

138
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:04.550
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

139
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.760
<v Speaker 8>it's an elastic suitcase term for a </v>
<v Speaker 8>reason and it's,</v>

140
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.973
<v Speaker 8>it's actually in reading your book,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I realize there's a point of contact </v>

141
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:12.294
<v Speaker 8>here because you used the word being </v>
<v Speaker 8>capital b been with as though it were </v>

142
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:19.430
<v Speaker 8>imbued with significant gravitas.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And</v>

143
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 8>so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I agree with you,</v>

144
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:23.694
<v Speaker 8>that's an inappropriate use of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of being a and for me wellbeing is </v>

145
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:30.190
<v Speaker 8>simply just the positive side of being,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

146
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 8>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's the negative side,</v>

147
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.274
<v Speaker 8>the suffering we want to mitigate.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But I think I think however good </v>

148
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.653
<v Speaker 8>consciousness can be in this universe,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that the wellbeing for me subsumes all </v>

149
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:42.264
<v Speaker 8>of those possibilities.</v>

150
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.801
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

151
00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:43.634
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I focused on the suffering element I </v>

152
00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:46.034
<v Speaker 7>think as I've done in my own work </v>
<v Speaker 7>because I actually think it's easier to </v>

153
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:51.560
<v Speaker 7>zero in on in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I think it's easier for people.</v>

154
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.530
<v Speaker 7>And I think you lay out the argument in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the moral landscape kind of like this.</v>

155
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.210
<v Speaker 7>I think it's easier perhaps to gain </v>
<v Speaker 7>initial agreement between people on what</v>

156
00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:03.680
<v Speaker 7>might constitute a generalized ethic to </v>
<v Speaker 7>concentrate on what we don't want.</v>

157
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.410
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying that what we do want is </v>
<v Speaker 7>unimportant,</v>

158
00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:08.420
<v Speaker 7>but it seems to me to be harder to get a</v>
<v Speaker 7>grip on.</v>

159
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.810
<v Speaker 7>We don't want to Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we don't want to go like archipelago.</v>

160
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.153
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And</v>

161
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.203
<v Speaker 8>there are those and I would add to just </v>
<v Speaker 8>closing the door to moral relativism </v>

162
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.820
<v Speaker 8>here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those who do want Auschwitz are wrong to</v>

163
00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:20.680
<v Speaker 8>want Auschwitz.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

164
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.170
<v Speaker 8>obviously it's only happened because </v>
<v Speaker 8>some people did want Auschwitz,</v>

165
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.050
<v Speaker 8>not the victim side,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the perpetrator side.</v>

166
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.280
<v Speaker 8>And so crucially for me is the claim </v>
<v Speaker 8>that</v>

167
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.740
<v Speaker 8>I'm a realist.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm a moral realist and realism means is</v>

168
00:10:36.741 --> 00:10:37.574
<v Speaker 8>that it's that there are right and wrong</v>
<v Speaker 8>answers to the question of this kind </v>

169
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.943
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you can not know what you're </v>

170
00:10:42.381 --> 00:10:43.041
<v Speaker 8>missing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In fact,</v>

171
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:43.874
<v Speaker 8>we almost certainly don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 8>we're missing on questions of human </v>

172
00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:49.880
<v Speaker 8>value.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then our job is to discover just how</v>

173
00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:50.714
<v Speaker 8>good life can be and just what variables</v>
<v Speaker 8>are making it needlessly horrible and </v>

174
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:58.160
<v Speaker 8>to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to mitigate all of that and live in a,</v>

175
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.960
<v Speaker 8>in a better and better world.</v>

176
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.981
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so.</v>

177
00:11:00.981 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

178
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.333
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

179
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.460
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>

180
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.200
<v Speaker 7>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a lot of points of agreement.</v>

181
00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:14.201
<v Speaker 7>So I also believe that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 7>catastrophe of,</v>

182
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.533
<v Speaker 7>of arbitrary moral injunction and that </v>
<v Speaker 7>there is a catastrophe of moral </v>

183
00:11:18.981 --> 00:11:20.940
<v Speaker 7>relativism and that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

184
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.863
<v Speaker 7>that has to be dealt with and that there</v>
<v Speaker 7>are genuine differences between the </v>

185
00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:30.560
<v Speaker 7>proper way of behaving morally and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>improper way of behaving morally.</v>

186
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.800
<v Speaker 7>And I think that they are grounded in </v>
<v Speaker 7>human human universals,</v>

187
00:11:33.801 --> 00:11:37.580
<v Speaker 7>even though there's a wide amount of </v>
<v Speaker 7>variation so that that's a lot of points</v>

188
00:11:37.581 --> 00:11:38.331
<v Speaker 7>of agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

189
00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:41.240
<v Speaker 7>So we know that there's two things we </v>
<v Speaker 7>want to avoid.</v>

190
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:42.973
<v Speaker 7>We conceptually speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is the most moral relativism in </v>

191
00:11:46.221 --> 00:11:47.054
<v Speaker 7>this kind of moral absolutism that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>grounded in an arbitrary statement of </v>

192
00:11:51.051 --> 00:11:53.210
<v Speaker 7>facts that you identify with religious </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamentalism.</v>

193
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.200
<v Speaker 7>I would identify that with fungilin </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamentalism more generally,</v>

194
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.063
<v Speaker 7>not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not with religious fundamentalism per </v>

195
00:11:58.301 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 7>se,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I see it also happening,</v>

196
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 7>happening in secular states,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say like Nazi Germany or or,</v>

197
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.283
<v Speaker 7>or so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't seem to be religious </v>

198
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:08.170
<v Speaker 7>fundamentalism per se.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's crucial to your argument.</v>

199
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.103
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not.</v>

200
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.493
<v Speaker 8>Just to close the loop on that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the only reason why I would focus on </v>

201
00:12:13.461 --> 00:12:18.461
<v Speaker 8>religion in particular there is that </v>
<v Speaker 8>religion is the only language game where</v>

202
00:12:19.131 --> 00:12:24.131
<v Speaker 8>in fundamentalism and of dogmatism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>dogmatism is not a pejorative concept.</v>

203
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.523
<v Speaker 8>A Dogma is a good word,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and specifically within Catholicism and </v>

204
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.453
<v Speaker 8>the notion that you must believe things </v>
<v Speaker 8>on faith that is in the absence of </v>

205
00:12:34.281 --> 00:12:37.550
<v Speaker 8>compelling evidence that would otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 8>cause a rational person to believe it.</v>

206
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.570
<v Speaker 8>That in a religious context is </v>
<v Speaker 8>considered a feature,</v>

207
00:12:41.571 --> 00:12:42.404
<v Speaker 8>not a bug elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We recognize it to be a bug and that's </v>

208
00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 8>why the</v>

209
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.383
<v Speaker 7>focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

210
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.273
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>

211
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.490
<v Speaker 7>so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All right.</v>

212
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.070
<v Speaker 7>So is it reasonable to assume that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>associate,</v>

213
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.200
<v Speaker 7>we've already established,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at least in principle,</v>

214
00:12:54.201 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 7>that there's an association between the </v>
<v Speaker 7>totalitarian regimes,</v>

215
00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.170
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and a dog and dogmatism,</v>

216
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.840
<v Speaker 7>dogmatism that characterize his </v>
<v Speaker 7>religious belief.</v>

217
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.890
<v Speaker 7>What do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>although it,</v>

218
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.743
<v Speaker 7>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the secularist totalitarian states and </v>

219
00:13:09.381 --> 00:13:12.920
<v Speaker 7>the religious fundamentalists,</v>
<v Speaker 7>totalitarian states do different,</v>

220
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.590
<v Speaker 7>one important regard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is that the religious types ground</v>

221
00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:19.670
<v Speaker 7>their axioms in God and the secular </v>
<v Speaker 7>totalitarian types don't.</v>

222
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:20.743
<v Speaker 7>And so there's got to be something about</v>
<v Speaker 7>totalitarianism per se that's </v>

223
00:13:23.901 --> 00:13:24.734
<v Speaker 7>independent of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's associated with religious belief </v>

224
00:13:27.651 --> 00:13:28.484
<v Speaker 7>in the manner that you just described,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's not particularly associated </v>

225
00:13:31.341 --> 00:13:33.440
<v Speaker 7>with the belief in God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's something that makes them,</v>

226
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.453
<v Speaker 7>it's a commonality between them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so do you have any sense of what </v>

227
00:13:36.921 --> 00:13:37.760
<v Speaker 7>that might be?</v>

228
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.233
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

229
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.840
<v Speaker 8>I think one has to acknowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 8>there's something uniquely pernicious,</v>

230
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:48.364
<v Speaker 8>at least potentially about religious </v>
<v Speaker 8>beliefs because they have the other </v>

231
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:55.720
<v Speaker 8>worldly variable,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the supernatural variable.</v>

232
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.790
<v Speaker 8>The,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

233
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.610
<v Speaker 8>you're gonna get everything you want </v>
<v Speaker 8>after you die.</v>

234
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:04.150
<v Speaker 8>So this life doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Issue that,</v>

235
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.580
<v Speaker 8>that allows for a kind of misbehavior </v>
<v Speaker 8>that is especially.</v>

236
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.231
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

237
00:14:10.231 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Speaker 7>so it seems that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so that the claim would be that if you,</v>

238
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.630
<v Speaker 7>if you put forward axiomatically your </v>
<v Speaker 7>claim that God exists,</v>

239
00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.493
<v Speaker 7>then you can use that claim to justify </v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever arbitrary atrocities your </v>

240
00:14:22.971 --> 00:14:24.170
<v Speaker 7>system might throw off.</v>

241
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:25.443
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I guess the only point I was making </v>

242
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:27.304
<v Speaker 8>there is that not all dogmas are created</v>
<v Speaker 8>equal and some dogmas are on their face </v>

243
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 8>more dangerous and more divisive.</v>

244
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.373
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what I'm curious about specifically </v>

245
00:14:34.851 --> 00:14:35.684
<v Speaker 7>is because it seems to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>dogmas of the USSR and the dogmas of </v>

246
00:14:38.601 --> 00:14:39.434
<v Speaker 7>Nazi Germany where as pernicious as any </v>
<v Speaker 7>religious dog dogmas and they may also </v>

247
00:14:44.211 --> 00:14:46.740
<v Speaker 7>share important features with pernicious</v>
<v Speaker 7>religious candles,</v>

248
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.693
<v Speaker 7>but it isn't clear to me from your </v>
<v Speaker 7>perspective what those commonalities </v>

249
00:14:50.811 --> 00:14:51.644
<v Speaker 7>would.</v>

250
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.813
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I mean in some ways your </v>

251
00:14:55.601 --> 00:14:56.434
<v Speaker 5>recapitulated in an argument I've made,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is an argument that I would </v>

252
00:14:58.641 --> 00:14:59.474
<v Speaker 5>make against you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were you declaim as you've had you have </v>

253
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:02.654
<v Speaker 5>elsewhere that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that atheism is responsible for the </v>

254
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 5>greatest atrocities of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea that Stalin,</v>

255
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:10.064
<v Speaker 5>Ism and Nazi-ism and fascism were </v>
<v Speaker 5>expressions of atheism simply doesn't </v>

256
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:17.980
<v Speaker 5>make any sense in the case of fascism </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Nazis,</v>

257
00:15:17.981 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 5>and it doesn't make any sense because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fascists and the Nazis,</v>

258
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:22.200
<v Speaker 5>by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not even atheist,</v>

259
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.073
<v Speaker 5>mean Hitler wasn't an atheist and he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about executing a divine plan </v>

260
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:27.584
<v Speaker 5>and he got lots of support from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>churches and the Vatican did nothing to </v>

261
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 5>stop him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Fascism as you know,</v>

262
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.673
<v Speaker 5>a coexisted quite happily with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Catholicism in Croatia and Portugal and </v>

263
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 5>Spain and Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

264
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.563
<v Speaker 5>but even in the case of stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was so wrong with that situation </v>

265
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 5>was where all of the ways in which it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>so resembled a religion.</v>

266
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:52.220
<v Speaker 5>You had a personality cult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had dogmatism,</v>

267
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

268
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:54.763
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>held sway to a point where apostasy and </v>

269
00:15:57.891 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 5>blasts with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're killing offenses.</v>

270
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.520
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the people who,</v>

271
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.383
<v Speaker 5>who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who didn't toe the line were eradicated </v>

272
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:09.320
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so and so to take a more modern example,</v>

273
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:10.154
<v Speaker 5>North Korea is a religious cult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just doesn't happen to be a one that </v>

274
00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:18.110
<v Speaker 5>is focused on the next life or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

275
00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>supernatural claims.</v>

276
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.650
<v Speaker 7>So what we imagined if.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

277
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:22.484
<v Speaker 7>so what would be the defining </v>
<v Speaker 7>characteristics of a religious </v>

278
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.483
<v Speaker 7>totalitarian movement that would make it</v>
<v Speaker 7>different from a nonreligious </v>

279
00:16:27.501 --> 00:16:28.580
<v Speaker 7>totalitarian movement?</v>

280
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.761
<v Speaker 5>Similar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

281
00:16:30.761 --> 00:16:31.180
<v Speaker 5>They may,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

282
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.340
<v Speaker 5>they're very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the problem is dogmatism.</v>

283
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.810
<v Speaker 5>The overarching problem is believing </v>
<v Speaker 5>things strongly on bad evidence and B,</v>

284
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.673
<v Speaker 5>b,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the reason why dogmatism is so </v>

285
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.213
<v Speaker 5>dangerous is that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't allow us to revise our bad </v>

286
00:16:47.141 --> 00:16:47.974
<v Speaker 5>ideas in real time through conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is dogmas have to be enforced by </v>

287
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.313
<v Speaker 5>force or the threat of force.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the moment someone has a better </v>

288
00:16:55.361 --> 00:16:56.194
<v Speaker 5>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to shut it down in order to </v>

289
00:16:58.211 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 5>preserve your dog.</v>

290
00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.661
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

291
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:01.700
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so the commonality seems to be something</v>

292
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 7>like claims of absolute truth at some </v>
<v Speaker 7>level that can't be,</v>

293
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.970
<v Speaker 7>that you're no longer allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 7>discuss.</v>

294
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.021
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

295
00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:09.651
<v Speaker 7>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

296
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:11.660
<v Speaker 7>so that's another point of agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then I would say,</v>

297
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:13.730
<v Speaker 7>because part of the reason that I've </v>
<v Speaker 7>been,</v>

298
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.593
<v Speaker 7>let's say a free speech advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>although I don't think that's the right </v>

299
00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:19.990
<v Speaker 7>way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just because I think of free discourse,</v>

300
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.370
<v Speaker 7>the discourse that we're engaged in as </v>
<v Speaker 7>the mechanism that corrects totalitarian</v>

301
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:25.204
<v Speaker 7>excess or dogmatic excess,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so I also think that systems of </v>

302
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:32.690
<v Speaker 7>governance that are laying themselves </v>
<v Speaker 7>out properly have to evaluate,</v>

303
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.793
<v Speaker 7>have to elevate the process by which </v>
<v Speaker 7>dogmatic errors are corrected over the </v>

304
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:38.564
<v Speaker 7>dogmas themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is why I think the Americans are </v>

305
00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>say with regard to their first amendment</v>

306
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.843
<v Speaker 7>is the process of free speech is the </v>
<v Speaker 7>process by which dogmatic errors are </v>

307
00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:49.190
<v Speaker 7>rectified.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so it has to be put at the pinnacle,</v>

308
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 7>the hierarchy of values.</v>

309
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.030
<v Speaker 5>I think you and I totally agree about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the primacy of free speech.</v>

310
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.151
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

311
00:17:55.151 --> 00:17:55.661
<v Speaker 7>good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

312
00:17:55.661 --> 00:17:56.494
<v Speaker 7>so that's another.</v>

313
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.050
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

314
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.660
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so then we could think there's</v>

315
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.560
<v Speaker 9>point that we should just a lock in our </v>
<v Speaker 9>gains here.</v>

316
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.663
<v Speaker 9>It sounds like what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 9>that the reason to fear religious dogma </v>

317
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 9>is really on the dogma side and not the </v>
<v Speaker 9>religion side,</v>

318
00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:19.134
<v Speaker 9>which at least leaves open the </v>
<v Speaker 9>possibility that something could exist </v>

319
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.650
<v Speaker 9>over on the religion side that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 9>have that characteristic.</v>

320
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That often they travel in tandem,</v>

321
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.990
<v Speaker 9>but that the thing to fear is not the </v>
<v Speaker 9>religious belief.</v>

322
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 9>It is the dogmatic nature of the way it </v>
<v Speaker 9>is.</v>

323
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.003
<v Speaker 5>The other way to say that is the only </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that's wrong with religion is the </v>

324
00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:40.660
<v Speaker 5>dogmatism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you get rid of the dog,</v>

325
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:43.630
<v Speaker 5>I've got no problem with the buildings </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the music and the and the</v>

326
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.270
<v Speaker 7>Dan's and.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wait,</v>

327
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.223
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>

328
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 7>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wait a minute.</v>

329
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.833
<v Speaker 7>That's not a trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not a trivial point and it's not </v>

330
00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:51.534
<v Speaker 7>just a joke because the buildings and </v>
<v Speaker 7>the music are very important parts of </v>

331
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:55.584
<v Speaker 7>their religious process and so I know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know there's a humorous element to </v>

332
00:18:58.171 --> 00:18:59.004
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's not like Sam is throwing out </v>

333
00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:01.410
<v Speaker 7>the baby with the bathwater there</v>

334
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.370
<v Speaker 5>and to go further than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got no problem.</v>

335
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:06.204
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm deeply interested in the </v>

336
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:09.290
<v Speaker 5>phenomenology of spiritual experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

337
00:19:09.291 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 5>so whatever experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone like Jesus had,</v>

338
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 5>whoever he was historically or any of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other,</v>

339
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matriarchs and Patriarchs of the world's</v>

340
00:19:19.051 --> 00:19:24.051
<v Speaker 5>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that phenomenology is subjectively real.</v>

341
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is diverse.</v>

342
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying everyone's had the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience,</v>

343
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:28.344
<v Speaker 5>but there are changes in consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 5>that explain both how religions have </v>

344
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.504
<v Speaker 5>gotten founded by their founders and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences people have had in the </v>

345
00:19:38.641 --> 00:19:39.474
<v Speaker 5>presence of those people or by following</v>
<v Speaker 5>their methodologies that seemed to be </v>

346
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:46.140
<v Speaker 5>confirming of the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that got,</v>

347
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:49.510
<v Speaker 5>that grew up around those traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And My,</v>

348
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 5>my issue is that whatever is true about </v>
<v Speaker 5>us spiritually,</v>

349
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.680
<v Speaker 5>whatever opportunity being born to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>universe actually presented a matter of,</v>

350
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.620
<v Speaker 5>of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a spiritually,</v>

351
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 5>that truth has to be deeper than </v>
<v Speaker 5>accidents of culture.</v>

352
00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:11.730
<v Speaker 5>And just mere historical contingency is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that somebody was born in,</v>

353
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.470
<v Speaker 5>in Mesopotamia and not in China and got </v>
<v Speaker 5>a different language game.</v>

354
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so whatever is true,</v>

355
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:20.304
<v Speaker 5>there has to be understood in universal </v>
<v Speaker 5>terms about the nature of human </v>

356
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:25.680
<v Speaker 5>psychology and the human mind.</v>

357
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.720
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

358
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.950
<v Speaker 7>so now another thing that I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 7>just point out obliquely and then I want</v>

359
00:20:30.951 --> 00:20:34.070
<v Speaker 7>to return to outlining maybe where we </v>
<v Speaker 7>agree is that</v>

360
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.970
<v Speaker 7>one of the things that was really </v>
<v Speaker 7>shocking to me,</v>

361
00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:38.804
<v Speaker 7>I would say was the my reading of what </v>
<v Speaker 7>was originally Jane Goodall's discovery </v>

362
00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:45.080
<v Speaker 7>about chimp behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

363
00:20:45.081 --> 00:20:45.914
<v Speaker 7>because there is this idea that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>really in Rousseau in thinking that the </v>

364
00:20:49.121 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 7>reason that people committed atrocities </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the service of their group identity,</v>

365
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:57.760
<v Speaker 7>let's say their tribal identity was </v>
<v Speaker 7>because culture had corruptive.</v>

366
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.603
<v Speaker 7>So it was a uniquely human thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then of course good all showed in </v>

367
00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:05.530
<v Speaker 7>the 19 seventies that the chimps at </v>
<v Speaker 7>Gombe,</v>

368
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.400
<v Speaker 7>I think I'm pronouncing that correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>would go and raiding parties.</v>

369
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:10.234
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so there'd be like four or five </v>

370
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.360
<v Speaker 7>adolescent chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 7>usually male,</v>

371
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:14.194
<v Speaker 7>sometimes with a female in there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They would patrol the borders of their </v>

372
00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:17.524
<v Speaker 7>territory if they found an interloper on</v>
<v Speaker 7>the border near the border from another </v>

373
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.713
<v Speaker 7>troop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even if it was a member of their troop </v>

374
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 7>that had immigrated,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so to speak,</v>

375
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.830
<v Speaker 7>and that they knew that they had had </v>
<v Speaker 7>some history with.</v>

376
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.903
<v Speaker 7>They would tear them to pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And of course that was shocking to good </v>

377
00:21:33.111 --> 00:21:33.944
<v Speaker 7>old buddy and my understanding is she </v>
<v Speaker 7>had some trepidations about publishing </v>

378
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:38.590
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>although she did,</v>

379
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:43.420
<v Speaker 7>but then that's been noted repeatedly in</v>
<v Speaker 7>other forms of behavior.</v>

380
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.263
<v Speaker 7>So see,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been really interested in the </v>

381
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:48.910
<v Speaker 7>commission of atrocity in the surface of</v>
<v Speaker 7>belief,</v>

382
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.493
<v Speaker 7>and it's tempting to pin that say on on </v>
<v Speaker 7>Dogma and then to associate that with </v>

383
00:21:55.331 --> 00:21:57.130
<v Speaker 7>religious dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's all tempting,</v>

384
00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.293
<v Speaker 7>but the fact that chimps do it shows </v>
<v Speaker 7>that it can't be a consequence of </v>

385
00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:03.274
<v Speaker 7>something like religious belief unless </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're willing to say that the reason </v>

386
00:22:06.011 --> 00:22:06.844
<v Speaker 7>that chimps commit a trustee in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>service of their truth and their </v>

387
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.773
<v Speaker 7>territory is because chimps are </v>
<v Speaker 7>religious and so they're not religious </v>

388
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:16.700
<v Speaker 7>and they don't really hold a secular </v>
<v Speaker 7>totalitarian viewpoint,</v>

389
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.040
<v Speaker 7>but they act out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They still act out the atrocity element.</v>

390
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:23.230
<v Speaker 7>That's characteristic of human behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so to me,</v>

391
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 7>that makes the problem deeper than one </v>
<v Speaker 7>of mirror,</v>

392
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 7>let's say surface statements surface.</v>

393
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.503
<v Speaker 5>It's of metaphysics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The obviously the problem of primate </v>

394
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.823
<v Speaker 5>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we've inherited along with the </v>

395
00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:40.920
<v Speaker 5>Shims,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is deeper or at least different than the</v>

396
00:22:40.921 --> 00:22:41.754
<v Speaker 5>problem of religious violence or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or totalitarian political structure is </v>

397
00:22:46.781 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

398
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.650
<v Speaker 5>get the worst out data people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

399
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:50.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we have,</v>

400
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.743
<v Speaker 5>we have these primate capacities that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to correct for and we're busily </v>

401
00:22:55.051 --> 00:22:55.884
<v Speaker 5>trying to correct for almost everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we've have been evolved to do and </v>

402
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.400
<v Speaker 5>we're not w w we don't like the state of</v>
<v Speaker 5>nature for good reason.</v>

403
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.700
<v Speaker 5>And virtually everything that's good </v>
<v Speaker 5>about human life is born of our,</v>

404
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.760
<v Speaker 5>I would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>culture based and,</v>

405
00:23:10.761 --> 00:23:13.890
<v Speaker 5>and highly intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unnecessary effort to,</v>

406
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.030
<v Speaker 5>to mitigate what is in fact natural for </v>
<v Speaker 5>us and that,</v>

407
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.310
<v Speaker 5>and there's nothing more natural than </v>
<v Speaker 5>tribal violence,</v>

408
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.590
<v Speaker 5>which you have the source.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

409
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.920
<v Speaker 5>you're describing a chance.</v>

410
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:23.551
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

411
00:23:23.551 --> 00:23:28.551
<v Speaker 7>so then it also seems like we agree that</v>
<v Speaker 7>the core element of tribal alliance,</v>

412
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.150
<v Speaker 7>which would have its roots say and in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the chimpanzee proclivity to,</v>

413
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.133
<v Speaker 7>or it's analog and the chimpanzee </v>
<v Speaker 7>proclivity to identify with the </v>

414
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.283
<v Speaker 7>dominance hierarchy of the troop is </v>
<v Speaker 7>something that's a source of the </v>

415
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.363
<v Speaker 7>proclivity for human social aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's independent of it's at in </v>

416
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.900
<v Speaker 7>independent of any obvious religious </v>
<v Speaker 7>substrate.</v>

417
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.123
<v Speaker 7>So there are other reasons for group </v>
<v Speaker 7>belief and the Commission of a trustee </v>

418
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 7>that can't be directly attributed to two</v>
<v Speaker 7>religious dogma.</v>

419
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.493
<v Speaker 5>What most worries me about religion and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I was able to obviously religion can </v>

420
00:24:00.821 --> 00:24:05.821
<v Speaker 5>channel these primal urges in unhappy </v>
<v Speaker 5>ways so you can get tribal violence that</v>

421
00:24:06.881 --> 00:24:10.120
<v Speaker 5>gets amplified by religious dogmatism </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that should trouble everyone,</v>

422
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.890
<v Speaker 5>but it's not unique to religion is also </v>
<v Speaker 5>nationalism and his racism and his other</v>

423
00:24:14.891 --> 00:24:19.750
<v Speaker 5>kinds of dogmatism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what most worries me are those cases</v>

424
00:24:19.751 --> 00:24:20.584
<v Speaker 5>where clearly good people who are not </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily captured by tribalism per </v>

425
00:24:27.491 --> 00:24:28.730
<v Speaker 5>se,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

426
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.960
<v Speaker 5>are doing the unthinkable based purely </v>
<v Speaker 5>on religious doctrines that they believe</v>

427
00:24:35.771 --> 00:24:37.990
<v Speaker 5>wholeheartedly with without good </v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence.</v>

428
00:24:37.991 --> 00:24:38.824
<v Speaker 5>So you have the person who joins isis </v>
<v Speaker 5>who wasn't even Muslim before they </v>

429
00:24:43.391 --> 00:24:44.170
<v Speaker 5>converted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

430
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.003
<v Speaker 5>16 months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they go all the way down the rabbit </v>

431
00:24:48.101 --> 00:24:51.280
<v Speaker 5>hole to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most doctrinaire,</v>

432
00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:55.120
<v Speaker 5>most committed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most uncompromising view of just how you</v>

433
00:24:55.121 --> 00:24:55.954
<v Speaker 5>have to live in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to be Muslim and they </v>

434
00:24:58.901 --> 00:25:03.901
<v Speaker 5>join isis based on the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 5>salvation only goes one way and the dine</v>

435
00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:06.694
<v Speaker 5>and defends it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one true faith is the best thing </v>

436
00:25:08.621 --> 00:25:09.454
<v Speaker 5>that can happen to you.</v>

437
00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.580
<v Speaker 5>There's no question that there are </v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals who have made that journey.</v>

438
00:25:12.581 --> 00:25:13.414
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are individuals by the thousands </v>

439
00:25:14.201 --> 00:25:17.980
<v Speaker 5>who have made that journey and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>far more benign versions of that.</v>

440
00:25:17.981 --> 00:25:19.510
<v Speaker 5>There are people who just waste their </v>
<v Speaker 5>lives.</v>

441
00:25:19.511 --> 00:25:20.344
<v Speaker 5>I would argue converting to whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 5>belief system is and just wasting a lot </v>

442
00:25:23.111 --> 00:25:23.944
<v Speaker 5>of time worrying about hell or warning </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the fact that their child is gay </v>

443
00:25:28.871 --> 00:25:29.611
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

444
00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:31.870
<v Speaker 5>the creator of the universe doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>approve of that,</v>

445
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.103
<v Speaker 5>and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are all kinds of suffering that </v>

446
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.610
<v Speaker 5>striked me as truly unnecessary born.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not of,</v>

447
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.340
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>apelike urges,</v>

448
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:47.670
<v Speaker 5>but ideas that any rational person would</v>
<v Speaker 5>if believed,</v>

449
00:25:48.791 --> 00:25:51.190
<v Speaker 5>would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would follow to that same terminus.</v>

450
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing is if you buy,</v>

451
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:59.070
<v Speaker 5>if you buy the fact again to take Islam </v>
<v Speaker 5>as as a current example,</v>

452
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.063
<v Speaker 5>if you buy the claim that the Koran is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the perfect word of the creator of the </v>

453
00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:05.104
<v Speaker 5>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never to be superseded by anything </v>

454
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.833
<v Speaker 5>humanity does now or a thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 5>from now that commits a rational per </v>

455
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:14.523
<v Speaker 5>that then then the exercise of human </v>
<v Speaker 5>reason is bounded by this I would argue </v>

456
00:26:18.941 --> 00:26:19.774
<v Speaker 5>pathological frame which leads to </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain outcomes that we should really </v>

457
00:26:23.351 --> 00:26:24.184
<v Speaker 5>worry us.</v>

458
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.343
<v Speaker 7>So let's take that claim apart for a </v>
<v Speaker 7>minute because that's not your claim </v>

459
00:26:29.141 --> 00:26:31.330
<v Speaker 7>specifically the claim that you were </v>
<v Speaker 7>describing.</v>

460
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:32.463
<v Speaker 7>See because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's really not the claim that </v>

461
00:26:34.841 --> 00:26:35.674
<v Speaker 7>religious fundamentalists make.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The claim they make is worse than that </v>

462
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.413
<v Speaker 7>because they claim that the Koran or the</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bible for that matter is the literal </v>

463
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 7>word of God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but more than that,</v>

464
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:55.020
<v Speaker 7>they claimed that their understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 7>that word is correct.</v>

465
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.213
<v Speaker 7>Which means they conflate two things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because you could imagine a situation </v>

466
00:26:59.071 --> 00:27:01.350
<v Speaker 7>where you had a book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I'm not saying this is the case.</v>

467
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:05.520
<v Speaker 7>It's an imaginative exercise where you </v>
<v Speaker 7>had a book that had all the answers that</v>

468
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 7>was extraordinarily complicated and so </v>
<v Speaker 7>that when you read it,</v>

469
00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:09.684
<v Speaker 7>it wouldn't be obvious that you </v>
<v Speaker 7>understood it or perhaps it wouldn't be </v>

470
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 7>obvious that you didn't understand it </v>
<v Speaker 7>either,</v>

471
00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:18.531
<v Speaker 7>but you're not going to be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can't get an interpretive version of</v>

472
00:27:19.531 --> 00:27:20.364
<v Speaker 7>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so the fundamentalists claim is far </v>

473
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:22.944
<v Speaker 7>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's that not only is there an absolute </v>

474
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.343
<v Speaker 7>reality truth embedded in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that their particular take on that </v>

475
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:31.530
<v Speaker 7>absolute reality is the absolute take on</v>
<v Speaker 7>that book.</v>

476
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.930
<v Speaker 7>So they conflate their own.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

477
00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:34.773
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they make an assumption of their own </v>

478
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:39.070
<v Speaker 7>omniscience and then pass that off </v>
<v Speaker 7>quantic</v>

479
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.230
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>except in their defense,</v>

480
00:27:41.231 --> 00:27:43.720
<v Speaker 5>and I don't often rise to the defense of</v>
<v Speaker 5>fundamentalist.</v>

481
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.450
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very easy to get there because some</v>

482
00:27:50.451 --> 00:27:54.290
<v Speaker 5>of the claims in the book are not at all</v>
<v Speaker 5>hard to parse.</v>

483
00:27:54.291 --> 00:27:55.124
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many of them can only be honestly </v>

484
00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.800
<v Speaker 5>interpreted one way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So to take again an example that will be</v>

485
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:05.510
<v Speaker 5>not inflammatory to you but makes the </v>
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>

486
00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.573
<v Speaker 5>It just says that the remedy for theft </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Koran is to cut the hands off a </v>

487
00:28:12.741 --> 00:28:14.300
<v Speaker 5>thief,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me that you,</v>

488
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:18.770
<v Speaker 5>that that is the unambiguous injunction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not an allegory,</v>

489
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.293
<v Speaker 5>so the you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to dodge some kind of tortured </v>

490
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:28.663
<v Speaker 5>interpretive scheme to avoid the that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the shocking fact that the creator of </v>

491
00:28:33.681 --> 00:28:36.170
<v Speaker 5>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he thinks you should live this way for,</v>

492
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.080
<v Speaker 5>for all time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and people like Isis.</v>

493
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.073
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is my claim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this most of what is in these books </v>

494
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.990
<v Speaker 5>and this is what worries me about those </v>
<v Speaker 5>books because they can't be edited.</v>

495
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:53.680
<v Speaker 5>Most of what's in the books is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 5>not the best that humanity is capable of</v>

496
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.780
<v Speaker 5>in the ethical domain or in the</v>

497
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.713
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

498
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.190
<v Speaker 5>and and so and so clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is true for morality,</v>

499
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:10.260
<v Speaker 5>most pressingly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's true for science,</v>

500
00:29:10.261 --> 00:29:12.640
<v Speaker 5>is true for economic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is true for anything else that we,</v>

501
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:13.523
<v Speaker 5>we are wise to pay attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say Slavery is condoned in the Bible in </v>

502
00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:24.840
<v Speaker 5>both testaments and in the Koran.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no getting away from that.</v>

503
00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:26.130
<v Speaker 5>Now you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

504
00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 5>it's not the central thrust of any of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these books,</v>

505
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 5>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you go to the books and try to figure</v>

506
00:29:31.921 --> 00:29:32.754
<v Speaker 5>out what the creator of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 5>wants with respect to the owning and </v>

507
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.560
<v Speaker 5>needless immiseration of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

508
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Speaker 5>He expects you to keep slaves and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>told you how to do it.</v>

509
00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.413
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't knock out their eyes and their </v>

510
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:46.114
<v Speaker 5>teeth.</v>

511
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.910
<v Speaker 5>You don't take if you're a Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't take other Muslims as slaves,</v>

512
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.103
<v Speaker 5>but it's not an accident that the people</v>
<v Speaker 5>who joined Isis thought that it was </v>

513
00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.440
<v Speaker 5>absolutely kosher to take slaves to take</v>
<v Speaker 5>sex slaves,</v>

514
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:04.803
<v Speaker 5>and they were even there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their use of their sex slaves was </v>

515
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.910
<v Speaker 5>conducted as a sacrament and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>an accident.</v>

516
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:13.744
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they weren't getting grain over there </v>

517
00:30:14.801 --> 00:30:17.500
<v Speaker 5>that the Fed girls before they raped </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

518
00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:18.883
<v Speaker 5>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not unlike what many people </v>

519
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:22.864
<v Speaker 5>expect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that this doctrine is being </v>

520
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:28.114
<v Speaker 5>used as a pretext for people who would </v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise do terrible things like take </v>

521
00:30:32.531 --> 00:30:33.364
<v Speaker 5>sex slaves and raped them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's no net damage being done </v>

522
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:39.940
<v Speaker 5>here by this belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

523
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:42.490
<v Speaker 5>these are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would argue in many cases,</v>

524
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.353
<v Speaker 5>psychologically normal people who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>simply convinced of the absolute </v>

525
00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:47.794
<v Speaker 5>veracity of these ideas and and in in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this case that the perfect example of </v>

526
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:52.654
<v Speaker 5>Mohammed as the most self actualized </v>
<v Speaker 5>human who's ever existed and what did </v>

527
00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 5>Mohammed Mohammed Hooks.</v>

528
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.430
<v Speaker 5>Excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you know,</v>

529
00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:05.440
<v Speaker 5>he and he's an and then once you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once you grant that,</v>

530
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:06.663
<v Speaker 5>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is where there's a tension </v>

531
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:12.991
<v Speaker 5>between both how we pursue the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>goals as we've just established.</v>

532
00:31:13.211 --> 00:31:14.044
<v Speaker 5>We have many of the same goals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in so far as you make religion look </v>

533
00:31:18.851 --> 00:31:23.320
<v Speaker 5>palatable in so far as you suggest to </v>
<v Speaker 5>your audience that they can.</v>

534
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.570
<v Speaker 5>They can have their religious cake and </v>
<v Speaker 5>eat it too.</v>

535
00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:27.250
<v Speaker 5>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can have their reason.</v>

536
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.630
<v Speaker 5>They can have their respect for science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can have a 21st century worldview,</v>

537
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.493
<v Speaker 5>but they can also hold on to everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>they love and Christianity or fear to </v>

538
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:37.624
<v Speaker 5>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's undoubtedly mostly </v>

539
00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:41.710
<v Speaker 5>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but whatever,</v>

540
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:42.544
<v Speaker 5>any religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My concern is that it keeps us shackled </v>

541
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.063
<v Speaker 5>to these iron age philosophies and these</v>
<v Speaker 5>iron age conversations where we should </v>

542
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:56.620
<v Speaker 5>be having a 21st century conversation </v>
<v Speaker 5>about everything.</v>

543
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.410
<v Speaker 5>Ethics included.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

544
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.411
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>

545
00:32:06.411 --> 00:32:09.830
<v Speaker 9>so,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I want to ask you a little bit about</v>

546
00:32:09.831 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 9>your feeling about weight before.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Before you move on,</v>

547
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:17.720
<v Speaker 9>I want to get each of you to clarify </v>
<v Speaker 9>something so that we know we're where we</v>

548
00:32:17.721 --> 00:32:18.860
<v Speaker 9>are.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So Sam,</v>

549
00:32:18.861 --> 00:32:23.000
<v Speaker 9>you said the problem here is that the </v>
<v Speaker 9>dogma can't be updated,</v>

550
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:24.043
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>That slavery is with us permanently </v>

551
00:32:25.311 --> 00:32:26.144
<v Speaker 9>because it's written into the dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but clearly most of the traditions in </v>

552
00:32:28.371 --> 00:32:31.610
<v Speaker 9>which it's written into the holy book </v>
<v Speaker 9>don't practice slavery.</v>

553
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.070
<v Speaker 9>And the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

554
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:37.190
<v Speaker 9>who adhere to these belief systems </v>
<v Speaker 9>wouldn't defend slavery.</v>

555
00:32:37.191 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 9>So clearly there is the capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 9>an update mechanism,</v>

556
00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 8>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

557
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 8>they've been forced.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It had beaten out of them,</v>

558
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:44.910
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

559
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:45.743
<v Speaker 8>we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we fought a civil war in the US to get </v>

560
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:51.860
<v Speaker 8>rid of slavery as Christians who </v>
<v Speaker 8>abolished slavery in England though,</v>

561
00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.200
<v Speaker 8>was that it was Christians who were at </v>
<v Speaker 8>the forefront of the movement to abolish</v>

562
00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.060
<v Speaker 8>Christians on either side of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean there's,</v>

563
00:32:58.061 --> 00:33:00.310
<v Speaker 8>there's no one else to do the job,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but that's the update</v>

564
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:06.963
<v Speaker 8>with specifically Christians who were </v>
<v Speaker 8>using their Christian belief as a </v>

565
00:33:09.281 --> 00:33:10.114
<v Speaker 8>justification for slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The problem was they were actually on </v>

566
00:33:13.401 --> 00:33:13.590
<v Speaker 8>the</v>

567
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:17.320
<v Speaker 5>losing side of a theological argument </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it would be much better.</v>

568
00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.380
<v Speaker 5>I think you would agree if one of the 10</v>
<v Speaker 5>commandments had been,</v>

569
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:23.560
<v Speaker 5>don't keep slaves.</v>

570
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.613
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's certainly one week of </v>

571
00:33:27.281 --> 00:33:29.450
<v Speaker 4>swap out for that one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

572
00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.343
<v Speaker 5>it would've been much easier for </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christians to have fought against </v>

573
00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:37.150
<v Speaker 5>slavery and it's much harder for Muslims</v>
<v Speaker 5>frankly,</v>

574
00:33:37.151 --> 00:33:38.690
<v Speaker 5>to to fight against it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

575
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.730
<v Speaker 5>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that there's a point I made,</v>

576
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:45.220
<v Speaker 5>I think in my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that the,</v>

577
00:33:45.221 --> 00:33:46.054
<v Speaker 5>the doors leading out of this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>fundamentalism don't open from the </v>

578
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:50.444
<v Speaker 5>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get bashed open from the outside </v>

579
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:53.711
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

580
00:33:53.711 --> 00:33:54.544
<v Speaker 5>it's humanism and it's secularism and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's scientific rationality that has </v>

581
00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:03.040
<v Speaker 5>exerted such pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>such winnowing pressure on Christianity,</v>

582
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:03.874
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now for multiple centuries that that's </v>

583
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:07.664
<v Speaker 5>why we're not encountering the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christians of the 14th century on a </v>

584
00:34:09.591 --> 00:34:11.120
<v Speaker 5>daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way that we,</v>

585
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.200
<v Speaker 5>we are essentially encountering Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the 14th century,</v>

586
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.473
<v Speaker 5>a not only in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in our own societies in terms of </v>

587
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:21.890
<v Speaker 5>their intuitions about how we should all</v>
<v Speaker 5>live,</v>

588
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:22.370
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

589
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:27.370
<v Speaker 5>the fact that zero percent of UK Muslims</v>
<v Speaker 5>think homosexuality is acceptable,</v>

590
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.440
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Zero percent,</v>

591
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.273
<v Speaker 5>but there's almost no question you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>come up with the where we could pull </v>

592
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.070
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

593
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:34.933
<v Speaker 5>this society and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think that that the lizard king </v>

594
00:34:39.441 --> 00:34:41.360
<v Speaker 5>is his living in the Oval Office,</v>

595
00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:43.271
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

596
00:34:43.271 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 8>you never get a zero percent response to</v>
<v Speaker 8>any</v>

597
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:46.490
<v Speaker 4>poll question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

598
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:48.973
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

599
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:52.670
<v Speaker 5>if you ask Muslims on the streets of </v>
<v Speaker 5>London,</v>

600
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.533
<v Speaker 5>is homosexuality morally acceptable?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently you can find no one who says </v>

601
00:34:57.771 --> 00:34:58.604
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's shocking and it's not an </v>

602
00:35:01.251 --> 00:35:02.150
<v Speaker 5>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

603
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.190
<v Speaker 5>And it would be much easier if the book </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually said,</v>

604
00:35:04.191 --> 00:35:08.420
<v Speaker 5>actually you can love anyone you want </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's not a problem.</v>

605
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.960
<v Speaker 9>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It is shocking.</v>

606
00:35:09.961 --> 00:35:10.794
<v Speaker 9>But I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's a reason that you keep finding </v>

607
00:35:12.691 --> 00:35:13.524
<v Speaker 9>yourself at Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which may be the slowest to update for </v>

608
00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 9>reasons that may be ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I want to do that.</v>

609
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.100
<v Speaker 9>That is a useful.</v>

610
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.690
<v Speaker 5>I can't do it for Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just want to make the.</v>

611
00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.920
<v Speaker 5>I want to make the point as cleanly and </v>
<v Speaker 5>as undistracted loudly as possible.</v>

612
00:35:31.921 --> 00:35:33.090
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it made it's true.</v>

613
00:35:33.091 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 5>I have the same kinds of concerns about </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christianity or mormonism or or anything</v>

614
00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>

615
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.413
<v Speaker 8>And they're all.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The point is they're all different and </v>

616
00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:45.000
<v Speaker 8>there's no reason to be because Islam to</v>
<v Speaker 8>take the case where it's fine.</v>

617
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.350
<v Speaker 8>Islam doesn't represent any impediment </v>
<v Speaker 8>to stem cell research.</v>

618
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.220
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because they just don't think that,</v>

619
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.343
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that the design of the fertilized ovum </v>

620
00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:56.230
<v Speaker 8>is immediately and sold.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They wait.</v>

621
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.330
<v Speaker 8>It's 40 days or 80 days,</v>
<v Speaker 8>120 days depending on what you believe.</v>

622
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.780
<v Speaker 8>So it's just that never came up when we </v>
<v Speaker 8>were all complaining about how religion,</v>

623
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:06.893
<v Speaker 8>in this case Orthodox Judaism and </v>
<v Speaker 8>Christianity and in the states was </v>

624
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 8>posing and impediment to embryonic stem </v>
<v Speaker 8>cell research.</v>

625
00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:13.510
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Hold on.</v>

626
00:36:13.511 --> 00:36:16.690
<v Speaker 9>I wanted to ask you a clarifying </v>
<v Speaker 9>question to same level.</v>

627
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.023
<v Speaker 9>Would you agree that there are things </v>
<v Speaker 9>written into these religious texts that </v>

628
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.733
<v Speaker 9>are unambiguously unacceptable viewed </v>
<v Speaker 9>through a modern lens and not because </v>

629
00:36:28.421 --> 00:36:31.840
<v Speaker 9>the texts are so complicated that we </v>
<v Speaker 9>have misunderstood something,</v>

630
00:36:31.841 --> 00:36:32.674
<v Speaker 9>but there are things that are just </v>
<v Speaker 9>written in there that we now understand </v>

631
00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:36.664
<v Speaker 9>to be wrong.</v>

632
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.620
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

633
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:38.580
<v Speaker 7>so the first thing,</v>

634
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.083
<v Speaker 7>the first thing I would say is that we </v>
<v Speaker 7>have to be very careful about equating </v>

635
00:36:44.781 --> 00:36:45.614
<v Speaker 7>all the religious texts and I do </v>
<v Speaker 7>actually think that you are careful </v>

636
00:36:48.591 --> 00:36:49.424
<v Speaker 7>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's something we can have a </v>

637
00:36:50.631 --> 00:36:52.950
<v Speaker 7>discussion about a little bit later.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I agree with you there.</v>

638
00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.280
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so because you know,</v>

639
00:36:55.281 --> 00:36:57.410
<v Speaker 7>for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for a lot of my life I was,</v>

640
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:58.483
<v Speaker 7>I would say more interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>universal truths expressed in religious </v>

641
00:37:02.301 --> 00:37:03.134
<v Speaker 7>belief across different cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I've become more and more aware of </v>

642
00:37:06.201 --> 00:37:07.034
<v Speaker 7>the important distinctions between the </v>
<v Speaker 7>religious cultures maybe in the last 10 </v>

643
00:37:10.881 --> 00:37:11.714
<v Speaker 7>years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it isn't clear to me that you can </v>

644
00:37:12.681 --> 00:37:17.681
<v Speaker 7>just throw all religious dictum dicta in</v>
<v Speaker 7>the same bucket and there may be complex</v>

645
00:37:18.741 --> 00:37:19.760
<v Speaker 7>reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

646
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.520
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one question which you kind of sent it,</v>

647
00:37:22.521 --> 00:37:23.420
<v Speaker 7>Sam already,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>

648
00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:24.613
<v Speaker 7>do you see a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 7>unacceptability between different </v>

649
00:37:28.431 --> 00:37:31.060
<v Speaker 7>religious doctrines?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You active.</v>

650
00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.640
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fine,</v>

651
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.300
<v Speaker 7>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fine.</v>

652
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.133
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

653
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.270
<v Speaker 7>now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but here,</v>

654
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.870
<v Speaker 7>here's an interesting issue and I think </v>
<v Speaker 7>we're starting to zero in on.</v>

655
00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.620
<v Speaker 7>We've covered what we agreed on a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

656
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.000
<v Speaker 7>but there's another way to answer a </v>
<v Speaker 7>question because I think.</v>

657
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.003
<v Speaker 7>Sorry,</v>

658
00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.130
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

659
00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:53.020
<v Speaker 7>I answered the first half of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The second part is I think that</v>

660
00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:58.720
<v Speaker 7>this is where I'm going to sound like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>postmodernist,</v>

661
00:37:58.721 --> 00:37:59.554
<v Speaker 7>which I really hate.</v>

662
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:08.570
<v Speaker 7>I would say sentence by sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

663
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.820
<v Speaker 7>you're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Paragraph by paragraph perhaps.</v>

664
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.463
<v Speaker 7>But here's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's the problem with complicated </v>

665
00:38:17.661 --> 00:38:19.820
<v Speaker 7>texts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially ones that actually constitute</v>

666
00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.760
<v Speaker 7>narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So imagine,</v>

667
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:23.683
<v Speaker 7>imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So imagine you're at a movie and it's a </v>

668
00:38:26.391 --> 00:38:27.224
<v Speaker 7>movie with a twist at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so the entire movie is set up to </v>

669
00:38:30.621 --> 00:38:33.860
<v Speaker 7>make you think one particular way and to</v>
<v Speaker 7>have one set of experiences,</v>

670
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.420
<v Speaker 7>but when you put the twist at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it changes the entire structure.</v>

671
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.003
<v Speaker 7>And so this is the one of the complex </v>
<v Speaker 7>problems that actually led to the rise </v>

672
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 7>of postmodern interpretations of </v>
<v Speaker 7>literature,</v>

673
00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.350
<v Speaker 7>which is that if you take a complex </v>
<v Speaker 7>narrative,</v>

674
00:38:47.351 --> 00:38:48.184
<v Speaker 7>there's a very large number of ways of </v>
<v Speaker 7>interpreting it and it isn't self </v>

675
00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:54.220
<v Speaker 7>evident which of those are canonically </v>
<v Speaker 7>correct.</v>

676
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 7>We can deal with that horrible issue </v>
<v Speaker 7>later,</v>

677
00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:00.280
<v Speaker 7>but.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it's a good objection and it's true.</v>

678
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.173
<v Speaker 7>And what it does is it makes these sorts</v>
<v Speaker 7>of things quite complicated because in </v>

679
00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:06.923
<v Speaker 7>the Bible is a series of books and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>had influence on one another and they </v>

680
00:39:11.651 --> 00:39:15.940
<v Speaker 7>were sequenced with a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 7>editorial process and there's actually a</v>

681
00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:19.870
<v Speaker 7>developmental narrative that links all </v>
<v Speaker 7>the chapters together.</v>

682
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 7>And what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is at least I'm going to speak from</v>

683
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:28.300
<v Speaker 7>the perspective or in terms of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 7>of the Christian Bible.</v>

684
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:34.500
<v Speaker 7>What it means is that you have to read </v>
<v Speaker 7>the beginning as if it's also influenced</v>

685
00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:38.290
<v Speaker 7>by the end,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is what,</v>

686
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:39.124
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in case you think that I'm weaseling </v>

687
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:45.490
<v Speaker 7>around here and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that that's exactly what you do.</v>

688
00:39:45.491 --> 00:39:48.130
<v Speaker 7>Every time you read any story,</v>
<v Speaker 7>any work of fiction,</v>

689
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.060
<v Speaker 7>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

690
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.220
<v Speaker 7>you're claiming that the Bible is a work</v>
<v Speaker 7>of fiction.</v>

691
00:39:51.221 --> 00:39:52.180
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't don't.</v>

692
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.730
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's just a cheap objection.</v>

693
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:55.563
<v Speaker 7>That's not my point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My point is that it's a narrative and </v>

694
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:59.703
<v Speaker 7>everything in a narrative is conditioned</v>
<v Speaker 7>by all the rest of the things in the </v>

695
00:40:02.711 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 7>narrative and it is well known.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like if you're a screenwriter,</v>

696
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:07.180
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's an old dictum,</v>

697
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:11.170
<v Speaker 7>remember who generate it was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>great Russians that if there's a a rifle</v>

698
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:15.010
<v Speaker 7>lying on a table in the first scene,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that it better be used by the end of the</v>

699
00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:17.080
<v Speaker 7>second scene or it shouldn't have been </v>
<v Speaker 7>there at all.</v>

700
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.650
<v Speaker 7>So there's this coherence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm looking for the rifle in your answer</v>

701
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.460
<v Speaker 7>to this question,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one overused.</v>

702
00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.453
<v Speaker 7>My point is is that it isn't reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 7>to take a single sentence out of a </v>

703
00:40:29.141 --> 00:40:29.974
<v Speaker 7>coherent narrative and say that stands </v>
<v Speaker 7>on its own or it's rarely reasonable </v>

704
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:34.323
<v Speaker 7>because you have to interpret the word </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the sentence and the sentence in the </v>

705
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:38.434
<v Speaker 7>paragraph and the paragraph in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>chapter and the chapter in the context </v>

706
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:44.380
<v Speaker 7>of the entire book.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to do that now you could object</v>

707
00:40:44.381 --> 00:40:45.214
<v Speaker 7>and reasonably so that there are some </v>
<v Speaker 7>sentences that are so blatant that you </v>

708
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:52.870
<v Speaker 7>can't use context to to what paraphrase </v>
<v Speaker 7>them,</v>

709
00:40:52.871 --> 00:40:53.704
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think you also have to give the </v>

710
00:40:55.031 --> 00:40:55.864
<v Speaker 7>devil his due that the Christian Bible </v>
<v Speaker 7>is a developmental narrative and the </v>

711
00:40:59.051 --> 00:41:02.100
<v Speaker 7>beginning has to be read in light of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>end and that's a.</v>

712
00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:04.260
<v Speaker 7>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a fact.</v>

713
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.650
<v Speaker 9>So what does that do to Moses's laws of </v>
<v Speaker 9>war?</v>

714
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.633
<v Speaker 9>This is not a narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This is instructions about what to do </v>

715
00:41:13.241 --> 00:41:17.770
<v Speaker 9>when you invade a foreign land.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you intend to take over that land,</v>

716
00:41:17.771 --> 00:41:19.690
<v Speaker 9>you kill every break,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

717
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:25.680
<v Speaker 9>There are other rules in there about </v>
<v Speaker 9>killing husbands and taking the wives.</v>

718
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:27.910
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the old testaments are brutal document.</v>

719
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 9>Absolutely brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so my point would be,</v>

720
00:41:29.861 --> 00:41:33.830
<v Speaker 9>I don't know that reading that portion,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

721
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 9>in</v>

722
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.903
<v Speaker 10>light of the end,</v>
<v Speaker 10>even if you call the end of the New </v>

723
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.053
<v Speaker 10>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know that it changes Moses's </v>

724
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:44.180
<v Speaker 10>laws of war and their acceptability </v>
<v Speaker 10>while you take the new testament.</v>

725
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:46.490
<v Speaker 10>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It does because it's a suit.</v>

726
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:47.324
<v Speaker 10>It's a document that supersedes it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I think there's actually technical </v>

727
00:41:50.001 --> 00:41:51.290
<v Speaker 10>reasons but superseded.</v>

728
00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:52.763
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is the problem.</v>

729
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:57.190
<v Speaker 8>Slavery is a very straightforward case </v>
<v Speaker 8>because clearly the,</v>

730
00:41:57.191 --> 00:41:59.710
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the Bible thumpers of the South who were</v>

731
00:41:59.711 --> 00:42:04.240
<v Speaker 8>defending slavery with reference to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>text felt they were on firm ground.</v>

732
00:42:04.241 --> 00:42:05.074
<v Speaker 8>And I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would invite anyone to read what the </v>

733
00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:07.683
<v Speaker 8>New Testament and the Old Testament say </v>
<v Speaker 8>about slavery to see that they were on </v>

734
00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.770
<v Speaker 8>fairly firm ground.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That the balance of the,</v>

735
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.950
<v Speaker 8>of the honest reading was on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 8>clearly we can,</v>

736
00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.180
<v Speaker 8>we can keep slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

737
00:42:19.181 --> 00:42:19.990
<v Speaker 8>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jesus.</v>

738
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.740
<v Speaker 8>Jesus never envisioned a world without </v>
<v Speaker 8>slavery.</v>

739
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.633
<v Speaker 8>And he admonished slaves to serve their </v>
<v Speaker 8>masters well and to serve their </v>

740
00:42:27.101 --> 00:42:28.540
<v Speaker 8>Christian masters especially.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

741
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.040
<v Speaker 10>the English Protestants wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 10>agreed with that because like I said,</v>

742
00:42:32.041 --> 00:42:33.780
<v Speaker 10>they were at the forefront of the fight </v>
<v Speaker 10>against slavery.</v>

743
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:34.723
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

744
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:37.840
<v Speaker 8>Clean influenced by something outside </v>
<v Speaker 8>the text.</v>

745
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.900
<v Speaker 8>And this is began as you're making this </v>
<v Speaker 8>harder than it is.</v>

746
00:42:43.271 --> 00:42:45.460
<v Speaker 8>And my concern is why?</v>

747
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.330
<v Speaker 10>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>But I don't think I am Sam,</v>

748
00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:48.164
<v Speaker 10>because I think that the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 10>message in the New Testament for </v>

749
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:52.290
<v Speaker 10>example,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is that so</v>

750
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:54.163
<v Speaker 8>the old hat,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if we Jews are in possession of a book </v>

751
00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.160
<v Speaker 8>that has some diabolical passages that </v>
<v Speaker 8>would be better left out.</v>

752
00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 10>You're not going to offend me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm Jewish.</v>

753
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:09.600
<v Speaker 10>It's not like it's in the old testament </v>
<v Speaker 10>itself and the Jewish Bible.</v>

754
00:43:09.601 --> 00:43:10.434
<v Speaker 10>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's also the seeds of the same </v>

755
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.950
<v Speaker 10>tension.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So for example,</v>

756
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:15.023
<v Speaker 10>there's a tension and this would be </v>
<v Speaker 10>attention that's of interest to you </v>

757
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.790
<v Speaker 10>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you stated quite clearly in your book,</v>

758
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.713
<v Speaker 10>in the moral landscape that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 10>want to throw the baby out with the </v>

759
00:43:23.881 --> 00:43:26.580
<v Speaker 10>bathwater with regards to at least to </v>
<v Speaker 10>religious phenomenology.</v>

760
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:29.700
<v Speaker 10>You said that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>for example,</v>

761
00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:33.300
<v Speaker 10>I still considered the world's religions</v>
<v Speaker 10>to be mere intellectual,</v>

762
00:43:33.301 --> 00:43:36.420
<v Speaker 10>runes maintained at enormous economic </v>
<v Speaker 10>and social costs.</v>

763
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:40.050
<v Speaker 10>But now I understood that important </v>
<v Speaker 10>psychological truths can be found in the</v>

764
00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:40.884
<v Speaker 10>rubble while I'm trying to find the </v>
<v Speaker 10>important psychological truths in the </v>

765
00:43:43.681 --> 00:43:46.140
<v Speaker 10>rubble and so and so,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but,</v>

766
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.450
<v Speaker 10>but we have to decide also if we agree </v>
<v Speaker 10>about that.</v>

767
00:43:48.451 --> 00:43:52.110
<v Speaker 10>Like are there important psychological </v>
<v Speaker 10>truth to be found in the rubble?</v>

768
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.070
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>absolutely.</v>

769
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.810
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so so then we can.</v>

770
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.110
<v Speaker 10>But</v>

771
00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:58.300
<v Speaker 8>the problem with revelation that this </v>
<v Speaker 8>notion of revelation,</v>

772
00:43:58.301 --> 00:44:01.540
<v Speaker 8>this notion that some books weren't </v>
<v Speaker 8>written by smart people,</v>

773
00:44:01.541 --> 00:44:02.374
<v Speaker 8>they were written by God,</v>
<v Speaker 8>allows you confines you to taking the </v>

774
00:44:06.821 --> 00:44:07.654
<v Speaker 8>whole tax,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even though the text was cobbled </v>

775
00:44:09.251 --> 00:44:11.920
<v Speaker 8>together over centuries and some for </v>
<v Speaker 8>whole centuries,</v>

776
00:44:11.921 --> 00:44:12.754
<v Speaker 8>but some books we're in the new </v>
<v Speaker 8>testament and then they got thrown out </v>

777
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.130
<v Speaker 8>the centuries later and some books </v>
<v Speaker 8>weren't in and then got put in.</v>

778
00:44:18.131 --> 00:44:18.964
<v Speaker 8>So it's like it's an all too human </v>
<v Speaker 8>process that got us these books in the </v>

779
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:25.390
<v Speaker 8>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But once they were set to believers,</v>

780
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:26.613
<v Speaker 8>imagine that you're stuck with every </v>
<v Speaker 8>passage and there are passages in the </v>

781
00:44:30.491 --> 00:44:31.324
<v Speaker 8>old testament.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Tell you to stone up a girl or a woman </v>

782
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 8>who's not a virgin on her wedding night.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Take her to her.</v>

783
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 8>Father's doorstep and stone her to </v>
<v Speaker 8>death.</v>

784
00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:39.324
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And</v>

785
00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.270
<v Speaker 7>probably agree that those are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>

786
00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:43.710
<v Speaker 7>there was another point,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you don't.</v>

787
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.160
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to read the book to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>end to know that it's wrong,</v>

788
00:44:46.161 --> 00:44:48.000
<v Speaker 7>but you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can get that from the paragraph.</v>

789
00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.130
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that isn't what I said.</v>

790
00:44:52.131 --> 00:44:52.964
<v Speaker 7>I didn't say you had to read the end to </v>
<v Speaker 7>the end of the book to know that it </v>

791
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.473
<v Speaker 7>needed to end.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You need it to read to the end of the </v>

792
00:44:58.191 --> 00:45:01.040
<v Speaker 7>book to contextualize those statements </v>
<v Speaker 7>within the whole.</v>

793
00:45:01.041 --> 00:45:03.160
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know exculpatory.</v>

794
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:07.580
<v Speaker 8>There's no exculpatory context as to </v>
<v Speaker 8>those kinds of statements and that's</v>

795
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.660
<v Speaker 10>there is in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's a real.</v>

796
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.553
<v Speaker 10>There's a real tension and this is.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think the tension that would be of </v>

797
00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:13.224
<v Speaker 10>interest to you is there's a tension </v>
<v Speaker 10>between the dogmatic and the prophetic </v>

798
00:45:15.511 --> 00:45:16.344
<v Speaker 10>traditions and I think to the degree </v>
<v Speaker 10>that you're interested in religious </v>

799
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:20.724
<v Speaker 10>phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you find yourself on the side of the </v>

800
00:45:21.991 --> 00:45:25.860
<v Speaker 10>prophetic tradition and the prophetic </v>
<v Speaker 10>tradition has implicitly in it,</v>

801
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.593
<v Speaker 10>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 10>An implicit damnation of those dogmatic </v>

802
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.960
<v Speaker 10>crew,</v>
<v Speaker 10>those cruelly dogmatic rules.</v>

803
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.190
<v Speaker 10>You see that emerge all the time,</v>

804
00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.880
<v Speaker 7>well arguably in Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think going to see it clearly there in</v>

805
00:45:40.881 --> 00:45:43.880
<v Speaker 7>the old testament with the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 7>between the once again</v>

806
00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:47.090
<v Speaker 8>to Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but but every prophetic,</v>

807
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:52.500
<v Speaker 8>the notion of prophecy is dangerous and </v>
<v Speaker 8>worth worrying about.</v>

808
00:45:52.911 --> 00:45:57.020
<v Speaker 8>I mean the idea that any ancient book </v>
<v Speaker 8>contains in it,</v>

809
00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:01.280
<v Speaker 8>a perfect description of rightly </v>
<v Speaker 8>interpreted,</v>

810
00:46:01.281 --> 00:46:03.830
<v Speaker 8>however difficult to interpret it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you're only smart enough,</v>

811
00:46:03.831 --> 00:46:08.570
<v Speaker 8>you could extract from this text a </v>
<v Speaker 8>perfect window onto the future,</v>

812
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:09.703
<v Speaker 8>right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and that that whole generations of </v>

813
00:46:10.821 --> 00:46:14.090
<v Speaker 8>people have lived by the lights of this </v>
<v Speaker 8>cockamamie idea,</v>

814
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.353
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That the world is going to end and it's </v>

815
00:46:16.581 --> 00:46:18.650
<v Speaker 8>empty and is going to be glorious,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

816
00:46:18.651 --> 00:46:19.484
<v Speaker 8>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is at the center of most most </v>

817
00:46:21.861 --> 00:46:23.410
<v Speaker 8>eschatology is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's just that the,</v>

818
00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.820
<v Speaker 8>when the wheels come off,</v>
<v Speaker 8>totally right,</v>

819
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.610
<v Speaker 8>that's on some levels the best thing </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's ever going to happen because it's</v>

820
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.453
<v Speaker 8>showing you that in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jesus is going to come back and throw </v>

821
00:46:35.211 --> 00:46:36.560
<v Speaker 8>this enters into a lake of fire</v>

822
00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.310
<v Speaker 7>and I've read to the end of the book is </v>
<v Speaker 7>pretty scary at the end as well.</v>

823
00:46:40.311 --> 00:46:41.810
<v Speaker 7>I in revelation is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

824
00:46:41.811 --> 00:46:42.351
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

825
00:46:42.351 --> 00:46:43.510
<v Speaker 7>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

826
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.260
<v Speaker 7>that's a really good objection,</v>

827
00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.470
<v Speaker 10>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like when I did my lectures on the Bible</v>

828
00:46:48.471 --> 00:46:49.304
<v Speaker 10>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I said they provided the psychological </v>

829
00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.093
<v Speaker 10>take on the biblical lectures and that's</v>
<v Speaker 10>what I'm going to attempt to maintain </v>

830
00:46:54.651 --> 00:46:55.484
<v Speaker 10>here because I don't believe that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 10>qualified to make fundamental </v>

831
00:46:59.331 --> 00:47:01.850
<v Speaker 10>metaphysical statements,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but,</v>

832
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.150
<v Speaker 10>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>

833
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.240
<v Speaker 10>that scene,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's,</v>

834
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.110
<v Speaker 10>that's limited out at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 10>revelation.</v>

835
00:47:08.111 --> 00:47:13.111
<v Speaker 10>So that's a very interesting book read </v>
<v Speaker 10>psychologically because what it is,</v>

836
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.880
<v Speaker 10>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we should talk about what we'll.</v>

837
00:47:16.881 --> 00:47:17.630
<v Speaker 10>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 10>let me,</v>

838
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:18.463
<v Speaker 10>let me just address that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Only take a minute and I'll try to be </v>

839
00:47:20.661 --> 00:47:21.494
<v Speaker 10>succinct.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So there's an idea that's expressed in </v>

840
00:47:23.661 --> 00:47:24.494
<v Speaker 10>that book is that it's something like </v>
<v Speaker 10>things are always falling apart in a </v>

841
00:47:27.441 --> 00:47:29.680
<v Speaker 10>fundamental manner.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's part,</v>

842
00:47:29.681 --> 00:47:30.514
<v Speaker 10>it's built into the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's an apocalyptic element to human </v>

843
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:33.694
<v Speaker 10>life.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We fail in small ways and we fail in </v>

844
00:47:36.011 --> 00:47:39.040
<v Speaker 10>catastrophic ways and everything that we</v>
<v Speaker 10>have,</v>

845
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 10>we lose and we die.</v>

846
00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:41.643
<v Speaker 10>So there's an societies come to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There's an apocalyptic element built </v>

847
00:47:44.531 --> 00:47:45.364
<v Speaker 10>into the structure of human reality and </v>
<v Speaker 10>part of part of what's revealed in that </v>

848
00:47:49.391 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 10>strange book at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is like a hallucinogenic nightmare</v>

849
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:53.224
<v Speaker 10>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is that the hero is born at the darkest </v>

850
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:56.980
<v Speaker 10>point in the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in the,</v>

851
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:58.023
<v Speaker 10>in the journey,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and it's a psychological truth and it's </v>

852
00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:01.234
<v Speaker 10>very,</v>
<v Speaker 10>very apt because at at the darkest </v>

853
00:48:03.401 --> 00:48:04.234
<v Speaker 10>point,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this is also why Christ is born near </v>

854
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.350
<v Speaker 10>near the darkest time of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 10>From a,</v>

855
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.510
<v Speaker 10>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>from a metaphysical perspective,</v>

856
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.640
<v Speaker 10>there's an idea there that when things </v>
<v Speaker 10>fall apart,</v>

857
00:48:12.641 --> 00:48:13.474
<v Speaker 10>that's the time for the birth of the </v>
<v Speaker 10>hero and the hero in revelation is also </v>

858
00:48:17.321 --> 00:48:21.250
<v Speaker 10>the place where free.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Where we're truthful speech most clearly</v>

859
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:23.470
<v Speaker 10>manifests itself because in the </v>
<v Speaker 10>Christian tradition,</v>

860
00:48:23.471 --> 00:48:24.304
<v Speaker 10>Christ is identified with truthful </v>
<v Speaker 10>speech and so the notion there is that </v>

861
00:48:26.921 --> 00:48:27.754
<v Speaker 10>redemption under apocalyptic conditions </v>
<v Speaker 10>is to be found in the revelation of </v>

862
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:31.804
<v Speaker 10>truthful speech.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Which is something that you actually </v>

863
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:33.890
<v Speaker 10>believe.</v>

864
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:36.260
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I believe in truthful speech,</v>

865
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.393
<v Speaker 8>but I also believe that you can play </v>
<v Speaker 8>this kind of interpretive game with </v>

866
00:48:41.421 --> 00:48:43.460
<v Speaker 8>almost any text.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That this is this way.</v>

867
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.320
<v Speaker 10>But then you can do it with the world </v>
<v Speaker 10>salmon.</v>

868
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:48.330
<v Speaker 10>That wreaks havoc with your value from </v>
<v Speaker 10>facts argument.</v>

869
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.153
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>actually I didn't hear what you just </v>

870
00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:51.510
<v Speaker 8>said.</v>

871
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:53.010
<v Speaker 10>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 10>While I said you can.</v>

872
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:53.873
<v Speaker 10>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can make exactly the same objection </v>

873
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.513
<v Speaker 10>with the world of facts is there's an </v>
<v Speaker 10>infinite number of facts and there's an </v>

874
00:48:58.681 --> 00:48:59.514
<v Speaker 10>infinite number of potential </v>
<v Speaker 10>interpretations and so pat tracking the </v>

875
00:49:02.281 --> 00:49:05.760
<v Speaker 10>pathway from the fact to a value is </v>
<v Speaker 10>actually impossible.</v>

876
00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.900
<v Speaker 10>It's the same argument with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 10>the local.</v>

877
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:09.510
<v Speaker 10>We'll talk about that.</v>

878
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:12.220
<v Speaker 8>That I don't think that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 8>analogy.</v>

879
00:49:12.221 --> 00:49:13.054
<v Speaker 8>I.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There are more and less plausible </v>

880
00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:17.710
<v Speaker 8>interpretations of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of any situation,</v>

881
00:49:17.711 --> 00:49:20.680
<v Speaker 8>any data,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and any text,</v>

882
00:49:20.681 --> 00:49:23.980
<v Speaker 8>arguably,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the problem is that you can.</v>

883
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:25.083
<v Speaker 8>You can read into any story,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some apparently meaningful set of </v>

884
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:34.060
<v Speaker 8>psychological insights,</v>

885
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.133
<v Speaker 10>which,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but you can do that with any set of </v>

886
00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:37.310
<v Speaker 10>facts too.</v>

887
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:38.561
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

888
00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:42.970
<v Speaker 8>I mean there's certain things you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't over interpret to your heart's</v>

889
00:49:42.971 --> 00:49:45.220
<v Speaker 8>content and come out any way you choose.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My,</v>

890
00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.850
<v Speaker 8>my point is that the.</v>
<v Speaker 8>First of all there are.</v>

891
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:53.530
<v Speaker 8>This is why fundamentalism always has an</v>
<v Speaker 8>edge over more quote,</v>

892
00:49:53.531 --> 00:49:58.531
<v Speaker 8>more sophisticated theology because the </v>
<v Speaker 8>sophisticated theology is in,</v>

893
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.453
<v Speaker 8>in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 8>inspired by a more and more modern </v>

894
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:06.694
<v Speaker 8>recognition that what we can't read it </v>
<v Speaker 8>literally because it either makes no </v>

895
00:50:10.211 --> 00:50:12.190
<v Speaker 8>sense or it makes barbaric sense,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

896
00:50:12.191 --> 00:50:13.024
<v Speaker 8>So we have to get away from the literal </v>
<v Speaker 8>and the more you get away from the </v>

897
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:16.924
<v Speaker 8>literal,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the more you are unconstrained by the </v>

898
00:50:19.421 --> 00:50:23.500
<v Speaker 8>text and you can just broadcast on it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Anything you want to put there.</v>

899
00:50:23.501 --> 00:50:24.830
<v Speaker 8>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

900
00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the literal x,</v>

901
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:27.973
<v Speaker 8>there's no question that most </v>
<v Speaker 8>generations of Christians who read </v>

902
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:31.034
<v Speaker 8>revelation expected the world to end in </v>
<v Speaker 8>some literals sense of this kind of fat </v>

903
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:38.690
<v Speaker 8>phantasmagoria.</v>

904
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:39.141
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there was,</v>

905
00:50:39.141 --> 00:50:40.960
<v Speaker 8>there was going to be a beast and it </v>
<v Speaker 8>was.</v>

906
00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:42.670
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is our,</v>

907
00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.513
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>undoubtedly they thought this was gonna </v>

908
00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:45.860
<v Speaker 8>happen in their own time,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

909
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:47.840
<v Speaker 8>under Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>

910
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:50.030
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is a,</v>

911
00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:55.090
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you're going to go purely literary on</v>

912
00:50:55.851 --> 00:50:57.940
<v Speaker 8>any of these texts,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you are,</v>

913
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.280
<v Speaker 8>you on some level,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're playing tennis without a net.</v>

914
00:51:01.281 --> 00:51:03.680
<v Speaker 8>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're unconstrained by the text and you</v>

915
00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 8>can do with it more or less anything you</v>
<v Speaker 8>want.</v>

916
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:07.183
<v Speaker 8>Isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>isn't that argument working at cross </v>

917
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:12.360
<v Speaker 8>purposes with your other argument about.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

918
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:13.850
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because it's always tempting.</v>

919
00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.713
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there are lines that do not announce </v>

920
00:51:18.531 --> 00:51:19.364
<v Speaker 8>their,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that they're susceptible to that </v>

921
00:51:20.451 --> 00:51:21.110
<v Speaker 8>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

922
00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:21.921
<v Speaker 8>yes you can.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can say,</v>

923
00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:22.754
<v Speaker 8>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Allah does not want us to cut the hands </v>

924
00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:25.041
<v Speaker 8>off of thieves.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He,</v>

925
00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:25.671
<v Speaker 8>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

926
00:51:25.671 --> 00:51:26.520
<v Speaker 8>he,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he,</v>

927
00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.790
<v Speaker 8>he meant a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a cut the,</v>

928
00:51:29.791 --> 00:51:30.650
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

929
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.513
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the hand of their volition rather than </v>

930
00:51:33.771 --> 00:51:34.790
<v Speaker 8>their actual hands.</v>

931
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:35.400
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So you're,</v>

932
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.730
<v Speaker 8>you're constraining them rather than </v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of now.</v>

933
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.710
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Undoubtedly there was some,</v>

934
00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.990
<v Speaker 8>some Muslim somewhere who wants to </v>
<v Speaker 8>interpret it that way,</v>

935
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:46.640
<v Speaker 8>but it gets harder and harder.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The clearer the the line is.</v>

936
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:49.880
<v Speaker 8>And the problem with all of these taxes </v>
<v Speaker 8>that there are so many principles,</v>

937
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:53.630
<v Speaker 8>again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I read revelation any way you want.</v>

938
00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:59.050
<v Speaker 8>It is still a problem that it it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it is perfectly rational on the basis of</v>

939
00:52:00.651 --> 00:52:01.484
<v Speaker 8>reading that text to expect the world to</v>
<v Speaker 8>end and for Jesus Jesus to be the only </v>

940
00:52:06.951 --> 00:52:09.470
<v Speaker 8>savior of it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Therefore,</v>

941
00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:14.690
<v Speaker 8>if you happen to be born a Hindu or born</v>
<v Speaker 8>a Muslim or or or born a Jew who doesn't</v>

942
00:52:15.441 --> 00:52:18.260
<v Speaker 8>recognize Jesus to be the Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you are screwed.</v>

943
00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:20.200
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maternity is a funny thing though.</v>

944
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.030
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a strange thing.</v>

945
00:52:22.031 --> 00:52:22.864
<v Speaker 7>Let's say that one of the things we </v>
<v Speaker 7>already agreed on as far as I can tell </v>

946
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:32.080
<v Speaker 7>is that the antidote to pathological </v>
<v Speaker 7>dogmatism is,</v>

947
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.930
<v Speaker 7>is free,</v>
<v Speaker 7>truthful expression.</v>

948
00:52:34.931 --> 00:52:36.730
<v Speaker 7>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that?</v>

949
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:37.391
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

950
00:52:37.391 --> 00:52:37.961
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

951
00:52:37.961 --> 00:52:38.794
<v Speaker 7>but one of the things I would say that's</v>
<v Speaker 7>absolutely crucial to Christianity in </v>

952
00:52:42.911 --> 00:52:43.744
<v Speaker 7>particular is the notion that the thing </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's redeeming is exactly that and it </v>

953
00:52:47.921 --> 00:52:49.750
<v Speaker 7>doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so it's universal truth.</v>

954
00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.420
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if we both agree on that,</v>

955
00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:56.050
<v Speaker 7>the idea that the free expression of </v>
<v Speaker 7>truthful speech is the antidote,</v>

956
00:52:56.051 --> 00:52:58.450
<v Speaker 7>let's say both denialism and to </v>
<v Speaker 7>totalitarianism.</v>

957
00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:02.590
<v Speaker 7>Then the notion that that might be </v>
<v Speaker 7>embodied in something like the word,</v>

958
00:53:02.591 --> 00:53:05.860
<v Speaker 7>which is truly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think the deepest of Christian ideas.</v>

959
00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:09.850
<v Speaker 7>It that why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How is that not the same claim?</v>

960
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:13.050
<v Speaker 7>Now let.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let me elaborate more a little bit more,</v>

961
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.740
<v Speaker 7>more,</v>
<v Speaker 7>more completely.</v>

962
00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.600
<v Speaker 7>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's the strange thing.</v>

963
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.790
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I agree with you by the way,</v>

964
00:53:18.791 --> 00:53:19.624
<v Speaker 7>about the danger of flying off the text.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Write about as you move away from the </v>

965
00:53:23.861 --> 00:53:24.694
<v Speaker 7>text,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your interpretation gets less and less </v>

966
00:53:25.981 --> 00:53:26.814
<v Speaker 7>constraint and I think it's also the </v>
<v Speaker 7>same danger as move of moving away from </v>

967
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:30.444
<v Speaker 7>the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is I think why you want to ground </v>

968
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:32.904
<v Speaker 7>values and facts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I get that argument and I think it's </v>

969
00:53:34.771 --> 00:53:35.604
<v Speaker 7>accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

970
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.823
<v Speaker 7>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's something strange is that this </v>

971
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:39.984
<v Speaker 7>notion that redemptive,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that redemption is to be found in </v>

972
00:53:43.111 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 7>truthful speech is actually embodied in </v>
<v Speaker 7>Christian mythology,</v>

973
00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 7>let's say as a personality and not as an</v>
<v Speaker 7>idea.</v>

974
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.680
<v Speaker 7>It's actually something that you embody </v>
<v Speaker 7>and act out.</v>

975
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:53.514
<v Speaker 7>It's not just an idea and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's an emphasis on the idea of the </v>

976
00:53:56.341 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 7>embodiment of the word in flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a very sophisticated idea.</v>

977
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:03.150
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's insanely sophisticated idea,</v>

978
00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:04.350
<v Speaker 7>so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they will.</v>

979
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:06.420
<v Speaker 7>And there's one more thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

980
00:54:06.421 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 7>so look you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

981
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.433
<v Speaker 7>you've made the case and I hope we can </v>
<v Speaker 7>really get to this because this is the </v>

982
00:54:12.451 --> 00:54:13.284
<v Speaker 7>really tough part of our discussion I </v>
<v Speaker 7>think is that you want to ground the </v>

983
00:54:16.201 --> 00:54:19.350
<v Speaker 7>world of values in something that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>true.</v>

984
00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:22.560
<v Speaker 7>We can say objectively true,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but let's just say true for a minute and</v>

985
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:25.440
<v Speaker 7>I share that desire,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

986
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:29.250
<v Speaker 7>but the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that I can't see,</v>

987
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 7>and you actually state this in your </v>
<v Speaker 7>book,</v>

988
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:31.883
<v Speaker 7>I can't see how you can interpret the </v>
<v Speaker 7>world of facts without an a priori </v>

989
00:54:35.881 --> 00:54:39.930
<v Speaker 7>interpretive structure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And this is an old philosophical claim.</v>

990
00:54:39.931 --> 00:54:41.060
<v Speaker 7>It's not unique to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

991
00:54:41.061 --> 00:54:42.810
<v Speaker 7>it's the claim of Khan,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

992
00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:43.913
<v Speaker 7>that you can't get directly from the </v>
<v Speaker 7>fact to the value because there's an </v>

993
00:54:48.061 --> 00:54:52.020
<v Speaker 7>interpretive framework that mediates </v>
<v Speaker 7>between you and the fact that.</v>

994
00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:52.903
<v Speaker 7>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd like to know if you accept that </v>

995
00:54:54.031 --> 00:54:56.730
<v Speaker 7>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then the second question would be,</v>

996
00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:57.803
<v Speaker 7>if you do accept the proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then what's your understanding of the </v>

997
00:55:01.021 --> 00:55:05.040
<v Speaker 7>nature of the interpretive framework?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because I think it's best understood,</v>

998
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:08.940
<v Speaker 7>at least in part as a personality or as </v>
<v Speaker 7>a story for that matter.</v>

999
00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:09.774
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1000
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:15.350
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think our intuition of truth,</v>

1001
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:16.763
<v Speaker 8>the intuition that there's a difference </v>
<v Speaker 8>between fact and fiction or fact and </v>

1002
00:55:19.501 --> 00:55:23.160
<v Speaker 8>fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the intuition that we are in,</v>

1003
00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:24.053
<v Speaker 8>we live in relationship to a common </v>
<v Speaker 8>reality about which our understanding </v>

1004
00:55:27.871 --> 00:55:28.704
<v Speaker 8>can converge,</v>
<v Speaker 8>provided we're looking in the same </v>

1005
00:55:30.571 --> 00:55:31.404
<v Speaker 8>direction with the same tools.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that is certainly deeper than </v>

1006
00:55:35.491 --> 00:55:38.910
<v Speaker 8>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not best captured by stories.</v>

1007
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.590
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

1008
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:42.660
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Even if it,</v>

1009
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:45.300
<v Speaker 8>even if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as a matter of historical fact,</v>

1010
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:49.140
<v Speaker 8>point to its roots in story and myth and</v>
<v Speaker 8>religion,</v>

1011
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:50.543
<v Speaker 8>that's not an argument that it's now in </v>
<v Speaker 8>the 21st century best captured by story </v>

1012
00:55:54.541 --> 00:55:56.820
<v Speaker 8>and myth and religion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it's,</v>

1013
00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:01.860
<v Speaker 8>it is a fundamental intuition to which </v>
<v Speaker 8>our sanity,</v>

1014
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:03.743
<v Speaker 8>both personally and Inter subjectively </v>
<v Speaker 8>is anchored me to lose a sense of </v>

1015
00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:09.803
<v Speaker 8>objective reality is to lose the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the platform on which you can </v>

1016
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.240
<v Speaker 8>communicate with anyone and or,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or,</v>

1017
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:18.103
<v Speaker 8>or rationally expect anything to happen </v>
<v Speaker 8>a moment from now to think that your </v>

1018
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:23.243
<v Speaker 8>memory represents something about a </v>
<v Speaker 8>prior state of the world and your </v>

1019
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:30.520
<v Speaker 8>beliefs represent something about a </v>
<v Speaker 8>possible state in the future.</v>

1020
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.653
<v Speaker 8>All of this is anchored to a sense that </v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a difference between knowing </v>

1021
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:38.770
<v Speaker 8>something really and just imagining it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1022
00:56:38.771 --> 00:56:39.604
<v Speaker 8>There's a difference between perception </v>
<v Speaker 8>and hallucination and all of these </v>

1023
00:56:42.041 --> 00:56:42.874
<v Speaker 8>distinctions are born of this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this intuition I think we do have </v>

1024
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 8>clearly we have fundamental intuitions </v>
<v Speaker 8>which,</v>

1025
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:53.403
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>are either impossible to analyze or can </v>

1026
00:56:58.391 --> 00:56:59.224
<v Speaker 8>be analyzed with,</v>
<v Speaker 8>with respect to only other intuitions </v>

1027
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 8>which we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which we deem more rudimentary.</v>

1028
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:05.623
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're upon which everything else we do </v>

1029
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:11.140
<v Speaker 8>as a matter of knowledge gathering and </v>
<v Speaker 8>sensemaking is built.</v>

1030
00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:14.170
<v Speaker 8>So the intuition that two plus two makes</v>
<v Speaker 8>four,</v>

1031
00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:14.921
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1032
00:57:14.921 --> 00:57:15.754
<v Speaker 8>you at some point you learn basic </v>
<v Speaker 8>arithmetic and you learn what addition </v>

1033
00:57:20.351 --> 00:57:21.184
<v Speaker 8>is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it's demonstrated to you with </v>

1034
00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:25.390
<v Speaker 8>objects and you're showing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're showing,</v>

1035
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:26.303
<v Speaker 8>you take two apples and you take two </v>
<v Speaker 8>more apples and then you have four </v>

1036
00:57:28.481 --> 00:57:29.261
<v Speaker 8>apples.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

1037
00:57:29.261 --> 00:57:31.030
<v Speaker 8>just count them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1038
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the intuition that,</v>

1039
00:57:32.951 --> 00:57:35.980
<v Speaker 8>that can be generalized to any foreign </v>
<v Speaker 8>objects,</v>

1040
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.860
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That it's not just a fact about apples,</v>

1041
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.753
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is something that we are clearly </v>

1042
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 8>designed to have their places where it </v>
<v Speaker 8>might break down,</v>

1043
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:50.140
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>They might break down and at the quantum</v>

1044
00:57:50.141 --> 00:57:54.310
<v Speaker 8>level it might break down.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And in areas where our intuitions fail,</v>

1045
00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:58.450
<v Speaker 8>we recognize those failures in science </v>
<v Speaker 8>and mathematics by,</v>

1046
00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.150
<v Speaker 8>by recourse to other intuitions,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which again,</v>

1047
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:02.163
<v Speaker 8>are unreliable.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But so there is just this fact that we </v>

1048
00:58:04.361 --> 00:58:08.980
<v Speaker 8>do pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that's not embarrassing.</v>

1049
00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:09.660
<v Speaker 8>What's</v>

1050
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.980
<v Speaker 7>the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's the.</v>

1051
00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:13.620
<v Speaker 7>And I'm not trying to trap you here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>seriously,</v>

1052
00:58:13.621 --> 00:58:14.454
<v Speaker 7>not so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there might be mathematical </v>

1053
00:58:16.831 --> 00:58:17.664
<v Speaker 7>intuition's a priorities,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say identified time and spaces in </v>

1054
00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:22.553
<v Speaker 7>a prior intuitions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think there's a third category of </v>

1055
00:58:25.591 --> 00:58:26.424
<v Speaker 7>a prior intuitions that are in fact </v>
<v Speaker 7>stories or their personalities or </v>

1056
00:58:29.551 --> 00:58:30.241
<v Speaker 7>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So let,</v>

1057
00:58:30.241 --> 00:58:31.074
<v Speaker 7>let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I'm going to do a quick rereading of </v>

1058
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:37.290
<v Speaker 7>the moral landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So because see,</v>

1059
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.800
<v Speaker 7>you talk about g dot Morris argument of </v>
<v Speaker 7>infinite regress.</v>

1060
00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:43.740
<v Speaker 7>If you claim that something's good and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you equate it with something,</v>

1061
00:58:43.741 --> 00:58:47.490
<v Speaker 7>you can also ask infinitely why the </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing you're equating it with is good.</v>

1062
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:51.570
<v Speaker 7>Now it seems to me that the way that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>step out of that argument,</v>

1063
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.570
<v Speaker 7>and correct me if I'm wrong here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as you tell this,</v>

1064
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:58.560
<v Speaker 7>you tell you tell a story.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not trying to be smart about that.</v>

1065
00:58:59.100 --> 00:58:59.933
<v Speaker 7>You tell two stories.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You tell a story about someone who has </v>

1066
00:59:01.951 --> 00:59:03.660
<v Speaker 7>an absolutely terrible life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're in a,</v>

1067
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:04.703
<v Speaker 7>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in a jungle where nature is trying to </v>

1068
00:59:06.181 --> 00:59:09.030
<v Speaker 7>kill them all the time and well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're trying to be killed by nature.</v>

1069
00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.770
<v Speaker 7>Wild nature is trying to kill them all </v>
<v Speaker 7>the time.</v>

1070
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.670
<v Speaker 7>Horrible barbaric thugs are making their</v>
<v Speaker 7>life miserable in every possible way.</v>

1071
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:17.490
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so that's one poll,</v>

1072
00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.353
<v Speaker 7>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then another pool you identify and </v>

1073
00:59:21.171 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 7>these are hypotheticals.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I guess they're fictions.</v>

1074
00:59:23.301 --> 00:59:24.134
<v Speaker 7>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even though they're extracted from real </v>

1075
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:27.780
<v Speaker 7>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're there,</v>

1076
00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.280
<v Speaker 7>they're met,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have fictions there.</v>

1077
00:59:29.281 --> 00:59:31.280
<v Speaker 7>Met a truths,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's another way of thinking about it.</v>

1078
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.353
<v Speaker 7>You contrast a good life and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>life where the person has enough to eat </v>

1079
00:59:36.021 --> 00:59:36.854
<v Speaker 7>and enough shelter and you know they </v>
<v Speaker 7>have the things that you would expect </v>

1080
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:40.460
<v Speaker 7>people to want.</v>

1081
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.980
<v Speaker 7>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is a bad life and you say this is a</v>

1082
00:59:42.981 --> 00:59:43.814
<v Speaker 7>good life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so and then you say that's when you </v>

1083
00:59:46.491 --> 00:59:47.324
<v Speaker 7>make a side move,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I would say is that that's an </v>

1084
00:59:48.741 --> 00:59:51.530
<v Speaker 7>objectively verifiable fat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would say.</v>

1085
00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:54.500
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it is an objectively </v>
<v Speaker 7>verifiable fact.</v>

1086
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:55.663
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a fundamental moral claim </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I think that's where you put your </v>

1087
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:01.430
<v Speaker 7>stake in the ground and I would say when</v>
<v Speaker 7>I read that,</v>

1088
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.810
<v Speaker 7>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1089
01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:03.644
<v Speaker 7>if you take your jungle story,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which you've extracted from a bunch of </v>

1090
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:11.600
<v Speaker 7>horrors and compiled and you take your </v>
<v Speaker 7>positive story,</v>

1091
01:00:11.601 --> 01:00:16.550
<v Speaker 7>which you've extracted from a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 7>horrors or a bunch of of of Kwanzaa,</v>

1092
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:19.730
<v Speaker 7>utopias,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say in compiled your two thirds of</v>

1093
01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:20.564
<v Speaker 7>the way to a landscape of Hell and </v>
<v Speaker 7>heaven while so then why not continue </v>

1094
01:00:24.531 --> 01:00:25.910
<v Speaker 7>the abstraction and say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

1095
01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:29.120
<v Speaker 7>what we're really trying to avoid here </v>
<v Speaker 7>is hell.</v>

1096
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.340
<v Speaker 7>We're really trying to move towards this</v>
<v Speaker 7>heaven.</v>

1097
01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:31.731
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but.</v>

1098
01:00:31.731 --> 01:00:32.564
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

1099
01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.360
<v Speaker 5>As soon as they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you name it.</v>

1100
01:00:34.361 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 5>Just landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1101
01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:40.520
<v Speaker 5>but my name for hell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is very interesting because</v>

1102
01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:46.920
<v Speaker 7>like the,</v>

1103
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 5>you and I were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about this at dinner.</v>

1104
01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.040
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about this at dinner and </v>
<v Speaker 5>how the,</v>

1105
01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:55.874
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the overlap or lack of overlap between </v>

1106
01:00:57.651 --> 01:01:02.360
<v Speaker 5>our audiences and so like I just heard </v>
<v Speaker 5>from your audience there and</v>

1107
01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.720
<v Speaker 5>you might've heard from the odd convert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1108
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:06.703
<v Speaker 5>but what's amazing to me is so like I </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to do some work to figure out what </v>

1109
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:15.920
<v Speaker 5>point they think you made because.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait a second.</v>

1110
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:17.390
<v Speaker 5>Wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait a second.</v>

1111
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:18.503
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1112
01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.473
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

1113
01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.560
<v Speaker 5>And I said if you're going to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fiction,</v>

1114
01:01:22.561 --> 01:01:25.530
<v Speaker 5>why not go right to the end?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So did produce a fiction.</v>

1115
01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:26.683
<v Speaker 5>It's you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can tell stories by way of </v>

1116
01:01:29.761 --> 01:01:32.400
<v Speaker 5>communicating certain ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's obviously,</v>

1117
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:37.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying stories aren't incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful and useful and inevitable,</v>

1118
01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:39.413
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like we</v>

1119
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:40.790
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think you are.</v>

1120
01:01:40.791 --> 01:01:43.170
<v Speaker 7>You're not saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You might not be saying that they're,</v>

1121
01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.370
<v Speaker 7>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not,</v>

1122
01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:45.423
<v Speaker 7>they're not inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you are debating their utility and </v>

1123
01:01:48.111 --> 01:01:48.944
<v Speaker 7>power because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you said that you don't need the story </v>

1124
01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.274
<v Speaker 7>as an intern.</v>

1125
01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.110
<v Speaker 5>So now we have a few doors open here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think we should wait.</v>

1126
01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.003
<v Speaker 5>We should extract the most out of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>areas that we've touched and not run on </v>

1127
01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:02.460
<v Speaker 5>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think there is</v>

1128
01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.800
<v Speaker 5>to talk about the utility of story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1129
01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:07.634
<v Speaker 5>Which is obviously the fact about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world and about human psychology that </v>

1130
01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:13.940
<v Speaker 5>you're reading a lot into and more into </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1131
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:14.774
<v Speaker 5>I'm reading right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the people we just heard from love </v>

1132
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.073
<v Speaker 5>that you.</v>

1133
01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 7>Or maybe I'm reading more into it</v>

1134
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.790
<v Speaker 10>than</v>

1135
01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:21.623
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you talk a lot about the primacy of </v>

1136
01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:28.170
<v Speaker 8>stories and you're trying to get me to </v>
<v Speaker 8>admit that they are.</v>

1137
01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:29.004
<v Speaker 8>That I even,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I helplessly resort to storytelling to </v>

1138
01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:32.694
<v Speaker 8>make my points right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well I think is a good place for us to </v>

1139
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.770
<v Speaker 8>and I don't want us to get bogged down </v>
<v Speaker 8>by.</v>

1140
01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.613
<v Speaker 8>I think it's a good place for us to </v>
<v Speaker 8>touch this topic of the distinction </v>

1141
01:02:42.901 --> 01:02:45.900
<v Speaker 8>between the literal and metaphorical </v>
<v Speaker 8>truth which you.</v>

1142
01:02:45.901 --> 01:02:47.160
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you might want to introduce it,</v>

1143
01:02:47.161 --> 01:02:49.710
<v Speaker 8>but I been [inaudible] that for in my </v>
<v Speaker 8>mind that covers,</v>

1144
01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:52.110
<v Speaker 8>this is different emphasis on stories.</v>

1145
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:54.580
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>briefly,</v>

1146
01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:55.940
<v Speaker 10>but we are,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we are at,</v>

1147
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:57.303
<v Speaker 10>we are at</v>

1148
01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:02.250
<v Speaker 9>60 minutes and we had agreed to go an </v>
<v Speaker 9>hour and 15 before we start q and a.</v>

1149
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.460
<v Speaker 9>So I agree that metaphorical truth is </v>
<v Speaker 9>relevant here.</v>

1150
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:06.383
<v Speaker 9>Metaphorical truth is my argument that </v>
<v Speaker 9>there are some things which are </v>

1151
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.040
<v Speaker 9>literally false,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but if you behave as if they were true,</v>

1152
01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:14.874
<v Speaker 9>you come out ahead of where you would if</v>
<v Speaker 9>you behaved according to the fact that </v>

1153
01:03:17.521 --> 01:03:22.380
<v Speaker 9>they are false sense that these things </v>
<v Speaker 9>hover in a kind of intermediate space to</v>

1154
01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:24.810
<v Speaker 9>call them false is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is incorrect.</v>

1155
01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:25.940
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>

1156
01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:26.863
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I hear Jordan wanting to call them </v>

1157
01:03:29.621 --> 01:03:31.330
<v Speaker 8>true because there are so useful,</v>

1158
01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:33.500
<v Speaker 10>but you also call it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>look,</v>

1159
01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.210
<v Speaker 10>this is what happens in the moral </v>
<v Speaker 10>landscape.</v>

1160
01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:36.870
<v Speaker 10>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Tell me about that.</v>

1161
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:37.723
<v Speaker 10>Tell me why I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 10>because I'm really trying to understand </v>

1162
01:03:39.381 --> 01:03:39.981
<v Speaker 10>it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>See,</v>

1163
01:03:39.981 --> 01:03:40.814
<v Speaker 10>I think you dealt with Ge Moore's </v>
<v Speaker 10>problem of infinite regress by by </v>

1164
01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:48.590
<v Speaker 10>staking a moral proposition and your </v>
<v Speaker 10>moral proposition was,</v>

1165
01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:49.424
<v Speaker 10>look,</v>
<v Speaker 10>here's a way things can be horrible and </v>

1166
01:03:52.011 --> 01:03:52.844
<v Speaker 10>here's the way things can be good.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Can we accept that this is horrible and </v>

1167
01:03:56.091 --> 01:03:58.460
<v Speaker 10>this is good and that we should move </v>
<v Speaker 10>towards good?</v>

1168
01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:01.640
<v Speaker 10>And if the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we can accept that,</v>

1169
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:06.440
<v Speaker 10>then we can proceed and maybe we can </v>
<v Speaker 10>even proceed with extracting values from</v>

1170
01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:07.274
<v Speaker 10>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but we have to accept that a priority </v>

1171
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:10.304
<v Speaker 10>presupposition first and you insist that</v>
<v Speaker 10>we have to accept it because it's </v>

1172
01:04:13.371 --> 01:04:16.180
<v Speaker 10>objectively true and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 10>that's correct.</v>

1173
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.500
<v Speaker 10>So</v>

1174
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.333
<v Speaker 8>unlimited is get the proposition clear.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So my argument is that the worst </v>

1175
01:04:21.751 --> 01:04:26.100
<v Speaker 8>possible misery for everyone is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's hell.</v>

1176
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:29.940
<v Speaker 8>That's hell is is the religious version </v>
<v Speaker 8>of that.</v>

1177
01:04:29.941 --> 01:04:33.210
<v Speaker 8>But I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can forget about religion or whether</v>

1178
01:04:33.211 --> 01:04:34.044
<v Speaker 8>there's a god or anything else that we </v>
<v Speaker 8>live in a universe that admits of the </v>

1179
01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:37.404
<v Speaker 8>possibility of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm asking you to imagine a universe </v>

1180
01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:41.604
<v Speaker 8>where every conscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 8>every mind that can have an experience </v>

1181
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:50.820
<v Speaker 8>is tuned to the worst possible </v>
<v Speaker 8>experience for that mind.</v>

1182
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:54.000
<v Speaker 8>For as long as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so there's no silver lining,</v>

1183
01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.620
<v Speaker 8>there is no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There are no lessons learned.</v>

1184
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.813
<v Speaker 8>Everything that can suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>suffers as much as it possibly can for </v>

1185
01:04:59.581 --> 01:05:01.080
<v Speaker 8>as long as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>

1186
01:05:01.081 --> 01:05:03.150
<v Speaker 8>that includes human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 8>includes animals,</v>

1187
01:05:03.151 --> 01:05:07.590
<v Speaker 8>and includes future ai that we might </v>
<v Speaker 8>build that can suffer.</v>

1188
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Speaker 8>It includes beings that we will never </v>
<v Speaker 8>know about.</v>

1189
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:15.930
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So my argument is that's bad.</v>

1190
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:18.820
<v Speaker 8>If anything is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's bad.</v>

1191
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:21.190
<v Speaker 8>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 8>We don't disagree that the hell is bad.</v>

1192
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:22.053
<v Speaker 8>If,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if the word bad is going to mean </v>

1193
01:05:24.641 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 8>anything that's bad and you can't say </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's fine,</v>

1194
01:05:28.661 --> 01:05:30.660
<v Speaker 8>but it's not a factual claim.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1195
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:33.880
<v Speaker 8>it is is essentially it's a claim about.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I would argue to you,</v>

1196
01:05:33.881 --> 01:05:34.714
<v Speaker 8>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's hard to impart this intuition if </v>

1197
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:37.504
<v Speaker 8>someone doesn't share it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but if someone doesn't share this </v>

1198
01:05:39.281 --> 01:05:40.114
<v Speaker 8>intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have no way of interpreting any other </v>

1199
01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:47.320
<v Speaker 8>word that comes out of their mouth after</v>
<v Speaker 8>they admit they don't share this.</v>

1200
01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:51.310
<v Speaker 8>So just imagine someone saying that </v>
<v Speaker 8>doesn't make it a factual claim.</v>

1201
01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:53.740
<v Speaker 8>Notes every.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So again,</v>

1202
01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:56.020
<v Speaker 8>you guys are going to get stuck here.</v>

1203
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:59.590
<v Speaker 1>I think you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us.</v>

1204
01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Give us one more minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1205
01:06:00.951 --> 01:06:02.000
<v Speaker 1>one more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more minute.</v>

1206
01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.560
<v Speaker 8>I don't think we'll get stuck here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Every claim,</v>

1207
01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:08.310
<v Speaker 8>every claim we make about anything,</v>
<v Speaker 8>at a certain point,</v>

1208
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.490
<v Speaker 8>if you trace all the tools we're using </v>
<v Speaker 8>down to you,</v>

1209
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:15.480
<v Speaker 8>turtles all the way down to something </v>
<v Speaker 8>that we can't explain and justify,</v>

1210
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.433
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is true of physics as true of </v>

1211
01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:20.310
<v Speaker 8>mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just said it was true of arithmetic.</v>

1212
01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:23.220
<v Speaker 8>A good old proved it's true of </v>
<v Speaker 8>arithmetic.</v>

1213
01:06:23.221 --> 01:06:24.054
<v Speaker 8>I mean there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have intuitions of truth that can't </v>

1214
01:06:25.561 --> 01:06:28.440
<v Speaker 8>be cashed out by recourse to the system </v>
<v Speaker 8>itself.</v>

1215
01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:31.920
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and it's true.</v>

1216
01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:34.800
<v Speaker 8>Morally,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would argue in this sense that yes,</v>

1217
01:06:34.801 --> 01:06:37.830
<v Speaker 8>the worst possible misery for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 8>is bad.</v>

1218
01:06:37.831 --> 01:06:38.960
<v Speaker 8>And if you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1219
01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.500
<v Speaker 8>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maybe it's good or bad.</v>

1220
01:06:43.501 --> 01:06:46.360
<v Speaker 8>What does bad mean with a bad means?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bad things.</v>

1221
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:47.730
<v Speaker 8>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you guys are going to get stuck.</v>

1222
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:52.200
<v Speaker 8>What does bad I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I really,</v>

1223
01:06:52.201 --> 01:06:53.034
<v Speaker 8>I really think that we're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 8>down a rabbit hole here and this is a </v>

1224
01:06:55.711 --> 01:06:57.210
<v Speaker 8>crucial issue.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's an absolutely.</v>

1225
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're putting our.</v>

1226
01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:02.590
<v Speaker 1>We have a mutiny here.</v>

1227
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:04.510
<v Speaker 8>We're at,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're at war with our moderator.</v>

1228
01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:06.400
<v Speaker 8>Give us two more minutes.</v>

1229
01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

1230
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:11.940
<v Speaker 1>So let me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I mean honestly,</v>

1231
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.473
<v Speaker 8>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that two minutes we won't be any </v>

1232
01:07:14.881 --> 01:07:15.714
<v Speaker 8>foreigners.</v>

1233
01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's bet.</v>

1234
01:07:17.811 --> 01:07:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet you</v>

1235
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:19.263
<v Speaker 8>a dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're literally playing devil's </v>

1236
01:07:21.861 --> 01:07:26.861
<v Speaker 8>advocate here because you don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 8>that it's that hell might be good.</v>

1237
01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:28.580
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of course not.</v>

1238
01:07:28.581 --> 01:07:30.310
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so it didn't say that so second.</v>

1239
01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:33.460
<v Speaker 8>So you will agree that it's bad and this</v>
<v Speaker 8>is an eight.</v>

1240
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.640
<v Speaker 8>I would argue that anything you would </v>
<v Speaker 8>say,</v>

1241
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:40.750
<v Speaker 8>if you're going to use the word bad and </v>
<v Speaker 8>good or better and worse or anything,</v>

1242
01:07:40.971 --> 01:07:41.511
<v Speaker 8>any,</v>
<v Speaker 8>make,</v>

1243
01:07:41.511 --> 01:07:44.600
<v Speaker 8>any value,</v>
<v Speaker 8>judgment about anything it will.</v>

1244
01:07:44.601 --> 01:07:45.434
<v Speaker 8>Implicit in those judgments will be an </v>
<v Speaker 8>acknowledgement whether you're going to </v>

1245
01:07:48.321 --> 01:07:49.154
<v Speaker 8>acknowledge it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When I put the question to you that the </v>

1246
01:07:51.381 --> 01:07:55.580
<v Speaker 8>worst possible misery for everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 8>bad.</v>

1247
01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:59.540
<v Speaker 8>You can't use the word bad unless you're</v>
<v Speaker 8>not disagreeing in the least about that.</v>

1248
01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:04.850
<v Speaker 8>So it's built into your good and bad in </v>
<v Speaker 8>with respect to every other situation in</v>

1249
01:08:05.751 --> 01:08:06.584
<v Speaker 8>life.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Find.</v>

1250
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.560
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if,</v>

1251
01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.880
<v Speaker 8>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you're going home tomorrow and you're</v>

1252
01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:13.610
<v Speaker 8>a bus drives by and cuts your hand off </v>
<v Speaker 8>and you say,</v>

1253
01:08:13.611 --> 01:08:14.444
<v Speaker 8>well that was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It only makes sense with reference to </v>

1254
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:20.240
<v Speaker 8>this underlying claim.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1255
01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:23.950
<v Speaker 8>it would be worse if the other hand got </v>
<v Speaker 8>cut off too and everyone's hands.</v>

1256
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:25.990
<v Speaker 10>You're beating a dead horse here,</v>
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

1257
01:08:25.991 --> 01:08:26.824
<v Speaker 10>I agree with you.</v>

1258
01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:30.790
<v Speaker 8>So I'm saying that everyone assumes this</v>
<v Speaker 8>epic whether they,</v>

1259
01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:33.640
<v Speaker 8>whether they claim to or not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1260
01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:35.200
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so and to so to say,</v>

1261
01:08:35.201 --> 01:08:36.034
<v Speaker 8>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is how I bring g Moore's argument </v>

1262
01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:38.900
<v Speaker 8>to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to end the opera.</v>

1263
01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:43.720
<v Speaker 8>He says his argument depends on it being</v>
<v Speaker 8>intelligible at that point to say,</v>

1264
01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.330
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is that really bad?</v>

1265
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.420
<v Speaker 8>Is it really bad?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

1266
01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:51.550
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what would really band be if,</v>

1267
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:56.080
<v Speaker 8>if the worst possible misery for </v>
<v Speaker 8>everyone didn't get you there,</v>

1268
01:08:56.530 --> 01:08:57.400
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That there's no,</v>

1269
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:59.630
<v Speaker 8>there's no other space to occupy.</v>

1270
01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:00.843
<v Speaker 10>I'm also not disputing the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 10>your move to bring g Moore's infinite </v>

1271
01:09:04.301 --> 01:09:07.420
<v Speaker 10>regress to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm disputing something very specific.</v>

1272
01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.240
<v Speaker 10>I'm disputing the issue that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 10>factual claim.</v>

1273
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:13.600
<v Speaker 10>That's all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We should avoid it.</v>

1274
01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.030
<v Speaker 10>It brings Moore's infinite regress to an</v>
<v Speaker 10>end.</v>

1275
01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:16.923
<v Speaker 10>All of that.</v>

1276
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.983
<v Speaker 8>It's deeper than a factual claim.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's just a claim about the claim that </v>

1277
01:09:22.781 --> 01:09:26.890
<v Speaker 8>is required to make any value,</v>
<v Speaker 8>judgment intelligible,</v>

1278
01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.510
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Any value judgment.</v>

1279
01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.393
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so it's not an not an arithmetical </v>

1280
01:09:31.211 --> 01:09:32.044
<v Speaker 8>claim.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So an aeromedical claim about addition </v>

1281
01:09:34.031 --> 01:09:34.864
<v Speaker 8>in this case is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is now you could say the same thing you </v>

1282
01:09:40.151 --> 01:09:42.850
<v Speaker 8>could say when I say two plus two makes </v>
<v Speaker 8>four,</v>

1283
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:46.840
<v Speaker 8>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but is that a factual claim and there is</v>

1284
01:09:46.841 --> 01:09:50.530
<v Speaker 8>some way of jiggering the way you talk </v>
<v Speaker 8>about facts with respect to mathematics,</v>

1285
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.951
<v Speaker 8>because I.</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1286
01:09:50.951 --> 01:09:53.450
<v Speaker 8>it's not a factual claim,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but as it's an arithmetical claim,</v>

1287
01:09:53.451 --> 01:09:54.910
<v Speaker 8>it's a mathematical claim.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1288
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:59.160
<v Speaker 8>I'm also not trying to organize our </v>
<v Speaker 8>myosin this way.</v>

1289
01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.250
<v Speaker 10>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 10>fine.</v>

1290
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.450
<v Speaker 10>What I'm trying to do is to what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 10>really trying to do,</v>

1291
01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:04.883
<v Speaker 10>we need.</v>
<v Speaker 10>See the problem I have with your </v>

1292
01:10:06.931 --> 01:10:10.620
<v Speaker 10>argument and this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't mean that you're wrong.</v>

1293
01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.650
<v Speaker 10>I see what you're doing and I see why </v>
<v Speaker 10>you're doing it.</v>

1294
01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.870
<v Speaker 10>As far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's laudable,</v>

1295
01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.660
<v Speaker 10>but for the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is that as far as I can tell,</v>

1296
01:10:18.661 --> 01:10:19.494
<v Speaker 10>there's problems it doesn't solve and </v>
<v Speaker 10>there's other problems that leaves and </v>

1297
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.940
<v Speaker 10>address that don't have to be unsolved </v>
<v Speaker 10>or unaddressed.</v>

1298
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.460
<v Speaker 10>And so one of the problems is this </v>
<v Speaker 10>problem of the intermediary interpretive</v>

1299
01:10:29.461 --> 01:10:30.294
<v Speaker 10>structure and you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you already said we need intuitions to </v>

1300
01:10:32.491 --> 01:10:33.390
<v Speaker 10>guide our,</v>
<v Speaker 10>our,</v>

1301
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:36.870
<v Speaker 10>our interrelationship with facts because</v>
<v Speaker 10>we've already agreed on that.</v>

1302
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:40.200
<v Speaker 10>So the question is what are the nature </v>
<v Speaker 10>of these intuitions?</v>

1303
01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.040
<v Speaker 10>And I'm saying some of those intuitions </v>
<v Speaker 10>take the place of stories,</v>

1304
01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.500
<v Speaker 10>take the form of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but even more than that.</v>

1305
01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:49.200
<v Speaker 10>So I'm going to go after the health </v>
<v Speaker 10>thing again.</v>

1306
01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:50.610
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Because you said,</v>

1307
01:10:50.611 --> 01:10:53.250
<v Speaker 10>well it's bad and you made sure that I </v>
<v Speaker 10>also agreed with that,</v>

1308
01:10:53.251 --> 01:10:55.320
<v Speaker 10>which I do.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I agree with that.</v>

1309
01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.170
<v Speaker 10>And then it's a point of profound </v>
<v Speaker 10>agreement between you and I,</v>

1310
01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.033
<v Speaker 10>like I've spent my entire life trying to</v>
<v Speaker 10>understand why people get the worst </v>

1311
01:11:03.361 --> 01:11:07.500
<v Speaker 10>things they could possibly imagine in </v>
<v Speaker 10>the service of their dogmatic beliefs.</v>

1312
01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.830
<v Speaker 10>And so I think that that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Seriously.</v>

1313
01:11:10.831 --> 01:11:13.540
<v Speaker 10>And I'm no fan of moral relativism,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so we're,</v>

1314
01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:14.523
<v Speaker 10>we're on the same page there now.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But what I noticed when you wrote the </v>

1315
01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.340
<v Speaker 10>moral landscape is you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you tell it,</v>

1316
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.080
<v Speaker 10>and I'm not trying to trap you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>

1317
01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.133
<v Speaker 10>you tell a story about it looks to me </v>
<v Speaker 10>like it's a story about heaven versus </v>

1318
01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:28.920
<v Speaker 10>Hell essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Let me use that language momentarily.</v>

1319
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.320
<v Speaker 10>But it's also a story about good versus </v>
<v Speaker 10>evil.</v>

1320
01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:34.440
<v Speaker 10>And this is why is because the question </v>
<v Speaker 10>is,</v>

1321
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.880
<v Speaker 10>what's bad about hell?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Now you say the suffering,</v>

1322
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:40.730
<v Speaker 10>it's like fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

1323
01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:45.510
<v Speaker 10>True enough but not true,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but not true enough.</v>

1324
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:50.900
<v Speaker 10>So what's also bad about how in addition</v>
<v Speaker 10>to the actions that put you there,</v>

1325
01:11:53.491 --> 01:11:55.570
<v Speaker 10>the malevolence that generation,</v>
<v Speaker 10>okay,</v>

1326
01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.700
<v Speaker 10>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's part of the sufferings mean.</v>

1327
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 10>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's not.</v>

1328
01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's not.</v>

1329
01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.620
<v Speaker 10>It's not the same as the suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's not,</v>

1330
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:02.723
<v Speaker 10>it's not the having your hand cut off.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's the pleasure that's derived by the </v>

1331
01:12:06.061 --> 01:12:08.640
<v Speaker 10>person who cut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And that is different.</v>

1332
01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.190
<v Speaker 10>So.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But that's part of my picture.</v>

1333
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.070
<v Speaker 10>But wait,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's an important distinction.</v>

1334
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.780
<v Speaker 10>That distinction is important.</v>

1335
01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:18.363
<v Speaker 8>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my picture of the moral landscape </v>

1336
01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.513
<v Speaker 8>includes all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It includes everything that this is why </v>

1337
01:12:25.171 --> 01:12:26.004
<v Speaker 8>I don't readily answer to the name of </v>
<v Speaker 8>utilitarian or consequentialist because </v>

1338
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:33.480
<v Speaker 8>the way those those views tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 8>taught,</v>

1339
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:38.570
<v Speaker 8>they tend to take as the in the in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>tally of consequences.</v>

1340
01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:45.410
<v Speaker 8>You leave out the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 8>implications of being the sort of person</v>

1341
01:12:45.871 --> 01:12:47.850
<v Speaker 8>who would,</v>
<v Speaker 8>who would have sought those consequences</v>

1342
01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.170
<v Speaker 8>or behaved that way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

1343
01:12:49.171 --> 01:12:52.470
<v Speaker 8>So I would grant you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and this I'm explicit about this,</v>

1344
01:12:52.471 --> 01:12:53.304
<v Speaker 8>whenever I talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that part of the picture of any </v>

1345
01:12:57.511 --> 01:12:58.344
<v Speaker 8>consequentialist discussion of wellbeing</v>
<v Speaker 8>are it is everything about the human </v>

1346
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:04.524
<v Speaker 8>mind and social relationships and </v>
<v Speaker 8>societies born of all the individuals </v>

1347
01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:13.580
<v Speaker 8>living together,</v>
<v Speaker 8>everything there that leads to different</v>

1348
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.903
<v Speaker 8>states of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's like like you having you having </v>

1349
01:13:17.171 --> 01:13:21.360
<v Speaker 8>a negative intentions towards other </v>
<v Speaker 8>people that give you that,</v>

1350
01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:23.520
<v Speaker 8>that produce certain negative actions in</v>
<v Speaker 8>the world.</v>

1351
01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:24.913
<v Speaker 8>They,</v>
<v Speaker 8>those intentions themselves are part of </v>

1352
01:13:26.851 --> 01:13:27.684
<v Speaker 8>the consequential picture.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those intentions themselves lead to </v>

1353
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:31.643
<v Speaker 8>close the door to certain kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 8>positive mental states that you don't </v>

1354
01:13:34.621 --> 01:13:35.301
<v Speaker 8>have.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's say you.</v>

1355
01:13:35.301 --> 01:13:36.134
<v Speaker 8>Let's say you don't have compassion </v>
<v Speaker 8>because you wake up every morning just </v>

1356
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:40.440
<v Speaker 8>trying to figure out how to manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>

1357
01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:41.310
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not,</v>

1358
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:45.780
<v Speaker 8>not being able to feel compassion for </v>
<v Speaker 8>other people is a bad thing for for many</v>

1359
01:13:45.781 --> 01:13:46.614
<v Speaker 8>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We could produce and if you get the </v>

1360
01:13:50.191 --> 01:13:51.024
<v Speaker 8>usual consequentialist picture just </v>
<v Speaker 8>looks at what's happening out in the </v>

1361
01:13:53.551 --> 01:13:57.210
<v Speaker 8>world in terms of the body count and </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's not,</v>

1362
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:58.103
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's.</v>

1363
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.220
<v Speaker 8>It's all part of this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's all we're all talking.</v>

1364
01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.273
<v Speaker 8>Anything that can possibly affect a </v>
<v Speaker 8>conscious mind anywhere is part of the </v>

1365
01:14:06.691 --> 01:14:09.270
<v Speaker 8>picture that I'm painting that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>calling the moral landscape.</v>

1366
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 10>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 10>So I want you to let me step</v>

1367
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.730
<v Speaker 8>in.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

1368
01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:15.490
<v Speaker 8>I think we need to bring you somewhere.</v>

1369
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.420
<v Speaker 9>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm gonna Start with you sam.</v>

1370
01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.633
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let's swap out the idea of metaphorical </v>

1371
01:14:22.081 --> 01:14:26.370
<v Speaker 9>truth for something a little harder </v>
<v Speaker 9>headed heuristics,</v>

1372
01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:28.160
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>We have [inaudible].</v>

1373
01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:32.160
<v Speaker 9>We used them to perceive the world.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They're often highly reliable.</v>

1374
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:36.270
<v Speaker 9>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 9>almost everything that you believed that</v>

1375
01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:39.180
<v Speaker 9>lets you operate has to be a hero stick </v>
<v Speaker 9>of some kind.</v>

1376
01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:42.360
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you decided to learn to drive and you</v>

1377
01:14:42.361 --> 01:14:44.250
<v Speaker 9>got into the car and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

1378
01:14:44.251 --> 01:14:46.590
<v Speaker 9>well it's all quarks out there,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1379
01:14:46.591 --> 01:14:49.260
<v Speaker 9>You need to understand how parks </v>
<v Speaker 9>interact with each other,</v>

1380
01:14:49.261 --> 01:14:51.090
<v Speaker 9>not useful,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not useful,</v>

1381
01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.050
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>What you need,</v>

1382
01:14:52.051 --> 01:14:52.884
<v Speaker 9>or some heuristics in which you can </v>
<v Speaker 9>stipulate that there's something called </v>

1383
01:14:55.141 --> 01:14:55.974
<v Speaker 9>a vehicle out there and you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 9>to be overly precise about what it is </v>

1384
01:14:58.261 --> 01:14:59.660
<v Speaker 9>and you learn to avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay?</v>

1385
01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:03.420
<v Speaker 9>The heuristics vary a lot in quality.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Some of them are really good.</v>

1386
01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:05.040
<v Speaker 9>The periodic tables are really good.</v>

1387
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:06.263
<v Speaker 9>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

1388
01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:11.010
<v Speaker 9>the idea of a gravitational potential </v>
<v Speaker 9>energy is kind of crappy,</v>

1389
01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:14.550
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>If I have a phone on a table here,</v>

1390
01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:15.384
<v Speaker 9>I can tell you how much potential energy</v>
<v Speaker 9>it has by measuring its mass and its </v>

1391
01:15:18.150 --> 01:15:20.370
<v Speaker 9>distance from the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But if I've got a whole,</v>

1392
01:15:20.371 --> 01:15:21.204
<v Speaker 9>at one depth on one side of the table </v>
<v Speaker 9>and another depth on the other side of </v>

1393
01:15:23.401 --> 01:15:24.234
<v Speaker 9>the table,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I can't calculate it because it's a </v>

1394
01:15:25.231 --> 01:15:28.770
<v Speaker 9>crappy heuristic.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Works well enough in regular stuff.</v>

1395
01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.150
<v Speaker 9>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>here's the question.</v>

1396
01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:35.820
<v Speaker 9>What if these religious texts are </v>
<v Speaker 9>heuristics?</v>

1397
01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:36.683
<v Speaker 9>Through which most people simplify </v>
<v Speaker 9>calculations that they are in no </v>

1398
01:15:39.721 --> 01:15:40.554
<v Speaker 9>position to do based on the limited </v>
<v Speaker 9>amount that they are capable of </v>

1399
01:15:43.321 --> 01:15:44.154
<v Speaker 9>perceiving,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the amount that they understand about </v>

1400
01:15:45.691 --> 01:15:46.524
<v Speaker 9>the things that are in play.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So they're deploying these heuristics </v>

1401
01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.070
<v Speaker 9>may be to reduce,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

1402
01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:51.953
<v Speaker 9>things that degrade wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If it were true that religious </v>

1403
01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:56.514
<v Speaker 9>heuristics increased wellbeing by </v>
<v Speaker 9>allowing people to actually on average </v>

1404
01:16:01.531 --> 01:16:04.740
<v Speaker 9>operate in the world in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that increased wellbeing,</v>

1405
01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.510
<v Speaker 9>what would you say about them that?</v>

1406
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.133
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would worry much less about them </v>

1407
01:16:09.041 --> 01:16:09.874
<v Speaker 8>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and that's why I don't treat all </v>

1408
01:16:12.221 --> 01:16:13.054
<v Speaker 8>religions equally there their religions </v>
<v Speaker 8>I literally never think about because </v>

1409
01:16:16.991 --> 01:16:21.040
<v Speaker 8>I'm not seeing the daily casualties of </v>
<v Speaker 8>those belief systems.</v>

1410
01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:24.760
<v Speaker 9>So.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But you say that as people get away from</v>

1411
01:16:24.761 --> 01:16:25.594
<v Speaker 9>fundamental versions of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I'm not advocating for </v>

1412
01:16:27.611 --> 01:16:28.444
<v Speaker 9>fundamentalism here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but you say yourself as people get away </v>

1413
01:16:30.701 --> 01:16:32.950
<v Speaker 9>from the fundamental versions of these </v>
<v Speaker 9>things,</v>

1414
01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:37.480
<v Speaker 9>things tend to go haywire and so in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in essence what you're saying</v>

1415
01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.470
<v Speaker 8>that lap tend to go haywire and one </v>
<v Speaker 8>says,</v>

1416
01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:43.063
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I thought I was interpreting </v>

1417
01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.330
<v Speaker 8>multiplicity of interpretations,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1418
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:46.060
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1419
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.780
<v Speaker 8>but so people are in search of better or</v>
<v Speaker 8>heuristics.</v>

1420
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:50.623
<v Speaker 8>I think the pressure is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some of these heuristics are obviously </v>

1421
01:16:53.561 --> 01:16:54.394
<v Speaker 8>so bad that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's civilizational pressure to find </v>

1422
01:16:57.941 --> 01:16:59.890
<v Speaker 8>better interpretation and,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

1423
01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:03.680
<v Speaker 8>but you said that the fundamentalists </v>
<v Speaker 8>have an advantage.</v>

1424
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.593
<v Speaker 8>What is that advantage?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because if you just go back to the text </v>

1425
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.640
<v Speaker 8>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>listen,</v>

1426
01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:13.370
<v Speaker 8>I just want to understand what these </v>
<v Speaker 8>words mean,</v>

1427
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:17.030
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You get the first pass the quote literal</v>

1428
01:17:17.031 --> 01:17:18.500
<v Speaker 8>interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1429
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:23.530
<v Speaker 8>And you're not bringing the </v>
<v Speaker 8>armamentarium.</v>

1430
01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:24.890
<v Speaker 8>You,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you've brought your,</v>

1431
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.520
<v Speaker 8>you've got from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 8>from other parts of culture to Parse the</v>

1432
01:17:28.521 --> 01:17:29.510
<v Speaker 8>tax.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're just trying to,</v>

1433
01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:31.460
<v Speaker 8>if it's an English and you speak </v>
<v Speaker 8>English,</v>

1434
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.060
<v Speaker 8>you're just trying to decode the words.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

1435
01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:35.750
<v Speaker 8>And when it says,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if your,</v>

1436
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:39.080
<v Speaker 8>if your girl is not a virgin on her </v>
<v Speaker 8>wedding night,</v>

1437
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:41.180
<v Speaker 8>take her to her father's doorstep and </v>
<v Speaker 8>stone her to death.</v>

1438
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.690
<v Speaker 8>That you know what stone means,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know what girl means,</v>

1439
01:17:44.691 --> 01:17:47.990
<v Speaker 8>you know what father means and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're 90 percent there to uh,</v>

1440
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.190
<v Speaker 8>an obvious atrocity.</v>

1441
01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.810
<v Speaker 9>I get the horror of it and we'll get to </v>
<v Speaker 9>that in a second.</v>

1442
01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:52.883
<v Speaker 9>But,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

1443
01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:58.190
<v Speaker 9>but the basic point is to say that the </v>
<v Speaker 9>fundamentalists have an advantage,</v>

1444
01:17:59.130 --> 01:17:59.963
<v Speaker 9>is to acknowledge something functional </v>
<v Speaker 9>about those stories which I'm claiming </v>

1445
01:18:04.111 --> 01:18:04.944
<v Speaker 9>are going to be some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 9>evolutionary heuristic for living a </v>

1446
01:18:07.861 --> 01:18:09.540
<v Speaker 9>life.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Does that make him defensible?</v>

1447
01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:10.483
<v Speaker 8>They have an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's an advantage that it's an </v>

1448
01:18:14.381 --> 01:18:15.011
<v Speaker 8>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a,</v>

1449
01:18:15.011 --> 01:18:15.844
<v Speaker 8>it's a mimetic advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's an advantage that isis has the </v>

1450
01:18:18.311 --> 01:18:19.560
<v Speaker 8>advantage when,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when,</v>

1451
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:24.750
<v Speaker 8>when the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 8>who share their interpretation of Islam,</v>

1452
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:29.640
<v Speaker 8>they slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's why someone like Anwar,</v>

1453
01:18:29.641 --> 01:18:30.474
<v Speaker 8>Allah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>locky could,</v>

1454
01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:34.330
<v Speaker 8>could make youtube videos that so many </v>
<v Speaker 8>people found compelling.</v>

1455
01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:37.060
<v Speaker 8>It's because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's totally straightforward.</v>

1456
01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:37.953
<v Speaker 8>Like the advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Listen that a lot of people spending a </v>

1457
01:18:40.181 --> 01:18:45.070
<v Speaker 8>lot of time lying to you about what </v>
<v Speaker 8>these books mean and what the profit and</v>

1458
01:18:45.071 --> 01:18:46.570
<v Speaker 8>how he lived.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

1459
01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:47.670
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

1460
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:48.730
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1461
01:18:48.731 --> 01:18:51.790
<v Speaker 8>in your heart that my interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 8>this is correct.</v>

1462
01:18:51.791 --> 01:18:53.570
<v Speaker 8>You just read the words,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1463
01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.770
<v Speaker 8>And there's a strength in that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a,</v>

1464
01:18:56.771 --> 01:18:58.900
<v Speaker 8>there's an honesty in that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a,</v>

1465
01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:01.060
<v Speaker 8>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just,</v>

1466
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:04.480
<v Speaker 8>it's clear when it says sacrifice a </v>
<v Speaker 8>goat,</v>

1467
01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:06.190
<v Speaker 8>goat means goat,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1468
01:19:06.191 --> 01:19:07.024
<v Speaker 8>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't have to do something else to </v>

1469
01:19:08.141 --> 01:19:10.290
<v Speaker 8>make goat meat having nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 8>goat.</v>

1470
01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:11.460
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so that it's,</v>

1471
01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.530
<v Speaker 8>it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's an asymmetric war of,</v>

1472
01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.413
<v Speaker 8>of if you're going to try to make your </v>
<v Speaker 8>dog knows more and more palatable by </v>

1473
01:19:19.751 --> 01:19:20.584
<v Speaker 8>importing stuff that clearly was never </v>
<v Speaker 8>even in the worldview of anyone who </v>

1474
01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:26.650
<v Speaker 8>birthed these religions.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're playing,</v>

1475
01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.720
<v Speaker 8>you're not doing that because you want </v>
<v Speaker 8>to live even more by God's word.</v>

1476
01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.793
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You found some of God's words </v>

1477
01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:35.530
<v Speaker 8>unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

1478
01:19:35.531 --> 01:19:39.490
<v Speaker 8>And that's an every fundamentalist can </v>
<v Speaker 8>sniff that out and the right to sniff it</v>

1479
01:19:39.491 --> 01:19:42.130
<v Speaker 8>out because in fact it is in fact the </v>
<v Speaker 8>motivation.</v>

1480
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:43.900
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>good.</v>

1481
01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:44.913
<v Speaker 9>So I think we have.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We've got a tenuous kind of agreement </v>

1482
01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:48.933
<v Speaker 9>that there might be some kind of utility</v>
<v Speaker 9>that that utility might be morally </v>

1483
01:19:51.581 --> 01:19:52.414
<v Speaker 9>questionable sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but that there is some reason that </v>

1484
01:19:55.091 --> 01:19:55.924
<v Speaker 9>people would resort to a fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 9>simple interpretation because as they </v>

1485
01:19:59.141 --> 01:19:59.974
<v Speaker 9>depart from that interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 9>things get more difficult and to create </v>

1486
01:20:02.481 --> 01:20:03.314
<v Speaker 9>some kind of disadvantage.</v>
<v Speaker 9>While the part of the problem with that </v>

1487
01:20:05.171 --> 01:20:07.120
<v Speaker 9>would be that as you move away from the </v>
<v Speaker 9>texts,</v>

1488
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:08.170
<v Speaker 9>you fractionate</v>

1489
01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:11.610
<v Speaker 10>the moral belief system and you end up </v>
<v Speaker 10>with a nihilistic city situation.</v>

1490
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:16.110
<v Speaker 10>So as you move away from dogmatism,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you move towards the parallel danger,</v>

1491
01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:16.944
<v Speaker 10>which is moral relativism and nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so hopefully you can find some </v>

1492
01:20:20.131 --> 01:20:21.000
<v Speaker 10>ballots.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So</v>

1493
01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:23.200
<v Speaker 9>let me ask you to know.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I want to ask you a question.</v>

1494
01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:24.063
<v Speaker 9>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1495
01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:27.840
<v Speaker 9>And also what time do we actually start </v>
<v Speaker 9>this 10?</v>

1496
01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:32.170
<v Speaker 9>I just missed the timecard but I think </v>
<v Speaker 9>we have another couple of minutes.</v>

1497
01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:34.323
<v Speaker 9>So</v>

1498
01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:36.400
<v Speaker 10>no objective reality to time.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think</v>

1499
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:40.570
<v Speaker 10>actually it's a pretty good conversation</v>
<v Speaker 10>we could have,</v>

1500
01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.433
<v Speaker 10>but.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1501
01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:43.693
<v Speaker 9>So here's my question for you is</v>
<v Speaker 9>if we agree that there is some way in </v>

1502
01:20:50.991 --> 01:20:51.824
<v Speaker 9>which religious texts carry some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 9>value because they allow people to </v>

1503
01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:02.140
<v Speaker 9>figure out how to navigate their lives </v>
<v Speaker 9>in ways that might reduce suffering,</v>

1504
01:21:02.141 --> 01:21:04.670
<v Speaker 9>reduced the complexity of the choices </v>
<v Speaker 9>that they have to make.</v>

1505
01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:10.420
<v Speaker 9>Presumably you will agree that that </v>
<v Speaker 9>would be consistent with an evolutionary</v>

1506
01:21:10.611 --> 01:21:11.444
<v Speaker 9>interpretation that the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 9>stories themselves are functional would </v>

1507
01:21:16.431 --> 01:21:18.860
<v Speaker 9>provide an advantage to those who were </v>
<v Speaker 9>deploying them.</v>

1508
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:20.390
<v Speaker 9>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so here's the problem,</v>

1509
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:22.783
<v Speaker 9>isn't it then also true that those </v>
<v Speaker 9>stories are responsive to past </v>

1510
01:21:26.571 --> 01:21:27.404
<v Speaker 9>environments and so the claim that these</v>
<v Speaker 9>things might be timeless would be </v>

1511
01:21:30.861 --> 01:21:35.861
<v Speaker 9>suspect and in fact you would expect a </v>
<v Speaker 9>spectrum of durability.</v>

1512
01:21:36.381 --> 01:21:41.150
<v Speaker 9>Some stories would be right in a brief </v>
<v Speaker 9>moment and all that's true.</v>

1513
01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:43.040
<v Speaker 9>All that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So far so good.</v>

1514
01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.270
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so far so good.</v>

1515
01:21:44.271 --> 01:21:45.800
<v Speaker 9>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This is actually,</v>

1516
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:50.890
<v Speaker 9>I think quite excellent then because </v>
<v Speaker 9>what we have is a recognition that there</v>

1517
01:21:51.921 --> 01:21:52.754
<v Speaker 9>is something to these belief systems </v>
<v Speaker 9>that has to do with practical realities </v>

1518
01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:57.853
<v Speaker 9>in the past and we also have an </v>
<v Speaker 9>acknowledgement that we cannot trust in </v>

1519
01:22:00.771 --> 01:22:01.604
<v Speaker 9>these things based on simple faith </v>
<v Speaker 9>because even if they aren't can be </v>

1520
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:07.760
<v Speaker 9>certain to have worked at some point in </v>
<v Speaker 9>the past.</v>

1521
01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:11.000
<v Speaker 9>We don't know what their relevance is to</v>
<v Speaker 9>the president.</v>

1522
01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:13.230
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1523
01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:14.693
<v Speaker 10>Fair enough.</v>

1524
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:24.690
<v Speaker 10>That's an I would say that's.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's two things about that.</v>

1525
01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:28.043
<v Speaker 10>That's exactly why we're having this </v>
<v Speaker 10>discussion and you see what happens in </v>

1526
01:22:33.361 --> 01:22:34.194
<v Speaker 10>the most profound of such texts is the </v>
<v Speaker 10>idea that the process by which your </v>

1527
01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:44.691
<v Speaker 10>knowledge is updated has to occupy a </v>
<v Speaker 10>position in the hierarchy of values that</v>

1528
01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:50.130
<v Speaker 10>supersedes your reliance on dogma is the</v>
<v Speaker 10>fundamental claim.</v>

1529
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:51.930
<v Speaker 10>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 10>for example,</v>

1530
01:22:51.931 --> 01:22:52.764
<v Speaker 10>in Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the notion is is that the word is the </v>

1531
01:22:54.691 --> 01:22:55.524
<v Speaker 10>highest values and that's embodied word </v>
<v Speaker 10>and that's the thing that mediates </v>

1532
01:22:59.131 --> 01:22:59.964
<v Speaker 10>between order and chaos and everything </v>
<v Speaker 10>else has to be subject to that and I </v>

1533
01:23:03.181 --> 01:23:04.860
<v Speaker 10>would say that's not a claim that's </v>
<v Speaker 10>unique to.</v>

1534
01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:06.363
<v Speaker 10>So for example,</v>

1535
01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:08.580
<v Speaker 8>I think because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're being,</v>

1536
01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:09.573
<v Speaker 8>we're being told we're out of time here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I want to give Sam his reaction to </v>

1537
01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:14.230
<v Speaker 8>that as well and then we'll move on to q</v>
<v Speaker 8>and a.</v>

1538
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.380
<v Speaker 8>I'm tempted to just asked Jordan the </v>
<v Speaker 8>question here.</v>

1539
01:23:22.381 --> 01:23:23.214
<v Speaker 8>I know this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's hard to know what to save for </v>

1540
01:23:24.421 --> 01:23:25.254
<v Speaker 8>tomorrow night,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I feel like we've got 3000 people </v>

1541
01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:29.040
<v Speaker 8>sitting here who would really like an </v>
<v Speaker 8>answer to this question.</v>

1542
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:38.120
<v Speaker 8>You say you believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have been.</v>

1543
01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:40.250
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I say I act as if he exists,</v>

1544
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:41.143
<v Speaker 8>you'd say what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I act as if he exists a much more </v>

1545
01:23:44.841 --> 01:23:46.500
<v Speaker 8>precise claim.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

1546
01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.650
<v Speaker 8>so.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So then what,</v>

1547
01:23:47.651 --> 01:23:49.100
<v Speaker 8>what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>But in this case what.</v>

1548
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:52.703
<v Speaker 8>So you act as though God exists and in </v>
<v Speaker 8>addition I've heard you say that I act </v>

1549
01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:58.253
<v Speaker 8>as though God exists,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that I can't really be an atheist so </v>

1550
01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:04.020
<v Speaker 8>far.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'll see that the night is young.</v>

1551
01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:13.260
<v Speaker 8>So in that sense I'm not really an </v>
<v Speaker 8>atheist.</v>

1552
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:14.480
<v Speaker 8>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've heard you say this,</v>

1553
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:17.050
<v Speaker 8>some of you is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1554
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:22.770
<v Speaker 8>if I were really an atheist I would be </v>
<v Speaker 8>far more poorly behaved and in fact I am</v>

1555
01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:23.663
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would be like risk on the cough </v>

1556
01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:27.350
<v Speaker 8>committing murders and assuming there </v>
<v Speaker 8>was nothing wrong with it more,</v>

1557
01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:28.890
<v Speaker 8>it would be more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1558
01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:29.560
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1559
01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.393
<v Speaker 8>So.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that's a big distinction I need to </v>

1560
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:35.160
<v Speaker 8>know more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What was that?</v>

1561
01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:36.083
<v Speaker 8>It's a big distinction that you would,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is very different than it would be more </v>

1562
01:24:39.301 --> 01:24:41.340
<v Speaker 8>likely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Taking the safety off the gun is not the</v>

1563
01:24:41.341 --> 01:24:43.070
<v Speaker 8>same thing as shooting it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

1564
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:47.250
<v Speaker 8>The temptations laid open to risk and </v>
<v Speaker 8>would be more at hand.</v>

1565
01:24:47.690 --> 01:24:49.230
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just as they were to him.</v>

1566
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:54.590
<v Speaker 8>So what in that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So in what sense do you mean?</v>

1567
01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:59.920
<v Speaker 8>What is the God that you act as though </v>
<v Speaker 8>he,</v>

1568
01:25:00.601 --> 01:25:03.200
<v Speaker 8>she it exists,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and what is the what?</v>

1569
01:25:03.210 --> 01:25:04.043
<v Speaker 8>What is the God shaped thing I must have</v>
<v Speaker 8>in my life to prevent me from being a </v>

1570
01:25:08.551 --> 01:25:10.230
<v Speaker 8>quote real atheist?</v>

1571
01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:11.770
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

1572
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:12.663
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have to point out that there's no </v>

1573
01:25:13.991 --> 01:25:16.480
<v Speaker 7>possible way I can answer both those </v>
<v Speaker 7>questions in two minutes.</v>

1574
01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.160
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's the same question.</v>

1575
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:20.600
<v Speaker 8>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What do you mean by God?</v>

1576
01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:21.361
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1577
01:25:21.361 --> 01:25:24.110
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to tell you some of the things</v>
<v Speaker 7>that I mean by God.</v>

1578
01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:28.530
<v Speaker 11>We do have to get the quizzes.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm going to do this tomorrow.</v>

1579
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.060
<v Speaker 11>Maybe this is where we start.</v>

1580
01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was</v>

1581
01:25:33.330 --> 01:25:34.163
<v Speaker 11>pretty resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I seems like that constitutes an </v>

1582
01:25:36.451 --> 01:25:38.220
<v Speaker 11>audience question,</v>
<v Speaker 11>wouldn't you say?</v>

1583
01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:39.760
<v Speaker 11>I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'll tell you what,</v>

1584
01:25:40.110 --> 01:25:45.110
<v Speaker 11>let's</v>
<v Speaker 11>let's do this,</v>

1585
01:25:47.261 --> 01:25:49.720
<v Speaker 11>but let's be deliberate about time.</v>

1586
01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:51.010
<v Speaker 7>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1587
01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:52.420
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1588
01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:53.323
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>

1589
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:54.243
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to read some things that I </v>
<v Speaker 7>wrote because it's so complicated that </v>

1590
01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:59.890
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure that I can just spin it off</v>
<v Speaker 7>the top of my head.</v>

1591
01:25:59.891 --> 01:26:02.710
<v Speaker 7>And so you'll have to excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1592
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:06.040
<v Speaker 7>and what I'm going to do is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 7>paint a picture by by,</v>

1593
01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:09.230
<v Speaker 7>by highlighting different things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So now are already made.</v>

1594
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:10.123
<v Speaker 7>One point here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I made the point that part of the </v>

1595
01:26:12.651 --> 01:26:13.484
<v Speaker 7>conception of God that underlies the </v>
<v Speaker 7>western ethos is the notion that </v>

1596
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.193
<v Speaker 7>whatever God is expressed in truth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the truthful speech that rectifies </v>

1597
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.520
<v Speaker 7>pathological hierarchies and that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>all it does,</v>

1598
01:26:25.521 --> 01:26:30.050
<v Speaker 7>it also confronts the chaos of being </v>
<v Speaker 7>itself and generates habitable order.</v>

1599
01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.090
<v Speaker 7>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the metaphysical proposition,</v>

1600
01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:36.470
<v Speaker 7>and that that's best conceptualized as </v>
<v Speaker 7>at least one element of God.</v>

1601
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.633
<v Speaker 7>And so I would think about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>transcendent reality that's only </v>

1602
01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:42.590
<v Speaker 7>observable across the longest of </v>
<v Speaker 7>timeframes.</v>

1603
01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.960
<v Speaker 7>The longest have iterated timeframes to </v>
<v Speaker 7>your point.</v>

1604
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:46.250
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>

1605
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.110
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so here's,</v>

1606
01:26:48.111 --> 01:26:48.944
<v Speaker 7>here's some propositions and they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>complicated and they need to be </v>

1607
01:26:51.741 --> 01:26:52.574
<v Speaker 7>unpacked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I'm just going to read them and </v>

1608
01:26:54.170 --> 01:26:55.003
<v Speaker 7>that'll have to do for the time being.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So God is how we imaginatively and </v>

1609
01:26:59.391 --> 01:27:03.560
<v Speaker 7>collectively represent the existence and</v>
<v Speaker 7>action of consciousness across time,</v>

1610
01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:04.993
<v Speaker 7>as the most real aspects of existence </v>
<v Speaker 7>manifest themselves across the longest </v>

1611
01:27:08.151 --> 01:27:11.330
<v Speaker 7>of timeframes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but are not necessarily apprehensible as</v>

1612
01:27:11.331 --> 01:27:12.164
<v Speaker 7>objects in the here and now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what that means in some senses that </v>

1613
01:27:14.781 --> 01:27:15.614
<v Speaker 7>you have conceptions of reality built </v>
<v Speaker 7>into your biological and metaphysical </v>

1614
01:27:18.591 --> 01:27:21.350
<v Speaker 7>structure that are consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 7>processes,</v>

1615
01:27:21.351 --> 01:27:22.184
<v Speaker 7>of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that that occurred over unbelievably </v>

1616
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.393
<v Speaker 7>vast expanses of time and that structure</v>
<v Speaker 7>your perception of reality in ways that </v>

1617
01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:30.853
<v Speaker 7>it wouldn't be structured if you only </v>
<v Speaker 7>live for the amount of time that you're </v>

1618
01:27:33.111 --> 01:27:33.944
<v Speaker 7>going to live,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's also part of the problem of </v>

1619
01:27:36.201 --> 01:27:37.034
<v Speaker 7>deriving values from fact because you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>evanescent and and you can derive the </v>

1620
01:27:41.151 --> 01:27:45.530
<v Speaker 7>right values from the facts that portray</v>
<v Speaker 7>themselves to you in your lifespan,</v>

1621
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:46.393
<v Speaker 7>which is why you have a biological </v>
<v Speaker 7>structure that's like three point 5 </v>

1622
01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:50.023
<v Speaker 7>billion years old,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so god is that which eternally dies and </v>

1623
01:27:52.641 --> 01:27:55.520
<v Speaker 7>is reborn in the pursuit of higher being</v>
<v Speaker 7>in truth.</v>

1624
01:27:55.730 --> 01:27:57.860
<v Speaker 7>That's a fundamental element of hero </v>
<v Speaker 7>mythology.</v>

1625
01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.830
<v Speaker 7>God is the highest value in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>hierarchy of values.</v>

1626
01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:01.913
<v Speaker 7>It's another way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>God is what calls and what responds in </v>

1627
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:08.960
<v Speaker 7>the eternal call to adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>God is the voice of conscience.</v>

1628
01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.900
<v Speaker 7>God is the source of judgment and mercy </v>
<v Speaker 7>in guilt.</v>

1629
01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:13.213
<v Speaker 7>God is the future to which we make </v>
<v Speaker 7>sacrifices and something akin to the </v>

1630
01:28:17.331 --> 01:28:21.020
<v Speaker 7>transcendental repository of reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's a cool one.</v>

1631
01:28:21.021 --> 01:28:24.050
<v Speaker 7>If you're an evolutionary biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>

1632
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:25.873
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>God is that which selects among men in </v>

1633
01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:31.650
<v Speaker 7>the eternal hierarchy of men,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you know,</v>

1634
01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:32.503
<v Speaker 7>men arrange themselves into hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then men rise in the hierarchy and </v>

1635
01:28:36.471 --> 01:28:37.304
<v Speaker 7>there's principles that are important </v>
<v Speaker 7>that determine the probability of their </v>

1636
01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:43.670
<v Speaker 7>rise and those principles aren't </v>
<v Speaker 7>tyrannical power.</v>

1637
01:28:43.671 --> 01:28:44.504
<v Speaker 7>There are something like the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 7>articulate truth and the ability to be </v>

1638
01:28:47.721 --> 01:28:50.960
<v Speaker 7>competent and the ability to make </v>
<v Speaker 7>appropriate moral judgements,</v>

1639
01:28:50.961 --> 01:28:53.390
<v Speaker 7>and if you can do that in a given </v>
<v Speaker 7>situation,</v>

1640
01:28:53.391 --> 01:28:56.630
<v Speaker 7>then all the other men will vote you up </v>
<v Speaker 7>the hierarchy so to speak,</v>

1641
01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:57.464
<v Speaker 7>and that will radically increase your </v>
<v Speaker 7>reproductive fitness and the operation </v>

1642
01:29:00.321 --> 01:29:02.400
<v Speaker 7>of that process.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Long expanses</v>

1643
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.233
<v Speaker 10>of time looks to me like it's codified </v>
<v Speaker 10>in something like the notion of God the </v>

1644
01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:06.594
<v Speaker 10>father.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's also the same thing that makes </v>

1645
01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:11.220
<v Speaker 10>women men attractive to women because </v>
<v Speaker 10>men,</v>

1646
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.113
<v Speaker 10>women peel off the top of the male </v>
<v Speaker 10>hierarchy and the question is what </v>

1647
01:29:14.731 --> 01:29:15.564
<v Speaker 10>should be at the top of the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 10>and the answer right now is tyranny as </v>

1648
01:29:18.871 --> 01:29:19.704
<v Speaker 10>part of the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but the real answer is something more </v>

1649
01:29:21.481 --> 01:29:22.314
<v Speaker 10>like the ability to use truthful speech </v>
<v Speaker 10>in the service of let's say wellbeing </v>

1650
01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:27.503
<v Speaker 10>and so that's something that operates </v>
<v Speaker 10>across tremendous expenses of time and </v>

1651
01:29:31.141 --> 01:29:34.020
<v Speaker 10>it plays a role in the selection for </v>
<v Speaker 10>survival itself,</v>

1652
01:29:34.021 --> 01:29:35.580
<v Speaker 10>which makes it a fundamental reality.</v>

1653
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:36.490
<v Speaker 8>Jordan?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Ivanka,</v>

1654
01:29:36.490 --> 01:29:40.040
<v Speaker 8>I just cut in here with one question </v>
<v Speaker 8>that for now</v>

1655
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:41.303
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1656
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:48.383
<v Speaker 8>So I was not hearing in that list of </v>
<v Speaker 8>attributes a god who could care if </v>

1657
01:29:53.791 --> 01:29:58.791
<v Speaker 8>anyone masturbated.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was not hearing a God who</v>

1658
01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.820
<v Speaker 10>depends on what else is stopping you </v>
<v Speaker 10>from doing.</v>

1659
01:30:00.821 --> 01:30:03.190
<v Speaker 10>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 10>sorry,</v>

1660
01:30:03.191 --> 01:30:04.024
<v Speaker 10>I missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I said it depends on what else is </v>

1661
01:30:06.851 --> 01:30:08.260
<v Speaker 10>stopping you from doing</v>

1662
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:09.801
<v Speaker 8>well.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1663
01:30:09.801 --> 01:30:12.470
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so it's serious.</v>

1664
01:30:12.471 --> 01:30:14.750
<v Speaker 8>It's important to do something other </v>
<v Speaker 8>than masturbate.</v>

1665
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:15.663
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1666
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:17.730
<v Speaker 10>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Which is which,</v>

1667
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:20.870
<v Speaker 10>which actually constitutes a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is harder</v>

1668
01:30:21.090 --> 01:30:21.923
<v Speaker 4>sounds.</v>

1669
01:30:26.690 --> 01:30:27.523
<v Speaker 8>I'm not hearing a God,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a personal God who can possibly hear </v>

1670
01:30:33.201 --> 01:30:35.360
<v Speaker 8>anyone's prayer is much less answer </v>
<v Speaker 8>them.</v>

1671
01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:36.793
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I'm wondering what percentage of </v>

1672
01:30:38.661 --> 01:30:41.060
<v Speaker 8>religious people who would say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah,</v>

1673
01:30:41.061 --> 01:30:43.820
<v Speaker 8>I believe in God and it's the most </v>
<v Speaker 8>important thing in my life.</v>

1674
01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:45.973
<v Speaker 8>What percentage of those religious </v>
<v Speaker 8>people do you think have in mind a god </v>

1675
01:30:48.441 --> 01:30:49.790
<v Speaker 8>of this sort you just described</v>

1676
01:30:50.150 --> 01:30:50.983
<v Speaker 10>know sam?</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a good question because when I go </v>

1677
01:30:52.451 --> 01:30:54.130
<v Speaker 10>talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when I,</v>

1678
01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:57.280
<v Speaker 10>when I talk to people online and use </v>
<v Speaker 10>exactly this terminology,</v>

1679
01:30:57.281 --> 01:31:00.450
<v Speaker 10>millions of people listen,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so it's not so obvious which,</v>

1680
01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:02.230
<v Speaker 10>what percentage of people see it this </v>
<v Speaker 10>way?</v>

1681
01:31:02.231 --> 01:31:04.690
<v Speaker 10>It's maybe that they have the </v>
<v Speaker 10>intuitions,</v>

1682
01:31:04.691 --> 01:31:06.370
<v Speaker 10>but they haven't been articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

1683
01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:09.800
<v Speaker 8>I mean this is the problem is what </v>
<v Speaker 8>worries me about this.</v>

1684
01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:10.713
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1685
01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:14.373
<v Speaker 8>you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You could do the same thing with the </v>

1686
01:31:18.201 --> 01:31:18.620
<v Speaker 8>idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of,</v>

1687
01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.730
<v Speaker 8>of ghosts,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1688
01:31:19.731 --> 01:31:21.710
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so people traditionally have believed in</v>

1689
01:31:21.711 --> 01:31:23.240
<v Speaker 8>ghosts.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a,</v>

1690
01:31:23.241 --> 01:31:24.074
<v Speaker 8>it's an archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You might say the ghost survival of </v>

1691
01:31:26.091 --> 01:31:26.924
<v Speaker 8>death is certainly an archetypes and we </v>
<v Speaker 8>know what most people most of the time </v>

1692
01:31:30.321 --> 01:31:32.360
<v Speaker 8>mean when they say they believe in </v>
<v Speaker 8>ghosts,</v>

1693
01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:35.720
<v Speaker 8>and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't believe in ghosts,</v>

1694
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:36.861
<v Speaker 8>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1695
01:31:36.861 --> 01:31:38.510
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you do believe in ghosts.</v>

1696
01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:42.920
<v Speaker 8>Ghosts are your relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>unseen.</v>

1697
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:44.203
<v Speaker 8>That's a ghost,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so you have a new definition of ghost </v>

1698
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:50.630
<v Speaker 8>that you're putting in in place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Provided which I have to say,</v>

1699
01:31:50.631 --> 01:31:51.464
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of course I have a relationship to the </v>

1700
01:31:52.221 --> 01:31:55.130
<v Speaker 8>unseen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I guess I do believe in ghosts.</v>

1701
01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.330
<v Speaker 8>You win that argument,</v>

1702
01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:00.300
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1703
01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:01.133
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

1704
01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:05.260
<v Speaker 8>simply isn't what most people mean by a </v>
<v Speaker 8>ghost most.</v>

1705
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:06.343
<v Speaker 8>You mean using that simplified argument </v>
<v Speaker 8>about my conception of ghost as an </v>

1706
01:32:09.971 --> 01:32:13.240
<v Speaker 8>analogy for the proposition that I just </v>
<v Speaker 8>put forward is when I see you do.</v>

1707
01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:15.310
<v Speaker 8>I mean maybe you have more to say on the</v>
<v Speaker 8>topic of Guy,</v>

1708
01:32:15.311 --> 01:32:17.620
<v Speaker 8>but this is what I hear you doing with </v>
<v Speaker 8>God.</v>

1709
01:32:17.621 --> 01:32:18.454
<v Speaker 8>You have defined the God that most </v>
<v Speaker 8>people believe in and we know this is </v>

1710
01:32:22.391 --> 01:32:24.760
<v Speaker 8>the God that most people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was asked what God I believed in.</v>

1711
01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:26.550
<v Speaker 8>I'm asking you</v>

1712
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:28.110
<v Speaker 1>percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1713
01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:29.453
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1714
01:32:29.490 --> 01:32:32.860
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you by shifting the definition,</v>

1715
01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:33.723
<v Speaker 8>you have robbed the now and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>traditional now of its traditional </v>

1716
01:32:37.541 --> 01:32:39.260
<v Speaker 8>meaning and you're giving your</v>

1717
01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:42.530
<v Speaker 1>partying to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a second.</v>

1718
01:32:42.650 --> 01:32:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean by traditional meaning,</v>

1719
01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.420
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1720
01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.253
<v Speaker 10>it's one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 10>One of the elemental claims in the Old </v>

1721
01:32:49.421 --> 01:32:50.254
<v Speaker 10>Testament is that you're not even </v>
<v Speaker 10>supposed to under the name of God </v>

1722
01:32:52.241 --> 01:32:56.620
<v Speaker 10>because by defining it too tightly,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you lose its essence and so let's not be</v>

1723
01:32:56.621 --> 01:32:59.710
<v Speaker 10>talking about what the classical </v>
<v Speaker 10>definition of God is here.</v>

1724
01:32:59.711 --> 01:33:01.060
<v Speaker 10>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a historical</v>

1725
01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:01.920
<v Speaker 11>starter.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Okay?</v>

1726
01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:02.753
<v Speaker 11>Then there's plenty of religions that </v>
<v Speaker 11>can make in my check in with the </v>

1727
01:33:04.521 --> 01:33:05.354
<v Speaker 11>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Is the audience all right with us </v>

1728
01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:08.980
<v Speaker 11>continuing down this.</v>

1729
01:33:10.670 --> 01:33:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can I.</v>

1730
01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:15.750
<v Speaker 1>can I jump in here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sacrificing</v>

1731
01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:19.990
<v Speaker 11>your q and a so that it is at the </v>
<v Speaker 11>expense of q and a that's,</v>

1732
01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:20.853
<v Speaker 11>that's given out,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I</v>

1733
01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:26.130
<v Speaker 1>probably worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me say,</v>

1734
01:33:26.821 --> 01:33:27.654
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

1735
01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:30.433
<v Speaker 9>I do not believe in a supernatural God,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but the God that I've heard Jordan just </v>

1736
01:33:34.461 --> 01:33:35.294
<v Speaker 9>describe.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I do not have any difficulty </v>

1737
01:33:38.811 --> 01:33:41.900
<v Speaker 9>understanding why he might care if you </v>
<v Speaker 9>masturbate.</v>

1738
01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:42.853
<v Speaker 9>And I also don't have any trouble </v>
<v Speaker 9>figuring out how he might answer </v>

1739
01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:47.533
<v Speaker 9>prayers.</v>

1740
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:50.810
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>tell me more.</v>

1741
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:52.230
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I,</v>

1742
01:33:52.230 --> 01:33:53.730
<v Speaker 11>I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I can tell you,</v>

1743
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.890
<v Speaker 11>I can tell you how our prayer might be </v>
<v Speaker 11>answered.</v>

1744
01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:57.760
<v Speaker 11>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 11>But these are so specific.</v>

1745
01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:59.100
<v Speaker 11>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Let me do that.</v>

1746
01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:02.220
<v Speaker 11>So it'll be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So I'm not Jordan,</v>

1747
01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:04.080
<v Speaker 11>we've not talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 11>If I</v>

1748
01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:05.373
<v Speaker 9>an answer from him that actually would </v>
<v Speaker 9>satisfy me as to what the mechanism of </v>

1749
01:34:09.661 --> 01:34:11.030
<v Speaker 9>action might be that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that,</v>

1750
01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.490
<v Speaker 9>that'd be pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And if he can tell me what I heard,</v>

1751
01:34:15.170 --> 01:34:16.003
<v Speaker 9>I think it would,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it would suggest that that we're not </v>

1752
01:34:17.641 --> 01:34:18.474
<v Speaker 9>just making it.</v>

1753
01:34:18.670 --> 01:34:19.220
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>

1754
01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.390
<v Speaker 10>so you might like this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you may be done,</v>

1755
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:23.980
<v Speaker 10>but it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1756
01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:25.600
<v Speaker 10>So imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1757
01:34:25.630 --> 01:34:28.510
<v Speaker 10>So let's imagine that hellish situation </v>
<v Speaker 10>that you laid out.</v>

1758
01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:30.011
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but,</v>

1759
01:34:30.011 --> 01:34:30.844
<v Speaker 10>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>let's put the extra twist in it because </v>

1760
01:34:32.141 --> 01:34:32.974
<v Speaker 10>one of the things that we both decided,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think was that you also have to build </v>

1761
01:34:35.981 --> 01:34:39.370
<v Speaker 10>in the intent into that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So let's say the hell that we're talking</v>

1762
01:34:39.371 --> 01:34:40.204
<v Speaker 10>about isn't the victim of the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 10>massacres that you laid out in the </v>

1763
01:34:44.591 --> 01:34:46.180
<v Speaker 10>jungle story.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But a perpetrator,</v>

1764
01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:47.913
<v Speaker 10>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so someone who's actually acted in a </v>

1765
01:34:49.481 --> 01:34:51.520
<v Speaker 10>malevolent manner,</v>
<v Speaker 10>truly malevolent manner,</v>

1766
01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:52.940
<v Speaker 10>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Or,</v>

1767
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.540
<v Speaker 10>or maybe perhaps we wouldn't have to </v>
<v Speaker 10>take that extreme case.</v>

1768
01:34:55.541 --> 01:34:56.231
<v Speaker 10>We could say,</v>
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

1769
01:34:56.231 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 10>perhaps you've,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that</v>

1770
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.843
<v Speaker 7>any of you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've decided that you've seriously </v>

1771
01:34:59.991 --> 01:35:04.220
<v Speaker 7>done something wrong and you want to get</v>
<v Speaker 7>away from hail.</v>

1772
01:35:04.221 --> 01:35:06.350
<v Speaker 7>You want to make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay?</v>

1773
01:35:06.351 --> 01:35:08.720
<v Speaker 7>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's an exercise you can try.</v>

1774
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:11.300
<v Speaker 7>So what you do is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>

1775
01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:14.810
<v Speaker 7>is you sit on the edge of your bed and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you say,</v>

1776
01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:17.600
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what I did was wrong.</v>

1777
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:20.090
<v Speaker 7>And you have to really believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1778
01:35:20.091 --> 01:35:21.530
<v Speaker 7>So you've thought about it's killing </v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

1779
01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:23.023
<v Speaker 7>it's killing you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now you're a penitent and you're </v>

1780
01:35:25.071 --> 01:35:26.210
<v Speaker 7>confessing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>

1781
01:35:26.630 --> 01:35:29.990
<v Speaker 7>and you're confessing to yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 7>much as to anyone and you say,</v>

1782
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.903
<v Speaker 7>I really want to know what I did wrong </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I really want to know what I could </v>

1783
01:35:35.511 --> 01:35:36.344
<v Speaker 7>do to put it right and I'm willing to </v>
<v Speaker 7>accept any answer that will manifest </v>

1784
01:35:40.611 --> 01:35:43.250
<v Speaker 7>itself to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Try that.</v>

1785
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:44.600
<v Speaker 7>See what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1786
01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:47.750
<v Speaker 7>that's a prayer that will be answered </v>
<v Speaker 7>and it won't be answered in the way that</v>

1787
01:35:47.751 --> 01:35:49.970
<v Speaker 7>you want it to be answered.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can bloody well tell you that.</v>

1788
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:50.630
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

1789
01:35:50.630 --> 01:35:52.190
<v Speaker 7>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1790
01:35:52.230 --> 01:35:55.390
<v Speaker 7>what are you communicating with you </v>
<v Speaker 7>communicating with what you do</v>

1791
01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:56.503
<v Speaker 8>that that is something that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is a process that I'm familiar </v>

1792
01:36:00.891 --> 01:36:01.724
<v Speaker 8>with.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't require any supernatural </v>

1793
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:05.623
<v Speaker 8>explanation.</v>

1794
01:36:05.690 --> 01:36:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly doesn't require</v>

1795
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:11.103
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We imagine that any of our books were </v>

1796
01:36:13.361 --> 01:36:14.194
<v Speaker 7>dictated by the creator of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't say anything so acquired any </v>

1797
01:36:16.151 --> 01:36:18.250
<v Speaker 7>supernatural gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nobody shouldn't order to require.</v>

1798
01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:23.260
<v Speaker 7>My concern was asked to provide an </v>
<v Speaker 7>instance of prayer that worked.</v>

1799
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:24.370
<v Speaker 7>That's what I did.</v>

1800
01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.970
<v Speaker 8>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's fully understandable.</v>

1801
01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:31.300
<v Speaker 8>In terms of human psychology.</v>

1802
01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:34.110
<v Speaker 7>It's not understandable because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 7>know where the answer comes from.</v>

1803
01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.700
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we don't know where anything comes from.</v>

1804
01:36:35.701 --> 01:36:36.600
<v Speaker 7>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1805
01:36:37.050 --> 01:36:40.740
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't.</v>

1806
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:42.000
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't open</v>

1807
01:36:42.150 --> 01:36:42.983
<v Speaker 8>door of we one thing we can know with </v>
<v Speaker 8>absolute certainty that that whoever </v>

1808
01:36:47.251 --> 01:36:50.730
<v Speaker 8>wrote the Bible didn't know either and </v>
<v Speaker 8>there's many other things.</v>

1809
01:36:50.731 --> 01:36:51.780
<v Speaker 8>He or she didn't know.</v>

1810
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Everything else we know scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1811
01:36:56.050 --> 01:36:57.990
<v Speaker 7>So obvious with people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No one even knew.</v>

1812
01:36:58.090 --> 01:37:00.820
<v Speaker 7>No one even knew the brain was involved </v>
<v Speaker 7>in any of this.</v>

1813
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:01.743
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he probably knew about as much as we </v>

1814
01:37:03.251 --> 01:37:05.410
<v Speaker 7>do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>About how the brain was involved in it,</v>

1815
01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:06.333
<v Speaker 7>but we've already,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've already established in some </v>

1816
01:37:07.901 --> 01:37:08.734
<v Speaker 7>tenuous way that things that nobody </v>
<v Speaker 7>understands could have evolved into </v>

1817
01:37:12.311 --> 01:37:14.920
<v Speaker 7>these stories in some way that would be </v>
<v Speaker 7>useful,</v>

1818
01:37:14.921 --> 01:37:17.140
<v Speaker 7>but nobody knew what they were writing </v>
<v Speaker 7>when they wrote it.</v>

1819
01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.373
<v Speaker 8>The problem is that you can so again </v>
<v Speaker 8>with this has been focused through the </v>

1820
01:37:21.791 --> 01:37:26.110
<v Speaker 8>lens of your attachment to Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 8>largely,</v>

1821
01:37:26.170 --> 01:37:27.003
<v Speaker 8>but the Hindus,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hinduism is a completely different set </v>

1822
01:37:30.641 --> 01:37:34.570
<v Speaker 8>of stories right now and many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the logic,</v>

1823
01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:37.690
<v Speaker 8>the emotional logic,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the psychological import.</v>

1824
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:42.750
<v Speaker 8>Many of them have the opposite valence </v>
<v Speaker 8>from any Christian story,</v>

1825
01:37:42.761 --> 01:37:45.100
<v Speaker 8>you would tell the whole notion of like </v>
<v Speaker 8>for instance,</v>

1826
01:37:45.101 --> 01:37:46.930
<v Speaker 8>the whole notion of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1827
01:37:46.931 --> 01:37:47.764
<v Speaker 8>Which has such primacy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean you talk about religion being </v>

1828
01:37:50.531 --> 01:37:51.364
<v Speaker 8>deeper than ethics because ethics just </v>
<v Speaker 8>deals with right and wrong and religion </v>

1829
01:37:54.731 --> 01:37:57.690
<v Speaker 8>deals with and evil right at bedrock,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

1830
01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:03.260
<v Speaker 8>good and evil do not have the same </v>
<v Speaker 8>meaning in the east.</v>

1831
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:06.360
<v Speaker 8>Buddhism and Hinduism do something very </v>
<v Speaker 8>different.</v>

1832
01:38:06.370 --> 01:38:09.240
<v Speaker 8>We're willing to accept your definitions</v>
<v Speaker 8>of good and evil.</v>

1833
01:38:09.241 --> 01:38:14.241
<v Speaker 8>For the truth is it's just not even evil</v>
<v Speaker 8>is just ignorance.</v>

1834
01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:15.533
<v Speaker 8>On some level,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just an evil is just you haven't </v>

1835
01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:19.620
<v Speaker 8>met any real evil people if you believe </v>
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>

1836
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:20.101
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

1837
01:38:20.101 --> 01:38:22.590
<v Speaker 8>so then all the Hindus and Buddhists are</v>
<v Speaker 8>wrong about this.</v>

1838
01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.473
<v Speaker 8>That's possible claim.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm just saying that there is over a </v>

1839
01:38:27.031 --> 01:38:32.031
<v Speaker 8>billion people who have a religious </v>
<v Speaker 8>system of stories from which they derive</v>

1840
01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 8>all kinds of meaning to which they're </v>
<v Speaker 8>mightily attached to where we could play</v>

1841
01:38:37.501 --> 01:38:38.334
<v Speaker 8>the same game of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of archetypal interpretation and </v>

1842
01:38:42.811 --> 01:38:43.644
<v Speaker 8>valuing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and yet the cash value with respect to </v>

1843
01:38:49.021 --> 01:38:53.010
<v Speaker 8>good and evil is irreconcilable with </v>
<v Speaker 8>what you get from Christianity,</v>

1844
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:55.670
<v Speaker 8>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't have to be interoperable.</v>

1845
01:38:55.770 --> 01:38:56.410
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>

1846
01:38:56.410 --> 01:38:56.870
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>

1847
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:57.703
<v Speaker 8>but the point is we live in a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Presumably Hinduism is also useful as a </v>

1848
01:39:03.991 --> 01:39:07.550
<v Speaker 8>set of heuristics to be for Hindus and </v>
<v Speaker 8>if he,</v>

1849
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:08.423
<v Speaker 8>if Hinduism as a manner of doctrine and </v>
<v Speaker 8>as a matter of the interpretations of </v>

1850
01:39:13.021 --> 01:39:16.530
<v Speaker 8>the Heuristics by the devout in both </v>
<v Speaker 8>systems,</v>

1851
01:39:17.290 --> 01:39:21.120
<v Speaker 8>if it Hinduism and Christianity are </v>
<v Speaker 8>irreconcilable,</v>

1852
01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:22.273
<v Speaker 8>right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then there must be a deeper level of </v>

1853
01:39:25.531 --> 01:39:28.110
<v Speaker 8>reality that explains why they both </v>
<v Speaker 8>work.</v>

1854
01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:33.380
<v Speaker 8>That can't be reducible to Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 8>being true or Hinduism being true.</v>

1855
01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1856
01:39:35.271 --> 01:39:37.230
<v Speaker 1>That's Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's there's,</v>

1857
01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:38.870
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely nothing</v>

1858
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.273
<v Speaker 10>wrong with that objection.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like so this is one of the immense </v>

1859
01:39:44.421 --> 01:39:45.254
<v Speaker 10>problems obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that that actually leads down the road </v>

1860
01:39:48.321 --> 01:39:51.990
<v Speaker 10>to the kind of nihilism that you were </v>
<v Speaker 10>objecting to in,</v>

1861
01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:53.630
<v Speaker 10>in,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in the moral landscape.</v>

1862
01:39:53.631 --> 01:39:56.500
<v Speaker 10>It's like one of the things that need </v>
<v Speaker 10>you said was,</v>

1863
01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.530
<v Speaker 10>it's very much apropos to this is that </v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1864
01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:00.373
<v Speaker 10>it's one thing to have your,</v>
<v Speaker 10>your belief system shattered by the </v>

1865
01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:05.413
<v Speaker 10>observation that there are other belief </v>
<v Speaker 10>systems that are incommensurate that </v>

1866
01:40:07.821 --> 01:40:09.930
<v Speaker 10>seemed to have equal utility so that </v>
<v Speaker 10>that's.</v>

1867
01:40:10.450 --> 01:40:11.283
<v Speaker 10>But it's even worse is that once you </v>
<v Speaker 10>make the observation that there are </v>

1868
01:40:13.851 --> 01:40:16.850
<v Speaker 10>other belief systems that have equal </v>
<v Speaker 10>utility,</v>

1869
01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:17.923
<v Speaker 10>then it can shatter your belief in </v>
<v Speaker 10>belief systems themselves and then </v>

1870
01:40:20.811 --> 01:40:23.910
<v Speaker 10>you're in the postmodern nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 10>landscape and that's a big problem.</v>

1871
01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:24.933
<v Speaker 8>Or You could just be in a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in a more fundamental landscape that </v>

1872
01:40:27.191 --> 01:40:28.210
<v Speaker 8>subsumes both</v>

1873
01:40:29.170 --> 01:40:29.650
<v Speaker 10>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Let's,</v>

1874
01:40:29.650 --> 01:40:30.483
<v Speaker 10>let's hope that that can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but that I would say that's the </v>

1875
01:40:32.501 --> 01:40:36.190
<v Speaker 10>landscape that I'm trying to pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Now you said that this is,</v>

1876
01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:37.173
<v Speaker 10>that I've been approaching this from a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>from a Christian perspective in this </v>

1877
01:40:40.061 --> 01:40:43.030
<v Speaker 10>dialogue and to some degree that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but there are reasons for that,</v>

1878
01:40:43.031 --> 01:40:43.864
<v Speaker 10>but I would also say I'm also doing what</v>
<v Speaker 10>you recommend doing because in maps of </v>

1879
01:40:48.791 --> 01:40:50.470
<v Speaker 10>meaning for example,</v>
<v Speaker 10>because you said,</v>

1880
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:51.333
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what about this problem of multiple </v>

1881
01:40:52.121 --> 01:40:52.954
<v Speaker 10>interpretations?</v>

1882
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:54.460
<v Speaker 8>You road maps of meaning</v>

1883
01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:57.520
<v Speaker 10>you wrote maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I wrote the moral landscape.</v>

1884
01:40:57.630 --> 01:40:58.780
<v Speaker 10>I must've,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I must've missed it.</v>

1885
01:40:58.810 --> 01:41:01.210
<v Speaker 10>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I must have missed it.</v>

1886
01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:04.120
<v Speaker 10>I missed starting to get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but</v>

1887
01:41:06.130 --> 01:41:06.963
<v Speaker 10>what I tried to do it well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I tried to address that problem </v>

1888
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:11.440
<v Speaker 10>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like it's a really big problem.</v>

1889
01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:13.900
<v Speaker 10>Was the problem of multiple </v>
<v Speaker 10>interpretations.</v>

1890
01:41:14.170 --> 01:41:15.003
<v Speaker 10>It's the postmodern problem is if </v>
<v Speaker 10>there's an infinite number of potential </v>

1891
01:41:17.831 --> 01:41:19.330
<v Speaker 10>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1892
01:41:19.331 --> 01:41:20.011
<v Speaker 10>So.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

1893
01:41:20.011 --> 01:41:20.844
<v Speaker 10>so what do we do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 10>And the answer is it's something you </v>

1894
01:41:22.931 --> 01:41:24.000
<v Speaker 10>alluded to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm sorry,</v>

1895
01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:25.660
<v Speaker 10>in,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in the moral landscape,</v>

1896
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:26.913
<v Speaker 10>and it's part of the basis of your </v>
<v Speaker 10>argument why these things need to be </v>

1897
01:41:29.621 --> 01:41:33.670
<v Speaker 10>grounded in facts.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So because that is part of the answer to</v>

1898
01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:37.150
<v Speaker 10>the problem of an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 10>interpretations in maps of meaning,</v>

1899
01:41:37.151 --> 01:41:39.220
<v Speaker 10>I tried to do what Ian Wilson </v>
<v Speaker 10>recommended,</v>

1900
01:41:39.221 --> 01:41:42.940
<v Speaker 10>but this was before he wrote his book.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I tried to use a consilience approach.</v>

1901
01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.700
<v Speaker 10>So I looked at multiple religious </v>
<v Speaker 10>systems.</v>

1902
01:41:45.701 --> 01:41:48.370
<v Speaker 10>I looked at Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I looked at evolutionary biology,</v>

1903
01:41:48.371 --> 01:41:52.210
<v Speaker 10>I looked at philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I looked at neuroscience and I looked at</v>

1904
01:41:52.450 --> 01:41:56.770
<v Speaker 10>the literature on emotion and motivation</v>
<v Speaker 10>and the literature on play that was very</v>

1905
01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:57.633
<v Speaker 10>nicely delineated by piaget and I tried </v>
<v Speaker 10>to see where there was a pattern that </v>

1906
01:42:01.751 --> 01:42:04.660
<v Speaker 10>repeated across all dimensions of </v>
<v Speaker 10>evaluation,</v>

1907
01:42:04.661 --> 01:42:06.520
<v Speaker 10>which is exactly what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 10>For example,</v>

1908
01:42:06.521 --> 01:42:09.730
<v Speaker 10>when you use your five senses to detect </v>
<v Speaker 10>something real in the world.</v>

1909
01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:12.910
<v Speaker 10>And that's what Wilson recommended was a</v>
<v Speaker 10>consilience approach.</v>

1910
01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:14.043
<v Speaker 10>And so my proposition was if it </v>
<v Speaker 10>manifests itself here and here and here </v>

1911
01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:21.760
<v Speaker 10>and here and here,</v>
<v Speaker 10>six places,</v>

1912
01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:22.683
<v Speaker 10>and it's always the same pattern than </v>
<v Speaker 10>the probability that that pattern </v>

1913
01:42:25.211 --> 01:42:26.044
<v Speaker 10>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Independent of my delusional </v>

1914
01:42:28.031 --> 01:42:30.820
<v Speaker 10>interpretation is radically decreased.</v>

1915
01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.510
<v Speaker 8>My claim,</v>
<v Speaker 8>however,</v>

1916
01:42:32.511 --> 01:42:35.120
<v Speaker 8>is that many of these things don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>repeat.</v>

1917
01:42:35.121 --> 01:42:35.954
<v Speaker 8>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're flipped around completely based </v>

1918
01:42:38.211 --> 01:42:40.580
<v Speaker 8>on different religious assumptions and </v>
<v Speaker 8>different cultures,</v>

1919
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:42.810
<v Speaker 8>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would just argue that this is.</v>

1920
01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:46.260
<v Speaker 8>We can disband discussion is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 8>dispense with those,</v>

1921
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:47.343
<v Speaker 8>but I'm just saying something as </v>
<v Speaker 8>fundamental as evil doesn't run through </v>

1922
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:52.730
<v Speaker 8>all these cultures and all these </v>
<v Speaker 8>religious traditions.</v>

1923
01:42:52.770 --> 01:42:53.603
<v Speaker 10>Then how can you make the claim that </v>
<v Speaker 10>everyone would agree with your </v>

1924
01:42:55.681 --> 01:42:57.540
<v Speaker 10>description of what constitutes bad</v>

1925
01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:00.160
<v Speaker 8>landscape?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It would be.</v>

1926
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:01.600
<v Speaker 8>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just not.</v>

1927
01:43:01.930 --> 01:43:06.060
<v Speaker 8>It's not evil in the sense that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's banter,</v>

1928
01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:08.110
<v Speaker 8>there's better and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's better and worse.</v>

1929
01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:09.693
<v Speaker 8>Can we?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Can we?</v>

1930
01:43:09.810 --> 01:43:13.260
<v Speaker 8>There's either universal moral </v>
<v Speaker 8>intuitions or there honest no it.</v>

1931
01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:14.223
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

1932
01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:19.290
<v Speaker 8>Are some moral intuitions universal?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1933
01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:19.780
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would.</v>

1934
01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:21.480
<v Speaker 8>I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Listen,</v>

1935
01:43:21.481 --> 01:43:23.940
<v Speaker 8>we are just human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1936
01:43:23.941 --> 01:43:27.180
<v Speaker 8>We're human beings first before we're </v>
<v Speaker 8>Hindu or Buddhist or Christian,</v>

1937
01:43:27.181 --> 01:43:30.060
<v Speaker 8>but we can all get indoctrinated into </v>
<v Speaker 8>the religion of our parents.</v>

1938
01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:31.890
<v Speaker 8>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>an artifice.</v>

1939
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:33.930
<v Speaker 8>This laid on top of something far </v>
<v Speaker 8>deeper.</v>

1940
01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:35.410
<v Speaker 8>That should be obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So.</v>

1941
01:43:35.490 --> 01:43:36.091
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

1942
01:43:36.091 --> 01:43:38.610
<v Speaker 8>so we're trying to get down to what's </v>
<v Speaker 8>deeper.</v>

1943
01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:39.660
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so there may be,</v>

1944
01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:42.570
<v Speaker 8>there may be some moral universal's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>

1945
01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:43.433
<v Speaker 8>I think Jordan would know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but possible that there are some moral </v>

1946
01:43:47.881 --> 01:43:51.240
<v Speaker 8>intuitions that are highly specific to </v>
<v Speaker 8>particular</v>

1947
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.230
<v Speaker 10>and wouldn't translate over to others.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yes,</v>

1948
01:43:54.730 --> 01:43:58.330
<v Speaker 10>so highly probable because there would </v>
<v Speaker 10>be environment specific adaptations like</v>

1949
01:43:58.331 --> 01:44:00.950
<v Speaker 10>the environment specific tool use of </v>
<v Speaker 10>chimpanzees.</v>

1950
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:02.150
<v Speaker 10>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right.</v>

1951
01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:02.983
<v Speaker 10>Or maybe it's not even the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Maybe it's the self consistency of the </v>

1952
01:44:06.081 --> 01:44:06.914
<v Speaker 10>belief pattern in question,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so I'm sure I would put that in the </v>

1953
01:44:09.261 --> 01:44:10.094
<v Speaker 10>broader environment.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It might be a consequence of the </v>

1954
01:44:11.391 --> 01:44:13.940
<v Speaker 10>particularities of that culture.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There will be things that look,</v>

1955
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:16.820
<v Speaker 10>think about it like languages,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like many,</v>

1956
01:44:16.821 --> 01:44:19.850
<v Speaker 10>and this is kind of an answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 10>problem that you laid out,</v>

1957
01:44:19.851 --> 01:44:22.130
<v Speaker 10>which is a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm not trying to deny the problem.</v>

1958
01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.740
<v Speaker 10>If you look at there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 10>languages,</v>

1959
01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.110
<v Speaker 10>lots of languages.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Look at how different they are.</v>

1960
01:44:27.111 --> 01:44:27.741
<v Speaker 10>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

1961
01:44:27.741 --> 01:44:28.574
<v Speaker 10>at some levels of analysis they're </v>
<v Speaker 10>fundamentally different and at other </v>

1962
01:44:30.561 --> 01:44:32.510
<v Speaker 10>levels of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they're fundamentally the same,</v>

1963
01:44:32.511 --> 01:44:34.940
<v Speaker 10>which is how we know that their </v>
<v Speaker 10>languages and you could say,</v>

1964
01:44:34.941 --> 01:44:35.774
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there's into very large number of </v>

1965
01:44:36.381 --> 01:44:37.070
<v Speaker 10>stories.</v>

1966
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.581
<v Speaker 10>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yes,</v>

1967
01:44:37.581 --> 01:44:38.414
<v Speaker 10>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but the fact that there's enough </v>

1968
01:44:41.331 --> 01:44:42.164
<v Speaker 10>commonality across the class of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the set of all possible stories so that </v>

1969
01:44:44.961 --> 01:44:45.794
<v Speaker 10>we can identify what constitutes a story</v>
<v Speaker 10>and I would say that there's enough </v>

1970
01:44:48.351 --> 01:44:51.800
<v Speaker 10>commonality across the set of all </v>
<v Speaker 10>possible good stories that we can say,</v>

1971
01:44:51.801 --> 01:44:53.210
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>here's a canonical good story,</v>

1972
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:54.163
<v Speaker 10>which is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what you do at the beginning of the </v>

1973
01:44:55.281 --> 01:44:58.700
<v Speaker 10>moral landscape because you say,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this is horrible,</v>

1974
01:44:58.730 --> 01:44:59.563
<v Speaker 10>this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We should move from what's horrible to </v>

1975
01:45:01.431 --> 01:45:02.900
<v Speaker 10>what's good.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Say yes,</v>

1976
01:45:02.901 --> 01:45:03.440
<v Speaker 10>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you've,</v>

1977
01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.230
<v Speaker 10>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you've taken a fragment of the universal</v>

1978
01:45:06.231 --> 01:45:09.530
<v Speaker 10>story and you've made it the axiom of </v>
<v Speaker 10>your moral system,</v>

1979
01:45:09.531 --> 01:45:11.600
<v Speaker 10>which is what you should do it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but,</v>

1980
01:45:11.601 --> 01:45:15.890
<v Speaker 10>but the claim that I think is not </v>
<v Speaker 10>helpful,</v>

1981
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.400
<v Speaker 10>even though I understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is that that's purely a claim of like of</v>

1982
01:45:21.771 --> 01:45:24.140
<v Speaker 10>unmediated fact.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like,</v>

1983
01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:26.090
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there is no need.</v>

1984
01:45:26.630 --> 01:45:30.420
<v Speaker 8>There is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Even facts aren't unmediated facts.</v>

1985
01:45:30.630 --> 01:45:31.463
<v Speaker 8>I mean you can't hand.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't judge something to be factual </v>

1986
01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:36.630
<v Speaker 8>without presupposing the validity of </v>
<v Speaker 8>certain intuitions.</v>

1987
01:45:36.631 --> 01:45:37.351
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1988
01:45:37.351 --> 01:45:40.370
<v Speaker 8>That that causes proceed events,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1989
01:45:40.371 --> 01:45:42.330
<v Speaker 8>so,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or causes precede their effects.</v>

1990
01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:46.020
<v Speaker 8>And those intuitions could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1991
01:45:46.021 --> 01:45:46.854
<v Speaker 8>we could live in a teleological universe</v>
<v Speaker 8>where everything is getting pulled into </v>

1992
01:45:49.111 --> 01:45:51.090
<v Speaker 8>the future by some kind of attractor.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

1993
01:45:51.450 --> 01:45:53.880
<v Speaker 8>And our notion of causation is totally </v>
<v Speaker 8>backwards.</v>

1994
01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.930
<v Speaker 8>That remains to be discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And we have,</v>

1995
01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:02.650
<v Speaker 8>we would use other intuitions to make </v>
<v Speaker 8>that discovery again,</v>

1996
01:46:02.850 --> 01:46:03.683
<v Speaker 8>again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that you do pull yourself up by your </v>

1997
01:46:04.711 --> 01:46:05.544
<v Speaker 8>bootstraps and that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's no branch of science or </v>

1998
01:46:09.781 --> 01:46:13.740
<v Speaker 8>mathematics or anything fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 8>logic that can get away from that.</v>

1999
01:46:14.050 --> 01:46:16.740
<v Speaker 8>But that's another place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But given that picture,</v>

2000
01:46:16.741 --> 01:46:21.510
<v Speaker 8>that doesn't render all intuitions </v>
<v Speaker 8>equally respectable,</v>

2001
01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:23.000
<v Speaker 8>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Someone says,</v>

2002
01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:24.600
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I happen to have an intuition that,</v>

2003
01:46:24.630 --> 01:46:27.840
<v Speaker 8>that Joseph Smith who saw those golden </v>
<v Speaker 8>tablets and they were,</v>

2004
01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:28.770
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2005
01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:29.883
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2006
01:46:29.890 --> 01:46:30.723
<v Speaker 8>in mormonism is true.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's not the sort of intuition we're </v>

2007
01:46:33.121 --> 01:46:33.954
<v Speaker 8>talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your intuition doesn't give you insight </v>

2008
01:46:36.391 --> 01:46:37.100
<v Speaker 8>into history.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We could</v>

2009
01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:38.810
<v Speaker 10>say,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and this would be an elaboration of,</v>

2010
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:39.990
<v Speaker 10>of,</v>
<v Speaker 10>of,</v>

2011
01:46:40.090 --> 01:46:40.923
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Brett's point is that moral intuitions </v>

2012
01:46:45.021 --> 01:46:48.980
<v Speaker 10>of the sort that you're describing have </v>
<v Speaker 10>different zones of relevance.</v>

2013
01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:50.280
<v Speaker 10>So there's some things</v>

2014
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:55.550
<v Speaker 7>that would only work as an intuition in </v>
<v Speaker 7>very delimited areas of time and space.</v>

2015
01:46:56.341 --> 01:46:57.174
<v Speaker 7>Let's say there's a hierarchy of moral </v>
<v Speaker 7>intuitions and the more profound the </v>

2016
01:47:00.181 --> 01:47:01.014
<v Speaker 7>intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the more it works as a universal truth </v>

2017
01:47:02.341 --> 01:47:04.860
<v Speaker 7>across context,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just like in a scientific truth.</v>

2018
01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:06.173
<v Speaker 7>So scientific truth is more profound.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is why the postmodernist readings </v>

2019
01:47:10.231 --> 01:47:11.064
<v Speaker 7>of Thomas Kuhn are wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that the idea that protons are real </v>

2020
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:15.383
<v Speaker 7>is really fundamental because no matter </v>
<v Speaker 7>what span of time and space that you </v>

2021
01:47:18.781 --> 01:47:21.540
<v Speaker 7>pick,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to encounter protons.</v>

2022
01:47:21.690 --> 01:47:24.960
<v Speaker 7>It works everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then with moral intuitions,</v>

2023
01:47:25.110 --> 01:47:25.943
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or moral a priorities you have the same </v>

2024
01:47:27.181 --> 01:47:28.014
<v Speaker 7>issue is some of them are so limited </v>
<v Speaker 7>that they only work here and now and </v>

2025
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:34.530
<v Speaker 7>those are sort of impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 7>low level intuitions,</v>

2026
01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:36.750
<v Speaker 7>a whim even.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But some of them are really,</v>

2027
01:47:36.751 --> 01:47:37.860
<v Speaker 7>really deep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The ones,</v>

2028
01:47:37.890 --> 01:47:38.723
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the one that orients you to make the </v>

2029
01:47:40.711 --> 01:47:43.320
<v Speaker 7>claim that you made in the moral </v>
<v Speaker 7>landscape,</v>

2030
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:47.190
<v Speaker 7>that the hellish story is bad and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>heavenly story is good.</v>

2031
01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:50.700
<v Speaker 7>I would say that's one of the deepest,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most context,</v>

2032
01:47:50.701 --> 01:47:53.820
<v Speaker 7>independent moral intuitions which,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is kind of the claim.</v>

2033
01:47:53.821 --> 01:47:54.490
<v Speaker 7>You make access.</v>

2034
01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:55.323
<v Speaker 8>You claim that as again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>go back to my fundamental concern here </v>

2035
01:47:57.551 --> 01:47:58.384
<v Speaker 8>in the difference with respect to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>difference in how we talk about these </v>

2036
01:48:00.461 --> 01:48:05.461
<v Speaker 8>things to call that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>God is fine.</v>

2037
01:48:05.981 --> 01:48:08.650
<v Speaker 8>That's a god I have no problem with.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2038
01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:09.513
<v Speaker 8>But that's not how most people most of </v>
<v Speaker 8>the time are you using the word and </v>

2039
01:48:12.941 --> 01:48:15.000
<v Speaker 8>there's something misleading about that </v>
<v Speaker 8>and that's.</v>

2040
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:16.460
<v Speaker 10>That worries me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2041
01:48:16.461 --> 01:48:17.294
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if,</v>

2042
01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:21.350
<v Speaker 10>if the claim,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if the claim that you're making is.</v>

2043
01:48:21.530 --> 01:48:26.060
<v Speaker 7>We're all deeply confused about the </v>
<v Speaker 7>nature of divinity and ultimate reality,</v>

2044
01:48:26.061 --> 01:48:27.140
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2045
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:29.060
<v Speaker 10>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Clearly.</v>

2046
01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:31.840
<v Speaker 10>The other thing we agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I also don't disagree.</v>

2047
01:48:31.930 --> 01:48:33.580
<v Speaker 10>I don't disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Look,</v>

2048
01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.473
<v Speaker 10>I've never said I've never made the </v>
<v Speaker 10>claim that what I'm talking about is </v>

2049
01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:42.640
<v Speaker 10>like what other people are talking </v>
<v Speaker 10>about.</v>

2050
01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:43.533
<v Speaker 10>I mean it is in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I've not made that claim so I don't </v>

2051
01:48:46.241 --> 01:48:48.750
<v Speaker 10>see why that's a justifiable criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like,</v>

2052
01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:50.330
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a,</v>

2053
01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:55.340
<v Speaker 8>it's a criticism can the with respect to</v>
<v Speaker 8>the very likely effects of communicating</v>

2054
01:48:56.941 --> 01:48:59.940
<v Speaker 8>in that way because I see the results of</v>
<v Speaker 8>that communication.</v>

2055
01:48:59.941 --> 01:49:00.840
<v Speaker 8>It's a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

2056
01:49:00.841 --> 01:49:02.640
<v Speaker 8>this is going to sound more invidious </v>
<v Speaker 8>than it is,</v>

2057
01:49:02.641 --> 01:49:04.980
<v Speaker 8>but this is the kind of thing that I get</v>
<v Speaker 8>into a Deepak Chopra.</v>

2058
01:49:05.490 --> 01:49:07.500
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Deepak and I agree.</v>

2059
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:10.420
<v Speaker 10>I think it's more invidious than it </v>
<v Speaker 10>sounds actually.</v>

2060
01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:13.263
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're not wearing rhinestone book </v>

2061
01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:16.660
<v Speaker 8>classes with you if you graduate to </v>
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

2062
01:49:16.690 --> 01:49:20.110
<v Speaker 8>We'll have more of a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's.</v>

2063
01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:21.613
<v Speaker 8>Deepak clearly wants to let his audience</v>
<v Speaker 8>believe that everything they're into is </v>

2064
01:49:29.681 --> 01:49:34.681
<v Speaker 8>on some level justifiable by his reading</v>
<v Speaker 8>of quantum spookiness.</v>

2065
01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.473
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's all.</v>

2066
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:37.343
<v Speaker 8>So if you want to go out and just buy a </v>
<v Speaker 8>lot of crystals and think they're going </v>

2067
01:49:41.471 --> 01:49:42.304
<v Speaker 8>to heal you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it has something to do with quantum </v>

2068
01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:47.890
<v Speaker 8>quantum reality.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nothing me know,</v>

2069
01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.470
<v Speaker 8>but saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I,</v>

2070
01:49:49.590 --> 01:49:51.700
<v Speaker 8>I think deeply could say if,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I,</v>

2071
01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.600
<v Speaker 8>if I got his back to the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Deepak could say,</v>

2072
01:49:55.601 --> 01:49:57.400
<v Speaker 8>honestly say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>listen,</v>

2073
01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:00.250
<v Speaker 8>I've never said anything about crystals,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

2074
01:50:00.251 --> 01:50:02.470
<v Speaker 8>I'm not selling crystals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've never said they work,</v>

2075
01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:07.860
<v Speaker 8>but it's the way in which he's failing </v>
<v Speaker 8>to make the clear differentiation.</v>

2076
01:50:08.141 --> 01:50:10.480
<v Speaker 8>The fact that the fact that it takes you</v>
<v Speaker 8>20 minutes</v>

2077
01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:13.330
<v Speaker 4>to admit that there is that</v>

2078
01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.430
<v Speaker 8>a lot of the Bible is filled with </v>
<v Speaker 8>barbaric nonsense.</v>

2079
01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:23.480
<v Speaker 8>It took me 20 minutes to it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'll go to the tape on that.</v>

2080
01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:24.333
<v Speaker 8>These things matter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These things matter and I'm just saying </v>

2081
01:50:27.581 --> 01:50:30.690
<v Speaker 8>it's like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you're.</v>

2082
01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:31.670
<v Speaker 8>If you're</v>

2083
01:50:31.670 --> 01:50:32.503
<v Speaker 5>parish of one or in a parish of 1000 or </v>
<v Speaker 5>a parish of 100,000 but not in the </v>

2084
01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:41.510
<v Speaker 5>parish that has anything in common with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the with the Bible.</v>

2085
01:50:41.511 --> 01:50:42.344
<v Speaker 5>Thumper is in my country who think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus is very likely coming back in </v>

2086
01:50:47.001 --> 01:50:47.834
<v Speaker 5>their lifetime because he never died and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to judge the living and the </v>

2087
01:50:50.721 --> 01:50:55.220
<v Speaker 5>dead and there will be a resurrection </v>
<v Speaker 5>and hell fire and all the rest.</v>

2088
01:50:55.221 --> 01:50:58.040
<v Speaker 5>If that's not the game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're playing at all.</v>

2089
01:50:58.740 --> 01:50:59.573
<v Speaker 8>Own it.</v>

2090
01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:05.810
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are you?</v>

2091
01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:09.220
<v Speaker 4>Why are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are you all applauding about that?</v>

2092
01:51:09.610 --> 01:51:10.190
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what?</v>

2093
01:51:10.190 --> 01:51:11.830
<v Speaker 8>What do you mean to own it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>

2094
01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:12.664
<v Speaker 8>I already made my claim.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like I'm not playing a religious </v>

2095
01:51:14.831 --> 01:51:15.664
<v Speaker 8>fundamentalist game,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so what's all the applause about so I </v>

2096
01:51:18.161 --> 01:51:19.150
<v Speaker 8>don't understand that</v>

2097
01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:23.240
<v Speaker 4>and own it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I was as listened.</v>

2098
01:51:23.730 --> 01:51:24.563
<v Speaker 8>I was as clear as I possibly could be </v>
<v Speaker 8>when I delineated my answer to the </v>

2099
01:51:28.741 --> 01:51:30.300
<v Speaker 8>question.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Some people say,</v>

2100
01:51:30.301 --> 01:51:31.570
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what do you mean by God?</v>

2101
01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:36.180
<v Speaker 8>Somebody asked you if Jesus one </v>
<v Speaker 8>residence second answer,</v>

2102
01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:38.080
<v Speaker 8>but no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well forget it man.</v>

2103
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:41.610
<v Speaker 8>When a women.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think we can actually.</v>

2104
01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:43.360
<v Speaker 8>This is a complicated.</v>

2105
01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:45.100
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to end on.</v>

2106
01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:47.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to end on a note of </v>
<v Speaker 5>acrimony,</v>

2107
01:51:47.530 --> 01:51:48.363
<v Speaker 5>but someone wants to ask you whether you</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought Jesus was literally resurrected </v>

2108
01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:55.270
<v Speaker 5>and you said it would take me 40 hours </v>
<v Speaker 5>to answer that question.</v>

2109
01:51:56.050 --> 01:51:57.000
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

2110
01:51:57.170 --> 01:51:58.003
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the kind of thing I'm responding </v>

2111
01:51:58.811 --> 01:52:00.580
<v Speaker 5>to here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't need to do that.</v>

2112
01:52:00.610 --> 01:52:03.400
<v Speaker 5>If you have a clear cut answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>question,</v>

2113
01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:07.680
<v Speaker 8>I don't have a clear head and if you </v>
<v Speaker 8>don't and if you don't do that,</v>

2114
01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:10.890
<v Speaker 8>that connects with many other things </v>
<v Speaker 8>that we still have to talk about.</v>

2115
01:52:11.070 --> 01:52:12.040
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>definitely.</v>

2116
01:52:12.041 --> 01:52:12.874
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I think because a cause that it </v>

2117
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:19.560
<v Speaker 8>isn't obvious in the biblical account </v>
<v Speaker 8>that Christ was literally resurrected,</v>

2118
01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:21.840
<v Speaker 8>so it's not simple.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

2119
01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:23.850
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but if the question is,</v>

2120
01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:25.560
<v Speaker 8>do you think he let?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's,</v>

2121
01:52:25.590 --> 01:52:27.840
<v Speaker 8>let's put it probabilistically.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean anything's possible.</v>

2122
01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:30.780
<v Speaker 8>I'll tell you that it's possible that he</v>
<v Speaker 8>was physically resurrected.</v>

2123
01:52:30.781 --> 01:52:32.670
<v Speaker 8>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's even pause.</v>

2124
01:52:32.671 --> 01:52:35.010
<v Speaker 8>Wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I did with respect to quantum mechanics,</v>

2125
01:52:35.610 --> 01:52:38.910
<v Speaker 8>the point is it would take me 40 hours </v>
<v Speaker 8>to answer the question.</v>

2126
01:52:38.911 --> 01:52:42.360
<v Speaker 8>I didn't say that he was.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How's this for an answer?</v>

2127
01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:47.430
<v Speaker 8>Almost certainly not</v>
<v Speaker 8>you.</v>

2128
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:50.140
<v Speaker 8>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's,</v>

2129
01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:51.490
<v Speaker 8>what's wrong with that answer?</v>

2130
01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:55.813
<v Speaker 4>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I know what's wrong with that </v>

2131
01:52:57.171 --> 01:52:58.004
<v Speaker 4>answer.</v>

2132
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:02.120
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's a,</v>

2133
01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:02.953
<v Speaker 10>it's a financer and people have been </v>
<v Speaker 10>giving that answer for a very long </v>

2134
01:53:05.391 --> 01:53:06.990
<v Speaker 10>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but the idea doesn't seem</v>

2135
01:53:07.050 --> 01:53:07.883
<v Speaker 9>to go away.</v>

2136
01:53:08.650 --> 01:53:11.170
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so that evidence of what exactly.</v>

2137
01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.280
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

2138
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:17.200
<v Speaker 10>I can tell you one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's an evidence of deep idea.</v>

2139
01:53:18.110 --> 01:53:20.690
<v Speaker 8>Let this be the doorway to our next </v>
<v Speaker 8>three hour conversation.</v>

2140
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:23.180
<v Speaker 8>Are they clearly were not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So sure we have.</v>

2141
01:53:23.181 --> 01:53:24.790
<v Speaker 8>We have 10 minutes left.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

2142
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:27.290
<v Speaker 8>Well then let's answer that question in </v>
<v Speaker 8>10 minutes.</v>

2143
01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:29.590
<v Speaker 4>So wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to trust me,</v>

2144
01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:30.780
<v Speaker 10>me,</v>
<v Speaker 10>hear you.</v>

2145
01:53:31.110 --> 01:53:33.030
<v Speaker 10>For whatever reason decided I should </v>
<v Speaker 10>moderate,</v>

2146
01:53:33.031 --> 01:53:35.340
<v Speaker 10>so I want you to trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>For one thing,</v>

2147
01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:37.370
<v Speaker 10>you.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You've been doing yeoman's work am.</v>

2148
01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:39.180
<v Speaker 10>I really would like to answer that </v>
<v Speaker 10>question,</v>

2149
01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:40.293
<v Speaker 10>but I'm trying to figure out if people </v>
<v Speaker 10>seem to think that I'm trying to evade </v>

2150
01:53:44.071 --> 01:53:46.500
<v Speaker 10>the question.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like not evading the question.</v>

2151
01:53:46.501 --> 01:53:48.180
<v Speaker 10>I'm trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a really.</v>

2152
01:53:48.330 --> 01:53:51.960
<v Speaker 10>People have been arguing about this for </v>
<v Speaker 10>2000 years.</v>

2153
01:53:52.170 --> 01:53:53.003
<v Speaker 10>It's like it's not.</v>

2154
01:53:53.590 --> 01:53:54.423
<v Speaker 8>That's a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's a symptom of the effect of </v>

2155
01:53:56.811 --> 01:53:59.480
<v Speaker 8>religious dogmatism for $2,000.</v>

2156
01:53:59.730 --> 01:54:00.563
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's not.</v>

2157
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:02.960
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's certainly a symptom of that.</v>

2158
01:54:02.961 --> 01:54:05.300
<v Speaker 10>It's also partly a symptom of the idea.</v>

2159
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:09.470
<v Speaker 9>The resurrection of Jesus is clearly an </v>
<v Speaker 9>important question,</v>

2160
01:54:09.471 --> 01:54:13.280
<v Speaker 9>but you've raised a much bigger and more</v>
<v Speaker 9>pressing question for the audience,</v>

2161
01:54:13.281 --> 01:54:16.040
<v Speaker 9>which is whether or not God cares </v>
<v Speaker 9>whether they masturbate.</v>

2162
01:54:16.130 --> 01:54:16.963
<v Speaker 9>So</v>

2163
01:54:18.330 --> 01:54:21.330
<v Speaker 8>I actually think if we pursue that </v>
<v Speaker 8>answer,</v>

2164
01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:22.253
<v Speaker 8>that we will actually wrap this up in a </v>
<v Speaker 8>way that you want to end this on </v>

2165
01:54:25.441 --> 01:54:30.441
<v Speaker 8>masturbation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think we owe it to them.</v>

2166
01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:34.673
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2167
01:54:36.690 --> 01:54:38.800
<v Speaker 8>give me a little leash that the floor is</v>
<v Speaker 8>yours.</v>

2168
01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:39.993
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

2169
01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:43.540
<v Speaker 8>How did I end up here?</v>
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>

2170
01:54:44.050 --> 01:54:45.880
<v Speaker 8>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>here's the question.</v>

2171
01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:47.080
<v Speaker 8>Let's just figure out if we</v>

2172
01:54:47.210 --> 01:54:51.950
<v Speaker 9>can determine why God might care if you </v>
<v Speaker 9>masturbate.</v>

2173
01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:55.130
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>So let's suppose that we have a story,</v>

2174
01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:58.130
<v Speaker 9>a heuristic of some kind that stands in </v>
<v Speaker 9>for something.</v>

2175
01:54:58.730 --> 01:55:03.730
<v Speaker 9>And the story is God is watching.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He sees you always.</v>

2176
01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:06.890
<v Speaker 9>He doesn't want you masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So don't you dare.</v>

2177
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:08.660
<v Speaker 9>What happens,</v>

2178
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:13.290
<v Speaker 8>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2179
01:55:14.370 --> 01:55:19.210
<v Speaker 8>Well it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's rubbed rather ineffectual idea.</v>

2180
01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:21.390
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2181
01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:23.010
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that story,</v>

2182
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.863
<v Speaker 8>but I think the reality was was that you</v>
<v Speaker 8>had people masturbating and feeling </v>

2183
01:55:28.981 --> 01:55:29.814
<v Speaker 8>terrible about it and you had a whole </v>
<v Speaker 8>layer of sexual neurosis that we've got </v>

2184
01:55:33.031 --> 01:55:35.850
<v Speaker 8>grafted onto human psychology </v>
<v Speaker 8>unnecessarily.</v>

2185
01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:40.990
<v Speaker 8>Christianity has a certain type apology </v>
<v Speaker 8>of sexual hang up or a which,</v>

2186
01:55:41.170 --> 01:55:42.010
<v Speaker 8>which,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2187
01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:45.330
<v Speaker 8>the contracts have.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So if I understand you correctly,</v>

2188
01:55:45.331 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 8>you are agreeing that a certain amount,</v>
<v Speaker 8>certain number of people will masturbate</v>

2189
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:52.200
<v Speaker 8>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some of them battling the priesthood and</v>

2190
01:55:52.201 --> 01:55:54.540
<v Speaker 8>rape little boys.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean that is a piece.</v>

2191
01:55:54.541 --> 01:55:55.374
<v Speaker 8>There is stick with the topic,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so a certain number of people will have </v>

2192
01:55:58.321 --> 01:55:59.760
<v Speaker 8>masturbated.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They will have thought.</v>

2193
01:55:59.850 --> 01:56:01.260
<v Speaker 8>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's the same topic.</v>

2194
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:02.740
<v Speaker 8>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

2195
01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:03.793
<v Speaker 8>the taboos around masturbation,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the taboos around sexuality prior to </v>

2196
01:56:08.941 --> 01:56:10.650
<v Speaker 8>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the taboo around divorce,</v>

2197
01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:13.560
<v Speaker 8>all of the taboo,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Taboola browned out of wedlock birth.</v>

2198
01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:14.693
<v Speaker 8>The ideal of celibacy in the priesthood.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All of that is a is a just a diabolical </v>

2199
01:56:19.621 --> 01:56:23.660
<v Speaker 8>machine of needless sexual conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 8>misery.</v>

2200
01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:24.503
<v Speaker 8>Hold on.</v>

2201
01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:26.723
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2202
01:56:27.410 --> 01:56:29.820
<v Speaker 8>You have to take.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How's the.</v>

2203
01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:32.460
<v Speaker 8>How's the whole flood of pornography </v>
<v Speaker 8>thing working out?</v>

2204
01:56:32.461 --> 01:56:33.294
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2205
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:35.820
<v Speaker 8>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I will grant you that.</v>

2206
01:56:35.821 --> 01:56:36.654
<v Speaker 8>There is some interpretation that takes </v>
<v Speaker 8>supernatural principles and magic and </v>

2207
01:56:42.481 --> 01:56:44.940
<v Speaker 8>other worldliness out of the equation </v>
<v Speaker 8>here.</v>

2208
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.730
<v Speaker 8>That gets you some wisdom in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>heuristic.</v>

2209
01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.470
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you're masturbating all the time,</v>

2210
01:56:49.471 --> 01:56:50.304
<v Speaker 8>you're not satisfying your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your monogamous relationship with your </v>

2211
01:56:52.831 --> 01:56:53.730
<v Speaker 8>wife or husband.</v>

2212
01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:55.760
<v Speaker 9>We wouldn't even need to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let's just.</v>

2213
01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:56.653
<v Speaker 9>You're not procreating and we agree that</v>
<v Speaker 9>a certain amount of masturbation was </v>

2214
01:57:00.171 --> 01:57:02.540
<v Speaker 9>present,</v>
<v Speaker 9>was prevented by that story,</v>

2215
01:57:02.541 --> 01:57:06.320
<v Speaker 9>which made people fear the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 9>of them engaging in it,</v>

2216
01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:11.800
<v Speaker 9>which would result in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm pretty sure less less masturbation,</v>

2217
01:57:11.871 --> 01:57:12.704
<v Speaker 9>which means that in seeking a release </v>
<v Speaker 9>which we are physiologically programmed </v>

2218
01:57:17.690 --> 01:57:18.523
<v Speaker 9>to seek,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one might end up looking in a more </v>

2219
01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:24.320
<v Speaker 9>urgent fashion for a mate.</v>

2220
01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:25.920
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's.</v>

2221
01:57:26.410 --> 01:57:28.770
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we going to enforce monogamy is a no.</v>

2222
01:57:29.130 --> 01:57:29.963
<v Speaker 8>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying to take you somewhere I </v>

2223
01:57:31.371 --> 01:57:32.350
<v Speaker 8>think.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think there is</v>

2224
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:33.303
<v Speaker 9>way that we can rescue some important </v>
<v Speaker 9>part of what both of you were saying </v>

2225
01:57:36.781 --> 01:57:39.690
<v Speaker 9>that can now be reconciled and then </v>
<v Speaker 9>there's a bitter pill for each of you.</v>

2226
01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:42.360
<v Speaker 9>I mean that's just the way this looks to</v>
<v Speaker 9>me.</v>

2227
01:57:42.570 --> 01:57:43.403
<v Speaker 9>So if we can agree that this makes sense</v>
<v Speaker 9>actually as a fitness enhancing </v>

2228
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:48.383
<v Speaker 9>adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that this story would result in people </v>

2229
01:57:50.131 --> 01:57:53.070
<v Speaker 9>behaving in a way that might result in </v>
<v Speaker 9>the marrying early,</v>

2230
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:56.580
<v Speaker 9>might result in them reproducing earlier</v>
<v Speaker 9>than they would otherwise.</v>

2231
01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:59.430
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Then we can understand it as mechanistic</v>

2232
01:57:59.431 --> 01:58:00.264
<v Speaker 9>and we can understand what you said that</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know maybe God would care about </v>

2233
01:58:03.781 --> 01:58:04.614
<v Speaker 9>whether or not people masturbate because</v>
<v Speaker 9>God is a metaphor for some set of </v>

2234
01:58:08.101 --> 01:58:10.440
<v Speaker 9>stories that gets you to behave in an </v>
<v Speaker 9>adaptive fashion,</v>

2235
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:16.100
<v Speaker 9>but the point for you then would be that</v>
<v Speaker 9>Sam is arguing with reason.</v>

2236
01:58:18.661 --> 01:58:22.740
<v Speaker 9>We can decide whether or not to employ </v>
<v Speaker 9>this story at this moment,</v>

2237
01:58:22.741 --> 01:58:23.574
<v Speaker 9>whether it's a good idea for us to </v>
<v Speaker 9>urgently reproduce as quickly as </v>

2238
01:58:27.301 --> 01:58:28.620
<v Speaker 9>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which for example,</v>

2239
01:58:28.621 --> 01:58:31.170
<v Speaker 9>increases the size of the population of </v>
<v Speaker 9>the planet.</v>

2240
01:58:31.171 --> 01:58:35.340
<v Speaker 9>Whereas delaying reproduction keeps the </v>
<v Speaker 9>rate of population growth down and might</v>

2241
01:58:35.341 --> 01:58:36.174
<v Speaker 9>be a better choice for a moment in </v>
<v Speaker 9>history when we have seven and a half </v>

2242
01:58:38.910 --> 01:58:42.430
<v Speaker 9>billion people on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So in some sense,</v>

2243
01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:47.560
<v Speaker 8>what I think I see is the religious </v>
<v Speaker 8>story itself make some kind of sense.</v>

2244
01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:48.453
<v Speaker 8>If you adhere to it in a manner that you</v>
<v Speaker 8>are obligated and I have no tools with </v>

2245
01:58:52.451 --> 01:58:55.150
<v Speaker 8>which to question it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then you will miss the fact that at this</v>

2246
01:58:55.151 --> 01:58:56.650
<v Speaker 8>moment you might want to throw that </v>
<v Speaker 8>story.</v>

2247
01:58:56.651 --> 01:58:58.190
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>For the problem is it doesn't make sense</v>

2248
01:58:58.191 --> 01:59:00.520
<v Speaker 8>and this is a problem with these </v>
<v Speaker 8>heuristics in general,</v>

2249
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.863
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't make sense for the right </v>
<v Speaker 8>reason and that's why it's not a </v>

2250
01:59:04.931 --> 01:59:07.930
<v Speaker 8>reliable guide given other changes in </v>
<v Speaker 8>the world,</v>

2251
01:59:07.931 --> 01:59:08.764
<v Speaker 8>but with everything changing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you want to be making sense for the </v>

2252
01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:14.140
<v Speaker 8>right reason.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't want it so useful.</v>

2253
01:59:14.141 --> 01:59:17.440
<v Speaker 8>Fictions have to be retired at a certain</v>
<v Speaker 8>point.</v>

2254
01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:20.440
<v Speaker 8>Useful truths stay true.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean if you,</v>

2255
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:21.303
<v Speaker 8>because they're based on your engagement</v>
<v Speaker 8>with reality and so to take your point </v>

2256
01:59:23.441 --> 01:59:25.930
<v Speaker 8>about pornography,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which I think is totally valid,</v>

2257
01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:26.910
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we,</v>

2258
01:59:26.910 --> 01:59:27.743
<v Speaker 8>you could have a completely rational </v>
<v Speaker 8>conversation in terms of human </v>

2259
01:59:31.511 --> 01:59:32.344
<v Speaker 8>psychology and sociology and what you </v>
<v Speaker 8>want society to look like about the </v>

2260
01:59:36.761 --> 01:59:39.450
<v Speaker 8>corrosive nature of pornography,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

2261
01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:41.620
<v Speaker 8>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't have to be a victorian,</v>

2262
01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:42.693
<v Speaker 8>a prude to worry that there might be </v>
<v Speaker 8>something wrong with the infinite </v>

2263
01:59:47.890 --> 01:59:52.690
<v Speaker 8>availability of pornography to 13 year </v>
<v Speaker 8>olds and above.</v>

2264
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:53.200
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

2265
01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:54.033
<v Speaker 8>that's A.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what what's generation of </v>

2266
01:59:56.171 --> 01:59:58.900
<v Speaker 8>human beings were raising in the current</v>
<v Speaker 8>environment.</v>

2267
01:59:58.970 --> 02:00:01.810
<v Speaker 8>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's quite worrisome actually,</v>

2268
02:00:02.170 --> 02:00:06.760
<v Speaker 8>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't have to invoke mythology to do</v>

2269
02:00:06.761 --> 02:00:09.790
<v Speaker 8>that and I would say the temptation to </v>
<v Speaker 8>invoke mythologist said,</v>

2270
02:00:09.791 --> 02:00:10.470
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you actually</v>

2271
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:11.340
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>
<v Speaker 10>how do you do it?</v>

2272
02:00:11.341 --> 02:00:13.350
<v Speaker 10>Poseidon really gets pissed off when you</v>
<v Speaker 10>master.</v>

2273
02:00:13.710 --> 02:00:15.450
<v Speaker 10>How do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 10>How do you do it?</v>

2274
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:16.663
<v Speaker 10>You don't have any effects to have no </v>
<v Speaker 10>mechanism for controlling about the </v>

2275
02:00:19.801 --> 02:00:20.530
<v Speaker 10>effects,</v>

2276
02:00:20.530 --> 02:00:21.363
<v Speaker 8>human relationships and your own mind </v>
<v Speaker 8>and your own intention and the way you </v>

2277
02:00:23.651 --> 02:00:24.410
<v Speaker 8>view others.</v>

2278
02:00:24.410 --> 02:00:27.690
<v Speaker 10>That barely works for sex ed.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It barely works for condom education.</v>

2279
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:28.863
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what was already works like those sorts </v>

2280
02:00:30.301 --> 02:00:31.134
<v Speaker 10>of educational interventions to stop </v>
<v Speaker 10>that kind of fundamental behavior have </v>

2281
02:00:33.571 --> 02:00:38.571
<v Speaker 10>very little effect when people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 10>nearly as amenable to behavioral changes</v>

2282
02:00:38.701 --> 02:00:42.120
<v Speaker 10>as a consequence of rational educational</v>
<v Speaker 10>interventions as you might hope.</v>

2283
02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.231
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and that's.</v>

2284
02:00:43.231 --> 02:00:46.410
<v Speaker 10>That's part and parcel of the very broad</v>
<v Speaker 10>clinical literature.</v>

2285
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:47.623
<v Speaker 10>They're not as.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They're not as amenable to dogmatic </v>

2286
02:00:50.071 --> 02:00:52.600
<v Speaker 10>intrusions either.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean they are and living.</v>

2287
02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:55.300
<v Speaker 10>That might be a problem and neuro </v>
<v Speaker 10>problems with no because.</v>

2288
02:00:55.450 --> 02:00:56.010
<v Speaker 10>Because</v>

2289
02:00:56.010 --> 02:00:58.090
<v Speaker 8>there again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is just</v>

2290
02:01:01.150 --> 02:01:01.983
<v Speaker 8>like the problem is that this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even if you could make the case that a </v>

2291
02:01:09.401 --> 02:01:14.401
<v Speaker 8>dogmatic at attachment to one or another</v>
<v Speaker 8>religion was better,</v>

2292
02:01:14.530 --> 02:01:18.340
<v Speaker 8>all things considered than being a </v>
<v Speaker 8>secular,</v>

2293
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:21.340
<v Speaker 8>truly secular and truly rational,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

2294
02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.373
<v Speaker 8>It's vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's vulnerable to every next thing we </v>

2295
02:01:27.371 --> 02:01:28.210
<v Speaker 8>find out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

2296
02:01:28.211 --> 02:01:32.770
<v Speaker 8>that's why it's like you could have said</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you go back 200 years before the germ</v>

2297
02:01:32.771 --> 02:01:34.660
<v Speaker 8>theory of disease,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you could have said,</v>

2298
02:01:34.661 --> 02:01:37.080
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all of these dietary taboos and,</v>

2299
02:01:37.110 --> 02:01:38.460
<v Speaker 8>and taboos around,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2300
02:01:38.461 --> 02:01:42.080
<v Speaker 8>hand washing and clint foot washing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's actually very wise.</v>

2301
02:01:42.081 --> 02:01:46.820
<v Speaker 8>The wisdom of the germ theory of disease</v>
<v Speaker 8>was sort of built into our scripture and</v>

2302
02:01:46.821 --> 02:01:47.654
<v Speaker 8>people were survived.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a kind of differential level of </v>

2303
02:01:49.071 --> 02:01:51.400
<v Speaker 8>survival based on those who really </v>
<v Speaker 8>adhere to these,</v>

2304
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:54.470
<v Speaker 8>these practices and those who didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

2305
02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:59.270
<v Speaker 8>but it one,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's blind to the actual variables.</v>

2306
02:01:59.271 --> 02:02:02.660
<v Speaker 8>Like is there's nothing special about </v>
<v Speaker 8>shellfish necessarily or there's nothing</v>

2307
02:02:02.661 --> 02:02:06.200
<v Speaker 8>special about pork necessarily or </v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever the example is.</v>

2308
02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:09.380
<v Speaker 8>And once you get the actual variables in</v>
<v Speaker 8>hand,</v>

2309
02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:10.513
<v Speaker 8>then the whole edifice comes crashing </v>
<v Speaker 8>down and then you really just want to </v>

2310
02:02:12.921 --> 02:02:13.440
<v Speaker 8>understand that.</v>

2311
02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.370
<v Speaker 10>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Does that work?</v>

2312
02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:15.480
<v Speaker 10>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know if.</v>

2313
02:02:15.570 --> 02:02:16.403
<v Speaker 10>I don't know if the whole edifice comes </v>
<v Speaker 10>crashing down and it isn't clear to me </v>

2314
02:02:19.261 --> 02:02:20.094
<v Speaker 10>that you want to claim that because one </v>
<v Speaker 10>of the things you did say in the moral </v>

2315
02:02:22.951 --> 02:02:25.140
<v Speaker 10>landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and I think this is associated with your</v>

2316
02:02:25.141 --> 02:02:28.800
<v Speaker 10>interest in spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is that there is some baby mixed in with</v>

2317
02:02:28.801 --> 02:02:31.590
<v Speaker 10>the bathwater.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And the question is how do we,</v>

2318
02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:33.840
<v Speaker 10>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 10>how do we distill that out?</v>

2319
02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:37.830
<v Speaker 10>And the objections that you're raising </v>
<v Speaker 10>are the objections that are,</v>

2320
02:02:37.831 --> 02:02:40.350
<v Speaker 10>look how difficult it is to do the </v>
<v Speaker 10>distillation.</v>

2321
02:02:40.351 --> 02:02:40.951
<v Speaker 10>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

2322
02:02:40.951 --> 02:02:41.784
<v Speaker 10>absolutely man.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And stuff like I'm a photo of the </v>

2323
02:02:43.501 --> 02:02:44.334
<v Speaker 10>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think you enlightenment types and I </v>

2324
02:02:46.161 --> 02:02:46.994
<v Speaker 10>put pinker in the same camp and </v>
<v Speaker 10>radically overestimate the degree to </v>

2325
02:02:49.471 --> 02:02:51.440
<v Speaker 10>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That was a cause of sweet.</v>

2326
02:02:51.441 --> 02:02:52.274
<v Speaker 10>It's like everyone was barbaric and </v>
<v Speaker 10>superstitious until 1750 and some </v>

2327
02:02:55.681 --> 02:02:58.980
<v Speaker 10>miracle occurred and now we're all in </v>
<v Speaker 10>what we all became enlightened.</v>

2328
02:02:58.981 --> 02:02:59.814
<v Speaker 10>Like there was</v>

2329
02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:02.550
<v Speaker 8>the developmental habit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean with this,</v>

2330
02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:03.513
<v Speaker 8>hence,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hence to are complaining about the </v>

2331
02:03:05.081 --> 02:03:05.914
<v Speaker 8>problem and most of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 8>most of the world hasn't had the </v>

2332
02:03:08.081 --> 02:03:08.980
<v Speaker 8>enlightenment true</v>

2333
02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:11.990
<v Speaker 10>look.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I no folded the enlightenment,</v>

2334
02:03:11.991 --> 02:03:12.824
<v Speaker 10>but I think that it had a lengthy </v>
<v Speaker 10>developmental history that is radically </v>

2335
02:03:15.741 --> 02:03:19.160
<v Speaker 10>underplayed by the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 10>who grounded purely in rationality</v>

2336
02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:20.053
<v Speaker 8>is clearly still developing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My point is we we should be able to </v>

2337
02:03:23.671 --> 02:03:24.504
<v Speaker 8>agree that having a worldview guided by </v>
<v Speaker 8>a continuous honest engagement with </v>

2338
02:03:34.171 --> 02:03:35.004
<v Speaker 8>reality and so far as we can apprehend </v>
<v Speaker 8>it is better than having a worldview </v>

2339
02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:42.143
<v Speaker 8>solidified or anchored to unchanging </v>
<v Speaker 8>ideas that were born of people who had </v>

2340
02:03:49.831 --> 02:03:50.664
<v Speaker 8>none of our present tools.</v>
<v Speaker 8>None of our present insights into </v>

2341
02:03:53.221 --> 02:03:54.054
<v Speaker 8>anything.</v>

2342
02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:55.270
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it depends on.</v>

2343
02:03:55.330 --> 02:03:58.300
<v Speaker 10>It depends on the principals.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It depends on the principals.</v>

2344
02:03:58.301 --> 02:04:01.690
<v Speaker 10>Like I would say there are situations </v>
<v Speaker 10>where that clearly applies,</v>

2345
02:04:01.691 --> 02:04:04.300
<v Speaker 10>but I think there are broad principles </v>
<v Speaker 10>and again,</v>

2346
02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:07.950
<v Speaker 10>we should probably stop with this.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think you have out there because I'm,</v>

2347
02:04:08.010 --> 02:04:09.580
<v Speaker 10>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm starting to get tired.</v>

2348
02:04:09.581 --> 02:04:11.650
<v Speaker 10>I'm sure everyone else in here is </v>
<v Speaker 10>starting to get tired.</v>

2349
02:04:12.370 --> 02:04:13.203
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm starting to get tired anyways and I </v>

2350
02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:17.350
<v Speaker 10>mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

2351
02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:19.520
<v Speaker 10>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there are principles,</v>

2352
02:04:19.521 --> 02:04:20.354
<v Speaker 10>there are higher order principles of the</v>
<v Speaker 10>sort that I described that you also </v>

2353
02:04:23.111 --> 02:04:25.210
<v Speaker 10>appeared to rely on in the moral </v>
<v Speaker 10>landscape,</v>

2354
02:04:25.211 --> 02:04:26.044
<v Speaker 10>the idea of these profound moral </v>
<v Speaker 10>intuitions and so that's what I'm after </v>

2355
02:04:29.951 --> 02:04:30.784
<v Speaker 10>is what are these profound moral </v>
<v Speaker 10>intuitions and what is their source and </v>

2356
02:04:34.590 --> 02:04:38.760
<v Speaker 10>like I'm also perfectly willing to make </v>
<v Speaker 10>the claim and have in fact in,</v>

2357
02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:42.540
<v Speaker 10>in detail that these moral intuitions </v>
<v Speaker 10>see that this is a place where we differ</v>

2358
02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:43.020
<v Speaker 10>a little bit.</v>

2359
02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:45.870
<v Speaker 10>It's like maybe we can go here tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 10>night.</v>

2360
02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:50.760
<v Speaker 10>See,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it seems to me that you,</v>

2361
02:04:50.810 --> 02:04:51.643
<v Speaker 10>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>for you and your argument is the facts </v>

2362
02:04:53.251 --> 02:04:54.084
<v Speaker 10>are laying out there and you can extract</v>
<v Speaker 10>out value from them and we already </v>

2363
02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:57.953
<v Speaker 10>described why you want to do that </v>
<v Speaker 10>because you want to at least not move </v>

2364
02:05:01.711 --> 02:05:02.544
<v Speaker 10>into the nihilistic direction and you </v>
<v Speaker 10>want to ground them in some sort of </v>

2365
02:05:04.651 --> 02:05:06.750
<v Speaker 10>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like fair enough.</v>

2366
02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:10.830
<v Speaker 10>But the thing is is that the facts as </v>
<v Speaker 10>they are,</v>

2367
02:05:10.831 --> 02:05:12.450
<v Speaker 10>have been around for a very,</v>
<v Speaker 10>very,</v>

2368
02:05:12.451 --> 02:05:13.650
<v Speaker 10>very,</v>
<v Speaker 10>very long time,</v>

2369
02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:14.513
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Let's say three and a half billion </v>

2370
02:05:15.481 --> 02:05:17.340
<v Speaker 10>years,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the entire expanse of life,</v>

2371
02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:21.240
<v Speaker 10>and it's the operation of those facts on</v>
<v Speaker 10>life that is produced,</v>

2372
02:05:21.241 --> 02:05:22.074
<v Speaker 10>the a priori implicit interpretive </v>
<v Speaker 10>structures that guide our interaction </v>

2373
02:05:26.521 --> 02:05:27.354
<v Speaker 10>with the facts and those a priority </v>
<v Speaker 10>implicit structures that have emerged </v>

2374
02:05:30.361 --> 02:05:31.194
<v Speaker 10>out of this evolutionary course,</v>
<v Speaker 10>have a structure that mediates between </v>

2375
02:05:34.861 --> 02:05:38.430
<v Speaker 10>us and the facts that cannot be derived </v>
<v Speaker 10>from the facts at hand.</v>

2376
02:05:40.230 --> 02:05:41.063
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so then the question is what is that </v>

2377
02:05:42.451 --> 02:05:45.300
<v Speaker 10>structure?</v>
<v Speaker 10>And it's in both of our interests to get</v>

2378
02:05:45.301 --> 02:05:46.134
<v Speaker 10>that right,</v>
<v Speaker 10>because you use that as the source of </v>

2379
02:05:47.731 --> 02:05:50.070
<v Speaker 10>moral intuitions like right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Agreed.</v>

2380
02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:52.920
<v Speaker 10>That's the source of moral intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So and</v>

2381
02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:54.433
<v Speaker 1>Clint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly what we need to table this for </v>

2382
02:05:55.491 --> 02:05:57.570
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a good guys.</v>

2383
02:05:57.590 --> 02:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to interrupt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys.</v>

2384
02:05:59.271 --> 02:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Let's give Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris and Bret Weinstein.</v>

2385
02:06:02.691 --> 02:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>

2386
02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:11.740
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
