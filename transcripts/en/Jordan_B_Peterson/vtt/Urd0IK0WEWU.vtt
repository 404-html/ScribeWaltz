1
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.020
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to start off this boy though.</v>

3
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 2>You introducing yourself a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling us about your general work,</v>

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.653
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've talked a lot about faculty </v>

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:14.934
<v Speaker 2>freedom recently and I'm wondering if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you want to talk a little bit </v>

6
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:17.994
<v Speaker 2>about what you see as the ideal </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between a university and </v>

7
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 2>its faculty members?</v>

8
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.893
<v Speaker 3>I think in many ways the best thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the university to do with its faculty </v>

10
00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:30.844
<v Speaker 3>members is to leave them alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean that in the best possible </v>

11
00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:35.344
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was actually one of the </v>

12
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:39.340
<v Speaker 3>things I taught here from 93 to 98 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things,</v>

13
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have the same relationship I would</v>

14
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 3>say with the university at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>University of Toronto,</v>

15
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 3>is that the universities go to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of trouble to identify</v>

16
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:50.344
<v Speaker 3>promising people in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of their research capability </v>

17
00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 3>from all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And generally speaking,</v>

18
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.853
<v Speaker 3>if you identify promising people your </v>
<v Speaker 3>best bet as a manager is to stay out of </v>

19
00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 3>their way now and to remove obstacles </v>
<v Speaker 3>from their,</v>

20
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 3>from their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from their movement forward.</v>

21
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the universities do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>credible job of that.</v>

22
00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Although my sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

23
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.273
<v Speaker 3>over the last few decades has been that </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly there are more impediments </v>

24
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 3>placed in the path of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of research.</v>

25
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.573
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that with the multiplication </v>

26
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:25.870
<v Speaker 3>of the powers of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of institutional review boards,</v>

27
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethics committees,</v>

28
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 3>which have vastly overreached there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there,</v>

29
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.910
<v Speaker 3>they're reasonable powers and they slow </v>
<v Speaker 3>things down.</v>

30
00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 3>And that's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're dealing with people who are,</v>

31
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.220
<v Speaker 3>are conducting research into important </v>
<v Speaker 3>topics,</v>

32
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.430
<v Speaker 3>then you want to do everything you </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly can to let them move forward as</v>

33
00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:43.264
<v Speaker 3>rapidly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In what ways do you think these </v>

34
00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:45.754
<v Speaker 3>institutional review boards or these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethics committees had particularly </v>

35
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 3>damage the process where the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 3>research research?</v>

36
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there are times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

37
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:55.144
<v Speaker 3>do you have any examples in mind of when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think they've overreached their </v>

38
00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:58.300
<v Speaker 3>power?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

39
00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 3>the rate they regulate think your mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>for</v>

40
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 2>I gotta ask him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one's not on yet.</v>

41
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well let's find it.</v>

42
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.043
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

43
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 4>That's better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.881
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can hear me.</v>

45
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 4>Which at least in principle should be an</v>
<v Speaker 4>improvement.</v>

46
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

47
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.291
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes,</v>

48
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 4>that's much better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.921
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It in,</v>

50
00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 4>in the social sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

51
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 4>the institutional review boards insist </v>
<v Speaker 4>upon reviewing the use of questionnaires</v>

52
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 4>in research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is,</v>

53
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:39.430
<v Speaker 4>is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not helpful.</v>

54
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.260
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Questionnaires aren't dangerous and they</v>

55
00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.094
<v Speaker 4>have no real policies set in place to </v>
<v Speaker 4>determine the difference between </v>

56
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.723
<v Speaker 4>dangerous research and the normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous that people expose them to </v>

57
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 4>cells on to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a daily basis.</v>

58
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

59
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.073
<v Speaker 4>and they've certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the institutional review boards have </v>

60
00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:56.980
<v Speaker 4>certainly slow down the work in my lab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

61
00:02:56.981 --> 00:02:57.814
<v Speaker 4>and made it much more onerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to do a tremendous amount of </v>

62
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:00.964
<v Speaker 4>writing and justification for this </v>
<v Speaker 4>study's long before they're even </v>

63
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:03.664
<v Speaker 4>undertaken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then also to do a fair bit of </v>

64
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 4>paperwork to keep up with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentation.</v>

65
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 4>And I don't find that the least bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>useful.</v>

66
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:10.204
<v Speaker 4>And I know that in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the institutional review boards domains </v>

67
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 4>of power being cut back now because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>complaints,</v>

68
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 4>primarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly,</v>

69
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:18.994
<v Speaker 4>primary from the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>primarily from the granting agencies </v>

70
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.753
<v Speaker 4>because they're adding to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unnecessary expense that's associated </v>

71
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:25.834
<v Speaker 4>with research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in the university should the </v>

72
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:29.914
<v Speaker 4>university administration fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists to serve the faculty and the </v>

73
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:33.874
<v Speaker 4>students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and probably the students first and the </v>

74
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:36.094
<v Speaker 4>faculty second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But increasingly I see that the </v>

75
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 4>administration is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is multiplying out of control and,</v>

76
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 4>and that's quite well documented in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of overall cost and some of that's</v>

77
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 4>driven by legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's not,</v>

78
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 4>it's not something that's necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>intrinsic to the administration itself,</v>

79
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 4>but that's one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving the spiraling up ever,</v>

80
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.380
<v Speaker 4>ever upward spiring of tuition costs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So aside from research ethics boards,</v>

81
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 4>Institutional Review Boards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ethics committees,</v>

82
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.023
<v Speaker 4>do you think that there are other ways </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the administration has interfered </v>

83
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 4>with your work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly?</v>

84
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.733
<v Speaker 4>You've recently come under fire by some </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration at the University of </v>

85
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Toronto for certain controversial views </v>
<v Speaker 4>you hold.</v>

86
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.263
<v Speaker 4>You mentioned that you think the </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration's primary obligation </v>

87
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 4>should be to its students and then it </v>
<v Speaker 4>should also serve as faculty.</v>

88
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.733
<v Speaker 4>Do you see the administration using that</v>
<v Speaker 4>mission properly when they try to talk </v>

89
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 4>to faculty about certain statements that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've made,</v>

90
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 4>or do you think that's also an overreach</v>
<v Speaker 4>of their power?</v>

91
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.683
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it reflects a more general </v>

92
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 4>societal confusion about just exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>what our priorities are.</v>

93
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.923
<v Speaker 4>I made a video back in September stating</v>
<v Speaker 4>my objections to the mandated use of a </v>

94
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:50.614
<v Speaker 4>certain category of Pronoun that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>object to mostly on the grounds that I </v>

95
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:55.534
<v Speaker 4>felt that the government had no right </v>
<v Speaker 4>compelling people's speech and also </v>

96
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 4>because personally I didn't want to use </v>
<v Speaker 4>the pronouns that were being put forward</v>

97
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:08.521
<v Speaker 4>by people I regard as holding up </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophical and political ethos that I</v>

98
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.560
<v Speaker 4>find really quite detestable.</v>

99
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.893
<v Speaker 4>And I made a video about that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentioned during the video that the act </v>

100
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:17.074
<v Speaker 4>of making the video had probably become,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had arguably become illegal and Ontario </v>

101
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.873
<v Speaker 4>in the province I'm from and was about </v>
<v Speaker 4>to become illegal federally with some </v>

102
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 4>new legislation and that it likely </v>
<v Speaker 4>violated the,</v>

103
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 4>the code of conduct that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

104
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 4>that characterize the university with </v>
<v Speaker 4>regards to its inclusiveness policies.</v>

105
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 4>University promptly validated my </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerns by sending me two letters,</v>

106
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.004
<v Speaker 4>telling me to stop making such </v>
<v Speaker 4>statements because they violated the </v>

107
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 4>university's code of conduct and also </v>
<v Speaker 4>the relevant human rights legislation in</v>

108
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 4>Ontario and in the federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the,</v>

109
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.883
<v Speaker 4>I felt that the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>university did that was because they </v>

110
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.263
<v Speaker 4>faced a certain amount of public </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure from people at the University </v>

111
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 4>of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that would be mostly,</v>

112
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.553
<v Speaker 4>most of that pressure came from people I</v>
<v Speaker 4>would regard as the professional </v>

113
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 4>activist types.</v>

114
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.473
<v Speaker 4>And the university said that they hadn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>received many letters accusing me of </v>

115
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 4>making the University of Toronto an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unsafe space,</v>

116
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.374
<v Speaker 4>which is the sort of language that </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately makes you know that you're </v>

117
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 4>dealing with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideologically possessed.</v>

118
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 4>But they also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they failed to note at the same time</v>

119
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:21.584
<v Speaker 4>that they had received hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps thousands of letters as well as </v>

120
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 4>a 10,000 signature petition supporting </v>
<v Speaker 4>my stance.</v>

121
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 4>And so I think when the administration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

122
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.773
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the administration regarding it's </v>

123
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:34.724
<v Speaker 4>duty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fundamental duty to promote some </v>

124
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:37.904
<v Speaker 4>illusory notion of safety and then also </v>
<v Speaker 4>is willing to falsify the facts on the </v>

125
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 4>ground by omission that definitely </v>
<v Speaker 4>overstepped their boundaries.</v>

126
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 4>And I would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

127
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were put back,</v>

128
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 4>they were set back on their heels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's put it that way,</v>

129
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.780
<v Speaker 4>by a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

130
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 4>strident outpouring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strident,</v>

131
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 4>powerful outpouring of public opinion in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada.</v>

132
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.183
<v Speaker 4>And that was all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was good for me because I got two </v>

133
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:03.974
<v Speaker 4>letters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And generally if you're dealing with </v>

134
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.224
<v Speaker 4>human resources professionals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then three letters is the warning and </v>

135
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 4>then the next step is something more </v>
<v Speaker 4>serious.</v>

136
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you mentioned the term safe space in</v>

137
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 4>particular for a university,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want you to link this back to this</v>

138
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:17.624
<v Speaker 4>idea that university administration </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be serving students first and </v>

139
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:21.914
<v Speaker 4>faculty second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do you think that the administration </v>

140
00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 4>has some sort of compelling mandate to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make sure that students feel safe?</v>

141
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they haven't.</v>

142
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.743
<v Speaker 4>They have exactly the reverse mandate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing safe about being </v>

143
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 4>educated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to be safe,</v>

144
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:35.174
<v Speaker 4>stay home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that you need to be educated </v>

145
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 4>about our terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost always,</v>

146
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 4>if you study history properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's terrible.</v>

147
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 4>If you study literature properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's terrible.</v>

148
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.384
<v Speaker 4>If you study psychology properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these fields of endeavor teach </v>

149
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:48.404
<v Speaker 4>you the painful things that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>know to understand what human beings in </v>

150
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 4>society or like.</v>

151
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

152
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 4>the idea that universities should be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>safe space is absolutely preposterous,</v>

153
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 4>but it's also preposterous for more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

154
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 4>I would say immediate reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of the,</v>

155
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.823
<v Speaker 4>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a few things that we know is as </v>

156
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 4>clinical psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

157
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.563
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a field and also as practitioners </v>

158
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 4>with regards to how to treat people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffer,</v>

159
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:13.214
<v Speaker 4>let's say from an excess of anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what you do with people who suffer </v>

160
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:17.744
<v Speaker 4>from an excess of anxiety is expose them</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the very things that they're afraid </v>

161
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 4>of or sometimes disgusted by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>

162
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.180
<v Speaker 4>you help them voluntarily expose </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves to such things.</v>

163
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 4>And that doesn't make the world safer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes them braver and more competent.</v>

164
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.530
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the notion that you serve students,</v>

165
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>safety concerns,</v>

166
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 4>even by shielding them from things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't wish to encounter.</v>

167
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely,</v>

168
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.423
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of a single possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a valid reason why you would ever </v>

169
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:45.584
<v Speaker 4>undertake such an endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really neat to talk about </v>

170
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:52.010
<v Speaker 4>it in the abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that particular concern that perhaps</v>

171
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 4>a lot of students and a lot of members </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the community have with your case</v>

172
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 5>is the particular pronoun usage issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in that instance,</v>

173
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm wondering if you think there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>real harm.</v>

174
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 5>So if someone comes to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of your students let's say,</v>

175
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 5>and would really feel more comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 5>engaging with the deep,</v>

176
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 5>troubling historical or psychological or</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever field truths,</v>

177
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 5>if you refer to the student with certain</v>
<v Speaker 5>pronouns,</v>

178
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.690
<v Speaker 5>do you really think that's a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 5>place where they need that,</v>

179
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>severe exposure or do you think there is</v>

180
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 5>some sort of harm by calling them the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pronoun that</v>

181
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.793
<v Speaker 4>they will?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fundamentally a fabricated </v>

182
00:09:32.931 --> 00:09:33.764
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been fabricated for political </v>

183
00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:35.504
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know the history of the relevant </v>

184
00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:37.604
<v Speaker 4>legislation in Ontario and initially the</v>
<v Speaker 4>legislation was basically predicated on </v>

185
00:09:41.361 --> 00:09:45.820
<v Speaker 4>the idea that that gender identity was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>social construct and that they're there,</v>

186
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:46.663
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be protections put in </v>
<v Speaker 4>place for people whose gender identity </v>

187
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.033
<v Speaker 4>had switched so that they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>subject to harassment or discrimination </v>

188
00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:53.684
<v Speaker 4>and there's no utility in subjecting </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to counterproductive </v>

189
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.903
<v Speaker 4>discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would consider discrimination </v>

190
00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:01.184
<v Speaker 4>counterproductive when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>discrimination occurs for reasons that </v>

191
00:10:04.101 --> 00:10:06.160
<v Speaker 4>aren't relevant to the task at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

192
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.010
<v Speaker 4>Cause we discriminate all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

193
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.873
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government ran the policies by a </v>

194
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 4>relatively select group of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of activists and,</v>

195
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:15.763
<v Speaker 4>and transformed it into a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a piece of policy legislation that no </v>

196
00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:19.544
<v Speaker 4>one in their right mind would abide by </v>
<v Speaker 4>or could abide by for that matter and </v>

197
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.200
<v Speaker 4>reduced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

198
00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:25.034
<v Speaker 4>the idea of human identity to something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that basically transforms on a </v>

199
00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:28.820
<v Speaker 4>subjective whim.</v>

200
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.090
<v Speaker 4>And so I don't buy any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

201
00:10:31.091 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that that's what identity </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

202
00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:35.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's fundamentally self </v>
<v Speaker 4>generated.</v>

203
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.163
<v Speaker 4>It might be socio culturally </v>
<v Speaker 4>constructive to some degree and it most </v>

204
00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:39.404
<v Speaker 4>certainly is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that your identity is </v>

205
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:47.711
<v Speaker 4>solely your choice and that you have the</v>
<v Speaker 4>right to inflict that on other people is</v>

206
00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:48.914
<v Speaker 4>absolutely preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people grow out of that idea when </v>

207
00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 4>they're two years of age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

208
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:54.384
<v Speaker 4>and I mean that technically because we </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that when children hit about three </v>

209
00:10:57.561 --> 00:10:58.394
<v Speaker 4>years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're able to start playing social </v>

210
00:10:59.751 --> 00:11:03.920
<v Speaker 4>games and that's when they start </v>
<v Speaker 4>learning that that identity is a,</v>

211
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.550
<v Speaker 4>is at minimum a socially negotiated </v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomena now.</v>

212
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.710
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So apart from that,</v>

213
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.693
<v Speaker 4>there's no agreement whatsoever on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>set of pronouns that will be used and </v>

214
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.550
<v Speaker 4>they've multiplied beyond anybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody's imagination,</v>

215
00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:19.010
<v Speaker 4>I would say including the people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>formulated the legislation.</v>

216
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.323
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the fact that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>refer to people by their pronouns </v>

217
00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:24.320
<v Speaker 4>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're third person pronouns.</v>

218
00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:26.180
<v Speaker 4>And so I don't call you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

219
00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:28.160
<v Speaker 4>when we're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might refer to you as he,</v>

220
00:11:28.161 --> 00:11:30.380
<v Speaker 4>if I was talking about you with someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

221
00:11:30.381 --> 00:11:32.570
<v Speaker 4>So most of the time it's a moot point </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyways.</v>

222
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.353
<v Speaker 4>But doctor computers,</v>

223
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.870
<v Speaker 5>it says where it does matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

224
00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:36.704
<v Speaker 5>Because certainly you could envision,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's not talk so much about federal </v>

225
00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:39.644
<v Speaker 5>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but perhaps like in an actual like </v>

226
00:11:40.941 --> 00:11:44.630
<v Speaker 5>personal day to day setting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think there is a harm?</v>

227
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:47.240
<v Speaker 5>So perhaps you can disagree with like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the philosophical principle,</v>

228
00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:51.410
<v Speaker 5>the theoretical truth of whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 5>identity can change subjectively with to</v>

229
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:54.310
<v Speaker 5>win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if someone comes up to me and says,</v>

230
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be referred to as this,</v>

231
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.693
<v Speaker 4>even if I adopt some sort of view that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't really think fundamentally on a </v>

232
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 4>pure theoretical level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have an understanding of identity.</v>

233
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:05.843
<v Speaker 4>Do does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I then choose to harm them or </v>

234
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:13.681
<v Speaker 4>potentially upset to them by sticking to</v>
<v Speaker 4>my belief about what their identity is?</v>

235
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.643
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first thing you'd have to establish </v>

236
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 4>is whether or not that would actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>constitute harm.</v>

237
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 4>That's the claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the person might say,</v>

238
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're harming me,</v>

239
00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:23.740
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't provide evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are people.</v>

240
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 4>People presume very often that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>harmed by things,</v>

241
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:26.854
<v Speaker 4>that they're not harmed by it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't think that the mere claim </v>

242
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:30.274
<v Speaker 4>that someone thinks that the way I would</v>
<v Speaker 4>address the might harm them gives them </v>

243
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 4>the right to enforce by legislation the </v>
<v Speaker 4>content of my speech.</v>

244
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 4>I'd have just doesn't that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't work.</v>

245
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.753
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's something else that's worth </v>

246
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:42.970
<v Speaker 4>noting from a more practical </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

247
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

248
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.453
<v Speaker 4>I've received letters from about 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>trends people and that's actually a lot </v>

249
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.850
<v Speaker 4>because there aren't that many people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and these are people who by and large,</v>

250
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 4>we're very serious about their </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformations and all.</v>

251
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 4>But one of them agreed with what I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing saying first of all,</v>

252
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.203
<v Speaker 4>that they never asked to be represented </v>
<v Speaker 4>by the activist to claim to be </v>

253
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 4>representing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

254
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:03.970
<v Speaker 4>So here's a proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

255
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:04.804
<v Speaker 4>So imagine that there's a group of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and that somebody is a member of </v>

256
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:12.250
<v Speaker 4>that group of people and then that </v>
<v Speaker 4>person stands forthe as a member of that</v>

257
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:14.500
<v Speaker 4>group and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm a member of that group,</v>

258
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:16.390
<v Speaker 4>I speak for all those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

259
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:16.991
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

260
00:13:16.991 --> 00:13:17.824
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The mere fact that you're the member of </v>

261
00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 4>a group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't give you any right whatsoever</v>

262
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 4>to speak on behalf of that group.</v>

263
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 4>You need to have legitimacy as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>representative and I don't,</v>

264
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 4>I think that that you can hardly imagine</v>
<v Speaker 4>a more pernicious,</v>

265
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 4>uh example say of racism then to presume</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if someone is black,</v>

266
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:37.270
<v Speaker 4>they speak on behalf of all black </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

267
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.870
<v Speaker 4>All black people are homogenous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all believe exactly the same thing.</v>

268
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.823
<v Speaker 4>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you talked to or met one of them </v>

269
00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 4>you've talked to or met them all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's that Dr. Peterson,</v>

270
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:46.474
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm referring to cases where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual people in front of you are </v>

271
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:50.344
<v Speaker 4>telling you though that they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to represent themselves a </v>

272
00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:53.801
<v Speaker 4>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

273
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:54.634
<v Speaker 4>So we can talk about whether or not to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the activist community is accurately </v>

274
00:13:57.461 --> 00:14:01.120
<v Speaker 4>representing actual communities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm wondering,</v>

275
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.120
<v Speaker 4>you mentioned you don't think like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>self report of like,</v>

276
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.983
<v Speaker 4>Oh this is harming me or I would not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>comfortable interacting with you unless </v>

277
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.583
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>x happened would not be an accurate way </v>

278
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:11.560
<v Speaker 4>of describing real harm.</v>

279
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Are there better metrics we have for </v>
<v Speaker 4>real harm?</v>

280
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:16.630
<v Speaker 4>If someone comes up to me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

281
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:17.464
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they are feeling too warm in this </v>

282
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 4>room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should leave,</v>

283
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:21.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I say,</v>

284
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:22.571
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

285
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:23.404
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't know how warm you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not something you can know for </v>

286
00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:27.880
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just the self report.</v>

287
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would depend on what they were asking</v>

288
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:30.604
<v Speaker 4>other people to do and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that people have the </v>

289
00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:34.024
<v Speaker 4>right to impose restrictions on what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not so much restrictions on what I'm </v>

290
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:38.194
<v Speaker 4>allowed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to determine the content of my </v>

291
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 4>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an entirely different thing.</v>

292
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:42.903
<v Speaker 4>And so if it's a matter of the legal </v>
<v Speaker 4>principle of whether or not I'm free to </v>

293
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:46.684
<v Speaker 4>determine the content of my speech or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hypothetical discomfort of a </v>

294
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 4>hypothetical person because no one's </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually asked me this yet.</v>

295
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.093
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I'm going to go with the freedom </v>

296
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 4>from compelled speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Partly again,</v>

297
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:56.864
<v Speaker 4>because I think that the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government or any other institution </v>

298
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 4>should regulate the content of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech is absolutely,</v>

299
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.463
<v Speaker 4>and it's intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you have a strong legal </v>

300
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:05.931
<v Speaker 4>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

301
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:07.990
<v Speaker 4>So the government probably shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>mandate this,</v>

302
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 4>that I'm sure a lot of people might </v>
<v Speaker 4>agree with that.</v>

303
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.343
<v Speaker 4>I'm still curious though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this hypothetical scenario that a </v>

304
00:15:13.801 --> 00:15:14.634
<v Speaker 4>student did or a person did approach you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they told you they would be harmed </v>

305
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:19.214
<v Speaker 4>or they would be uncomfortable unless </v>
<v Speaker 4>you refer to them with a certain </v>

306
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:21.584
<v Speaker 4>pronoun.</v>

307
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

308
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.180
<v Speaker 4>What would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

309
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:28.923
<v Speaker 4>I really have a hard time answering </v>
<v Speaker 4>questions like that because they're </v>

310
00:15:30.941 --> 00:15:33.690
<v Speaker 4>asked in the hypothetical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could certainly it could.</v>

311
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:34.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could,</v>

312
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.250
<v Speaker 4>but my sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm a clinician,</v>

313
00:15:36.251 --> 00:15:40.030
<v Speaker 4>is that I generally handle those sorts </v>
<v Speaker 4>of things at the level of actual detail.</v>

314
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.850
<v Speaker 4>So I would say it would depend on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

315
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.970
<v Speaker 4>It would depend on the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would depend on why they asked me.</v>

316
00:15:45.971 --> 00:15:46.804
<v Speaker 4>It would depend on how they asked me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would depend on what I thought they </v>

317
00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:51.220
<v Speaker 4>were trying to accomplish by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>request.</v>

318
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.293
<v Speaker 4>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would depend on whether or not they </v>

319
00:15:53.591 --> 00:15:55.030
<v Speaker 4>were filming me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

320
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.370
<v Speaker 4>they were asking me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would depend on whether they asked me</v>

321
00:15:57.371 --> 00:15:59.410
<v Speaker 4>in my office or in a hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

322
00:15:59.411 --> 00:16:03.970
<v Speaker 4>I can tell the difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 4>genuine plea for understanding and a bit</v>

323
00:16:03.971 --> 00:16:06.190
<v Speaker 4>of political theater or political </v>
<v Speaker 4>manipulation.</v>

324
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.093
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now and I've dealt with people who've </v>

325
00:16:07.991 --> 00:16:08.824
<v Speaker 4>made all sorts of requests of me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believed me because I've had a clinical </v>

326
00:16:10.961 --> 00:16:13.690
<v Speaker 4>practice for about 20 years and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience with,</v>

327
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.800
<v Speaker 4>with the range of human behavior is I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would say extraordinarily extensive.</v>

328
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:18.963
<v Speaker 4>And so I've made all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>adjustments to the way I interact with </v>

329
00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:21.604
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I can't say exactly what I would do </v>

330
00:16:23.261 --> 00:16:27.040
<v Speaker 4>in a given situation because I firmly </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe that the devil is in the details</v>

331
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:32.190
<v Speaker 4>and I haven't been making a case about a</v>
<v Speaker 4>specific interaction that I had actually</v>

332
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.660
<v Speaker 4>experienced or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

333
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:35.680
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

334
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:36.760
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

335
00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:38.980
<v Speaker 4>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd been making a case,</v>

336
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:39.843
<v Speaker 4>a philosophical fundamentally if </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophical case and secondarily a </v>

337
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:46.060
<v Speaker 4>political case and I think that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>made the case properly,</v>

338
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.163
<v Speaker 4>but you would say that you'd recognize a</v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between a like legal </v>

339
00:16:50.081 --> 00:16:50.914
<v Speaker 4>responsibility to do something versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of an individual personal </v>

340
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:55.290
<v Speaker 4>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should do something right.</v>

341
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.133
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I recognize that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean sometimes the legal and the </v>

342
00:16:58.421 --> 00:17:00.580
<v Speaker 4>philosophical and the personal issue are</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the same.</v>

343
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:01.623
<v Speaker 4>It's simpler when that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also think that the issue is </v>

344
00:17:04.271 --> 00:17:05.560
<v Speaker 4>essentially a red herring.</v>

345
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

346
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.880
<v Speaker 4>since I made that video for one reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>or another,</v>

347
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.043
<v Speaker 4>the things that I've been saying have </v>
<v Speaker 4>become quite popular and and not as </v>

348
00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:14.584
<v Speaker 4>controversial as you might think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of what I've accrued so far is </v>

349
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:18.304
<v Speaker 4>being support and the reason for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>has very little to do with the issue of </v>

350
00:17:21.701 --> 00:17:22.534
<v Speaker 4>pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Pronoun issue in the Pronoun </v>

351
00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:25.234
<v Speaker 4>controversy is a pointer to something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot larger and that's why this </v>

352
00:17:27.641 --> 00:17:28.474
<v Speaker 4>issue has had legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here because people are </v>

353
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:30.994
<v Speaker 4>interested in my views on pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I happen to put my foot down so to </v>

354
00:17:34.871 --> 00:17:35.704
<v Speaker 4>speak at a particular place because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>very frequently the case that if you're </v>

355
00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.410
<v Speaker 4>engaged in a complex philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispute,</v>

356
00:17:41.411 --> 00:17:44.080
<v Speaker 4>which is the case for our society in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general,</v>

357
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.590
<v Speaker 4>that in order to make a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make a statement about it,</v>

358
00:17:47.591 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 4>you have to make a statement in to an </v>
<v Speaker 4>actual cause.</v>

359
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.850
<v Speaker 4>So you have to draw the line somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people have asked me,</v>

360
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did you pick the Pronoun Hill to die</v>

361
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:58.620
<v Speaker 4>on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my answer to that generally is a,</v>

362
00:17:58.621 --> 00:17:59.940
<v Speaker 4>I didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And B,</v>

363
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 4>you have to and be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to,</v>

364
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.510
<v Speaker 4>you have to pick something real yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To,</v>

365
00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.580
<v Speaker 4>to enter into the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

366
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:11.640
<v Speaker 4>if I would have just made another video </v>
<v Speaker 4>decrying political correctness,</v>

367
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:12.474
<v Speaker 4>it would've gone nowhere at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I said that there was something I </v>

368
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:15.354
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things I won't do is use </v>

369
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:17.934
<v Speaker 4>the made upwards of postmodern neo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxist who are playing a particular </v>

370
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:21.534
<v Speaker 4>game with gender identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an extension of their particular </v>

371
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.900
<v Speaker 4>reprehensible philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if that happens to me in that,</v>

372
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.993
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to engage in discussions about </v>

373
00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 4>whether or not if a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

374
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:33.590
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

375
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.530
<v Speaker 4>a suffering and confused person who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a,</v>

376
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.523
<v Speaker 4>who's had a very like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>troubled pathway through life came and </v>

377
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 4>asked me politely if I would go out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>my way to accommodate them.</v>

378
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.430
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that those issues actually</v>

379
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 4>belong on the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the same,</v>

380
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.580
<v Speaker 4>they're not the same category of issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

381
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.010
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't see that there's,</v>

382
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.260
<v Speaker 4>well I guess that's enough set of boat </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

383
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's transition a little bit.</v>

384
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.920
<v Speaker 4>So you mentioned sort of postmodernism </v>
<v Speaker 4>and neo Marxism,</v>

385
00:19:04.921 --> 00:19:07.530
<v Speaker 4>in fact in a statement and mcmaster </v>
<v Speaker 4>university,</v>

386
00:19:07.531 --> 00:19:08.364
<v Speaker 4>you claimed that an expression of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the protest that you see at your events </v>

387
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.463
<v Speaker 4>are an expression of a philosophy that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>grounded partly in postmodernism and </v>

388
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.210
<v Speaker 4>partly in Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

389
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.973
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean first and secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how would you say that these movements </v>

390
00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:26.670
<v Speaker 4>are characterize in those ways?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

391
00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:29.610
<v Speaker 4>at mcmaster it meant that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>protesters came with,</v>

392
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.550
<v Speaker 4>came and hid behind a banner that had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hammer and sickle on it.</v>

393
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:34.243
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

394
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.180
<v Speaker 4>So you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the funny thing is,</v>

395
00:19:39.181 --> 00:19:41.270
<v Speaker 4>the funny thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that people laugh about that and,</v>

396
00:19:41.271 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 4>and I understand perfectly well what </v>
<v Speaker 4>while you're laughing,</v>

397
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:44.394
<v Speaker 4>but I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't have laughed if it would </v>

398
00:19:45.321 --> 00:19:47.520
<v Speaker 4>have been a swastika and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

399
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.470
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's no funnier that it was a hammer.</v>

400
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:50.880
<v Speaker 4>And sickle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

401
00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:51.411
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

402
00:19:51.411 --> 00:19:52.171
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

403
00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:53.004
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reprehensible ideologies that are </v>

404
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:55.824
<v Speaker 4>based in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fundamental Marxism killed at least </v>

405
00:19:57.691 --> 00:20:01.530
<v Speaker 4>100 million people in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's still apologist one in five.</v>

406
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:03.960
<v Speaker 4>Social scientists identifies as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxist.</v>

407
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.011
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

408
00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:05.850
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really,</v>

409
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 4>that's really where we're going to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

410
00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:10.530
<v Speaker 4>Is it after the bloody 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to say,</v>

411
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:11.364
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't real communism or something </v>

412
00:20:12.781 --> 00:20:13.614
<v Speaker 4>foolish like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though we had multiple examples of </v>

413
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.540
<v Speaker 4>exactly what happens when those </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctrines are let loose in the world.</v>

414
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.853
<v Speaker 4>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened in the 1960s in the late </v>

415
00:20:21.691 --> 00:20:24.960
<v Speaker 4>1960s as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this happened mostly in France,</v>

416
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.943
<v Speaker 4>which has probably produced the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>reprehensible coterie of public </v>

417
00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 4>intellectuals that any country has ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>managed,</v>

418
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.390
<v Speaker 4>is that in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

419
00:20:33.391 --> 00:20:36.120
<v Speaker 4>in the late 1960s when all the student </v>
<v Speaker 4>activists,</v>

420
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.013
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had decided that the Marxist revolution </v>

421
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:40.470
<v Speaker 4>wasn't going to occur in the western </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

422
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

423
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.250
<v Speaker 4>and had finally also realized that </v>
<v Speaker 4>apologizing for the Soviet,</v>

424
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 4>for the Soviet system was just not going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fly anymore.</v>

425
00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:48.994
<v Speaker 4>Given,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given the tens of millions of bodies </v>

426
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 4>that had stacked up that they performed </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

427
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:53.853
<v Speaker 4>what I would call a philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleight of hand and transformed the </v>

428
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:59.590
<v Speaker 4>class war into a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into a identity politics,</v>

429
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:00.580
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>war.</v>

430
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:01.743
<v Speaker 4>And that became extraordinarily popular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly transmitted through people like </v>

431
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:05.224
<v Speaker 4>shock Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who became an absolute darling of the </v>

432
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:07.564
<v Speaker 4>Yale English department and had his </v>
<v Speaker 4>pernicious doctrines spread throughout </v>

433
00:21:10.481 --> 00:21:14.200
<v Speaker 4>North America partly as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 4>his invasion of Yale.</v>

434
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:15.830
<v Speaker 4>And what happened with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

435
00:21:15.831 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 4>what happened with the postmodernist is </v>
<v Speaker 4>they kept on pedaling their,</v>

436
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

437
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.000
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their murderous breed of,</v>

438
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.863
<v Speaker 4>of political doctrine under a new guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>and resentful people all over the world </v>

439
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:28.120
<v Speaker 4>fell for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't,</v>

440
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't consider that acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

441
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've learned,</v>

442
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:32.794
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I teach my students in my second year </v>

443
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.323
<v Speaker 4>personality class about what happened in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Soviet Union and in the Gulag </v>

444
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:38.434
<v Speaker 4>archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I use soldier Nitsa and has an </v>

445
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:40.744
<v Speaker 4>exemplar Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>exemplar of existential psychology </v>

446
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:45.694
<v Speaker 4>because I think he's actually the wisest</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the existential psychologist even </v>

447
00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:51.490
<v Speaker 4>though he was primarily a historian in </v>
<v Speaker 4>literary finger.</v>

448
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:52.653
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the students don't even know </v>

449
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:56.380
<v Speaker 4>what happened in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well why is that exactly.</v>

450
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.920
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is that radical </v>
<v Speaker 4>leftist ideologue,</v>

451
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.773
<v Speaker 4>intellectuals in the West have never </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly apologized for the row for the </v>

452
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 4>role they played in the and the absolute</v>
<v Speaker 4>murderousness of the,</v>

453
00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 4>of the 20th century.</v>

454
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.200
<v Speaker 4>And so students don't even know about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

455
00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:13.130
<v Speaker 4>So they can come out to mcmaster behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

456
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.243
<v Speaker 4>they're damn mineable poster with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hammer and sickle on it and act like </v>

457
00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:19.630
<v Speaker 4>they're virtuous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's a calling,</v>

458
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.613
<v Speaker 4>getting that trend was only sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>significant to that specific mcmaster </v>

459
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:25.324
<v Speaker 4>incident?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or do you see this type of ideology </v>

460
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.110
<v Speaker 4>influencing campus protests beyond </v>
<v Speaker 4>mcmaster in general?</v>

461
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:33.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

462
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:37.960
<v Speaker 4>I think that that part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's everywhere.</v>

463
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:41.040
<v Speaker 4>It's not just in campus protests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>

464
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:42.520
<v Speaker 4>the campuses are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

465
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.910
<v Speaker 4>are overrun in large part with </v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplines that have,</v>

466
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 4>in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no valid reason to exist.</v>

467
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.610
<v Speaker 4>I think disciplines like women's studies</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be defunded.</v>

468
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.880
<v Speaker 4>Any of the activists disciplines who </v>
<v Speaker 4>act,</v>

469
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:55.803
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's primarily primary role is the </v>

470
00:22:58.211 --> 00:22:59.520
<v Speaker 4>overthrow us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

471
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.150
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the patriarchy,</v>

472
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:01.984
<v Speaker 4>which is about is ill defined the </v>
<v Speaker 4>concept as you could possibly formulate </v>

473
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.140
<v Speaker 4>that it's enough that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've done enough public funding of that</v>

474
00:23:08.141 --> 00:23:08.974
<v Speaker 4>sort of thing.</v>

475
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.963
<v Speaker 4>We're providing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're providing full time destructive </v>

476
00:23:12.551 --> 00:23:13.384
<v Speaker 4>employment for people who are doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing but causing trouble and </v>

477
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:16.603
<v Speaker 4>seriously nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would say that because you think </v>

478
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:18.994
<v Speaker 4>that these departments are causing harm </v>
<v Speaker 4>or it could have the potential to cause </v>

479
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:24.160
<v Speaker 4>harm that university administrations to </v>
<v Speaker 4>defund them,</v>

480
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:24.431
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

481
00:23:24.431 --> 00:23:25.264
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they should be fun to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the hell cares what I think about </v>

482
00:23:27.431 --> 00:23:28.264
<v Speaker 4>them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think that they should be </v>

483
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:30.130
<v Speaker 4>defunded at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

484
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:31.323
<v Speaker 4>I think they should be defunded because </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they promote has a zero </v>

485
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:34.564
<v Speaker 4>intellectual credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their research methods don't qualify as </v>

486
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:39.520
<v Speaker 4>research methods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are publications,</v>

487
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:44.350
<v Speaker 4>80% of humanities publications now </v>
<v Speaker 4>Garner zero citations.</v>

488
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.333
<v Speaker 4>That's not very citations and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little trick as far as I can tell is </v>

489
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:56.480
<v Speaker 4>what happens is that people write </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that no one will read.</v>

490
00:23:56.481 --> 00:23:58.310
<v Speaker 4>They know perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That new one will read it.</v>

491
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.143
<v Speaker 4>They circulated around there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're tiny group of compatriots who </v>

492
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:02.354
<v Speaker 4>occupied the same little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little what a little area on the </v>

493
00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:06.284
<v Speaker 4>intellectual spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then it's peer reviewed then is </v>

494
00:24:08.391 --> 00:24:09.224
<v Speaker 4>published by major journals who sell it </v>
<v Speaker 4>at inflated prices to libraries who </v>

495
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:13.154
<v Speaker 4>squirreled away to end and only increase</v>
<v Speaker 4>the noise to signal ratio in </v>

496
00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 4>relationship to the sum total of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge.</v>

497
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.790
<v Speaker 4>It's a scam from top to bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

498
00:24:22.791 --> 00:24:24.700
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the exam,</v>

499
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:25.813
<v Speaker 4>well let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's one of the things that really </v>

500
00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:30.560
<v Speaker 4>bothered me about what was going on in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario.</v>

501
00:24:30.561 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 4>And this is happening everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I made,</v>

502
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.550
<v Speaker 4>I made this claim when I made my first </v>
<v Speaker 4>video,</v>

503
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.533
<v Speaker 4>since we have to get into this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the technical claim in the Ontario </v>

504
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:39.644
<v Speaker 4>legislature legislation now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is how this has already </v>

505
00:24:41.541 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 4>happened in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

506
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.780
<v Speaker 4>this is not only a Canadian thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happening in Australia,</v>

507
00:24:44.781 --> 00:24:47.060
<v Speaker 4>it's happening in New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happening everywhere.</v>

508
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.030
<v Speaker 4>Here's the claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's biological sex,</v>

509
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.043
<v Speaker 4>there's gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gender expression and their </v>

510
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:55.580
<v Speaker 4>sexual proclivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they vary independently.</v>

511
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.520
<v Speaker 4>That's the technical claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's built into the Canadian law.</v>

512
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.190
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>

513
00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:01.024
<v Speaker 4>Not a bit of that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The correlation between biological sex </v>

514
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:07.520
<v Speaker 4>and gender identity exceeds 0.99 it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>virtually perfect.</v>

515
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.340
<v Speaker 4>It's the very definition of non </v>
<v Speaker 4>independent.</v>

516
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.413
<v Speaker 4>So you think almost everyone who is </v>
<v Speaker 4>biologically male identifies as </v>

517
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:15.284
<v Speaker 4>biologically male,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost everyone who identifies as </v>

518
00:25:17.421 --> 00:25:21.680
<v Speaker 4>biologically male dresses and acts mail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the gender identity element.</v>

519
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:22.723
<v Speaker 4>And almost everybody who is biologically</v>
<v Speaker 4>male who identifies as male who dresses </v>

520
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:27.464
<v Speaker 4>as male is in fact heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most things are incredibly tightly </v>

521
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:31.664
<v Speaker 4>linked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the technical claim in the </v>

522
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:35.570
<v Speaker 4>legislation is that they vary </v>
<v Speaker 4>independently wrong.</v>

523
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.853
<v Speaker 4>Now I got in trouble for saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what people claimed was that I </v>

524
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:40.034
<v Speaker 4>was denying the existence of people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't fit neatly into the gendered </v>

525
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:44.204
<v Speaker 4>categories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I wasn't doing it a zero one or </v>

526
00:25:45.981 --> 00:25:47.480
<v Speaker 4>whatever the percentage may be.</v>

527
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:48.853
<v Speaker 4>That wouldn't fall neatly under that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So suddenly if there were a perfect </v>

528
00:25:51.621 --> 00:25:53.120
<v Speaker 4>correlation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would work.</v>

529
00:25:53.121 --> 00:25:53.954
<v Speaker 4>But if there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would seem perhaps that you're </v>

530
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.520
<v Speaker 4>excluding certain people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

531
00:25:58.521 --> 00:25:59.354
<v Speaker 4>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if most people tend to identify a </v>

532
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:02.810
<v Speaker 4>certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is that 0.01 that's not,</v>

533
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.433
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't ever denying their existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was denying the validity of the claim </v>

534
00:26:07.851 --> 00:26:11.450
<v Speaker 4>that those four levels of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 4>existed independently of one another,</v>

535
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.060
<v Speaker 4>which they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a false claim.</v>

536
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:14.894
<v Speaker 4>And the reason that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the radical social constructionist who </v>

537
00:26:17.481 --> 00:26:18.314
<v Speaker 4>are pursuing this line of reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is completely discredited as far </v>

538
00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:21.494
<v Speaker 4>as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's any better than </v>

539
00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:23.294
<v Speaker 4>claiming that the world is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason that they're pursuing it </v>

540
00:26:26.091 --> 00:26:26.924
<v Speaker 4>legally is because they know perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 4>well that they've lost the scientific </v>

541
00:26:29.181 --> 00:26:30.110
<v Speaker 4>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

542
00:26:30.111 --> 00:26:30.944
<v Speaker 4>I debated someone on Canadian public </v>
<v Speaker 4>television who had the gall to say that </v>

543
00:26:33.891 --> 00:26:34.581
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

544
00:26:34.581 --> 00:26:35.414
<v Speaker 4>the scientific consensus over the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>four decades was that there was no </v>

545
00:26:37.671 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 4>biological differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

546
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:40.983
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was one of the things that was </v>

547
00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 4>so absurd about</v>

548
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:44.933
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were many things that were </v>

549
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:47.034
<v Speaker 2>absurd about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that I was in trouble with the </v>

550
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:52.440
<v Speaker 2>university at that point and he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like first of all,</v>

551
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.453
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not the scientific consensus of </v>

552
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:59.690
<v Speaker 2>the last four decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since the idea of it,</v>

553
00:26:59.691 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 2>there are no biological differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>between men and women.</v>

554
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 2>It's the sort of thing you hear that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just makes your jaw drop.</v>

555
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.353
<v Speaker 2>Now what you could say is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>took all the dimensions along which men </v>

556
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:11.364
<v Speaker 2>and women very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a substantial number of </v>

557
00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's substantial overlap between</v>

558
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Speaker 2>men and women on almost all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensions.</v>

559
00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Now that's not particularly true with </v>
<v Speaker 2>chromosomal identity,</v>

560
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 2>although there are some exceptions like </v>
<v Speaker 2>with personality for example,</v>

561
00:27:24.181 --> 00:27:26.460
<v Speaker 2>and I happened to be somewhat of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>expert on personality.</v>

562
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.520
<v Speaker 2>There are marked differences between men</v>
<v Speaker 2>and women,</v>

563
00:27:29.521 --> 00:27:31.350
<v Speaker 2>but the overlap exceeds the differences.</v>

564
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.183
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are higher in agreeableness and </v>

565
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:34.584
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's socio culturally </v>

566
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:36.234
<v Speaker 2>constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out that it isn't because </v>

567
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.730
<v Speaker 2>if you look across cultures and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the cultures that have moved</v>

568
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.593
<v Speaker 2>most forward with um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with gender equality provisions up the </v>

569
00:27:46.261 --> 00:27:47.094
<v Speaker 2>social and political lead levels and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the Scandinavian </v>

570
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:50.094
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the differences in personality between </v>

571
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:52.914
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women maximize in those </v>

572
00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:55.920
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these are tiny studies.</v>

573
00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:56.754
<v Speaker 2>These are studies that involve tens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people and that have been </v>

574
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:01.650
<v Speaker 2>well replicated by a series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent researchers.</v>

575
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.900
<v Speaker 2>And so with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

576
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:04.763
<v Speaker 2>per,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you add the personality differences </v>

577
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 2>between men and women across all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality traits,</v>

578
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 2>you can almost perfectly segregate men </v>
<v Speaker 2>from women.</v>

579
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 2>And that has not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

580
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:12.953
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't take into account the </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious things like arm angle and hip </v>

581
00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:17.064
<v Speaker 2>width,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hip,</v>

582
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:17.913
<v Speaker 2>hip with compared to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to waste with and shoulder width and </v>

583
00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 2>upper body strength and height and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight and the biochemical differences.</v>

584
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.380
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so preposterous that it's,</v>

585
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.413
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's beyond conception to me that we're </v>

586
00:28:29.851 --> 00:28:33.360
<v Speaker 2>actually even discussing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was making a specific claim,</v>

587
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.950
<v Speaker 2>which is the law says these four levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>of analysis very independently.</v>

588
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.130
<v Speaker 2>The only reason they're associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>one another is for cultural reasons,</v>

589
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.083
<v Speaker 2>no wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't get to put fallacious </v>

590
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.310
<v Speaker 2>scientific truths into the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

591
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:50.243
<v Speaker 2>or if you're going to do that then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to abide by that particular </v>

592
00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:53.970
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to object to it,</v>

593
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.560
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what I shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

594
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.423
<v Speaker 2>So do you think that a necessary premise</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us to accept to have a law like </v>

595
00:29:01.171 --> 00:29:03.480
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a law that extends protections and these</v>

596
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:04.314
<v Speaker 2>groups is that these identities are </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent from each other fully </v>

597
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:10.110
<v Speaker 2>independent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

598
00:29:10.111 --> 00:29:10.944
<v Speaker 2>Could we accept like if they had just </v>
<v Speaker 2>justified it as we know that these </v>

599
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:14.544
<v Speaker 2>aren't fully independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we think there are other good </v>

600
00:29:17.131 --> 00:29:20.640
<v Speaker 2>reasons to provide these protections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you be,</v>

601
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.190
<v Speaker 2>what your stance on the law change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

602
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.103
<v Speaker 2>the law as it's currently formulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't in fact it undermines the </v>

603
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:32.700
<v Speaker 2>protection that these sorts of groups </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been pursuing is seeking for years.</v>

604
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.773
<v Speaker 2>So let's say let's take the let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's accept the proposition that these </v>

605
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:41.250
<v Speaker 2>very independently or or that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>only socio culturally constructed.</v>

606
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so where does</v>

607
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 4>that leave your discussion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>homosexuality?</v>

608
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.900
<v Speaker 4>So if they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the fundamentalist Christians say,</v>

609
00:29:46.901 --> 00:29:47.560
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

610
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.393
<v Speaker 4>if homosexuality is nothing butter </v>
<v Speaker 4>socio-cultural construct and why do we </v>

611
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:53.950
<v Speaker 4>have to put up with it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a perfectly valid argument.</v>

612
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.390
<v Speaker 4>And he's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well no,</v>

613
00:29:55.391 --> 00:29:56.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

614
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.330
<v Speaker 4>people are born into their sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>proclivity.</v>

615
00:29:58.331 --> 00:29:59.164
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm not saying that they are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm not making either of those </v>

616
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:02.614
<v Speaker 4>courses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I am pointing out is that the </v>

617
00:30:03.881 --> 00:30:04.714
<v Speaker 4>legislation and policies of that sword </v>
<v Speaker 4>as currently formulated actually </v>

618
00:30:07.691 --> 00:30:08.524
<v Speaker 4>undermine the very arguments that many </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the activists groups have been using </v>

619
00:30:11.621 --> 00:30:13.790
<v Speaker 4>to promote the fact that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are,</v>

620
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.143
<v Speaker 4>they're deserving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say that they're deserving of </v>

621
00:30:18.281 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of their non standard identity,</v>

622
00:30:20.531 --> 00:30:22.750
<v Speaker 4>that the nonstandard identities is </v>
<v Speaker 4>justifiable.</v>

623
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 4>If your sexual proclivity is nothing but</v>
<v Speaker 4>a whim,</v>

624
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:27.230
<v Speaker 4>then why should I put up with it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

625
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.353
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's perfectly reasonable for me to say </v>

626
00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

627
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll just reshape it because you're in,</v>

628
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.580
<v Speaker 4>you're infinitely malleable now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know it,</v>

629
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.433
<v Speaker 4>it isn't exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't exactly know the degree to </v>

630
00:30:37.871 --> 00:30:38.704
<v Speaker 4>which such things as let's say sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity and sexual proclivity are </v>

631
00:30:42.221 --> 00:30:45.370
<v Speaker 4>biologically predicated or socio </v>
<v Speaker 4>culturally instantiated,</v>

632
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.773
<v Speaker 4>but when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you put forward legislation that </v>

633
00:30:48.731 --> 00:30:51.130
<v Speaker 4>insists on one to the exclusion of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>

634
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 4>you better be careful because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be hooked,</v>

635
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.153
<v Speaker 4>hooked in your own news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when I read through the </v>

636
00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 4>legislation and the policies that </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounded that,</v>

637
00:30:58.271 --> 00:30:59.104
<v Speaker 4>I thought this isn't going to protect </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that it's supposed to </v>

638
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:01.744
<v Speaker 4>protect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't matter because the </v>

639
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:05.020
<v Speaker 4>legislation was never designed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>protect people.</v>

640
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.140
<v Speaker 4>It was designed to advance a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of political agenda,</v>

641
00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.600
<v Speaker 4>which is partly why I'm objecting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm objecting to it,</v>

642
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.123
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not willing in the slightest to </v>
<v Speaker 4>presume that just because activist </v>

643
00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:19.840
<v Speaker 4>groups with this postmodern Neil Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 4>ethic stand up and say,</v>

644
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:21.610
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're on the side of the oppressed,</v>

645
00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:25.000
<v Speaker 4>that that makes them a on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the oppressed or be virtuous.</v>

646
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:25.983
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy either of those arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they stand for what they </v>

647
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:29.044
<v Speaker 4>say they stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're promoting a </v>

648
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:32.710
<v Speaker 4>doctrine that is going to do what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>claim it will do.</v>

649
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that they're good in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of the world,</v>

650
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:35.944
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy their oppressor victim </v>

651
00:31:37.571 --> 00:31:38.404
<v Speaker 4>dichotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't admire their philosophical </v>

652
00:31:40.091 --> 00:31:40.924
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they don't know anything about </v>

653
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:44.560
<v Speaker 4>history or if they do know anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>about history,</v>

654
00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:45.394
<v Speaker 4>then they're malevolent for pursuing </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same policies that led us </v>

655
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:49.084
<v Speaker 4>into terrible situations before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in what ways do you think the </v>

656
00:31:51.881 --> 00:31:52.714
<v Speaker 4>policies that are being advocated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you could talk a bit about the </v>

657
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 4>particular harms you think that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadian bill would have,</v>

658
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:05.280
<v Speaker 4>even if we don't accept the theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 4>or political or historical rationale for</v>

659
00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.053
<v Speaker 4>the bail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could it be that it's still produces </v>

660
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:09.844
<v Speaker 4>good consequences or do you think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there is even a consequentialist </v>

661
00:32:11.981 --> 00:32:13.870
<v Speaker 4>argument against this sort of bill?</v>

662
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 4>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

663
00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:15.964
<v Speaker 4>The big letters that I've received from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the transsexual people I described </v>

664
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:19.354
<v Speaker 4>indicate instantly that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>producing positive positive effects at </v>

665
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:24.340
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said after saying,</v>

666
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.653
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our political views aren't homogenous </v>

667
00:32:27.761 --> 00:32:29.650
<v Speaker 4>and we don't like being treated as if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>

668
00:32:29.651 --> 00:32:32.830
<v Speaker 4>And these activists don't speak for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>

669
00:32:32.831 --> 00:32:33.664
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of us would just like to be a </v>

670
00:32:34.481 --> 00:32:35.314
<v Speaker 4>little bit more invisible if we could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all this terrible concentration on </v>

671
00:32:38.741 --> 00:32:42.350
<v Speaker 4>preferred pronouns and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and identification of transsexual people</v>

672
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:45.380
<v Speaker 4>has made our lives a living hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well and no wonder,</v>

673
00:32:45.381 --> 00:32:48.830
<v Speaker 4>because it's hard to imagine you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine that you are having real trouble</v>

674
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:50.210
<v Speaker 4>with your gender identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

675
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:53.420
<v Speaker 4>and you're a six foot one guy and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to transform yourself into a woman.</v>

676
00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be hard enough for you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

677
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.473
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I invisible in a socially </v>

678
00:32:58.101 --> 00:32:58.934
<v Speaker 4>acceptable way without a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who purport to be speaking on your </v>

679
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:02.684
<v Speaker 4>behalf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making this like issue do juror for </v>

680
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:05.600
<v Speaker 4>their political reasons.</v>

681
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 4>And that's exactly what the letter </v>
<v Speaker 4>writers have been telling me.</v>

682
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So no,</v>

683
00:33:09.891 --> 00:33:11.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see that.</v>

684
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the legislation is,</v>

685
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:14.683
<v Speaker 4>was incoherent as originally formulated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it was made worse by its shopping </v>

686
00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:19.004
<v Speaker 4>before activist groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There no evidence whatsoever that will </v>

687
00:33:21.261 --> 00:33:22.094
<v Speaker 4>have the outcomes that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the people who formulated it </v>

688
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.453
<v Speaker 4>hypothetically desire because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe that they desire the best </v>

689
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:30.320
<v Speaker 4>possible outcome anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people look,</v>

690
00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:31.154
<v Speaker 4>the people who are formulating these </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorts of policies state quite </v>

691
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.600
<v Speaker 4>forthrightly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so for example,</v>

692
00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:37.550
<v Speaker 4>if you go look at women's studies </v>
<v Speaker 4>websites,</v>

693
00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:38.384
<v Speaker 4>they state quite forthrightly that their</v>
<v Speaker 4>aim is the destruction of the </v>

694
00:33:41.361 --> 00:33:43.310
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the hell that is.</v>

695
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.310
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that that's a good indication of the</v>

696
00:33:46.311 --> 00:33:49.940
<v Speaker 4>level of intellectual sophistication </v>
<v Speaker 4>that goes into this sort of thinking.</v>

697
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.350
<v Speaker 4>What is this patriarchy exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

698
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.320
<v Speaker 4>what is it exactly?</v>

699
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:55.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we're going to talk about it,</v>

700
00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:56.450
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

701
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.540
<v Speaker 4>it's male domination of everything and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing but oppression.</v>

702
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:00.733
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really that's how we're going to define </v>

703
00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:03.860
<v Speaker 4>our society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it compared to what society?</v>

704
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.723
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where if people be more free than they </v>

705
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:07.251
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

706
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:08.084
<v Speaker 4>in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean they're perfectly </v>

707
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:10.341
<v Speaker 4>free,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

708
00:34:10.341 --> 00:34:12.080
<v Speaker 4>forget that that's never going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

709
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.670
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

710
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.430
<v Speaker 4>this is an oppressive place compared to </v>
<v Speaker 4>my height,</v>

711
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.910
<v Speaker 4>the hypothetical utopia that I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>produce if I happen to be,</v>

712
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.833
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

713
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 4>stolen for a week and are as I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I've always,</v>

714
00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 4>as I've already pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were the,</v>

715
00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:30.450
<v Speaker 4>the hypothetical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

716
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:31.303
<v Speaker 4>altruistic Utopian of your imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the people right behind you and </v>

717
00:34:35.271 --> 00:34:36.104
<v Speaker 4>your bloody revolution would stab you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>death in your bed and you wouldn't get </v>

718
00:34:38.361 --> 00:34:41.840
<v Speaker 4>to make your decisions for the benefit </v>
<v Speaker 4>of anyone every anyways.</v>

719
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.273
<v Speaker 4>So how do you think progress should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>made in a world where we are freer than </v>

720
00:34:47.601 --> 00:34:49.280
<v Speaker 4>we have ever been?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think we,</v>

721
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.143
<v Speaker 4>like when are there changes that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>desirable to be made and how would you </v>

722
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:53.834
<v Speaker 4>want to see them implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if not through policy or through </v>

723
00:34:56.571 --> 00:34:57.404
<v Speaker 4>activism?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way that certain groups currently </v>

724
00:34:58.821 --> 00:35:00.020
<v Speaker 4>are promotable back?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

725
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.003
<v Speaker 4>this happened in the 60s as far as I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell that we've got this misbegotten </v>

726
00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:06.200
<v Speaker 4>idea that the way to conduct yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

727
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.730
<v Speaker 4>as a responsible human being was to hold</v>
<v Speaker 4>plaque cards up to protest,</v>

728
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.780
<v Speaker 4>to change the viewpoints of other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and thereby usher in the utopia.</v>

729
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:15.471
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

730
00:35:15.471 --> 00:35:16.304
<v Speaker 4>I think that's all appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's appalling and I think it's </v>

731
00:35:19.491 --> 00:35:20.324
<v Speaker 4>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely observed that students </v>

732
00:35:22.431 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 4>are taught that that's the way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>conduct themselves in the world.</v>

733
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.813
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're 19 or 20 or 21 you don't </v>

734
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 4>bloody well know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You haven't done anything.</v>

735
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.900
<v Speaker 4>You don't know anything about history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You haven't read anything.</v>

736
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:35.330
<v Speaker 4>You haven't supported yourself for any </v>
<v Speaker 4>length of time.</v>

737
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 4>You've been entirely dependent on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>state and on</v>

738
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.933
<v Speaker 2>your family for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the brief few years of your </v>

739
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:41.694
<v Speaker 2>existence and the idea that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough wisdom to determine how society </v>

740
00:35:44.761 --> 00:35:45.594
<v Speaker 2>should be reconstructed when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in the absolute lap of luxury </v>

741
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 2>protected by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

742
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.430
<v Speaker 2>by processes that you don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>is absolutely,</v>

743
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a bad,</v>

744
00:35:56.641 --> 00:35:58.440
<v Speaker 2>let's call that a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

745
00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.353
<v Speaker 2>She all wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the idea that what you should </v>

746
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:04.164
<v Speaker 2>do to change the world is to find people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you disagree with in shake paper on </v>

747
00:36:07.141 --> 00:36:10.370
<v Speaker 2>sticks at them and call them names is </v>
<v Speaker 2>also so,</v>

748
00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:14.340
<v Speaker 2>and then you do that before you go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>for here.</v>

749
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:15.343
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you how serious the activists </v>

750
00:36:16.621 --> 00:36:17.454
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that's just </v>

751
00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:19.920
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably comical as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

752
00:36:19.921 --> 00:36:22.110
<v Speaker 2>So some of you may know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

753
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:24.750
<v Speaker 2>I participated in a debate on free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

754
00:36:24.751 --> 00:36:27.780
<v Speaker 2>so called debate at free speech that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto hosted.</v>

755
00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned into a forum and,</v>

756
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.750
<v Speaker 2>and whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly not a debate.</v>

757
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.350
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things I did when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to the university administration</v>

758
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.300
<v Speaker 2>was to suggest how they might deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of protestors.</v>

759
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.171
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

760
00:36:43.171 --> 00:36:44.004
<v Speaker 2>that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can know how you can have absolutely </v>

761
00:36:45.121 --> 00:36:46.920
<v Speaker 2>zero protesters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

762
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:49.350
<v Speaker 2>habit in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't get out of bed in the town.</v>

763
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:53.603
<v Speaker 2>So we had it at nine o'clock in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and there was one MP member of </v>

764
00:36:57.301 --> 00:36:58.134
<v Speaker 2>parliament who showed up to hand out </v>
<v Speaker 2>some pamphlets and not a single </v>

765
00:37:00.211 --> 00:37:01.200
<v Speaker 2>protester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

766
00:37:01.201 --> 00:37:03.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you want a controversial </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaker on campus,</v>

767
00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:04.524
<v Speaker 2>just have it at seven in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't get a protestor within 50 </v>

768
00:37:07.171 --> 00:37:08.004
<v Speaker 2>yards of it because they'll still be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping off last night's part and the </v>

769
00:37:10.521 --> 00:37:11.940
<v Speaker 2>alcohol induced hangover.</v>

770
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

771
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.630
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me know when this question was.</v>

772
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.553
<v Speaker 2>What do I think people should do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you something that's been </v>

773
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:26.730
<v Speaker 2>very interesting to me and I can see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflected here.</v>

774
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.050
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I've noticed is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

775
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.890
<v Speaker 2>when I started putting my videos on </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>

776
00:37:31.891 --> 00:37:32.724
<v Speaker 2>which was about three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that about 85% of the people </v>

777
00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:35.994
<v Speaker 2>that were watching the more men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought that's pretty weird </v>

778
00:37:38.221 --> 00:37:40.290
<v Speaker 2>because about 80% of my students are </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

779
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.183
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because men are bailing out of </v>

780
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:43.014
<v Speaker 2>universities like mad and there won't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>one in the social sciences and </v>

781
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 2>humanities left in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

782
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.870
<v Speaker 2>nobody seems particularly worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

783
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.730
<v Speaker 2>You can go look that up online if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

784
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:51.564
<v Speaker 2>and look at the enrollment curves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just project them 10 years out into the </v>

785
00:37:54.121 --> 00:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd been following that for about 20</v>

786
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:56.790
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

787
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:58.470
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but online it was,</v>

788
00:37:58.471 --> 00:38:00.300
<v Speaker 2>so it was 85% men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

789
00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:01.860
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really weird and strange.</v>

790
00:38:01.861 --> 00:38:06.861
<v Speaker 2>And then I made these political videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it popped up to 91% men.</v>

791
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.113
<v Speaker 2>And then I've noticed in the audiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've gone to talk to that it's </v>

792
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:13.290
<v Speaker 2>almost all men now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just look around here man.</v>

793
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

794
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.710
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be 90% guys in this audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

795
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:19.080
<v Speaker 2>what the Hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

796
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.063
<v Speaker 2>And I noticed that at the first free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech debate at the University of </v>

797
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.341
<v Speaker 2>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a point of it.</v>

798
00:38:23.341 --> 00:38:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I walked into the room and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

799
00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:25.554
<v Speaker 2>these are all men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had the stand up and the women </v>

800
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:27.864
<v Speaker 2>stand up and I used that as an example </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the fact that maybe men and women </v>

801
00:38:30.781 --> 00:38:32.010
<v Speaker 2>have different interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

802
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:33.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just an ad hoc demonstration.</v>

803
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>But it's really been born out by the</v>

804
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 3>demographic analysis of my viewers and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

805
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.093
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>several about 8 million views or </v>

806
00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:43.030
<v Speaker 3>something like that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a pretty big population.</v>

807
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.113
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been talking nonstop about </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal responsibility and about the </v>

808
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:49.300
<v Speaker 3>fact that if you want to change the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

809
00:38:49.301 --> 00:38:50.134
<v Speaker 3>you should bloody well get your act </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and quit whining and sniveling </v>

810
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:52.924
<v Speaker 3>about how horrible everything is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how people will you more rights </v>

811
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:56.104
<v Speaker 3>and more privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for some reason that seems to be a </v>

812
00:38:58.331 --> 00:39:00.760
<v Speaker 3>message that's really resonating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>among young men.</v>

813
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:02.890
<v Speaker 3>And I think the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

814
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 3>I think young women have enough to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's perhaps part of the reason</v>

815
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:07.900
<v Speaker 3>why the message isn't as necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

816
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to juggle career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to figure out how to have</v>

817
00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:11.374
<v Speaker 3>a family and they don't really have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>question about whether or not that's </v>

818
00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:14.620
<v Speaker 3>useful and proper.</v>

819
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Speaker 3>So they're off doing that and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whatever else they're doing.</v>

820
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.900
<v Speaker 3>But young men seem to have more of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice about that.</v>

821
00:39:19.901 --> 00:39:22.090
<v Speaker 3>And many of them are essentially bailing</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

822
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.870
<v Speaker 3>And it's partly because I think they'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>been well punished for their virtues.</v>

823
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 3>And so I talked to young guys in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular about,</v>

824
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:29.883
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adopting some responsibility and trying </v>

825
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:32.314
<v Speaker 3>to straighten out their lives and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear the load of being properly into </v>

826
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.123
<v Speaker 3>forthrightly move through existence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to become a credit to themselves and </v>

827
00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 3>their community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you should do instead of</v>

828
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.393
<v Speaker 3>waving cards at someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling them to behave more property </v>

829
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:47.290
<v Speaker 3>because you're morally superior to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

830
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 3>and for some reason that message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

831
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.373
<v Speaker 3>it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the sort of message that you </v>

832
00:39:51.401 --> 00:39:53.360
<v Speaker 3>would expect to sell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

833
00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.213
<v Speaker 3>It's the exactly the opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that you would consider a </v>

834
00:39:56.441 --> 00:39:56.970
<v Speaker 3>salable.</v>

835
00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:57.803
<v Speaker 3>But my experience has been that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>young men in particular are so bloody </v>

836
00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:03.940
<v Speaker 3>desperate for that message that they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardly stand themselves.</v>

837
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:05.083
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's no wonder because it's a call </v>

838
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:08.500
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a call to proper being,</v>

839
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:09.334
<v Speaker 3>it's a call to heroic being and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>call for people to adopt their </v>

840
00:40:12.311 --> 00:40:13.144
<v Speaker 3>individual responsibility and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>straighten themselves out and to find </v>

841
00:40:15.401 --> 00:40:18.970
<v Speaker 3>out what they can be like if they took </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the burdens of existence,</v>

842
00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:20.680
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like respectable,</v>

843
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.330
<v Speaker 3>well-educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>articulate,</v>

844
00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:23.164
<v Speaker 3>powerful people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's ducks to the benefit of </v>

845
00:40:25.241 --> 00:40:27.520
<v Speaker 3>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so while it's,</v>

846
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:31.550
<v Speaker 3>so that's where the responsibility lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not interested in the,</v>

847
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I've thought for many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years,</v>

848
00:40:33.761 --> 00:40:35.950
<v Speaker 3>decades really about having a political </v>
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>

849
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.233
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was interested in a political career </v>

850
00:40:37.991 --> 00:40:42.910
<v Speaker 3>when I was 13 and so every five years or</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've probably revisited that.</v>

851
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:45.730
<v Speaker 3>But every time I revisited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came to the same conclusion,</v>

852
00:40:45.731 --> 00:40:46.564
<v Speaker 3>which was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the work that I was doing that was </v>

853
00:40:49.571 --> 00:40:50.404
<v Speaker 3>focused on a philosophy of individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility and trying to identify </v>

854
00:40:53.531 --> 00:40:54.364
<v Speaker 3>how that philosophy had emerged in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>West over thousands of years was more </v>

855
00:40:57.461 --> 00:40:59.770
<v Speaker 3>important than any possible political </v>
<v Speaker 3>action could be.</v>

856
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.820
<v Speaker 3>And I still don't regard what I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>as political in any sense of the word.</v>

857
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:04.654
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's still esophageal most </v>

858
00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:08.050
<v Speaker 3>accurately and there's an element of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

859
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.970
<v Speaker 3>It's theological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

860
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:10.923
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think it's individual </v>

861
00:41:13.511 --> 00:41:14.344
<v Speaker 3>responsibility and the meaning of life </v>
<v Speaker 3>is to be found in the adoption of </v>

862
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:19.900
<v Speaker 3>individual responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the university should be</v>

863
00:41:19.901 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Speaker 3>teaching people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Dr. Peterson,</v>

864
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.670
<v Speaker 3>you've mentioned these ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>

865
00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:28.420
<v Speaker 3>of virtue of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've I think,</v>

866
00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.810
<v Speaker 3>detailed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think students shouldn't do?</v>

867
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.950
<v Speaker 3>And these examples of like protests</v>

868
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.620
<v Speaker 2>and these examples of certain types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>activist tactics.</v>

869
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:37.693
<v Speaker 2>What advice would you have for students?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can students make the changes that </v>

870
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:42.350
<v Speaker 2>they want to make?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Particularly,</v>

871
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:44.210
<v Speaker 2>do you have any advice for students </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

872
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read great books.</v>

873
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

874
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.613
<v Speaker 2>you've got this four year period that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been carved out of your lives by </v>

875
00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:52.810
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

876
00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:53.340
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

877
00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.410
<v Speaker 2>it's given you an identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a high quality identity and freedom</v>

878
00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:58.244
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're not going to get that again </v>

879
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 2>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to,</v>

880
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:01.903
<v Speaker 2>you've got a respectable identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>university student and complete freedom </v>

881
00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:07.820
<v Speaker 2>associated with that or as near as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're ever going to get.</v>

882
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.833
<v Speaker 2>And you've got these unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 2>libraries that are full of the writings </v>

883
00:42:10.851 --> 00:42:11.684
<v Speaker 2>of people who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are intelligent and articulate </v>

884
00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:16.270
<v Speaker 2>beyond comprehension and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

885
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:19.220
<v Speaker 2>and you can go there and you can learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this and you might think,</v>

886
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:20.330
<v Speaker 2>well why should you learn it?</v>

887
00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you learn it to get a job or you </v>

888
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:25.760
<v Speaker 2>learn it to get good grades or you learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to get a degree.</v>

889
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:28.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nonsense.</v>

890
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.323
<v Speaker 2>The reason that you come to university </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be educated is because there is </v>

891
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:32.354
<v Speaker 2>nothing more powerful than someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>is articulate and who can think and </v>

892
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:36.560
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's power,</v>

893
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:37.703
<v Speaker 2>I mean power of the best sort and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority and influence and </v>

894
00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:41.114
<v Speaker 2>respectability and competence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you come to the university to </v>

895
00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:44.594
<v Speaker 2>craft your highest skill and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest skill is to be found in </v>

896
00:42:47.271 --> 00:42:49.730
<v Speaker 2>articulated speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're,</v>

897
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.713
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a master at formulating your </v>

898
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 2>arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you win everything.</v>

899
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.650
<v Speaker 2>And better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you win everything,</v>

900
00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:01.820
<v Speaker 2>everyone around you wins too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because to transform yourself into,</v>

901
00:43:01.821 --> 00:43:02.654
<v Speaker 2>let's consider you consider your </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation into something </v>

902
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:06.014
<v Speaker 2>approximating the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means you shine a light on the whole </v>

903
00:43:08.991 --> 00:43:09.824
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

904
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing more exciting to do than</v>

905
00:43:11.481 --> 00:43:12.314
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing better you can possibly </v>

906
00:43:13.221 --> 00:43:14.054
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to think that you're going to </v>

907
00:43:15.081 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 2>university to be trained to have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like great.</v>

908
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:18.914
<v Speaker 2>That's a hell of a lot better than being</v>
<v Speaker 2>unemployed and covered with cheeto dust </v>

909
00:43:21.591 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 2>while you're snacking away in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your video game in the basement.</v>

910
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:26.620
<v Speaker 2>But it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a,</v>

911
00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 2>and I don't have anything against video </v>
<v Speaker 2>games by the way,</v>

912
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's hardly a triumphant call to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>being in the world.</v>

913
00:43:36.591 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 2>And that's what universities should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling forth.</v>

914
00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:40.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you people,</v>

915
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.620
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what Harvard students are like.</v>

916
00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I taught here for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You people are spectacular.</v>

917
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.300
<v Speaker 2>You're spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

918
00:43:47.301 --> 00:43:47.990
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

919
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:50.510
<v Speaker 2>you're all capable of being world </v>
<v Speaker 2>beaters.</v>

920
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:51.523
<v Speaker 2>You transform yourself into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's articulated and sensible and </v>

921
00:43:54.441 --> 00:43:56.690
<v Speaker 2>grounded in history and knowledgeable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wise.</v>

922
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:57.523
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do anything you want and </v>

923
00:43:58.851 --> 00:44:02.120
<v Speaker 2>hopefully anything you want for good </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you have any sense,</v>

924
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:03.043
<v Speaker 2>everything you want to do would be for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the good because there's nothing more </v>

925
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:10.570
<v Speaker 2>compelling or meaningful or or useful in</v>
<v Speaker 2>combating the tragedy of life than to,</v>

926
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.043
<v Speaker 2>than to struggle with all your soul on </v>
<v Speaker 2>behalf of the good and the university's </v>

927
00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:17.600
<v Speaker 2>isn't forgotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt.</v>

928
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.690
<v Speaker 2>It's what everyone's bailing out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanities and they should,</v>

929
00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:21.524
<v Speaker 2>the humanities are corrupt and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt because they're not telling </v>

930
00:44:24.381 --> 00:44:26.540
<v Speaker 2>students this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so bloody obvious.</v>

931
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:27.763
<v Speaker 2>It's like learn to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn to speak loom to it makes you a </v>

932
00:44:32.521 --> 00:44:35.970
<v Speaker 2>super power and individual superpower </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have</v>

933
00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 2>under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm just stand.</v>

934
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Why that isn't just told to students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that hard to understand it.</v>

935
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

936
00:44:44.701 --> 00:44:45.660
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>

937
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>

938
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:47.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

939
00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:52.851
<v Speaker 2>really you could do that and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>society around you is labored for really</v>

940
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:54.413
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years to provide every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single one of you with this spectacular </v>

941
00:44:56.551 --> 00:44:57.384
<v Speaker 2>opportunity that you have while your </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergraduates and graduate students </v>

942
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:00.960
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

943
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:01.794
<v Speaker 2>everyone's just praying that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come here and manifest everything that </v>

944
00:45:05.551 --> 00:45:08.490
<v Speaker 2>you could manifest and that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be doing.</v>

945
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:09.383
<v Speaker 2>Instead of waving plot cards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining about how you're oppressed </v>

946
00:45:12.571 --> 00:45:13.404
<v Speaker 2>for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see these Yale students complaining </v>

947
00:45:15.751 --> 00:45:17.280
<v Speaker 2>about their oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

948
00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:21.210
<v Speaker 2>it just leaves me aghast and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

949
00:45:21.211 --> 00:45:23.100
<v Speaker 2>we're against the ruling class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

950
00:45:23.101 --> 00:45:23.491
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

951
00:45:23.491 --> 00:45:26.190
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your baby ruling class members,</v>

952
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:27.203
<v Speaker 2>you're young.</v>

953
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:32.750
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] the</v>

954
00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.030
<v Speaker 2>only reason you're not rich is cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're young.</v>

955
00:45:37.031 --> 00:45:37.960
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best.</v>

956
00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

957
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:43.120
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the 1%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the dreaded 1% you know,</v>

958
00:45:43.121 --> 00:45:45.940
<v Speaker 2>most of those people are old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

959
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you progress through life,</v>

960
00:45:47.891 --> 00:45:48.724
<v Speaker 2>if you're reasonably successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you trade in your promising youth for </v>

961
00:45:51.881 --> 00:45:52.714
<v Speaker 2>your wealthy old age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're still blooding old when you </v>

962
00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:58.720
<v Speaker 2>trade it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you trade your youth for that,</v>

963
00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.900
<v Speaker 2>like if you factor age out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic equation,</v>

964
00:46:01.901 --> 00:46:03.070
<v Speaker 2>things look a lot different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One.</v>

965
00:46:03.071 --> 00:46:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>older people have more money.</v>

966
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:05.913
<v Speaker 2>If they have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd been collecting it for their </v>

967
00:46:07.091 --> 00:46:09.040
<v Speaker 2>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that somehow unfair?</v>

968
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.233
<v Speaker 2>It's not unfair unless you want to want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be poverty stricken when you're 70 </v>

969
00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.193
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't want to be poverty </v>

970
00:46:14.831 --> 00:46:19.120
<v Speaker 2>stricken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop poverty stricken when you're 70 so I</v>

971
00:46:19.121 --> 00:46:21.580
<v Speaker 2>just don't understand what's happened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universities.</v>

972
00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that you're not told </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you come the first day,</v>

973
00:46:25.091 --> 00:46:26.410
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are on,</v>

974
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.273
<v Speaker 2>you're here on a heroic mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to take your capacity to </v>

975
00:46:30.131 --> 00:46:33.100
<v Speaker 2>articulate yourself to levels that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>undreamed of,</v>

976
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:35.470
<v Speaker 2>you're going to come out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm unstoppable.</v>

977
00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.270
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be able to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

978
00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's what you're here for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

979
00:46:40.141 --> 00:46:41.380
<v Speaker 2>you're taught that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

980
00:46:41.381 --> 00:46:42.214
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world's a pretty oppressive place </v>

981
00:46:43.211 --> 00:46:45.250
<v Speaker 2>and you're probably the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>victim pile.</v>

982
00:46:45.251 --> 00:46:45.881
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

983
00:46:45.881 --> 00:46:46.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>

984
00:46:46.841 --> 00:46:47.674
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's virtually nothing you can do </v>

985
00:46:48.881 --> 00:46:49.900
<v Speaker 2>about it except,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

986
00:46:49.901 --> 00:46:50.734
<v Speaker 2>deconstruct the patriarchy and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>rude deed and so pathetic that that </v>

987
00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.013
<v Speaker 2>university should be embarrassed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're peddling to </v>

988
00:46:57.821 --> 00:47:00.040
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm embarrassed by it.</v>

989
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:01.263
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gone on public record telling </v>

990
00:47:02.501 --> 00:47:03.490
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody well,</v>

991
00:47:03.491 --> 00:47:07.360
<v Speaker 2>send your boys to trade school because </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least they'll learn something useful.</v>

992
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.433
<v Speaker 2>And that's a terrible thing for someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>like me to say it because I do believe </v>

993
00:47:11.171 --> 00:47:12.004
<v Speaker 2>that the are being articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an educated in the highest possible </v>

994
00:47:16.271 --> 00:47:17.104
<v Speaker 2>manner is there's nothing that's better </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you and for society and why are the </v>

995
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:23.170
<v Speaker 2>why of the university's forgotten this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

996
00:47:23.171 --> 00:47:24.004
<v Speaker 2>that's postmodern neo Marxism for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that then the philosophy of </v>

997
00:47:27.341 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 2>intense resentment and oppression and </v>
<v Speaker 2>group identity and god,</v>

998
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.093
<v Speaker 2>it's just pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That reason I think a lot of students </v>

999
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:39.190
<v Speaker 2>here would agree with you that one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the main purposes of,</v>

1000
00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:40.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>education and college,</v>

1001
00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:41.254
<v Speaker 2>particularly at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to develop their sense of </v>

1002
00:47:43.241 --> 00:47:44.860
<v Speaker 2>articulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ability to read,</v>

1003
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:46.810
<v Speaker 2>their ability to create a critically </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

1004
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Then what comes after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly at Harvard,</v>

1005
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:51.970
<v Speaker 2>there's a big discussion on what is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good life,</v>

1006
00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to use those skills </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we get here and then we graduate.</v>

1007
00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.560
<v Speaker 2>What do we do from there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

1008
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.960
<v Speaker 2>Unnecessary suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you do.</v>

1009
00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.080
<v Speaker 2>You know that that's your calling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you say,</v>

1010
00:48:08.081 --> 00:48:09.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do after you graduate?</v>

1011
00:48:09.611 --> 00:48:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you graduate,</v>

1012
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:12.063
<v Speaker 2>articulated and powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be people giving you so many </v>

1013
00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:16.174
<v Speaker 2>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't even be able to keep up with </v>

1014
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:18.851
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1015
00:48:18.851 --> 00:48:20.830
<v Speaker 2>and I've worked with comp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1016
00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:23.470
<v Speaker 2>very competent people in many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>domains in my life.</v>

1017
00:48:23.471 --> 00:48:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Hyper competent people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you some very interesting</v>

1018
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:27.574
<v Speaker 2>things about hyper competent people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing is they are not selfish </v>

1019
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:31.803
<v Speaker 2>and they're not greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the great pleasures in their </v>

1020
00:48:33.791 --> 00:48:34.624
<v Speaker 2>lives is to find people who have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to also be hyper competent and </v>

1021
00:48:38.351 --> 00:48:41.350
<v Speaker 2>to open doors for them as rapidly as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can possibly be opened.</v>

1022
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.920
<v Speaker 2>They delight in that because there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing there.</v>

1023
00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:46.900
<v Speaker 2>There's just very few things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>more intrinsically meaningful.</v>

1024
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:48.003
<v Speaker 2>If you're an accomplished person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then to find young people who have the </v>

1025
00:48:50.111 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 2>possibility of being accomplished and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1026
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.010
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an opportunity for you.</v>

1027
00:48:54.011 --> 00:48:55.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like go out there man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill it.</v>

1028
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.120
<v Speaker 2>And then they go up there and kill it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think right on man,</v>

1029
00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.090
<v Speaker 2>here's another opportunity to go ahead </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go there.</v>

1030
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Nail that to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1031
00:49:02.201 --> 00:49:03.034
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all holding their wealth and </v>

1032
00:49:03.761 --> 00:49:05.050
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to share it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

1033
00:49:05.051 --> 00:49:07.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's absolute complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>rubbish.</v>

1034
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:08.343
<v Speaker 2>And so you don't even have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what you're going to do after you </v>

1035
00:49:10.301 --> 00:49:11.440
<v Speaker 2>graduate from here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

1036
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.750
<v Speaker 2>if you turn yourself into half of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be,</v>

1037
00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:14.584
<v Speaker 2>because people will be dying to offer </v>
<v Speaker 2>you every opportunity that you can </v>

1038
00:49:17.351 --> 00:49:20.260
<v Speaker 2>possibly make use of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1039
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:21.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a moot point.</v>

1040
00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:22.180
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1041
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.013
<v Speaker 2>the world is always desperately short of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who can think and speak and you </v>

1042
00:49:27.311 --> 00:49:28.020
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1043
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.760
<v Speaker 2>I won't be made use of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1044
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.780
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say that if you're an F,</v>

1045
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 2>if you're at Harvard for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1046
00:49:34.001 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 2>people already figured out who you are.</v>

1047
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.760
<v Speaker 2>They've already figured it out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're offering you the world on a,</v>

1048
00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.320
<v Speaker 2>on a gold platter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It take it,</v>

1049
00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:42.820
<v Speaker 2>it's yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take it.</v>

1050
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great man.</v>

1051
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Put yourself together and deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be great.</v>

1052
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:50.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's what everyone wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what your parents want.</v>

1053
00:49:50.261 --> 00:49:52.050
<v Speaker 2>It's also what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know it,</v>

1054
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 2>it's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what men,</v>

1055
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.550
<v Speaker 2>it's what women want from men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what men want from women.</v>

1056
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:58.743
<v Speaker 2>It's like for you to be who you could be</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the highest faculty of the </v>

1057
00:50:02.441 --> 00:50:05.400
<v Speaker 2>human being is articulated speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1058
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.250
<v Speaker 2>it's the divine faculty and there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing more powerful than that.</v>

1059
00:50:09.251 --> 00:50:11.920
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that's even in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>league,</v>

1060
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.890
<v Speaker 2>and so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have faith in that,</v>

1061
00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 2>then your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your priorities are misplaced and I</v>

1062
00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:20.560
<v Speaker 2>can't even understand why you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have faith in that being,</v>

1063
00:50:20.561 --> 00:50:23.470
<v Speaker 2>say Harvard students because look where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got you already.</v>

1064
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.260
<v Speaker 2>You know you're already sitting on top </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>

1065
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.840
<v Speaker 2>so make deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make use of it,</v>

1066
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go out there and fix things up.</v>

1067
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.013
<v Speaker 2>That's what you need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of things that need to be </v>

1068
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:35.324
<v Speaker 2>fixed up and what you want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden yourself with so much </v>

1069
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:38.534
<v Speaker 2>responsibility that you can barely stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you'll get stronger trying to </v>

1070
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:44.060
<v Speaker 2>lift it up and you'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't be asking,</v>

1071
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:45.103
<v Speaker 2>what should I be doing with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or what's the meaning of life or any of </v>

1072
00:50:47.241 --> 00:50:48.530
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be self evident.</v>

1073
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 2>It's self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At minimum.</v>

1074
00:50:50.841 --> 00:50:53.990
<v Speaker 2>You can say there's more suffering in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and there should be,</v>

1075
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:54.883
<v Speaker 2>and I could probably do something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and you can do something about </v>

1076
00:50:57.261 --> 00:50:59.250
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So go do something about it.</v>

1077
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.040
<v Speaker 2>And then there'll be less suffering in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1078
00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:03.500
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're 80 you can look </v>
<v Speaker 2>back on your life and say,</v>

1079
00:51:03.501 --> 00:51:04.334
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1080
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:07.400
<v Speaker 2>there's less suffering in the world than</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and there would have been had.</v>

1081
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.233
<v Speaker 2>I know it existed and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't have to even have a sense </v>

1082
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:12.464
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ultimate destiny or even any sort of </v>

1083
00:51:14.031 --> 00:51:17.120
<v Speaker 2>theistic belief to regard that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive good.</v>

1084
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.103
<v Speaker 2>Like I think it goes beyond the mere </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic utility of addressing the </v>

1085
00:51:21.831 --> 00:51:23.860
<v Speaker 2>world's ills because I think we do live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1086
00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:24.843
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a world that has a transcendent </v>

1087
00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:28.880
<v Speaker 2>reality as well as the reality that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can detect.</v>

1088
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:31.250
<v Speaker 2>But even independently if that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

1089
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1090
00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:35.750
<v Speaker 2>this is part of the reason I like people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Bill Gates is a great example,</v>

1091
00:51:35.751 --> 00:51:36.471
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is,</v>

1092
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:39.560
<v Speaker 2>he's after five major diseases at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time,</v>

1093
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to wipe out polio.</v>

1094
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:45.200
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to wipe out</v>
<v Speaker 2>malaria.</v>

1095
00:51:45.201 --> 00:51:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1096
00:51:46.281 --> 00:51:47.900
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to wipe out malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1097
00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:50.300
<v Speaker 2>well what should you do with your life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1098
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a look at Bill Gates and see if you</v>

1099
00:51:52.821 --> 00:51:54.590
<v Speaker 2>could do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be good.</v>

1100
00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:57.483
<v Speaker 2>So I said after a penis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you talk about this idea of ending </v>

1101
00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.253
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary suffering and this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>committing one's life to that at a </v>

1102
00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:07.190
<v Speaker 2>minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the minimum thing that you</v>

1103
00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:10.010
<v Speaker 2>could do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of students I think,</v>

1104
00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:10.903
<v Speaker 2>accept that premise and view what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing as trying to eliminate or </v>

1105
00:52:14.721 --> 00:52:15.554
<v Speaker 2>reduce unnecessary suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they see activism or other forms of </v>

1106
00:52:18.531 --> 00:52:19.364
<v Speaker 2>direct service as fulfilling that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you simply disagree with like the </v>

1107
00:52:22.671 --> 00:52:23.504
<v Speaker 2>content of what they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tactic that they are using to end </v>

1108
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:27.854
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do you think that their motives or </v>

1109
00:52:29.991 --> 00:52:33.050
<v Speaker 2>their intentions are not even the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>as yours?</v>

1110
00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.750
<v Speaker 2>It's too public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1111
00:52:40.751 --> 00:52:41.590
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

1112
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:45.610
<v Speaker 2>there's this old saying from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the new testament about not praying</v>

1113
00:52:45.611 --> 00:52:47.260
<v Speaker 2>in public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1114
00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.530
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>commune for the higher good,</v>

1115
00:52:50.531 --> 00:52:51.364
<v Speaker 2>you should do it in private because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you're warping your ethic in </v>

1116
00:52:53.561 --> 00:52:57.370
<v Speaker 2>some sense by demonstrating how virtuous</v>
<v Speaker 2>you virtuous you are to the world.</v>

1117
00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:58.453
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1118
00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.610
<v Speaker 2>you go out there with a stick and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sign on,</v>

1119
00:53:00.611 --> 00:53:02.350
<v Speaker 2>if it says I'm against poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1120
00:53:02.351 --> 00:53:03.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no kidding man.</v>

1121
00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was for poverty.</v>

1122
00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:09.760
<v Speaker 2>No one's core poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1123
00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1124
00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.553
<v Speaker 2>it's an abdication of responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the mask of social virtue and you </v>

1125
00:53:14.771 --> 00:53:15.604
<v Speaker 2>want to solve difficult problems to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to get along with your </v>

1126
00:53:17.441 --> 00:53:18.274
<v Speaker 2>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one you've been fighting with for </v>

1127
00:53:18.941 --> 00:53:19.774
<v Speaker 2>five years there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you can staple your family back </v>

1128
00:53:21.401 --> 00:53:22.234
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if he can stop fighting with your </v>

1129
00:53:23.411 --> 00:53:26.370
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend and have a relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 2>for more than two weeks,</v>

1130
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:27.623
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like there are things that you </v>

1131
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:32.100
<v Speaker 4>should be doing in the confines of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>own life that are private and humble,</v>

1132
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.083
<v Speaker 4>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would constitute genuine </v>

1133
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 4>accomplishments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those are the things that you should</v>

1134
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:37.254
<v Speaker 4>attend to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And no one's going to come along and </v>

1135
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:38.641
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1136
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:39.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good job.</v>

1137
00:53:39.721 --> 00:53:42.030
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're changing the world because it's,</v>

1138
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.950
<v Speaker 4>it's private,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's real.</v>

1139
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.870
<v Speaker 4>And then people don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1140
00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:46.440
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1141
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't trust the activists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't trust the activist ethos at all.</v>

1142
00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:51.740
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1143
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:56.780
<v Speaker 4>I think everything about it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is superficial and,</v>

1144
00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:01.920
<v Speaker 4>and trendy and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and too easy and,</v>

1145
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:06.990
<v Speaker 4>and it externalizes the blame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The evil is always the elsewhere,</v>

1146
00:54:06.991 --> 00:54:10.830
<v Speaker 4>which is a dreadful mistake to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the evil isn't elsewhere.</v>

1147
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:11.664
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing that you understand </v>

1148
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:15.870
<v Speaker 4>when you're wise is the evil is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>elsewhere.</v>

1149
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:19.140
<v Speaker 4>It's you because you're not everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could be.</v>

1150
00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:20.341
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1151
00:54:20.341 --> 00:54:22.440
<v Speaker 4>you should work on that before going in </v>
<v Speaker 4>talent.</v>

1152
00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.420
<v Speaker 4>Someone else that maybe they're not who </v>
<v Speaker 4>they should be.</v>

1153
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.950
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1154
00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:28.230
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't buy it.</v>

1155
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:29.064
<v Speaker 4>It's too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's far too easy and it's too public </v>

1156
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:32.483
<v Speaker 4>and it's too self congratulatory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the murderous like </v>

1157
00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:35.970
<v Speaker 4>Marxist element,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

1158
00:54:35.971 --> 00:54:38.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always often inclined to mention.</v>

1159
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:40.523
<v Speaker 4>So certainly I think you've identified </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain causes where the public element </v>

1160
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:49.980
<v Speaker 4>or the self congratulatory version I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do good could be harmful.</v>

1161
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.900
<v Speaker 4>But do you think there are cases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>

1162
00:54:51.901 --> 00:54:55.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking of policy influencing </v>
<v Speaker 4>policy and being a policy maker.</v>

1163
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:56.423
<v Speaker 4>It seems like something like that public</v>
<v Speaker 4>policy could be used to eliminate some </v>

1164
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:05.460
<v Speaker 4>unnecessary suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but would involve a more public domain.</v>

1165
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.760
<v Speaker 4>Something where you are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>attract followers,</v>

1166
00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:10.620
<v Speaker 4>trying to attract praise from other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1167
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:11.281
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1168
00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:12.114
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've established yourself in the </v>

1169
00:55:13.531 --> 00:55:14.364
<v Speaker 4>world as a credible human being and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are asking you to enter public </v>

1170
00:55:19.291 --> 00:55:22.620
<v Speaker 4>service because of your accomplishments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's time to do it,</v>

1171
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:25.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But before that,</v>

1172
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.360
<v Speaker 4>it's a little on the premature site.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're just setting your for self</v>

1173
00:55:29.361 --> 00:55:32.250
<v Speaker 4>forward as an Avatar of an idiot of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideology,</v>

1174
00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:33.323
<v Speaker 4>then there's nothing to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Except I think of it as the chattering </v>

1175
00:55:35.671 --> 00:55:39.030
<v Speaker 4>of various forms of demons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're not helpful.</v>

1176
00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:40.770
<v Speaker 4>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look,</v>

1177
00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:41.521
<v Speaker 4>you want to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1178
00:55:41.521 --> 00:55:43.310
<v Speaker 4>are you fit to lead?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1179
00:55:43.311 --> 00:55:44.640
<v Speaker 4>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1180
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.830
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know where you're going?</v>

1181
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.990
<v Speaker 4>Because that's actually one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hallmarks of a leader.</v>

1182
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:49.824
<v Speaker 4>Leader knows where he's going and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people are also interested in </v>

1183
00:55:52.381 --> 00:55:53.214
<v Speaker 4>going that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the leaders I've met have carved </v>

1184
00:55:55.141 --> 00:55:57.360
<v Speaker 4>themselves out a personal vision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1185
00:55:57.361 --> 00:55:58.194
<v Speaker 4>He's not some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not some cookie cutter ideological </v>

1186
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.500
<v Speaker 4>solution to the ills of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've done a detailed analysis,</v>

1187
00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:06.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know what they're talking about and</v>

1188
00:56:06.421 --> 00:56:07.640
<v Speaker 4>they're usually people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1189
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:10.710
<v Speaker 4>they've had a successful relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've had a successful family,</v>

1190
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.693
<v Speaker 4>they have a couple of degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've established a business like </v>

1191
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 4>they've made themselves credible in five</v>
<v Speaker 4>or six dimensions.</v>

1192
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:17.933
<v Speaker 4>Well then maybe you know enough about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world to dare to mess with its </v>

1193
00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:22.500
<v Speaker 4>internal mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you,</v>

1194
00:56:22.501 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have that kind of in depth</v>

1195
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.330
<v Speaker 3>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you should just,</v>

1196
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.433
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should know more work on the </v>

1197
00:56:27.941 --> 00:56:30.520
<v Speaker 3>economic systems of Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

1198
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:31.503
<v Speaker 3>Then you should try to adjust the </v>
<v Speaker 3>electronic systems of your automobile </v>

1199
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:39.370
<v Speaker 3>because the latter is far less complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the former.</v>

1200
00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 3>So of course there's utility in policy </v>
<v Speaker 3>formulation and in,</v>

1201
00:56:42.761 --> 00:56:45.220
<v Speaker 3>in government service and in all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those sorts of things,</v>

1202
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:48.910
<v Speaker 3>but you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have transformed yourself at</v>

1203
00:56:48.911 --> 00:56:49.744
<v Speaker 3>least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into someone who's actually competent </v>

1204
00:56:51.401 --> 00:56:53.620
<v Speaker 3>before you should even dare to do such </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1205
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:54.610
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1206
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:57.440
<v Speaker 3>I have read some marks and now I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to change the world.</v>

1207
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:01.563
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very bad idea because the </v>

1208
00:57:02.541 --> 00:57:03.374
<v Speaker 3>probability that you're going to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>something complex that doesn't work too </v>

1209
00:57:05.991 --> 00:57:09.680
<v Speaker 3>badly and fix it with your idiotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>intervention is zero.</v>

1210
00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well put,</v>

1211
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:24.743
<v Speaker 5>we've talked a little bit about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of signaling virtue and one thing </v>

1212
00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:29.773
<v Speaker 5>that I thought about a lot of activists </v>
<v Speaker 5>causes ones you might characterize as </v>

1213
00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:34.183
<v Speaker 5>self congratulatory seem to emphasize </v>
<v Speaker 5>concepts like validation and </v>

1214
00:57:37.311 --> 00:57:39.740
<v Speaker 5>affirmation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In your experience,</v>

1215
00:57:39.741 --> 00:57:42.200
<v Speaker 5>either as a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a psychologist,</v>

1216
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:43.243
<v Speaker 5>do you think that this is an example of </v>
<v Speaker 5>virtue signaling and perhaps provide </v>

1217
00:57:45.711 --> 00:57:49.400
<v Speaker 5>like a definition of virtual virtue </v>
<v Speaker 5>signaling first or do you think there is</v>

1218
00:57:49.401 --> 00:57:52.790
<v Speaker 5>some value in these types of principles </v>
<v Speaker 5>or these types of interactions?</v>

1219
00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:57.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any value in those</v>
<v Speaker 3>principles at all.</v>

1220
00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:58.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can say,</v>

1221
00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a really good guy.</v>

1222
00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:01.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1223
00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.150
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At most,</v>

1224
00:58:04.151 --> 00:58:05.110
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1225
00:58:05.111 --> 00:58:06.420
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cheap and easy,</v>

1226
00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:07.993
<v Speaker 3>and now I'm in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a good guy because he's the one </v>

1227
00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:11.470
<v Speaker 3>perfectly willing to affirm you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

1228
00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:17.920
<v Speaker 3>everyone has a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say with self affirmation.</v>

1229
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:21.220
<v Speaker 3>This is why I hate that word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll use it temporarily.</v>

1230
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:22.623
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is part of the reason why I'm an </v>

1231
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.053
<v Speaker 3>admirer of part in part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>existential philosophers and </v>

1232
00:58:27.641 --> 00:58:28.474
<v Speaker 3>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the points they made is </v>

1233
00:58:30.701 --> 00:58:31.534
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1234
00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:35.920
<v Speaker 3>human beings are flawed creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>W W we have tragic lives.</v>

1235
00:58:35.921 --> 00:58:37.270
<v Speaker 3>We're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very vulnerable.</v>

1236
00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:41.650
<v Speaker 3>And so it's very easy for us to despise </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves and to end,</v>

1237
00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:43.060
<v Speaker 3>to end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to end,</v>

1238
00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:44.380
<v Speaker 3>to be empty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to despise,</v>

1239
00:58:44.381 --> 00:58:47.470
<v Speaker 3>and have contempt for humanity itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are reasons for that.</v>

1240
00:58:47.471 --> 00:58:48.880
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're weak,</v>

1241
00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:51.640
<v Speaker 3>we're flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're malevolent.</v>

1242
00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:54.250
<v Speaker 3>We don't last very long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not very attractive.</v>

1243
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.640
<v Speaker 3>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have an endless litany of faults,</v>

1244
00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:00.310
<v Speaker 3>both as a species and as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1245
00:59:00.311 --> 00:59:01.900
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're stuck with that.</v>

1246
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:05.260
<v Speaker 3>That's just part of being itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's built into the fabric of being.</v>

1247
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.030
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1248
00:59:07.031 --> 00:59:11.140
<v Speaker 3>you don't go around waiting for someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell you what a good person you are.</v>

1249
00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:12.160
<v Speaker 3>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1250
00:59:12.161 --> 00:59:13.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not believable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not helpful.</v>

1251
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:14.713
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean you should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>commenting people into a sense of even </v>

1252
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:21.410
<v Speaker 3>more fallibility than they already have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not clearly,</v>

1253
00:59:21.411 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 3>that's not helpful.</v>

1254
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.670
<v Speaker 2>But the way that you develop an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>

1255
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:28.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of respect for yourself,</v>

1256
00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:29.383
<v Speaker 2>which is a better way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it or respect for humanity for that </v>

1257
00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is much better than thinking about</v>

1258
00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:38.441
<v Speaker 2>it as an affirmation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to bear up under the damn load.</v>

1259
00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:41.810
<v Speaker 2>And then you can recognize yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's flawed,</v>

1260
00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:45.160
<v Speaker 2>but the can tolerate the floor and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can work towards alleviating it.</v>

1261
00:59:45.161 --> 00:59:45.994
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the pathway to the transcendence </v>

1262
00:59:47.841 --> 00:59:48.674
<v Speaker 2>of tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a much like comparing just </v>

1263
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:52.820
<v Speaker 2>affirmation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1264
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.983
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1265
00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.513
<v Speaker 2>you're giving a starving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're giving a thirsty person dust to </v>

1266
01:00:01.371 --> 01:00:02.380
<v Speaker 2>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1267
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.460
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1268
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:05.323
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the people have to commit to being </v>

1269
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 2>in order to withstand their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability and fragility.</v>

1270
01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:15.080
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and essentially flawed nature.</v>

1271
01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:16.663
<v Speaker 2>The way that you tolerate them is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you stand up underneath that is </v>

1272
01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:24.050
<v Speaker 2>to adapt responsibility for it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>your pathways clear.</v>

1273
01:00:24.051 --> 01:00:24.884
<v Speaker 2>Then you can tolerate who you are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you won't hate humanity because </v>

1274
01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:30.950
<v Speaker 2>people hate humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hear the environmentalists,</v>

1275
01:00:30.951 --> 01:00:32.870
<v Speaker 2>the radical environmental is say such </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1276
01:00:32.871 --> 01:00:33.704
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet would be better off without </v>

1277
01:00:35.991 --> 01:00:37.040
<v Speaker 2>people on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1278
01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:37.874
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's keep you away from the hydrogen </v>

1279
01:00:39.321 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 2>bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shall we know when people think that's a</v>

1280
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:42.764
<v Speaker 2>virtuous statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet would be better off without </v>

1281
01:00:44.931 --> 01:00:45.820
<v Speaker 2>people on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1282
01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.990
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're saying.</v>

1283
01:00:47.991 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1284
01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:51.530
<v Speaker 2>You don't think it's okay to be racially</v>
<v Speaker 2>genocidal,</v>

1285
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's perfectly fine to just wipe out</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>

1286
01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.673
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as you're not selective about </v>

1287
01:00:56.451 --> 01:00:58.130
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

1288
01:00:58.131 --> 01:00:58.880
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1289
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.440
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're nourishing.</v>

1290
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.690
<v Speaker 2>People were nourishing young people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1291
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing.</v>

1292
01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're suffering and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder because life is suffering.</v>

1293
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.213
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing you learn if </v>

1294
01:01:08.841 --> 01:01:11.930
<v Speaker 2>you're on the road to wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is suffering.</v>

1295
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is it someone's fault?</v>

1296
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1297
01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:17.750
<v Speaker 2>It's Society's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your fault.</v>

1298
01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:19.700
<v Speaker 2>It's nature's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's God's fault.</v>

1299
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.331
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1300
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:21.560
<v Speaker 2>the faults everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1301
01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:26.780
<v Speaker 2>So what are you gonna do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bear up under it and do something useful</v>

1302
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:29.990
<v Speaker 2>and then you can respect yourself at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least to some degree.</v>

1303
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:32.240
<v Speaker 2>At least you're not contributing to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1304
01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:33.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1305
01:01:33.201 --> 01:01:34.034
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you can start to see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beauty in life and the possibility in </v>

1306
01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:38.990
<v Speaker 2>life and the majesty in life and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1307
01:01:38.991 --> 01:01:43.600
<v Speaker 2>and the incredible capacity of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings for self transformation here.</v>

1308
01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>

1309
01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:48.800
<v Speaker 2>we've learned this relatively recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>and at a neuro biological level,</v>

1310
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:51.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's been an idea,</v>

1311
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:55.760
<v Speaker 2>psychological idea that's floated around</v>
<v Speaker 2>for quite a long time,</v>

1312
01:01:55.761 --> 01:01:56.594
<v Speaker 2>a clinical idea that you expand your </v>
<v Speaker 2>character by aggregating diverse </v>

1313
01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:01.580
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1314
01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:04.430
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of the journey everywhere to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become who you are.</v>

1315
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:08.120
<v Speaker 2>And you can think about that from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a Piagetian perspective,</v>

1316
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:10.310
<v Speaker 2>a constructivist perspective and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1317
01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>the more places you journey to in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1318
01:02:12.561 --> 01:02:14.720
<v Speaker 2>the more information you expose yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1319
01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:15.733
<v Speaker 2>And then you take in that information </v>
<v Speaker 2>and inform yourself with it and you </v>

1320
01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:19.993
<v Speaker 2>develop yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're more differentiated than </v>

1321
01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:23.580
<v Speaker 2>you have a more differentiated view of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1322
01:02:23.581 --> 01:02:24.414
<v Speaker 2>It's like the basic idea is the world is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pool of information that you can use </v>

1323
01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:30.030
<v Speaker 2>to construct yourself out event to </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct the world.</v>

1324
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:33.330
<v Speaker 2>And that's a lovely doctrine and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that to be the case,</v>

1325
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.040
<v Speaker 2>but there's more to it than that.</v>

1326
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know now that if you take someone and</v>

1327
01:02:37.951 --> 01:02:40.020
<v Speaker 2>you put them in in radically new </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

1328
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:43.920
<v Speaker 2>that new genes turn on in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their brain at the micro,</v>

1329
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:44.754
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

1330
01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:48.720
<v Speaker 2>at the microlevel new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new new genetic structure's code for new</v>

1331
01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:49.554
<v Speaker 2>proteins and build new structures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're actually a pool of </v>

1332
01:02:52.381 --> 01:02:53.214
<v Speaker 2>biological possibility and the only way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can determine the full extent </v>

1333
01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:58.350
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that pool,</v>

1334
01:02:58.351 --> 01:03:02.100
<v Speaker 2>of the possibility of that pool is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing yourself out against the world.</v>

1335
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 2>And that will physiologically transform </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1336
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.480
<v Speaker 2>And we have no idea what the limits to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are.</v>

1337
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.970
<v Speaker 2>We know in clinical psychology that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1338
01:03:08.971 --> 01:03:09.804
<v Speaker 2>what you do with people is expose them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the things that they're afraid of </v>

1339
01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:14.820
<v Speaker 2>vendor or avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't make them less afraid by doing</v>

1340
01:03:14.821 --> 01:03:16.110
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make them braver.</v>

1341
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:18.120
<v Speaker 2>That's why it generalizes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1342
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.140
<v Speaker 2>They don't come out saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1343
01:03:19.141 --> 01:03:19.974
<v Speaker 2>the world's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like once you've learned that the </v>

1344
01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:22.950
<v Speaker 2>world is safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not safe,</v>

1345
01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:23.873
<v Speaker 2>there is no going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the post traumatic stress </v>

1346
01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.920
<v Speaker 2>disorder conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no going back.</v>

1347
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:32.280
<v Speaker 2>But what you can learn is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is terribly dangerous,</v>

1348
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:33.263
<v Speaker 2>far more dangerous than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people are far more malevolent than </v>

1349
01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 2>you likely have the imagination to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to conceptualize.</v>

1350
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:41.970
<v Speaker 2>But there is really more to you than you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1351
01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 2>And if you wouldn't look for safe spaces</v>
<v Speaker 2>and retreat,</v>

1352
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:49.260
<v Speaker 2>if you would push out in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept your responsibility and,</v>

1353
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:50.263
<v Speaker 2>and confront your limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you would discover all sorts of </v>

1354
01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:54.630
<v Speaker 2>things about you that you have no idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1355
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:55.763
<v Speaker 2>And then you would transform it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's far more than what you </v>

1356
01:03:57.661 --> 01:03:58.494
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1357
01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.353
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's in that process of continual </v>

1358
01:04:00.931 --> 01:04:04.050
<v Speaker 2>transformation that you'll actually find</v>
<v Speaker 2>the essential meaning of life.</v>

1359
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:05.790
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1360
01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:07.140
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like,</v>

1361
01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.440
<v Speaker 2>it's not like we don't know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows this.</v>

1362
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:11.783
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the universities in some sense </v>

1363
01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:13.873
<v Speaker 2>supposed to remind you of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've abdicated their </v>

1364
01:04:16.441 --> 01:04:17.274
<v Speaker 2>responsibility as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in many cases are working counter </v>

1365
01:04:20.121 --> 01:04:20.954
<v Speaker 2>productively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to teach young people </v>

1366
01:04:22.201 --> 01:04:23.034
<v Speaker 2>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're helpless victims who need </v>

1367
01:04:25.231 --> 01:04:29.370
<v Speaker 2>to restructure society in order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1368
01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:31.110
<v Speaker 2>I can't even say it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>

1369
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:33.120
<v Speaker 2>it's so empty and dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1370
01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:33.691
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1371
01:04:33.691 --> 01:04:35.260
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Ah,</v>

1372
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I read this and,</v>

1373
01:04:37.991 --> 01:04:39.870
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eli is Canadian,</v>

1374
01:04:39.871 --> 01:04:42.600
<v Speaker 2>a book called crowds and power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was one of the things that really</v>

1375
01:04:42.601 --> 01:04:45.120
<v Speaker 2>stuck in my imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did an atom,</v>

1376
01:04:45.121 --> 01:04:49.830
<v Speaker 2>a logical analysis of the word slogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said that it was derived from the</v>

1377
01:04:49.831 --> 01:04:50.740
<v Speaker 2>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1378
01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.810
<v Speaker 2>two words slew ag es,</v>
<v Speaker 2>El you a,</v>

1379
01:04:53.811 --> 01:04:57.090
<v Speaker 2>g h and Gerome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>g h a,</v>

1380
01:04:57.091 --> 01:04:57.661
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>r.</v>

1381
01:04:57.661 --> 01:05:00.270
<v Speaker 2>M.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it meant battle cry of the dead.</v>

1382
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:01.583
<v Speaker 2>And that really struck me because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always had this sense that people </v>

1383
01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:07.020
<v Speaker 2>mouthing ideologies are the puppets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>corpses.</v>

1384
01:05:07.021 --> 01:05:07.854
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puppets of corpses of level and </v>

1385
01:05:10.351 --> 01:05:13.890
<v Speaker 2>philosophers now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they speak in dead tones and they're</v>

1386
01:05:13.891 --> 01:05:14.724
<v Speaker 2>not interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're listening to an Indian </v>

1387
01:05:16.381 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>log of rattle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hardly</v>

1388
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.680
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on what they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's bad.</v>

1389
01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 4>It's death itself speaking again and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>compels zero interest.</v>

1390
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.640
<v Speaker 4>And so even discussing this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

1391
01:05:27.641 --> 01:05:28.474
<v Speaker 4>I find difficult to even formulate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>words because I'm so tired of that kind </v>

1392
01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:35.170
<v Speaker 4>of that realm of that realm of </v>
<v Speaker 4>discourse.</v>

1393
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.273
<v Speaker 4>It's like with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many tremendous things that </v>

1394
01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 4>are remaining in the world for people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do with,</v>

1395
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:44.230
<v Speaker 4>they stopped being dead puppets of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1396
01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:49.231
<v Speaker 4>of sick ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's appalling to me that it even has,</v>

1397
01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 4>and the opposition to that even has to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be justified.</v>

1398
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:55.450
<v Speaker 4>Our entire civilization is opposition to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1399
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.681
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1400
01:05:56.681 --> 01:05:57.514
<v Speaker 4>we can let it go if we want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the alternatives are far gloomier </v>

1401
01:05:59.801 --> 01:06:01.720
<v Speaker 4>than what we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you that.</v>

1402
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:05.980
<v Speaker 4>So we can let it all go and we're being </v>
<v Speaker 4>taught to let it all go.</v>

1403
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:07.360
<v Speaker 4>It's corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's rotten,</v>

1404
01:06:07.361 --> 01:06:10.210
<v Speaker 4>right to the roots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It needs to be retooled late to the very</v>

1405
01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:11.860
<v Speaker 4>concepts that we use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1406
01:06:11.861 --> 01:06:13.210
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going to replace it?</v>

1407
01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:16.990
<v Speaker 4>What have we got this better?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got nothing that's better.</v>

1408
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.620
<v Speaker 4>What we have is something that could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>far more than it is if people would just</v>

1409
01:06:20.621 --> 01:06:24.760
<v Speaker 4>take it to the level that it could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken to and everyone wants to hear that</v>

1410
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.760
<v Speaker 4>and then we're all nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been a very long answer.</v>

1411
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:32.470
<v Speaker 4>This is why 91% of the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching my lectures are man as far as I</v>

1412
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:33.304
<v Speaker 4>can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1413
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:34.070
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1414
01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:34.903
<v Speaker 5>that could be something we have time for</v>
<v Speaker 5>one or two more questions then we might </v>

1415
01:06:36.471 --> 01:06:39.200
<v Speaker 5>open it up to q and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A one more question according to connor.</v>

1416
01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:40.443
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to end with it cause you </v>

1417
01:06:41.721 --> 01:06:42.554
<v Speaker 5>were talking about your experience as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>clinical psychologist and I'm wondering </v>

1418
01:06:45.111 --> 01:06:50.111
<v Speaker 5>if you have any advice for students on </v>
<v Speaker 5>general topics of like mental health,</v>

1419
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:53.990
<v Speaker 5>wellness at college.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In a lot of ways,</v>

1420
01:06:53.991 --> 01:06:58.100
<v Speaker 5>I think you have claimed that by finding</v>
<v Speaker 5>more purpose,</v>

1421
01:06:58.101 --> 01:06:58.934
<v Speaker 5>by finding more meaning by contributing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one can develop more tolerance for </v>

1422
01:07:02.421 --> 01:07:04.940
<v Speaker 5>oneself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One can develop more self affirmation.</v>

1423
01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:07.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm wondering though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you think there are cases where there</v>

1424
01:07:07.341 --> 01:07:08.174
<v Speaker 5>are people with a lot of potential,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially at Harvard who may doubt </v>

1425
01:07:10.881 --> 01:07:12.950
<v Speaker 5>their abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who may get quite anxious.</v>

1426
01:07:12.951 --> 01:07:16.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you've interacted with students</v>
<v Speaker 5>with um,</v>

1427
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:19.460
<v Speaker 5>clients as a clinician.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you,</v>

1428
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:20.323
<v Speaker 5>what advice do you give them or what do </v>
<v Speaker 5>you think college students should know </v>

1429
01:07:21.711 --> 01:07:25.010
<v Speaker 5>about enhancing their psychological </v>
<v Speaker 5>wellbeing at college?</v>

1430
01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.250
<v Speaker 3>We've done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've done some research on that topic.</v>

1431
01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:31.323
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that really seems to </v>

1432
01:07:32.711 --> 01:07:36.130
<v Speaker 3>help is to write out your plans for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1433
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:37.503
<v Speaker 3>We have a program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an online program called future </v>

1434
01:07:39.521 --> 01:07:40.354
<v Speaker 3>authoring that we've used with Oh 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>university students now and raise their </v>

1435
01:07:43.811 --> 01:07:47.620
<v Speaker 3>grade point average 25% drop their </v>
<v Speaker 3>dropout rate by about the same.</v>

1436
01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:48.943
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it particularly works well for men who </v>

1437
01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:53.170
<v Speaker 3>are generally underperforming women now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that,</v>

1438
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:57.760
<v Speaker 3>I think it's raising them up and it also</v>
<v Speaker 3>works spectacularly well for non Western</v>

1439
01:07:57.761 --> 01:07:58.594
<v Speaker 3>ethnic minority men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was also extraordinarily positive </v>

1440
01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:02.200
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1441
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:07.060
<v Speaker 3>that's well that that was a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>unexpected outcome.</v>

1442
01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:12.190
<v Speaker 3>But in some of it is to aim at something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's worth aiming out.</v>

1443
01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:13.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1444
01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:16.370
<v Speaker 3>and how do you determine what's worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>aiming out?</v>

1445
01:08:16.371 --> 01:08:16.941
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1446
01:08:16.941 --> 01:08:20.210
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here I have my miserable wretched life.</v>

1447
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.313
<v Speaker 3>Under what conditions would it justify </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself as far as I'm concerned </v>

1448
01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.600
<v Speaker 3>personally?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like under what conditions would my life</v>

1449
01:08:26.601 --> 01:08:28.270
<v Speaker 3>justify itself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you,</v>

1450
01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.001
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1451
01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:32.030
<v Speaker 3>what sort of future would I have to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that I can say this is worth it.</v>

1452
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.310
<v Speaker 3>And then that's what you aim for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

1453
01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:38.240
<v Speaker 3>and technically that works in part </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we know that most of the systems</v>

1454
01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:40.370
<v Speaker 3>that mediate positive emotion and human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings,</v>

1455
01:08:40.371 --> 01:08:41.204
<v Speaker 3>and so those would be the dopaminergic </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems that have their roots in the </v>

1456
01:08:43.131 --> 01:08:48.050
<v Speaker 3>hypothalamic exploratory centers are </v>
<v Speaker 3>activated in relationship to the pursuit</v>

1457
01:08:48.051 --> 01:08:48.884
<v Speaker 3>of a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as a consequence of attaining </v>

1458
01:08:50.421 --> 01:08:52.610
<v Speaker 3>something that's a conservatory reward </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

1459
01:08:52.611 --> 01:08:54.800
<v Speaker 3>But human beings mostly run on incentive</v>
<v Speaker 3>reward.</v>

1460
01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:57.530
<v Speaker 3>And so it appears that the higher the </v>
<v Speaker 3>goal,</v>

1461
01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.633
<v Speaker 3>the more kick you get from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from noting your progress towards that </v>

1462
01:09:02.241 --> 01:09:03.074
<v Speaker 3>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you have to be careful because you </v>

1463
01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:04.844
<v Speaker 3>don't want to pick a goal that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossible that all you ever do is fail </v>

1464
01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:08.450
<v Speaker 3>in relationship to it.</v>

1465
01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:10.930
<v Speaker 3>That's an issue of self management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1466
01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.013
<v Speaker 3>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to pick a goal that moves you </v>

1467
01:09:13.461 --> 01:09:14.294
<v Speaker 3>to the next plateau that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable prob a reasonable but not </v>

1468
01:09:18.261 --> 01:09:20.600
<v Speaker 3>certain probability of attaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1469
01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:24.020
<v Speaker 3>that's part of it is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to formulate a plan to decide who,</v>

1470
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:26.360
<v Speaker 3>who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is that you want to be,</v>

1471
01:09:26.361 --> 01:09:29.090
<v Speaker 3>who it is that you want to be from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>character logical perspective.</v>

1472
01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:31.160
<v Speaker 3>And if you're having other problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1473
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:34.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of that is when you're talking more</v>

1474
01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:37.730
<v Speaker 3>on the clinical end of things is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1475
01:09:37.731 --> 01:09:40.700
<v Speaker 3>the devil's in the details,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's useful to talk to people.</v>

1476
01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:43.070
<v Speaker 3>It's useful to write about what it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're up to it.</v>

1477
01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:43.993
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's most worthwhile to organize your </v>

1478
01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:46.670
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>

1479
01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:50.030
<v Speaker 3>And to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to pick a goal into a mad it that's,</v>

1480
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.880
<v Speaker 3>that's a very nice way of starting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>straighten things out for yourself.</v>

1481
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:54.650
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

1482
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.410
<v Speaker 3>I would also say like I've had many </v>
<v Speaker 3>clients,</v>

1483
01:09:57.411 --> 01:10:00.020
<v Speaker 3>I often advocate the use of </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants.</v>

1484
01:10:00.021 --> 01:10:00.854
<v Speaker 3>I mean people for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have all sorts of physiological </v>

1485
01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:06.770
<v Speaker 3>problems that compromise their movement </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>

1486
01:10:06.771 --> 01:10:07.604
<v Speaker 3>And those have to be addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that you can lift </v>

1487
01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 3>yourself up by your bootstraps in every </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible situation.</v>

1488
01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:16.010
<v Speaker 3>I know that not be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take whatever interventions you need</v>

1489
01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:18.890
<v Speaker 3>in order to allow yourself to continue </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving forward in the world.</v>

1490
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:20.143
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what do you do to try to set </v>

1491
01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:23.781
<v Speaker 3>yourself up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1492
01:10:23.781 --> 01:10:27.830
<v Speaker 3>I have some friends that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have an intimate relationship.</v>

1493
01:10:27.831 --> 01:10:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Try to make one that's reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 3>permanent.</v>

1494
01:10:29.661 --> 01:10:30.494
<v Speaker 3>That's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aim at having a family and children aim </v>

1495
01:10:32.541 --> 01:10:33.374
<v Speaker 3>at being useful to the community and </v>
<v Speaker 3>turning yourself into something that's </v>

1496
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:40.160
<v Speaker 3>noble and respectable and powerful and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that'll,</v>

1497
01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.740
<v Speaker 3>that'll help you orient yourself when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're young.</v>

1498
01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:45.980
<v Speaker 3>And because you'll start to see that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could have a life that was worth living,</v>

1499
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:47.143
<v Speaker 3>that you could be not proud of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the wrong way of thinking about </v>

1500
01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:53.600
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that you could live in the right way</v>

1501
01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:57.710
<v Speaker 3>of phrasing it is that you could live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a manner that justifies the fragility of</v>

1502
01:10:57.711 --> 01:11:00.110
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the right way to think about it.</v>

1503
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.040
<v Speaker 3>That's the right way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the fragility of being is a very</v>

1504
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:04.874
<v Speaker 3>powerful argument against its existence </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's been recognized by that was </v>

1505
01:11:09.711 --> 01:11:10.544
<v Speaker 3>that that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the fundamental ethical dilemma </v>

1506
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:14.790
<v Speaker 3>investigated by Gurth F for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his,</v>

1507
01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:15.853
<v Speaker 3>in his play foxed because Mephistopheles</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the mouthpiece of everyone who says </v>

1508
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:20.483
<v Speaker 3>being is so fragile that it should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>eradicated because it produces too much </v>

1509
01:11:23.401 --> 01:11:24.234
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Ivan chromosomes argumenting in </v>

1510
01:11:26.351 --> 01:11:27.184
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the brothers Karamazov it's a very </v>

1511
01:11:28.141 --> 01:11:28.974
<v Speaker 3>powerful argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why should any of this be an announcer </v>

1512
01:11:31.471 --> 01:11:34.840
<v Speaker 3>is you justify it by how it is that by </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you exist,</v>

1513
01:11:34.841 --> 01:11:35.674
<v Speaker 3>you justify being by how you choose to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist and you can choose to exist in a </v>

1514
01:11:39.871 --> 01:11:43.650
<v Speaker 3>manner that produces absolutely no </v>
<v Speaker 3>justification whatsoever for being quite</v>

1515
01:11:43.651 --> 01:11:45.810
<v Speaker 3>the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

1516
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:49.280
<v Speaker 3>that's not a pathway that I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>recommend.</v>

1517
01:11:49.281 --> 01:11:50.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1518
01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.133
<v Speaker 3>My pleasure.</v>

1519
01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:58.170
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1520
01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:10.670
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1521
01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.310
<v Speaker 5>So we have some questions I think from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the audience.</v>

1522
01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.980
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm just going to read them in order</v>

1523
01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:19.700
<v Speaker 5>and you're going to answer com.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty simple.</v>

1524
01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:24.170
<v Speaker 5>So our first question we have here </v>
<v Speaker 5>reads,</v>

1525
01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.093
<v Speaker 5>I'm a postdoc in the psychology </v>
<v Speaker 5>department and I'm very interested in </v>

1526
01:12:28.251 --> 01:12:29.084
<v Speaker 5>conducting research,</v>
<v Speaker 5>examining the extent to which highly </v>

1527
01:12:31.911 --> 01:12:36.200
<v Speaker 5>politically correct individuals are </v>
<v Speaker 5>analytical in parentheses or not.</v>

1528
01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:37.483
<v Speaker 5>I am however very concerned that this </v>
<v Speaker 5>pursuit will potentially flip to the </v>

1529
01:12:42.111 --> 01:12:42.944
<v Speaker 5>back proved to be quite damaging to my </v>
<v Speaker 5>reputation and that it will likely </v>

1530
01:12:46.671 --> 01:12:49.520
<v Speaker 5>hinder my chances of obtaining a faculty</v>
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

1531
01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.110
<v Speaker 5>Do you have any advice for them?</v>

1532
01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to talk to the members all the </v>

1533
01:12:55.101 --> 01:12:56.870
<v Speaker 3>time and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they see the same thing.</v>

1534
01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:59.053
<v Speaker 3>I'll say what I think when I get my </v>
<v Speaker 3>first job and then they get their first </v>

1535
01:13:02.241 --> 01:13:02.931
<v Speaker 3>job and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1536
01:13:02.931 --> 01:13:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll say what I think when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

1537
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:05.750
<v Speaker 3>when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm,</v>

1538
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:06.643
<v Speaker 3>when I have tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they get tenure and it's like </v>

1539
01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:10.550
<v Speaker 3>15 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years later.</v>

1540
01:13:10.551 --> 01:13:11.384
<v Speaker 3>And they don't have anything left to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they haven't said anything for </v>

1541
01:13:13.161 --> 01:13:14.930
<v Speaker 3>the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1542
01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.430
<v Speaker 3>that's no way to live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1543
01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.100
<v Speaker 3>That's no way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's do your damn research.</v>

1544
01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Pick the hardest topic you can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine and pursue it and state what you</v>

1545
01:13:23.331 --> 01:13:25.460
<v Speaker 3>believe to be the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let me see,</v>

1546
01:13:25.461 --> 01:13:26.720
<v Speaker 3>there's a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a rule.</v>

1547
01:13:26.721 --> 01:13:28.510
<v Speaker 3>This is an existential rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in Sweden,</v>

1548
01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.590
<v Speaker 3>one we're really worth thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it,</v>

1549
01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:31.483
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pointer to a fundamental mode of </v>

1550
01:13:33.231 --> 01:13:36.560
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one mode of being involved using your</v>

1551
01:13:36.561 --> 01:13:39.490
<v Speaker 3>speech strategically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what it is.</v>

1552
01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.870
<v Speaker 3>Questions about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person is basically asking,</v>

1553
01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:46.130
<v Speaker 3>should I use my ability to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategically and strategically?</v>

1554
01:13:46.131 --> 01:13:46.964
<v Speaker 3>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should I aim at getting the job I want </v>

1555
01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.160
<v Speaker 3>with my actions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1556
01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.430
<v Speaker 3>the answer to that is it's better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>not aiming at anything.</v>

1557
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:56.650
<v Speaker 3>So that's one answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1558
01:13:56.651 --> 01:13:57.230
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1559
01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:58.940
<v Speaker 3>and it's a reasonable answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's,</v>

1560
01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:03.290
<v Speaker 3>here's a different answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a fundamental dilemma of faith.</v>

1561
01:14:03.291 --> 01:14:04.124
<v Speaker 3>I would say</v>

1562
01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.253
<v Speaker 3>the fundamental dilemma of faith is </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you should live by the </v>

1563
01:14:10.121 --> 01:14:11.140
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1564
01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1565
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:13.053
<v Speaker 2>you determined to live by the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you make the decision that if you </v>

1566
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:18.184
<v Speaker 2>tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outcome is the best possible </v>

1567
01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:21.850
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

1568
01:14:21.851 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 2>that's an existential decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1569
01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:25.773
<v Speaker 2>And it's predicated on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's predicated on something like faith </v>

1570
01:14:28.301 --> 01:14:29.134
<v Speaker 2>in the fundamental nature of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you allow yourself to the </v>

1571
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:36.340
<v Speaker 2>degree that you can with the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what you're doing is acting out the</v>

1572
01:14:36.341 --> 01:14:37.174
<v Speaker 2>proposition that being is structured in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best possible manner because </v>

1573
01:14:40.181 --> 01:14:41.014
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you wouldn't ally yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the truth and if you decided to </v>

1574
01:14:43.481 --> 01:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>ally yourself with the truth and you act</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a manner of commensurate with that,</v>

1575
01:14:47.141 --> 01:14:50.830
<v Speaker 2>then your life will unfold in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular way and you have to take your</v>

1576
01:14:50.831 --> 01:14:52.480
<v Speaker 2>chances if you're going to live like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1577
01:14:52.481 --> 01:14:54.610
<v Speaker 2>But the advantage to that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1578
01:14:54.611 --> 01:14:55.444
<v Speaker 2>one advantage is you don't compromise </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and maybe you don't want to </v>

1579
01:14:58.271 --> 01:14:59.104
<v Speaker 2>compromise yourself because yourself is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you have to stave off the </v>

1580
01:15:03.521 --> 01:15:05.110
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe of being.</v>

1581
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.943
<v Speaker 2>And if you compromise that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have nothing except perhaps </v>

1582
01:15:08.021 --> 01:15:10.960
<v Speaker 2>what other people will give you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pathway to weakness.</v>

1583
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:13.240
<v Speaker 2>Now I have a graduate student.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As it happens,</v>

1584
01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:14.373
<v Speaker 2>who is doing exactly that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We started doing empirical analysis of </v>

1585
01:15:16.601 --> 01:15:19.300
<v Speaker 2>politically correct beliefs and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been absolutely fascinating.</v>

1586
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:21.490
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do cohere.</v>

1587
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:23.200
<v Speaker 2>So the way we did it was we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1588
01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:24.053
<v Speaker 2>we collected about 400 statements that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were deemed by people in the press and </v>

1589
01:15:28.301 --> 01:15:31.420
<v Speaker 2>so forth as indicative of politically </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct belief.</v>

1590
01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.433
<v Speaker 2>We did that agnostically and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard standard construct validation </v>

1591
01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:39.490
<v Speaker 2>process in psychology is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to find out if something exists,</v>

1592
01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:44.491
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to find out if the elements of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that entity say a domain of beliefs</v>

1593
01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.410
<v Speaker 2>covariates such that if you hold one </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief,</v>

1594
01:15:47.411 --> 01:15:49.270
<v Speaker 2>you're much more likely to hold another </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>

1595
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.240
<v Speaker 2>And so then you can pile up the beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are likely to occur if one occurs.</v>

1596
01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:55.323
<v Speaker 2>And the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the essential way to do that is to </v>

1597
01:15:56.981 --> 01:15:57.814
<v Speaker 2>oversample the domain of beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subject them to a factor analysis and </v>

1598
01:16:00.941 --> 01:16:04.060
<v Speaker 2>see how they cohere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we found that there were two factors</v>

1599
01:16:04.061 --> 01:16:06.970
<v Speaker 2>that were associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically correct belief and that they</v>

1600
01:16:06.971 --> 01:16:07.804
<v Speaker 2>were very powerfully predicted by </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality and most particularly by </v>

1601
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:10.804
<v Speaker 2>trait agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was not a predictor of </v>

1602
01:16:12.821 --> 01:16:15.790
<v Speaker 2>conservatism or liberalism particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1603
01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.450
<v Speaker 2>but more to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the student who's doing that,</v>

1604
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:20.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her name is,</v>

1605
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:23.800
<v Speaker 2>her name is Christine brophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's very brave girl,</v>

1606
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:25.180
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very tough girl.</v>

1607
01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:27.310
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

1608
01:16:27.610 --> 01:16:31.960
<v Speaker 2>she's pursued this forthrightly and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>led to nothing but opportunity,</v>

1609
01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:34.810
<v Speaker 2>crazy amounts of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a tough road to hoe.</v>

1610
01:16:34.811 --> 01:16:35.644
<v Speaker 2>She knows perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not going to be very popular in </v>

1611
01:16:37.271 --> 01:16:38.230
<v Speaker 2>certain domains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1612
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.393
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's no reason not to pursue </v>

1613
01:16:41.171 --> 01:16:42.640
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue is,</v>

1614
01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:45.010
<v Speaker 2>are you interested in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to find out the truth?</v>

1615
01:16:45.011 --> 01:16:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Are you willing to pursue it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Are you willing to stake yourself on</v>

1616
01:16:47.891 --> 01:16:48.900
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>

1617
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:49.783
<v Speaker 2>if the answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're not willing to stake </v>

1618
01:16:51.521 --> 01:16:52.354
<v Speaker 2>yourself on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then God help you because you'll </v>

1619
01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:58.180
<v Speaker 2>have to be given something by someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else to stake yourself on.</v>

1620
01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:02.410
<v Speaker 2>And they can always take it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like don't be thinking,</v>

1621
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:05.530
<v Speaker 2>don't be thinking politically about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

1622
01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.750
<v Speaker 2>It's foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>

1623
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be second rate</v>

1624
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.903
<v Speaker 3>at fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be second rate and frightened at </v>

1625
01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:13.514
<v Speaker 3>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll never hit the top ranks if you </v>

1626
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.240
<v Speaker 3>perform like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And having said that,</v>

1627
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:21.410
<v Speaker 3>I would also say don't be an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't make unnecessary enemies.</v>

1628
01:17:21.411 --> 01:17:22.244
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no point in making </v>

1629
01:17:23.841 --> 01:17:25.520
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1630
01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:29.330
<v Speaker 3>that's not wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But don't sell yourself short.</v>

1631
01:17:29.331 --> 01:17:30.164
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be on the cutting edge of an </v>

1632
01:17:31.011 --> 01:17:34.250
<v Speaker 3>entire new domain of psychology if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually get it right.</v>

1633
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.750
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe you won't be popular among </v>
<v Speaker 3>your superiors for the time being.</v>

1634
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:39.703
<v Speaker 3>You can't talk to the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>above you in the dominance hierarchy </v>

1635
01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:42.590
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>

1636
01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:43.633
<v Speaker 3>You can barely talk laterally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pretty much have to broadcast your </v>

1637
01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:49.280
<v Speaker 3>message down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the fact that,</v>

1638
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:51.610
<v Speaker 3>well enough said about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1639
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:52.453
<v Speaker 3>it's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pursue your damn research and tell the </v>

1640
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:56.390
<v Speaker 3>truth about it and let the chips fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they will.</v>

1641
01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.253
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're much better protected that way </v>

1642
01:17:58.131 --> 01:18:00.170
<v Speaker 3>then by doing anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second question,</v>

1643
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:01.263
<v Speaker 3>how have university has been ruined by </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxism or rather by the massive growth </v>

1644
01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:09.290
<v Speaker 3>of student life bureaucracies that seek </v>
<v Speaker 3>to train rather than educate.</v>

1645
01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:11.293
<v Speaker 3>They haven't been completely ruined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the humanities and the social </v>

1646
01:18:13.551 --> 01:18:14.780
<v Speaker 3>sciences are both in trouble.</v>

1647
01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:17.043
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>

1648
01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.063
<v Speaker 3>Could you please speak to the legitimacy</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Harvard's decision to penalize </v>

1649
01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:27.234
<v Speaker 3>students for being part of single gender</v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations that are not officially </v>

1650
01:18:30.751 --> 01:18:32.700
<v Speaker 3>recognized by the university?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1651
01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:33.990
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fraternities,</v>

1652
01:18:33.991 --> 01:18:35.250
<v Speaker 3>sororities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and final clubs.</v>

1653
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:36.743
<v Speaker 3>It's cowardly.</v>

1654
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:38.183
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

1655
01:18:38.610 --> 01:18:41.010
<v Speaker 3>It's cowardly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's politically correct.</v>

1656
01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.133
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it interferes with freedom of </v>

1657
01:18:42.961 --> 01:18:43.794
<v Speaker 3>association.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would think they would have more </v>

1658
01:18:46.921 --> 01:18:49.950
<v Speaker 3>important things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1659
01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 3>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that victim hood narratives</v>

1660
01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:02.283
<v Speaker 3>and critiques of oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which make up much of the political </v>

1661
01:19:04.751 --> 01:19:05.584
<v Speaker 3>discussion on college campuses are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>symptom of a psychological need to </v>

1662
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.823
<v Speaker 3>deflect guilt because of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of a lack of another better </v>

1663
01:19:17.081 --> 01:19:18.160
<v Speaker 3>method of redemption?</v>

1664
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:21.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that is part of it.</v>

1665
01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't,</v>

1666
01:19:22.770 --> 01:19:24.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1667
01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm speaking more strongly in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>then perhaps would be optimal.</v>

1668
01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:35.660
<v Speaker 3>Partly because time is short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that young people have a mess.</v>

1669
01:19:36.831 --> 01:19:37.664
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yanik urge Piaget actually identified </v>

1670
01:19:40.771 --> 01:19:43.410
<v Speaker 3>that as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as part of the developmental process,</v>

1671
01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.553
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that was the typified late </v>

1672
01:19:46.771 --> 01:19:50.820
<v Speaker 3>adolescence</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's admirable in many ways.</v>

1673
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:56.870
<v Speaker 3>It needs to be directed in the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful possible,</v>

1674
01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:01.500
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosocial manner possible.</v>

1675
01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.050
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the university should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1676
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.570
<v Speaker 3>And by training students to be noisy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ill informed,</v>

1677
01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:13.680
<v Speaker 3>historically ignorant agitators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>narcissistic agitators,</v>

1678
01:20:13.681 --> 01:20:17.370
<v Speaker 3>let's add that they're doing them a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous disservice.</v>

1679
01:20:17.371 --> 01:20:18.204
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was at mcmaster for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the last very vocal protest </v>

1680
01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:25.470
<v Speaker 3>occurred mostly what I felt about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>protesters with sorrow.</v>

1681
01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:26.311
<v Speaker 3>Cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1682
01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:27.360
<v Speaker 3>I looked out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>

1683
01:20:27.361 --> 01:20:28.860
<v Speaker 3>well there's these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there young people,</v>

1684
01:20:28.861 --> 01:20:29.694
<v Speaker 3>they're university students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're because they went to university </v>

1685
01:20:30.931 --> 01:20:34.470
<v Speaker 3>at least in principle to learn something</v>
<v Speaker 3>about themselves and about the world.</v>

1686
01:20:34.471 --> 01:20:36.810
<v Speaker 3>And instead they've been transformed </v>
<v Speaker 3>into these.</v>

1687
01:20:36.811 --> 01:20:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Like they were chanting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were chanting like</v>

1688
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.513
<v Speaker 1>wow</v>

1689
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:43.583
<v Speaker 3>profanities at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really that's a best you can do </v>

1690
01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:47.933
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if come out and you're dopey little </v>

1691
01:20:48.631 --> 01:20:50.610
<v Speaker 3>group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll hide behind the hammer and sickle</v>

1692
01:20:50.611 --> 01:20:54.000
<v Speaker 3>because of one of your fashionable </v>
<v Speaker 3>professors convinced you that was a good</v>

1693
01:20:54.001 --> 01:20:54.834
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the best you can do is organize </v>

1694
01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:59.580
<v Speaker 3>yourself and chant profanities at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1695
01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:02.010
<v Speaker 3>it's so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>

1696
01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.023
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can be doing something better than </v>

1697
01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:05.993
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean card come out and they have a </v>

1698
01:21:08.131 --> 01:21:11.160
<v Speaker 3>useful protest of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least if you're going to come out and</v>

1699
01:21:11.161 --> 01:21:11.994
<v Speaker 3>protest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it a high quality protest stead of </v>

1700
01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:15.084
<v Speaker 3>like cursing at me in repetitively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dowel and unimaginative and and </v>

1701
01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:22.380
<v Speaker 3>pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1702
01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:25.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1703
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:27.210
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what the question was.</v>

1704
01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.560
<v Speaker 5>Eight more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1705
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:35.303
<v Speaker 5>Five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In cases where people have sworn </v>

1706
01:21:37.561 --> 01:21:38.394
<v Speaker 5>chastity throughout life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>under voluntary and noncoercive </v>

1707
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:41.873
<v Speaker 5>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it possible to still develop fully </v>

1708
01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:45.053
<v Speaker 5>and not suffer from the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 5>having never undergone sexual </v>

1709
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.550
<v Speaker 5>maturation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If so,</v>

1710
01:21:50.551 --> 01:21:53.010
<v Speaker 5>how is it possible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

1711
01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.490
<v Speaker 5>I didn't expect that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can tell Ya.</v>

1712
01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes people have to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice,</v>

1713
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:04.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1714
01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:09.560
<v Speaker 3>everyone always has to make sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually something that I learned</v>

1715
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:11.083
<v Speaker 3>from reading mythology because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient myths always talk about </v>

1716
01:22:14.601 --> 01:22:17.600
<v Speaker 3>sacrificing people claim not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what that means.</v>

1717
01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.400
<v Speaker 3>You always have to let go of something </v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to progress into the future.</v>

1718
01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.193
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the most fundamental discovery </v>

1719
01:22:25.311 --> 01:22:27.170
<v Speaker 3>human beings ever made as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell,</v>

1720
01:22:27.171 --> 01:22:28.004
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the same thing as </v>

1721
01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:31.940
<v Speaker 3>discovering the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we discovered the future,</v>

1722
01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're the only creatures that we know of</v>

1723
01:22:34.131 --> 01:22:34.964
<v Speaker 3>who really can conceive of the future </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the future is something that's made </v>

1724
01:22:38.001 --> 01:22:40.130
<v Speaker 3>better by letting go of things in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>

1725
01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's impulse control.</v>

1726
01:22:41.601 --> 01:22:43.190
<v Speaker 3>And you can look at it that way if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1727
01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:46.910
<v Speaker 3>The person who wrote this is obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling with something,</v>

1728
01:22:46.911 --> 01:22:48.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe they're wrestling with a hyper</v>

1729
01:22:48.681 --> 01:22:50.800
<v Speaker 3>dominant sexual impulse that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1730
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:51.643
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that threatens to be master instead of </v>

1731
01:22:53.391 --> 01:22:56.450
<v Speaker 3>servant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so who knows what they have to do in</v>

1732
01:22:56.451 --> 01:22:57.284
<v Speaker 3>order to bring themselves under control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that less radical solutions </v>

1733
01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:04.153
<v Speaker 3>might first be advised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can write because you don't have </v>

1734
01:23:08.531 --> 01:23:09.364
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to whip yourself with a </v>

1735
01:23:10.331 --> 01:23:12.550
<v Speaker 3>bigger whip then you need to use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1736
01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:13.384
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's minimal necessary force doctrine </v>

1737
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:18.040
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so yeah,</v>

1738
01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:21.280
<v Speaker 3>so that's how I would answer that </v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

1739
01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:23.350
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good if I want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You weren't expecting</v>

1740
01:23:24.810 --> 01:23:25.643
<v Speaker 5>Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you say that the meaning of life is to </v>

1741
01:23:26.941 --> 01:23:30.060
<v Speaker 5>take an individual responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the burdens of existence.</v>

1742
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:35.270
<v Speaker 5>If each person can justifiably choose </v>
<v Speaker 5>his own way of taking on these burdens,</v>

1743
01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:36.923
<v Speaker 5>then how can we prevent individuals from</v>
<v Speaker 5>committing actions that are clearly </v>

1744
01:23:40.411 --> 01:23:41.760
<v Speaker 5>moral injustices?</v>

1745
01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:44.523
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't.</v>

1746
01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1747
01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:51.330
<v Speaker 3>that happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the best way,</v>

1748
01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.950
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of mechanisms for </v>
<v Speaker 3>regulating it,</v>

1749
01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:54.813
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have all sorts of mechanisms for </v>

1750
01:23:55.691 --> 01:23:59.920
<v Speaker 3>regulating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Civil society and policing regulates it.</v>

1751
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:01.203
<v Speaker 3>Expectations between family members and </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends regulated your conscience </v>

1752
01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:05.254
<v Speaker 3>regulates it.</v>

1753
01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:06.693
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

1754
01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:13.760
<v Speaker 3>But I don't believe that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a general rule commit illegalities or</v>

1755
01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.310
<v Speaker 3>or worse because they've taken on </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

1756
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.353
<v Speaker 3>That isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pathway to criminality is not to be </v>

1757
01:24:24.541 --> 01:24:25.374
<v Speaker 3>found in the adoption of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't say that about criminals </v>

1758
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:29.343
<v Speaker 3>swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he would've just taken on a little </v>

1759
01:24:30.121 --> 01:24:32.910
<v Speaker 3>less responsibility than he wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>in jail.</v>

1760
01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:33.691
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is now.</v>

1761
01:24:33.691 --> 01:24:34.524
<v Speaker 3>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what the question is more something </v>

1762
01:24:37.381 --> 01:24:37.831
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1763
01:24:37.831 --> 01:24:40.350
<v Speaker 3>if people are allowed to direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

1764
01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:43.770
<v Speaker 3>how do you stop them from picking a path</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's improper?</v>

1765
01:24:43.771 --> 01:24:44.604
<v Speaker 3>And I would say that that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I do believe that that's the </v>

1766
01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:47.214
<v Speaker 3>essential question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say part of that is that if </v>

1767
01:24:49.321 --> 01:24:53.250
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be self directed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say at least to some degree,</v>

1768
01:24:53.730 --> 01:24:54.563
<v Speaker 3>then you have to tell the truth because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you pathologize yourself and </v>

1769
01:24:58.321 --> 01:25:00.060
<v Speaker 3>you can't rely on your own judgment </v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

1770
01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:00.893
<v Speaker 3>And that that's part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth is so necessary is that if </v>

1771
01:25:02.971 --> 01:25:03.804
<v Speaker 3>you're going to use yourself as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism by which you Orient Yourself </v>

1772
01:25:07.531 --> 01:25:08.364
<v Speaker 3>in the world and you better make sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not transforming yourself </v>

1773
01:25:12.121 --> 01:25:14.280
<v Speaker 3>into something that's predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 3>error.</v>

1774
01:25:14.970 --> 01:25:16.870
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

1775
01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:17.950
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1776
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:18.783
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the attempt to speak the truth is as a </v>

1777
01:25:20.371 --> 01:25:24.780
<v Speaker 3>form of psychophysiological hygiene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

1778
01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:25.973
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're oriented as well as you can </v>

1779
01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:29.483
<v Speaker 3>towards the articulated truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can increasingly rely on your </v>

1780
01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:33.930
<v Speaker 3>own judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1781
01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:38.430
<v Speaker 3>and that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best defense say against,</v>

1782
01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.650
<v Speaker 3>against the dark side.</v>

1783
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:44.800
<v Speaker 5>You've attached a number of useful </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>

1784
01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:47.890
<v Speaker 5>If this is a fun one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>number of useful ideas,</v>

1785
01:25:47.891 --> 01:25:48.724
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>self overcoming personal responsibility </v>

1786
01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:53.860
<v Speaker 5>to a viral meme,</v>
<v Speaker 5>social justice conflict,</v>

1787
01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:55.203
<v Speaker 5>how can we attach and useful ideas to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the social justice side of this </v>

1788
01:25:58.211 --> 01:26:02.860
<v Speaker 5>controversy and convert it into a </v>
<v Speaker 5>growthful movement for all involved?</v>

1789
01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.313
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that is what's happening to </v>

1790
01:26:06.311 --> 01:26:07.144
<v Speaker 3>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the political dialogue </v>

1791
01:26:09.761 --> 01:26:14.761
<v Speaker 3>that's emerging is precisely that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how we can do it.</v>

1792
01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:21.120
<v Speaker 3>I know what I know how I've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it to some degree.</v>

1793
01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:24.150
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing it by saying what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think</v>

1794
01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.293
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1795
01:26:25.570 --> 01:26:27.850
<v Speaker 3>and carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1796
01:26:28.110 --> 01:26:28.943
<v Speaker 3>and and knowing that I'm prone to error </v>
<v Speaker 3>and listening to feedback because I </v>

1797
01:26:32.471 --> 01:26:34.510
<v Speaker 3>would like to know where I'm making </v>
<v Speaker 3>errors.</v>

1798
01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:37.810
<v Speaker 3>I had advisors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friends,</v>

1799
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:39.183
<v Speaker 3>while I was undertaking this who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me constantly everything I was </v>

1800
01:26:42.941 --> 01:26:43.774
<v Speaker 3>doing that was second rate and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>egotistical and careless and all of </v>

1801
01:26:48.851 --> 01:26:51.940
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I would say,</v>

1802
01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.120
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1803
01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:54.953
<v Speaker 3>I would say to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that question is specified at the </v>

1804
01:26:57.421 --> 01:26:59.880
<v Speaker 3>wrong level of analysis is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should,</v>

1805
01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:00.923
<v Speaker 3>you should learn to articulate what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think and that's what you have at your </v>

1806
01:27:05.131 --> 01:27:05.964
<v Speaker 3>disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1807
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:07.950
<v Speaker 3>and with you people in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1808
01:27:07.951 --> 01:27:08.784
<v Speaker 3>you've got power at your disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all super bright and super </v>

1809
01:27:10.951 --> 01:27:12.560
<v Speaker 3>conscientious and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1810
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.433
<v Speaker 3>your powerhouses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might not know it and maybe some of </v>

1811
01:27:15.511 --> 01:27:17.780
<v Speaker 3>you forgotten that because you'd come to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard and of course,</v>

1812
01:27:17.781 --> 01:27:20.160
<v Speaker 3>so 50% of you are below average at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard,</v>

1813
01:27:20.190 --> 01:27:21.023
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>like hyper capable cause you're hyper </v>

1814
01:27:24.391 --> 01:27:25.224
<v Speaker 3>capable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So get your act together and say what </v>

1815
01:27:27.001 --> 01:27:28.920
<v Speaker 3>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that'll do the trick,</v>

1816
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:29.560
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll,</v>

1817
01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.393
<v Speaker 3>that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll,</v>

1818
01:27:30.630 --> 01:27:32.610
<v Speaker 3>that'll work just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr. Peterson,</v>

1819
01:27:32.611 --> 01:27:34.950
<v Speaker 3>we're running out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm gonna ask you one last question.</v>

1820
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.903
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an important one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for some of the people who </v>

1821
01:27:38.131 --> 01:27:40.380
<v Speaker 3>don't think you should be speaking here </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

1822
01:27:40.650 --> 01:27:43.440
<v Speaker 3>whether some of them are in this room or</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them were outside earlier.</v>

1823
01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:44.813
<v Speaker 3>The question reads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give an extremely elevated violence and </v>

1824
01:27:47.131 --> 01:27:47.964
<v Speaker 3>murder rates against trans people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why have you chosen to threat in a </v>

1825
01:27:51.121 --> 01:27:54.450
<v Speaker 3>population that is already facing job </v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination,</v>

1826
01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:55.800
<v Speaker 3>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

1827
01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not threatening them.</v>

1828
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.433
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that a handful of noisy </v>

1829
01:28:02.751 --> 01:28:03.584
<v Speaker 3>activists consider me a threat is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>criteria of proof of any sort of </v>

1830
01:28:06.861 --> 01:28:09.580
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean so,</v>

1831
01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:11.720
<v Speaker 3>so I just reject that entire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

1832
01:28:11.721 --> 01:28:16.721
<v Speaker 3>every single word in that question is </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningless as far as I'm concerned.</v>

1833
01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.033
<v Speaker 3>So people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone said just because someone said </v>

1834
01:28:22.791 --> 01:28:23.624
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I said is a threat to trans people </v>

1835
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:25.873
<v Speaker 3>does not make it true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have the testimony of a fair </v>

1836
01:28:29.421 --> 01:28:32.810
<v Speaker 3>number of trans people that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually not only not true.</v>

1837
01:28:32.811 --> 01:28:35.360
<v Speaker 3>It's palpably false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1838
01:28:35.361 --> 01:28:37.250
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not guilty.</v>

1839
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.433
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

1840
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Very Canadian of you to apologize there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1841
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:44.180
<v Speaker 3>but not so much to say that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>guilty,</v>

1842
01:28:47.630 --> 01:28:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I suppose.</v>

1843
01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For that.</v>

1844
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:04.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1845
01:29:04.201 --> 01:29:06.090
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't consider threats of violence,</v>

1846
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.540
<v Speaker 3>so we have to be very careful when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>use our words.</v>

1847
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:11.123
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so someone saying something and </v>

1848
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.750
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] relatively brief or not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>

1849
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:17.123
<v Speaker 3>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no possible way I can answer </v>

1850
01:29:18.331 --> 01:29:20.850
<v Speaker 3>that question because I know nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the threats.</v>

1851
01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:24.270
<v Speaker 3>I know nothing about who uttered them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know nothing about who reported them.</v>

1852
01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:26.910
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your question is basically,</v>

1853
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:30.420
<v Speaker 3>some people said some bad things after I</v>
<v Speaker 3>taught.</v>

1854
01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:32.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be,</v>

1855
01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:34.590
<v Speaker 3>but I have no idea what to do about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1856
01:29:34.591 --> 01:29:35.424
<v Speaker 3>And I don't take responsibility for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not specific enough to take </v>

1857
01:29:37.951 --> 01:29:40.300
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1858
01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.460
<v Speaker 3>So we do have the officers have to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

1859
01:29:45.090 --> 01:29:46.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate that you have an opinion,</v>

1860
01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:49.640
<v Speaker 3>but at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1861
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:53.130
<v Speaker 3>at some point we do need to call it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1862
01:29:53.490 --> 01:29:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

1863
01:29:54.751 --> 01:29:57.180
<v Speaker 3>Akash and Professor Peterson so much.</v>

1864
01:29:57.810 --> 01:30:02.810
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
