1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
<v Speaker 1>It happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we've got to the point where the </v>

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>story says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>human beings became self conscious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.253
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that we're terribly </v>

5
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:15.111
<v Speaker 1>self conscious about our inadequacies in</v>
<v Speaker 1>or vulnerabilities and that that sets up</v>

6
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:16.164
<v Speaker 1>enmity between men and women and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>dooms women to pain in childbirth and </v>

7
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>child rearing and a dooms men to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big problem.</v>

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.623
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now the next story that comes up in </v>

9
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>the sequences in the story of Cain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abel.</v>

10
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.053
<v Speaker 1>Now you know we talked about the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos and then the terrible mother </v>

11
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:36.204
<v Speaker 1>and the creative mother and on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical father in the secure father </v>

12
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:41.814
<v Speaker 1>and then the adversary and the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel are the first </v>

13
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:45.864
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of the adversary in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero and what happens is they emerge as </v>

14
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>soon as the genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original genesis story.</v>

15
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.363
<v Speaker 1>And so what the story basically proposes</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that once people became self </v>

16
00:00:57.371 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>conscious to modes of being emerged as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that,</v>

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>and one mode is represented by Cain in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other mode is represented by Abel.</v>

18
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.073
<v Speaker 1>And that's echoed in the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hostile brothers in stories of hostile </v>

19
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>brothers everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also paralleled in Christianity</v>

20
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>by the idea of the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ and Satan.</v>

21
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>So it's like Cain and Abel are </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursors to the idea of Christ and,</v>

22
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.563
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

23
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>and Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens is that,</v>

24
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.003
<v Speaker 1>so kane is the older brother and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes him sort of the embodiment of </v>

25
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:31.224
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would also be the favored one in </v>

26
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:33.894
<v Speaker 1>terms of the traditions of the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israelites because he would be the one </v>

27
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>that inherits everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything.</v>

28
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>So he's actually the one that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the embodiment of tradition.</v>

29
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And there's some advantages to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's privileged because of it.</v>

30
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.034
<v Speaker 1>But there's some disadvantages because </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that culture itself has </v>

31
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>become sterile and inappropriate and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests that.</v>

32
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>That means that he manifests error by </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely being what he was.</v>

33
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens with and enable is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>young is the young brother.</v>

34
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.563
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

35
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Abel was a keeper of sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</v>

36
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.783
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

37
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a dichotomy of,</v>

38
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.173
<v Speaker 1>of professions here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people have read that in all sorts </v>

39
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:21.994
<v Speaker 1>of different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the ways that you can think </v>

40
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 1>about it is that there are valid </v>
<v Speaker 1>different modes of being in the world,</v>

41
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can be in this situation,</v>

42
00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Speaker 1>you can be a tiller of the ground or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeper of animals,</v>

43
00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:34.024
<v Speaker 1>but in the world in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can adopt any number of roles that </v>

44
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>suffice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be a plumber,</v>

45
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:40.180
<v Speaker 1>you can be a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>and there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

47
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.453
<v Speaker 1>there's ways of acting within those </v>
<v Speaker 1>roles that transcend the roles </v>

48
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:46.984
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of what's being </v>

49
00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:51.970
<v Speaker 1>exemplified in Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can,</v>

50
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.190
<v Speaker 1>they can function in the world despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>their different.</v>

51
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>They're different roles.</v>

52
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.123
<v Speaker 1>In process of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came to pass that cain brought the </v>

53
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>fruit of the ground and offering unto </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lord and Abel,</v>

54
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:05.810
<v Speaker 1>he also brought of the firstlings of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>flock and of the fat they're up.</v>

55
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Now that's very archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of sacrifice.</v>

56
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what happens is that you're</v>

57
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:11.884
<v Speaker 1>trying to get God on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so God seems to want something from </v>

58
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>you because he's keeps demanding this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

59
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:19.144
<v Speaker 1>reality wants something from you once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to behave in a certain way so that </v>

61
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't suffer any more than you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to win so that things go well for you.</v>

62
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.523
<v Speaker 1>Now human beings at this point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or trying to work out exactly what that </v>

63
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:29.854
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've already gotten to the point </v>

64
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:31.954
<v Speaker 1>where they're conceptually sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to understand that that means </v>

65
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>that sacrifices are necessary.</v>

66
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.053
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember that it's only prior to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this that human beings discovered time </v>

67
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:40.931
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

68
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:41.764
<v Speaker 1>That's when they discovered that their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become self conscious and discover </v>

69
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:45.154
<v Speaker 1>their extension across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the consequences of </v>

70
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:48.664
<v Speaker 1>realizing that your extended across time</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you also will come to the </v>

71
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:52.204
<v Speaker 1>realization that you may have to let go </v>
<v Speaker 1>of certain valuable things right now in </v>

72
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>order to make things work better in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

73
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>And you can't imagine that people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>woke up and figured that out.</v>

74
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.493
<v Speaker 1>I can took people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how long to sort that </v>

75
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:06.214
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tens of thousands of years to come </v>

76
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>up with that realization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

77
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>they would have acted it out like bees </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

78
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>You know they collect honey and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it through the winter,</v>

79
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

80
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they do.</v>

81
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're little super computers </v>
<v Speaker 1>like these bloody adams,</v>

82
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can act as sort of thing out without</v>

83
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:23.164
<v Speaker 1>realizing what you're up to and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motif of sacrifice seemed to be exactly </v>

84
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.394
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People stumbled onto the dramatic idea </v>

85
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:30.184
<v Speaker 1>that if you gave up something of value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be some reasonable </v>

86
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>possibility that God would smile on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

87
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

88
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>So that's why there's the sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

89
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>well why did they burn them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

90
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

91
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>people are trying to understand what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate fabric of existence is.</v>

92
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:49.624
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you can feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes and one of the places that </v>

93
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 1>people feel that regularly is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out at night and they look up at</v>

94
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:57.124
<v Speaker 1>the sky and they see this immense </v>
<v Speaker 1>blanket of eternity that's laid out </v>

95
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>before them and that induces a feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all.</v>

96
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.013
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that archaic people </v>
<v Speaker 1>took the notion of that all that was a </v>

97
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:14.440
<v Speaker 1>consequence of this apprehension and </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated that with some something like</v>

98
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>communion with the divine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually quite reasonable.</v>

99
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Because when you aren't looking out into</v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

100
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 1>you are looking into the farthest </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaches of being.</v>

101
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.223
<v Speaker 1>You can see back millions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of years back into </v>

102
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>time and you see you gaze out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite expanses of being.</v>

103
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.653
<v Speaker 1>So it's not unreasonable to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense at that moment you have </v>

104
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>some connection with what's infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that happens to be.</v>

105
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you feel that rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than thinking.</v>

106
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.913
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea basically emerged that the </v>

107
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>divine was up in the sky and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the divine was up in this guy,</v>

108
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.793
<v Speaker 1>you could maybe communicate it with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>by sending messages up there and one of </v>

109
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:51.484
<v Speaker 1>the ways you could do that was with </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke and so if you're burning these </v>

110
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:55.324
<v Speaker 1>things that you're offering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to push the smoke up to God and </v>

111
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.454
<v Speaker 1>he can do a molecular analysis and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>if what you're offering is of any </v>

112
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>reasonable quality.</v>

113
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>And if it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Poof,</v>

114
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>you know God's going to be thrilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

115
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.303
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens is that keynes </v>

116
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.293
<v Speaker 1>offerings are rejected and ables </v>
<v Speaker 1>offerings are accepted and so what that </v>

117
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.364
<v Speaker 1>means is that cane gets the short end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stick and able gets everything good </v>

118
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:21.704
<v Speaker 1>happening to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you see happening is that </v>

119
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.453
<v Speaker 1>there's the notion of two paths of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that's favored in one that isn't </v>

120
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:28.934
<v Speaker 1>favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the story is very ambivalent about </v>

121
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>why Kane is not favored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enable is,</v>

122
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

123
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>you can read it multiple ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just say,</v>

124
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:37.574
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's basically being a son of a bitch </v>

125
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:39.524
<v Speaker 1>and he's not going to give cane anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because he's not in a very good </v>

126
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>mood that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can say,</v>

127
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:44.324
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ables doing something right in Kane </v>

128
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.124
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that interpreting the story </v>

129
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:48.464
<v Speaker 1>in either of those ways is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is perfectly illuminating because part </v>

130
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:52.184
<v Speaker 1>of the time in life it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's doing everything right and </v>

131
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>still they're just getting laid waste </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

132
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:58.214
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and center and someone else is doing </v>

133
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 1>something terribly and things are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>well for them and,</v>

134
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.833
<v Speaker 1>but then you also see the reverse where </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's doing well gets rewarded </v>

135
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>and someone who isn't doesn't.</v>

136
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>So there's an ambivalence about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

137
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I think the story does indicate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain is doing something wrong,</v>

138
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't do that until later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>

139
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.263
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just go down to the next section </v>

140
00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:32.484
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

141
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.310
<v Speaker 1>So what it came enables sacrifice in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical version cited here,</v>

142
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:46.144
<v Speaker 1>the nature of cane sacrifices left </v>
<v Speaker 1>unclear except that it is over the </v>

143
00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:51.850
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's vegetative and therefore bloodless.</v>

144
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Every canonical tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

145
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:56.290
<v Speaker 1>carries with it a surrounding cloud of </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar stories,</v>

146
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:57.124
<v Speaker 1>some derivative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some the product of a different </v>

147
00:07:58.301 --> 00:07:59.134
<v Speaker 1>developmental path and tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some intermingled with other stories in </v>

148
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:04.990
<v Speaker 1>some variants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cane sacrifices not only of the ground,</v>

149
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's of low quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain is unwilling to offer up the finest</v>

150
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:10.054
<v Speaker 1>fruits of his labors to go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's he does not really sacrifice </v>

151
00:08:12.731 --> 00:08:13.564
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to keep everything good to </v>

152
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he selfish as well as faithless.</v>

153
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Able by contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offers up the best of what he has.</v>

154
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.650
<v Speaker 1>What does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

155
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:26.080
<v Speaker 1>we already know we say to our children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do your best.</v>

156
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.153
<v Speaker 1>Do not hide your light under a Bushel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do not say conserve your baster or </v>

157
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:31.330
<v Speaker 1>hide your best.</v>

158
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.930
<v Speaker 1>We mean offer the best you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it in good faith.</v>

159
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.150
<v Speaker 1>You will not be absolutely assured of </v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

160
00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:37.984
<v Speaker 1>but your chances will be into increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that such increased as </v>

161
00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:41.374
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly it's an overstatement to say </v>

162
00:08:43.361 --> 00:08:44.194
<v Speaker 1>that if you do not believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you at least wish with all your heart </v>

163
00:08:46.121 --> 00:08:48.670
<v Speaker 1>that it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is hope to not believe.</v>

164
00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:51.730
<v Speaker 1>This is to risk descent into the deepest</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasms of cynicism.</v>

165
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God accepts able sacrifice,</v>

166
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:56.244
<v Speaker 1>offers him respect and renders his life </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable despite its terrible </v>

167
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cane sacrifice,</v>

168
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:04.330
<v Speaker 1>however he rejects this drives cane into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a murderous rage,</v>

169
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.273
<v Speaker 1>rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Lord God had respect unto Abel </v>

170
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:08.514
<v Speaker 1>and his offering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unto Cain and his offering he did </v>

171
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>not have respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea basically is that Abel makes</v>

172
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 1>these sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gay,</v>

173
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.360
<v Speaker 1>he's putting forth the best that he has.</v>

174
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 1>He's doing his best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

175
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>it's actually working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone likes able,</v>

176
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has,</v>

177
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 1>he's getting along with his wife's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his flocks are increasing.</v>

178
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>And so he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything's going well.</v>

179
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Cain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things aren't going very well at all and</v>

180
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 1>no one really cares for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And besides that,</v>

181
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.480
<v Speaker 1>he's burning with jealousy because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

182
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:37.314
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that he's slaving way </v>
<v Speaker 1>raising all these vegetables and trying </v>

183
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:43.020
<v Speaker 1>to offer them to God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing is going his way.</v>

184
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>So not only are things going badly for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

185
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.540
<v Speaker 1>but he's increasingly disaffected by it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

186
00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

187
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.923
<v Speaker 1>it's not difficult to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well that what </v>

188
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:55.794
<v Speaker 1>happens to you if you're working away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think diligently and properly and </v>

189
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:00.534
<v Speaker 1>nothing is going your way and some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>son of a bitches just flourishing like </v>

190
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:04.404
<v Speaker 1>mad beside you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's going to make you vengeful </v>

191
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:09.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and irritated and anxious and angry and,</v>

192
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 1>and homicidal for that matter.</v>

193
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't take very long before </v>
<v Speaker 1>people reached that stage,</v>

194
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 1>at least not in their fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the story says,</v>

195
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>and Cain was very wroth and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>countenance fell.</v>

196
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.780
<v Speaker 1>And what that meant is he's angry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his face changes to indicate that.</v>

197
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:25.614
<v Speaker 1>So he's got this continual look of </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetual dis affectation and anger on </v>

198
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>his face because things aren't going </v>
<v Speaker 1>well for them.</v>

199
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.873
<v Speaker 1>So that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he goes and has a chat with God </v>

200
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>because he's not very happy about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole situation.</v>

201
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think people do that all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

202
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.080
<v Speaker 1>even if they don't necessarily formulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in those terms,</v>

203
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

204
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:45.564
<v Speaker 1>what's the nature of reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm busting myself in half here trying </v>

205
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:50.520
<v Speaker 1>to make things work properly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's going well.</v>

206
00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:52.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like what kind of stupid universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that?</v>

207
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.723
<v Speaker 1>And for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a colocoy with God because you </v>

208
00:10:57.241 --> 00:10:58.074
<v Speaker 1>don't start thinking about the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>fabric of reality without bringing </v>

209
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:02.610
<v Speaker 1>religious intuitions into it.</v>

210
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.623
<v Speaker 1>You can't even ask such a question </v>
<v Speaker 1>without acting in a quasi religious </v>

211
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:08.880
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what happens.</v>

212
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:09.714
<v Speaker 1>It took me a long time to unpack this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes and has the cha chat with </v>

213
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Yahweh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with God,</v>

214
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.490
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord said to Cain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you angry and downcast?</v>

215
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.593
<v Speaker 1>Surely if you do right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ought to hold your head high sin </v>

216
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 1>crouches at your door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lusting for you,</v>

217
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:28.200
<v Speaker 1>yet you can master it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's very,</v>

218
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:30.360
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I translated those.</v>

219
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I got a translation to those lines from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named miles from 1995.</v>

220
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.093
<v Speaker 1>Now it's so what happens is the king </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes and has a chat with God about how </v>

221
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:42.030
<v Speaker 1>things aren't going very well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what he's trying to do is hold</v>

222
00:11:42.031 --> 00:11:42.864
<v Speaker 1>God to account for why he made such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid universe where everything keeps </v>

223
00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:50.481
<v Speaker 1>going wrong and what God says to him is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you angry and downcast?</v>

224
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.743
<v Speaker 1>If you do right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ought to be able to hold your head </v>

225
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:54.694
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an intimation there that the </v>

226
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:56.914
<v Speaker 1>reason the cane is wandering around like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is because there's actually </v>

227
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:00.184
<v Speaker 1>something he's doing that's not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that the structure of reality </v>

228
00:12:03.441 --> 00:12:04.274
<v Speaker 1>has got a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that cane has a problem and god </v>

229
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:06.641
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

230
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:09.610
<v Speaker 1>if you just do things properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you could stand up.</v>

231
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:12.790
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have to be a defeated </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobster all hunched over and aggravated.</v>

232
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:13.803
<v Speaker 1>You could stand up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold yourself properly and be the be </v>

233
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly integrated in a proper manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the way being is unfolding.</v>

234
00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:24.634
<v Speaker 1>And then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sin crutches at your door lusting for </v>

235
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet you can master it.</v>

236
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very interesting line.</v>

237
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.980
<v Speaker 1>So I found out that there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an under,</v>

238
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.713
<v Speaker 1>there's a metaphorical context within </v>
<v Speaker 1>which those lines are attorney and </v>

239
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:42.370
<v Speaker 1>here's the context.</v>

240
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 1>So God basically tells Kane that sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is misbehavior,</v>

241
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:47.554
<v Speaker 1>is a kind of personality and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality that he associates it with </v>

242
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:51.783
<v Speaker 1>is something like a sexually aroused </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory cat and he tells Kane that </v>

243
00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:56.974
<v Speaker 1>he's no canes in house and that thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>crouching at the door and it's waiting </v>

244
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:00.934
<v Speaker 1>to jump on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he tells Kane that that that's </v>

245
00:13:04.631 --> 00:13:06.730
<v Speaker 1>a real threat and it's right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could,</v>

246
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>he could not have that happen if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>

247
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.203
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole set of inferences in </v>

248
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:13.930
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one inference is cain invites it in.</v>

249
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not remember,</v>

250
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:17.860
<v Speaker 1>you have to invite the vampire into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

251
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.470
<v Speaker 1>It can't just come in and of its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>accord.</v>

252
00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:21.304
<v Speaker 1>You have to open the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the first thing God tells </v>

253
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:23.951
<v Speaker 1>Kane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

254
00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:24.784
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

255
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.530
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things aren't going very well,</v>

256
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:27.364
<v Speaker 1>but that things at your door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you invited it in and you could master </v>

257
00:13:30.931 --> 00:13:32.380
<v Speaker 1>it if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you chose not to.</v>

258
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.660
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing that that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conceptualization of the CNS,</v>

259
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:37.563
<v Speaker 1>this sort of angry and lustful cap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sexual connotation to it and </v>

260
00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:44.950
<v Speaker 1>so the thing pounces on cane and has its</v>
<v Speaker 1>way with him,</v>

261
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.173
<v Speaker 1>so there's an idea that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sexual interaction between Cain </v>

262
00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>and this force so that it's a creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>interplay.</v>

263
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not only that he's dominated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sin,</v>

264
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:57.783
<v Speaker 1>it's that he brings it in and enters </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a creative union with it and </v>

265
00:14:00.911 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 1>produces something out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the mixture.</v>

266
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was reading the column by kids,</v>

267
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:07.461
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

268
00:14:07.461 --> 00:14:09.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can see exactly that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their behavior.</v>

269
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:12.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like he knew perfectly well what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was up to.</v>

270
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.833
<v Speaker 1>He knew perfectly well what he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>inviting in and he put his own </v>

271
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:17.584
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily creative twist on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just that he was possessed by </v>

272
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:21.484
<v Speaker 1>an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he spent months planning with his </v>

273
00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:24.244
<v Speaker 1>horrible little compatriot about exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they were gonna blow up the school </v>

274
00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:27.904
<v Speaker 1>and the town and they would have liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have blown up the whole damn city </v>

275
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:30.963
<v Speaker 1>that was part of their plan and exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they were going to turn that into a </v>

276
00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:37.700
<v Speaker 1>creative spectacle that would be covered</v>
<v Speaker 1>by networks all over the land,</v>

277
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.420
<v Speaker 1>perfectly consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single bit of this.</v>

278
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.620
<v Speaker 1>So they put their own twist on it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of being angry and resentful</v>

279
00:14:44.621 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Speaker 1>and unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

280
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so God tells Kane,</v>

281
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 1>why are you coming to complain to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with reality.</v>

283
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get your act together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave properly.</v>

284
00:14:57.921 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 1>You can stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

285
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:59.803
<v Speaker 1>hold your head up high and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to let this thing that's tempting </v>

286
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you have its way with you and enter into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a creative union with it.</v>

287
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:06.884
<v Speaker 1>You can just behave properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so kane leaves and then he's really </v>

288
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.950
<v Speaker 1>annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason he's annoyed just because</v>

289
00:15:12.951 --> 00:15:13.784
<v Speaker 1>he's going in there hoping that he'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>straighten out with a little chat and </v>

290
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.933
<v Speaker 1>sent reality straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and basically what he finds out is that </v>

291
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:19.784
<v Speaker 1>as far as God's concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that all these terrible </v>

292
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:21.974
<v Speaker 1>things are happening to him is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not anywhere near what he could be </v>

293
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 1>and he's setting himself up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>continual failure.</v>

294
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 1>And so that really annoys him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

295
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 1>not only is he mad about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's failing,</v>

296
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 1>but he's even more mad because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it through.</v>

297
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.434
<v Speaker 1>He realized that it was actually his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fault and that the reason these things </v>

298
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:40.580
<v Speaker 1>are happening to him is because he's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he could be.</v>

299
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.110
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

300
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 1>what does he do as a consequence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

301
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:44.871
<v Speaker 1>you could think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

302
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:45.704
<v Speaker 1>he could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

303
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 1>little apology to God and try to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself on the right track.</v>

304
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.700
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't what happens at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes and kills Abel with a rock.</v>

305
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.621
<v Speaker 1>Now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

306
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.150
<v Speaker 1>why does he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

307
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 1>that's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly.</v>

308
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abel is obviously God's favorite.</v>

309
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.603
<v Speaker 1>So he's doing everything he can to pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>them down and you think people do that </v>

310
00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:06.920
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're jealous of someone else's</v>

311
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:07.754
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things really played themselves </v>

312
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 1>out in junior high and high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also play out in in adult life,</v>

313
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 1>you'll do everything you can to pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the thing that's hovering above you</v>

314
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and making you look bad from as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the reflection.</v>

315
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.470
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to destroy the ideal than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to try to live up to it and people do</v>

316
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:28.304
<v Speaker 1>that all the time and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishing each other for their virtues </v>

317
00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 1>and they do that because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

318
00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can pull down the ideal and</v>

319
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 1>then they don't have the mirror that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes themselves uncomfortable,</v>

320
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.130
<v Speaker 1>but they can also do that as revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>against God.</v>

321
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:40.791
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

322
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:43.320
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you favor and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to torture me to death,</v>

323
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.173
<v Speaker 1>then I'll just destroy what you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up to be the best manifestation </v>

324
00:16:47.601 --> 00:16:48.434
<v Speaker 1>of what is at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll just see who's who's </v>

325
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 1>winning this war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's winning the war of being.</v>

326
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.243
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes out and kills Abel and so God </v>

327
00:16:58.431 --> 00:16:59.264
<v Speaker 1>comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible thing because it means </v>

328
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:02.204
<v Speaker 1>he destroys his own ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's perfectly willing to pay that </v>

329
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:09.170
<v Speaker 1>price as long as he can get revenge for </v>
<v Speaker 1>his misery and his revenge on God.</v>

330
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.213
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting too because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the writings of people who </v>

331
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:17.060
<v Speaker 1>commit real atrocities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that they've gone far beyond</v>

332
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:20.450
<v Speaker 1>any desire for individual revenge like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids that people,</v>

333
00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.300
<v Speaker 1>the columbine kids shot up in in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>

334
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even necessarily have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>grudge against those particular kids.</v>

335
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.180
<v Speaker 1>It was like mayhem for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him sake,</v>

336
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.014
<v Speaker 1>and it was actually better if they shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that was innocent because that </v>

337
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:36.170
<v Speaker 1>was a lot more of a protest that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting someone who is guilty.</v>

338
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're shooting someone who's bullied</v>

339
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's just gel.</v>

340
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 1>That's just justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

341
00:17:41.631 --> 00:17:42.464
<v Speaker 1>it's a warped and bent form of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you go into the high school and </v>

342
00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:47.504
<v Speaker 1>shoot someone who's been good to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're really making a </v>

343
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 1>statement about just what you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the world and if you're willing to</v>

344
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:55.140
<v Speaker 1>blow your head off afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

345
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.153
<v Speaker 1>it's just that much more indication that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say to hell with everything </v>

346
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:01.480
<v Speaker 1>and that nothing is worth having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like,</v>

347
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

348
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 1>that's a demonstration of that mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking right down to the bottom.</v>

349
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes out there and he kills Abel.</v>

350
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I'll read you this paragraph.</v>

351
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Kane is faced with a very stark choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His pride,</v>

352
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.073
<v Speaker 1>his belief in his own omniscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compels him to repeat actions that do </v>

353
00:18:23.421 --> 00:18:27.140
<v Speaker 1>not produce their desired outcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite yourself to find failure.</v>

354
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.213
<v Speaker 1>This breeds a deep resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once his pride and resentment grow past </v>

355
00:18:31.221 --> 00:18:33.890
<v Speaker 1>a certain threshold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts to fantasize about revenge and</v>

356
00:18:33.891 --> 00:18:37.220
<v Speaker 1>then about murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gap between fantasy and action grows</v>

357
00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:38.054
<v Speaker 1>even smaller as resentment builds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one day the opportunity manifests </v>

358
00:18:40.941 --> 00:18:43.490
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Able says something optimistic,</v>

359
00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:44.324
<v Speaker 1>deserving and promising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that straw that breaks the camel's </v>

360
00:18:46.071 --> 00:18:48.560
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it is.</v>

361
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.670
<v Speaker 1>At first it was just resentment of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful deep resentment,</v>

362
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.533
<v Speaker 1>but it does not have to end there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no real end with enough </v>

363
00:18:56.781 --> 00:18:59.960
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can kill once if you can kill once.</v>

364
00:18:59.961 --> 00:19:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Why not 10?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If 10,</v>

365
00:19:01.941 --> 00:19:04.070
<v Speaker 1>why not 100?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If 100,</v>

366
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.710
<v Speaker 1>why not 10,000?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not a million?</v>

367
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Sterling was just getting warmed up when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he killed 6 million Ukrainians in the 19</v>

368
00:19:11.121 --> 00:19:11.954
<v Speaker 1>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's evidence from the KGB archives </v>

369
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:14.904
<v Speaker 1>that Stellan was preparing for the Third</v>
<v Speaker 1>World War when he was killed by his own </v>

370
00:19:17.661 --> 00:19:21.560
<v Speaker 1>people in the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who's to say that Hitler really lost</v>

371
00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:22.394
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends entirely on what he was </v>

372
00:19:23.751 --> 00:19:26.630
<v Speaker 1>aiming for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he got just what he aimed for when</v>

373
00:19:26.631 --> 00:19:27.464
<v Speaker 1>he blew his brains out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over his bunker deep underneath </v>

374
00:19:29.271 --> 00:19:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while Europe burned to ashes around it.</v>

375
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Why do we assist upon believing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every tyrant fights award to win?</v>

376
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.293
<v Speaker 1>Cane believed that the world was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible and unreasonable place bent on </v>

377
00:19:40.911 --> 00:19:42.770
<v Speaker 1>his suction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and destruction.</v>

378
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.280
<v Speaker 1>He thought that hard work and sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>was for babies and fools.</v>

379
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.670
<v Speaker 1>This is from Richard the third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should wrath be mute and theory?</v>

380
00:19:51.761 --> 00:19:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am no baby.</v>

381
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with based prayers,</v>

382
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I should repent the evils that I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

383
00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.000
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst that ever.</v>

384
00:19:59.001 --> 00:20:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Yet I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would I perform if I might have my will,</v>

385
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.090
<v Speaker 1>if one good deed in all my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

386
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I do repent it from my very soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Harris.</v>

387
00:20:09.531 --> 00:20:10.364
<v Speaker 1>This is from Columbine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most literate of the two killers </v>

388
00:20:13.371 --> 00:20:14.990
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate the fucking world.</v>

389
00:20:14.991 --> 00:20:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Kill mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one should survive.</v>

390
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.733
<v Speaker 1>Most investigators of the columbine </v>
<v Speaker 1>killings claim they cannot understand </v>

391
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:24.600
<v Speaker 1>the boys motivations and they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand them.</v>

392
00:20:24.601 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 1>They just don't want to.</v>

393
00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.173
<v Speaker 1>Harris said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would sooner die than be trained my </v>

394
00:20:29.831 --> 00:20:32.530
<v Speaker 1>own thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before I leave this worthless place,</v>

395
00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:34.660
<v Speaker 1>I will kill whoever id him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfit.</v>

396
00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.123
<v Speaker 1>Harris transformed himself into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal embodiment of Cain who's </v>

397
00:20:39.221 --> 00:20:41.740
<v Speaker 1>ultimate prototype is motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to girth.</v>

398
00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:45.880
<v Speaker 1>That by the following principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is Mephistopheles.</v>

399
00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 1>The spirit I endlessly denies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rightly to,</v>

400
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.553
<v Speaker 1>for all that comes to birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fit for overthrow as nothing worth </v>

401
00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 1>were for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're better sterilized.</v>

402
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 1>That's all that's here is evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized his game to me and downfall,</v>

403
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.980
<v Speaker 1>downfall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>runes sin,</v>

404
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:04.563
<v Speaker 1>very element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prosper in Harris the day before his </v>

405
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:10.810
<v Speaker 1>mass murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 26 point five hours from now,</v>

406
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:15.280
<v Speaker 1>the judgment will begun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Begin difficult but not impossible.</v>

407
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nerve wracking,</v>

408
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 1>and fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What fun is life without a little death?</v>

409
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:25.570
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting when I'm in my human </v>
<v Speaker 1>form knowing I'm going to die.</v>

410
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Everything hasn't touched of triviality </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

411
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.500
<v Speaker 1>With Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader.</v>

412
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens then is God finds caden </v>

413
00:21:43.441 --> 00:21:46.620
<v Speaker 1>has a little chat with him and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you tell the ground,</v>

414
00:21:46.621 --> 00:21:49.800
<v Speaker 1>it will not hence forth yield on Unti </v>
<v Speaker 1>unto the her strength.</v>

415
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.670
<v Speaker 1>He'll be a fugitive and a vagabond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cain said unto the Lord,</v>

416
00:21:53.671 --> 00:21:55.680
<v Speaker 1>my punishment is greater than I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>

417
00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Behold though it's driven me out of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

418
00:21:57.811 --> 00:22:00.510
<v Speaker 1>from the face of the earth and from thy </v>
<v Speaker 1>face shall I be hidden,</v>

419
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>

420
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.230
<v Speaker 1>And that it shall come to pass that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who finds me will slay me,</v>

421
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.040
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore whoever slayeth Cain,</v>

422
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.903
<v Speaker 1>vengeance shall be taken up on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven fold and the Lord set a mark on </v>

423
00:22:15.061 --> 00:22:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Cain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lest any finding him should kill him.</v>

424
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.593
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the aftermath of that story seems to </v>

425
00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:23.940
<v Speaker 1>be something like that.</v>

426
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:29.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's cane and then Adam and eve </v>
<v Speaker 1>have another son who's name is seth,</v>

427
00:22:29.101 --> 00:22:29.934
<v Speaker 1>and Seth produces descendants and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them down the chain is Noah </v>

428
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.003
<v Speaker 1>and he saves the world from the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But cain produces descendants two and </v>

429
00:22:38.671 --> 00:22:41.940
<v Speaker 1>each of the descendant generation seemed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get more and more aggressive.</v>

430
00:22:41.941 --> 00:22:42.774
<v Speaker 1>And the generation that produces a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Tubal tubilcain seems to be the </v>

431
00:22:46.381 --> 00:22:49.440
<v Speaker 1>same generation as no on the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>branch and Tubal.</v>

432
00:22:49.441 --> 00:22:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Cain is by tradition the first person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who produces our artifacts,</v>

433
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.163
<v Speaker 1>tools of warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an idea in the old </v>

434
00:22:58.231 --> 00:22:59.064
<v Speaker 1>testament in this story that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual murderous resentment of the </v>

435
00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:03.924
<v Speaker 1>individual who won't make the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices that distributes itself into </v>

436
00:23:07.321 --> 00:23:11.220
<v Speaker 1>the community and culminates in </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing brutality,</v>

437
00:23:11.221 --> 00:23:16.221
<v Speaker 1>atrocity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally into war Tubilcain T U B a l</v>

438
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Dash c a r I n,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

439
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:28.680
<v Speaker 1>And so lamb neck is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

440
00:23:28.681 --> 00:23:30.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kane Kane's descendants.</v>

441
00:23:30.691 --> 00:23:34.230
<v Speaker 1>And this is lamb economic kills two men </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he is wounded and hurt,</v>

442
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.490
<v Speaker 1>and Lamach says unto his wives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ada and Zillah hear my voice is wives of</v>

443
00:23:38.491 --> 00:23:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Lamech Hearken unto my speech for why </v>
<v Speaker 1>have slammed a man to my wounding</v>

444
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 1>and a young man to my hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly</v>

445
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Eq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 and seven fold.</v>

446
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 1>So there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the exponential distribution</v>

447
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:55.514
<v Speaker 1>of brutality into the community as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of this initial adoption of </v>

448
00:23:58.761 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 1>a particular form of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

449
00:24:00.681 --> 00:24:05.681
<v Speaker 1>So here's the situation that's laid out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in genesis as far as I can tell,</v>

450
00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:06.644
<v Speaker 1>is that people emerge as self conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not produces a terrible burden on </v>

451
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:11.384
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the burden is even either </v>

452
00:24:13.011 --> 00:24:16.880
<v Speaker 1>handled in the appropriate manner with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper sacrifices or it's not.</v>

453
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.043
<v Speaker 1>If it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences are that everything </v>

454
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:25.001
<v Speaker 1>degenerates into brutality and atrocity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me to be approximately</v>

455
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:26.444
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can understand both cane </v>

456
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 1>enables motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

457
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.430
<v Speaker 1>cain gets brutal and resentment full </v>
<v Speaker 1>because things don't go well for him and</v>

458
00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:37.070
<v Speaker 1>because he's suffering and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary,</v>

459
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you're suffering does seem</v>

460
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:40.574
<v Speaker 1>to be entirely arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of the moral of the story is </v>

461
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 1>that if you allow that to make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and vengeful,</v>

462
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.043
<v Speaker 1>that you'll participate in processes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make things absolutely unbearable </v>

463
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:54.200
<v Speaker 1>and make the entire situation much </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

464
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.423
<v Speaker 1>And all the existential commentary I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>read on the things that happened in the </v>

465
00:24:58.131 --> 00:24:58.964
<v Speaker 1>second world war and in the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in China for that matter seemed to </v>

466
00:25:03.591 --> 00:25:04.424
<v Speaker 1>lay out exactly the same story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is once individuals get corrupted </v>

467
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:10.910
<v Speaker 1>because they're unhappy with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of their being,</v>

468
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.923
<v Speaker 1>they can corrupt the entire social </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape and the entire world and </v>

469
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:15.524
<v Speaker 1>things go from bad to worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they're as bad as they can </v>

470
00:25:17.211 --> 00:25:21.470
<v Speaker 1>possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how things go badly.</v>

471
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.371
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

472
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:23.810
<v Speaker 1>how do things go well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

473
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately we missed one lecture,</v>

474
00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:28.190
<v Speaker 1>but there's some things that I can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that I,</v>

475
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Speaker 1>that I think I know about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

476
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.890
<v Speaker 1>what are you laughing about?</v>

477
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.111
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

478
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:36.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

479
00:25:36.951 --> 00:25:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

480
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.200
<v Speaker 1>there's other things that I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you about,</v>

481
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:40.063
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you about this anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't do it in quite as much </v>

482
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:43.094
<v Speaker 1>depth as I would have liked to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't seem to me that it's </v>

483
00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:49.970
<v Speaker 1>reasonable to try to impose an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological solution on the world.</v>

484
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.073
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable is because it leads you into </v>

485
00:25:53.121 --> 00:25:53.954
<v Speaker 1>something that's akin to ascend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pride you think you have the damn </v>

486
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:57.554
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you know everything and you </v>

487
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:02.660
<v Speaker 1>can impose that answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is that it,</v>

488
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.553
<v Speaker 1>it seems to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of sacrifices that </v>

489
00:26:05.721 --> 00:26:06.554
<v Speaker 1>produces the kind of sacrifices that God</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't find very acceptable and things </v>

490
00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:12.050
<v Speaker 1>go from bad to worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

491
00:26:12.051 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the alternative?</v>

492
00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.950
<v Speaker 1>What's the potential alternative mode of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being?</v>

493
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.330
<v Speaker 1>And so here's something that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about.</v>

494
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.183
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

495
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing that I want to tell </v>

496
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:24.800
<v Speaker 1>you about Christianity that's relevant </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this regard.</v>

497
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:26.150
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

498
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.840
<v Speaker 1>you'll see this in the last quarter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the maps of meaning when you read it,</v>

499
00:26:29.841 --> 00:26:30.674
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's images that have popped up in </v>

500
00:26:32.031 --> 00:26:32.864
<v Speaker 1>the middle agents where the tree of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tree in the garden of Eden is </v>

501
00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:37.694
<v Speaker 1>there again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the one side of the tree there </v>

502
00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:41.960
<v Speaker 1>are skulls and those are being handed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out by eve.</v>

503
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And on the other side there are these </v>
<v Speaker 1>little things that are liked fruits,</v>

504
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.633
<v Speaker 1>but they're representatives of the hosts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are given to people when they </v>

505
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:54.060
<v Speaker 1>undergo the mass in Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those little hosts which are made</v>

506
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:56.490
<v Speaker 1>out of wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a dying and resurrected God,</v>

507
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:57.563
<v Speaker 1>are like the body of the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea behind the masses that </v>

508
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.673
<v Speaker 1>in order to overcome death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to incorporate the body </v>

509
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:06.030
<v Speaker 1>of the hero and the body of the hero.</v>

510
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:10.410
<v Speaker 1>The hero is the person in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological landscape who is willing to</v>

511
00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:15.411
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily confront death and will as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence be reborn.</v>

512
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.033
<v Speaker 1>Now I think that that can be ran at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a psychological level because we </v>

513
00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.304
<v Speaker 1>already talked about the fact that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things that happens when you're </v>

514
00:27:23.131 --> 00:27:23.964
<v Speaker 1>in deep error is that you can allow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>erroneous structure to dissolve into </v>

515
00:27:27.721 --> 00:27:32.100
<v Speaker 1>something that's chaotic and then have </v>
<v Speaker 1>it reemerged as something that's new.</v>

516
00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.243
<v Speaker 1>The idea that's lurking behind this idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of transformation is that you should </v>

517
00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:41.010
<v Speaker 1>identify yourself not with the initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of order,</v>

518
00:27:41.011 --> 00:27:41.844
<v Speaker 1>which is like a particular way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world and you shouldn't </v>

519
00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:45.354
<v Speaker 1>identify yourself with the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos that's there when everything </v>

520
00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 1>collapses around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did,</v>

521
00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:51.504
<v Speaker 1>you should identify yourself with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of transformation from order </v>

522
00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.900
<v Speaker 1>through chaos and then into a new form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>

523
00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.003
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that you confront the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that reality is continually </v>

524
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:06.360
<v Speaker 1>transforming is by allowing yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform with it.</v>

525
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:09.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's the volunteer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the voluntary.</v>

526
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the taking on of the voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

527
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:18.050
<v Speaker 1>that have continual voluntary death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebirth in the service of higher being.</v>

528
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.000
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know the potential limits </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

529
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.553
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously in their current </v>

530
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:26.120
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

531
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.383
<v Speaker 1>everyone is still faced with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of ill health and a finite </v>

532
00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:32.460
<v Speaker 1>lifespan and all of the things that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with that,</v>

533
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:33.294
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know the limits of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential dynamic flexibility and we </v>

534
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:37.554
<v Speaker 1>sure do know that if you hold onto ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being that are counterproductive for </v>

535
00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Speaker 1>any length of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

536
00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:44.700
<v Speaker 1>that kills you faster and makes you more</v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>

537
00:28:44.701 --> 00:28:45.534
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's happening.</v>

538
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing happens as well when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

539
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wallowing and trapped in a chaotic </v>

540
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.010
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

541
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.010
<v Speaker 1>So here's a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

542
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.903
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that the new agers </v>
<v Speaker 1>will tell you is that you should follow </v>

543
00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:00.204
<v Speaker 1>your bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have a big problem with that </v>

544
00:29:01.921 --> 00:29:04.470
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's true and second,</v>

545
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.670
<v Speaker 1>because you pointed out that if you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall in what you find deeply meaningful,</v>

546
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.970
<v Speaker 1>it's likely to take you to a place that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're most afraid of.</v>

547
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.553
<v Speaker 1>And so to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a barrier to enlightenment and </v>

548
00:29:15.691 --> 00:29:16.890
<v Speaker 1>the barrier is that</v>

549
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.453
<v Speaker 1>you'll face things that will pull you </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart before you'll face things that'll </v>

550
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.023
<v Speaker 1>put you together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what you faced that </v>

551
00:29:24.501 --> 00:29:25.334
<v Speaker 1>will pull you apart is all the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've done in the past that have </v>

552
00:29:27.621 --> 00:29:28.454
<v Speaker 1>been Sabala suboptimal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things have to be repaired and </v>

553
00:29:30.921 --> 00:29:32.540
<v Speaker 1>fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

554
00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:35.863
<v Speaker 1>If you put yourself in a situation where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're able to rectify the errors that </v>

555
00:29:39.741 --> 00:29:40.574
<v Speaker 1>you've made in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you straightened out the manner </v>

556
00:29:43.151 --> 00:29:43.984
<v Speaker 1>in which you're organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think that it might be possible </v>

557
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:48.214
<v Speaker 1>to live so that your forthrightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronting things as they move towards </v>

558
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:55.150
<v Speaker 1>you and if you're oriented towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>making them better,</v>

559
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:57.180
<v Speaker 1>like assume that that's your highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

560
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Say Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the purpose of life?</v>

561
00:29:58.721 --> 00:29:59.554
<v Speaker 1>And the purpose of life is to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>things as good as you can possibly make </v>

562
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:03.304
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be for you and it might </v>

563
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:07.750
<v Speaker 1>be for those around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might not even know exactly what</v>

564
00:30:07.751 --> 00:30:10.330
<v Speaker 1>that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes you're going to have to let</v>

565
00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:14.020
<v Speaker 1>go of what you think good is as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress towards it.</v>

566
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that if you orient </v>

567
00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:22.831
<v Speaker 1>yourself towards that and you allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to stop living in,</v>

568
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.293
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in theories that you know to be false </v>

569
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 1>and carrying false hoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're acting out and,</v>

570
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.330
<v Speaker 1>and believing in that you know to be not</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

571
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 1>but you can start to live in a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

572
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

573
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.020
<v Speaker 1>So here's the different way in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

574
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:49.933
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

575
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.173
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you have to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you don't know what the hell </v>

576
00:30:55.681 --> 00:30:56.514
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second you have to think to figure </v>

577
00:30:59.401 --> 00:31:00.510
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's humility.</v>

578
00:31:00.511 --> 00:31:01.344
<v Speaker 1>I think the second thing you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out is what you want and you </v>

579
00:31:04.621 --> 00:31:07.170
<v Speaker 1>either want things to be better or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want them to be worse,</v>

580
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:08.363
<v Speaker 1>and there's reasons for wanting them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be worse and the reasons are deep and </v>

581
00:31:12.061 --> 00:31:14.580
<v Speaker 1>they're justifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not helpful.</v>

582
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:19.140
<v Speaker 1>So then let's assume that you noticed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of you that's devoted,</v>

583
00:31:19.141 --> 00:31:19.974
<v Speaker 1>like cane to the destruction of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you understand what that is and </v>

584
00:31:22.591 --> 00:31:25.200
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to take it onto yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>to repair.</v>

585
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Then it isn't other people's evil that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to worry about.</v>

586
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It's your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you might say,</v>

587
00:31:31.951 --> 00:31:35.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should you do next?</v>

588
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.653
<v Speaker 1>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the pieces of literature from </v>

589
00:31:39.421 --> 00:31:40.254
<v Speaker 1>which I've learned from that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>address that is the sermon on the mount </v>

590
00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:46.560
<v Speaker 1>in the New Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one thing that happens in the sermon</v>

591
00:31:46.561 --> 00:31:47.394
<v Speaker 1>on the mount is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Christ says to his followers that </v>

592
00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:52.190
<v Speaker 1>they should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

593
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.920
<v Speaker 1>There isn't something specifically that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be pursuing.</v>

594
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:57.143
<v Speaker 1>What they should be doing instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just orienting themselves in a </v>

595
00:31:59.011 --> 00:31:59.844
<v Speaker 1>particular direction and the direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be towards what's best and what's </v>

596
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:05.573
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first step is you figure </v>

597
00:32:08.011 --> 00:32:10.470
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want things to be better?</v>

598
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you want them to be worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental question.</v>

599
00:32:13.501 --> 00:32:14.334
<v Speaker 1>So are you working for the betterment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being or for its transformation into </v>

600
00:32:17.281 --> 00:32:18.114
<v Speaker 1>hell?</v>

601
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:19.171
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

602
00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I want things to be better than the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you think is,</v>

603
00:32:21.511 --> 00:32:22.344
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't exactly know how to go about </v>

604
00:32:23.761 --> 00:32:24.630
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

605
00:32:24.631 --> 00:32:26.970
<v Speaker 1>so then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

606
00:32:26.971 --> 00:32:31.971
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that that's the point at </v>
<v Speaker 1>time when you try to eradicate from your</v>

607
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:36.180
<v Speaker 1>field of apprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you know to be false and</v>

608
00:32:36.181 --> 00:32:39.710
<v Speaker 1>unworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get rid of it as much as you can,</v>

609
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:40.544
<v Speaker 1>as fast as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of the way you can do that is </v>

610
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:43.214
<v Speaker 1>by listening to what you say and </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching what you do and you can listen </v>

611
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:48.644
<v Speaker 1>to what you say and you can find out if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually saying what you believe </v>

612
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:52.844
<v Speaker 1>to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the hypothesis and I think </v>

613
00:32:55.911 --> 00:32:56.744
<v Speaker 1>this is the hypothesis that's laid out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the transformation from the Old </v>

614
00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Testament to the New Testament </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

615
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:02.863
<v Speaker 1>but I also think it's the same idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Taoists were pursuing and the </v>

616
00:33:05.991 --> 00:33:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Buddhists we're pursuing.</v>

617
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.430
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's based on the idea of logos.</v>

618
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:16.870
<v Speaker 1>What would happen if instead of pursuing</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you think you should be pursuing,</v>

619
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.493
<v Speaker 1>you did something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you say to yourself in a </v>

620
00:33:20.811 --> 00:33:21.644
<v Speaker 1>position where you're trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>things better and the next consequence </v>

621
00:33:25.071 --> 00:33:29.930
<v Speaker 1>of that is to try to say as clearly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you pause as you possibly can,</v>

622
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:34.250
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you believe to be true </v>
<v Speaker 1>in every situation,</v>

623
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:40.310
<v Speaker 1>and then to see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different way of playing the same</v>

624
00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:41.144
<v Speaker 1>game now in the sermon on the Mount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Christ tells his followers just to </v>

625
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Orient themselves towards paradise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth fundamentally,</v>

626
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.293
<v Speaker 1>and then to concentrate on doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything they possibly can moment to </v>

627
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.700
<v Speaker 1>moment as carefully and correctly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

628
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:56.743
<v Speaker 1>and then to see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this ancient idea that set </v>

629
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:06.180
<v Speaker 1>that root of Western culture that being </v>
<v Speaker 1>is spoken into existence and that's the.</v>

630
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the speech of the logo.</v>

631
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.920
<v Speaker 1>And the idea there is also partly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that inherits inside people if they,</v>

632
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:19.580
<v Speaker 1>if they're willing to utilize it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they know how they can utilize it.</v>

633
00:34:19.581 --> 00:34:20.414
<v Speaker 1>And the way to utilize that is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>straighten out your speech and action </v>

634
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:29.230
<v Speaker 1>and to act as well as you can moment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment and to let go other than that and</v>

635
00:34:30.051 --> 00:34:32.030
<v Speaker 1>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

636
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.290
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's the movement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith that the existentialist Christians</v>

637
00:34:36.291 --> 00:34:38.660
<v Speaker 1>continually talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

638
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.363
<v Speaker 1>Because the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're aiming at something specific </v>

639
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:43.394
<v Speaker 1>that constitutes the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then basically what you've done is made </v>

640
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:48.230
<v Speaker 1>yourself a kind of idle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>

641
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:50.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is paradise and God,</v>

642
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.103
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is you don't know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not sufficiently </v>

643
00:34:53.481 --> 00:34:54.314
<v Speaker 1>informed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand the ultimate nature of the </v>

644
00:34:55.791 --> 00:34:58.820
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think you're sufficiently informed</v>

645
00:34:58.821 --> 00:35:01.550
<v Speaker 1>to figure out when you're not using your</v>
<v Speaker 1>language properly.</v>

646
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.893
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can notice is that if you're not using </v>

647
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:06.044
<v Speaker 1>it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you ashamed and weak and </v>

648
00:35:07.821 --> 00:35:10.190
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can feel that.</v>

649
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.750
<v Speaker 1>You can feel it fully embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what Kane does.</v>

650
00:35:14.751 --> 00:35:16.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's what God tells them to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

651
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.220
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing things right,</v>

652
00:35:19.221 --> 00:35:21.170
<v Speaker 1>you can stand up with your head held </v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

653
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.453
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't your downcast and angry and </v>

654
00:35:24.441 --> 00:35:27.950
<v Speaker 1>resentful and murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's the case.</v>

655
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.253
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe that it's a different </v>

656
00:35:33.621 --> 00:35:36.020
<v Speaker 1>way of being because it's not aimed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

657
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not aimed something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>predefined.</v>

658
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.983
<v Speaker 1>You have to under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to allow what constitutes the </v>

659
00:35:42.811 --> 00:35:43.644
<v Speaker 1>good and your understanding of the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>to continually be updated as you pursue </v>

660
00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:48.534
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think all you have to do to do </v>

661
00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:53.880
<v Speaker 1>that is to speak words well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Northrop Frye would say is that you have</v>

662
00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:57.540
<v Speaker 1>to speak words with power and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn to do that,</v>

663
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:02.900
<v Speaker 1>but you have to let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's the,</v>

664
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.610
<v Speaker 1>that's the cure for radiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

665
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.473
<v Speaker 1>because what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can lay out a belief system and try </v>

666
00:36:10.491 --> 00:36:11.450
<v Speaker 1>to impose it</v>

667
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 1>or you can play along and see if you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what's going on.</v>

668
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:16.734
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with someone that's what </v>

669
00:36:18.771 --> 00:36:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

670
00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:20.923
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

671
00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.270
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we can figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get along.</v>

672
00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is within the confines of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship.</v>

673
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:26.901
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

674
00:36:26.901 --> 00:36:30.320
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I want?</v>

675
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.023
<v Speaker 1>How is that going to fit together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we communicate honestly about </v>

676
00:36:34.881 --> 00:36:36.830
<v Speaker 1>exactly what that is and how we might </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>

677
00:36:36.831 --> 00:36:39.320
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a process of coe discovery.</v>

678
00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.423
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you know the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with and you're not going to find </v>

679
00:36:42.921 --> 00:36:43.754
<v Speaker 1>it unless you tell each other the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not going to be able to </v>

680
00:36:46.071 --> 00:36:46.904
<v Speaker 1>pursue it unless you act out the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you articulate and I don't think </v>

681
00:36:50.121 --> 00:36:50.954
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be able to articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth properly unless what you want </v>

682
00:36:53.301 --> 00:36:57.540
<v Speaker 1>is the good and that's a very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to figure out.</v>

683
00:36:57.541 --> 00:36:58.374
<v Speaker 1>But I think one of the things we do know</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the 20th century that the </v>

684
00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:01.893
<v Speaker 1>continual attempt to make the world as </v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocious a place as possible seems to </v>

685
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:07.230
<v Speaker 1>be searching in the wrong direction.</v>

686
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:09.291
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

687
00:37:09.291 --> 00:37:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I've tried this sort of thing for a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time because I think that</v>

688
00:37:13.281 --> 00:37:14.114
<v Speaker 1>what I try to do or why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I try to do is to say what I </v>

689
00:37:16.341 --> 00:37:17.174
<v Speaker 1>believe to be the case in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that I'm in and to see what </v>

690
00:37:21.231 --> 00:37:24.830
<v Speaker 1>happens and my experience has been that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really works.</v>

691
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.173
<v Speaker 1>I get really works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can learn to get along with the </v>

692
00:37:27.951 --> 00:37:31.580
<v Speaker 1>people in your family and help them </v>
<v Speaker 1>straighten out and you can start to have</v>

693
00:37:31.581 --> 00:37:35.900
<v Speaker 1>a relatively beneficial effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes that are outside of your,</v>

694
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what's right in front of you and </v>

695
00:37:38.301 --> 00:37:39.134
<v Speaker 1>within your grasp so you can practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to set things </v>

696
00:37:42.381 --> 00:37:46.160
<v Speaker 1>straight and I have no idea what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate limits of that might be.</v>

697
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.863
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly makes your life and </v>

698
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:54.530
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously interesting and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in itself is one of the things that</v>

699
00:37:54.531 --> 00:37:56.150
<v Speaker 1>takes away the sting of mortality.</v>

700
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Because if what you're doing is so damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

701
00:37:58.671 --> 00:38:02.390
<v Speaker 1>you can hardly stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you have to pay a price as</v>

702
00:38:02.391 --> 00:38:04.940
<v Speaker 1>you move along starts to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable,</v>

703
00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll pay a price if it's worth</v>

704
00:38:07.311 --> 00:38:08.071
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's neat.</v>

705
00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:10.850
<v Speaker 1>You said if you have a why you can bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyhow,</v>

706
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:13.640
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's some truth in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

707
00:38:13.641 --> 00:38:14.301
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

708
00:38:14.301 --> 00:38:15.134
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a good that sufficiently good to </v>

709
00:38:17.931 --> 00:38:18.764
<v Speaker 1>justify voluntarily participating in </v>
<v Speaker 1>being that's bent on your misery and </v>

710
00:38:23.241 --> 00:38:26.960
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental question of life.</v>

711
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say you need a pretty elevated </v>

712
00:38:28.941 --> 00:38:29.774
<v Speaker 1>vision in order to counteract that and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's what a vision of paradise </v>

713
00:38:32.991 --> 00:38:36.910
<v Speaker 1>is and I think that paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that people have to build,</v>

714
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.853
<v Speaker 1>I think if we built it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would justify everything that </v>

715
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 1>happened on the way to building it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least that might be the case.</v>

716
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can do it locally first.</v>

717
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.260
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't see it.</v>

718
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:52.103
<v Speaker 1>I've watched people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched how people have lived live </v>

719
00:38:53.781 --> 00:38:57.960
<v Speaker 1>now for decades and I have two clients </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my practice right now who've,</v>

720
00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:00.650
<v Speaker 1>who one of them was pretty damn straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with,</v>

721
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.980
<v Speaker 1>but he's set up his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his business.</v>

722
00:39:03.981 --> 00:39:04.814
<v Speaker 1>It happens to be a firm and he's tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make absolutely straight decisions </v>

723
00:39:08.841 --> 00:39:11.570
<v Speaker 1>that were really informed and proper the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire way along.</v>

724
00:39:11.571 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And the bloody thing is running like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

725
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:16.840
<v Speaker 1>it's running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's celebrated.</v>

726
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.450
<v Speaker 1>It's extremely effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not wasteful.</v>

727
00:39:20.451 --> 00:39:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who was inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization is developing properly,</v>

728
00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:27.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no ones getting screwed over,</v>

729
00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:28.163
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an honest and straightforward </v>

730
00:39:29.661 --> 00:39:32.000
<v Speaker 1>enterprise and everybody seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefiting from it.</v>

731
00:39:32.001 --> 00:39:36.290
<v Speaker 1>And I have another client who was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn confused and arrogant and resentful</v>

732
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.393
<v Speaker 1>when he first started changing his life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he put together a relatively small </v>

733
00:39:42.321 --> 00:39:45.050
<v Speaker 1>business and I would say it's a low </v>
<v Speaker 1>status business,</v>

734
00:39:45.051 --> 00:39:48.050
<v Speaker 1>but he's done it as honestly as he </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly could.</v>

735
00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:51.440
<v Speaker 1>And he tried to keep himself on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and narrow.</v>

736
00:39:51.441 --> 00:39:52.274
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing it and he's trying to give </v>

737
00:39:52.971 --> 00:39:56.900
<v Speaker 1>his customers outstanding service and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be clear and straight with them at every</v>

738
00:39:56.901 --> 00:39:57.734
<v Speaker 1>single choice moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's lifted his cynicism and it's </v>

739
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:04.910
<v Speaker 1>made his business very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very productive and positive.</v>

740
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:09.200
<v Speaker 1>And so I can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

741
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.153
<v Speaker 1>there has to be some antidote to </v>
<v Speaker 1>theology because it's corrosive and </v>

742
00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.650
<v Speaker 1>destructive and I can't see that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

743
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.233
<v Speaker 1>any and that you can attain at any means</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can implement that's more </v>

744
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:24.043
<v Speaker 1>meaningful and rich and deep than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do think it's sufficient to stop </v>

745
00:40:28.071 --> 00:40:28.904
<v Speaker 1>you from being corrupted and genocidal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good thing because you can </v>

746
00:40:32.301 --> 00:40:33.134
<v Speaker 1>get corrupted and genocidal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's enough of us who were </v>

747
00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.313
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and genocidal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things are going to get very bad </v>

748
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 1>instead of very good</v>

749
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:44.583
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

750
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.860
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you can think about that.</v>

751
00:40:49.861 --> 00:40:53.640
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's an easy thing to to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start to try.</v>

752
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.073
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you have to do is decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want things to be better or </v>

753
00:40:57.241 --> 00:41:00.210
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a simple question because</v>

754
00:41:00.211 --> 00:41:04.050
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a lot of you that's bitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and resentful and vengeful and angry for</v>

755
00:41:04.051 --> 00:41:06.570
<v Speaker 1>all of your inadequacies in the way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's treated you.</v>

756
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.680
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing is pay attention to</v>

757
00:41:10.681 --> 00:41:14.640
<v Speaker 1>what you say and see if you believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't quit saying it,</v>

758
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:16.913
<v Speaker 1>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can tell if what you say makes </v>

759
00:41:18.931 --> 00:41:20.580
<v Speaker 1>you stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it makes you weak,</v>

760
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.020
<v Speaker 1>oh you have to do is feel it and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop saying things that make you weak,</v>

761
00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:26.850
<v Speaker 1>but it'll change you completely.</v>

762
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:28.803
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

763
00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:30.243
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that you won't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>associate with people who only allow to </v>

764
00:41:33.171 --> 00:41:35.150
<v Speaker 1>say things that make you weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

765
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:36.523
<v Speaker 1>because lots of people would be upset if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say things that make you strong </v>

766
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:39.404
<v Speaker 1>around them because they don't want you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to flourish and grow partly because it </v>

767
00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:44.390
<v Speaker 1>sheds a bad light on them.</v>

768
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:49.643
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is more of elaborated in the last </v>

769
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.593
<v Speaker 1>quarter of the book or there boats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll get a chance to read that </v>

770
00:41:56.251 --> 00:41:58.470
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I'll see you guys when you,</v>

771
00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.800
<v Speaker 1>when you have the final,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the meantime.</v>

772
00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Well think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

773
00:42:03.931 --> 00:42:04.764
<v Speaker 1>I think we have more opportunity now at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this point in history to make things </v>

774
00:42:08.011 --> 00:42:08.844
<v Speaker 1>good than we could have possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined 50 years ago and it's </v>

775
00:42:11.131 --> 00:42:12.210
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

776
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.223
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things that are falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart and people get cynical about that </v>

777
00:42:16.081 --> 00:42:16.914
<v Speaker 1>and that's the wrong attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have no idea how much </v>

778
00:42:19.351 --> 00:42:21.900
<v Speaker 1>power you might have at your disposal if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you used it properly.</v>

779
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think we could set things right if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we decided that it was worth doing.</v>

780
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:27.893
<v Speaker 1>And so it certainly seems to me to beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative because in the 20th </v>

781
00:42:31.141 --> 00:42:35.880
<v Speaker 1>century we bloody well learned what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative was and it is as horrible as</v>

782
00:42:35.881 --> 00:42:36.714
<v Speaker 1>anything you could possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to me that it's very much </v>

783
00:42:39.331 --> 00:42:42.210
<v Speaker 1>worth a while avoiding that even if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't make things perfect.</v>

784
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:43.703
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

785
00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.573
<v Speaker 2>see you all.</v>
