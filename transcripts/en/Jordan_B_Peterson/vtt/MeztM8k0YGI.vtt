1
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Well I won't back down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can stand at the gates of hell.</v>

2
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Good Morning Boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls and interested others.</v>

3
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 2>So the calls for my discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 2>silencing have begun in earnest.</v>

4
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.533
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to read you two letters </v>

5
00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 2>that have been produced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 2>publicly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and within the uh,</v>

7
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.480
<v Speaker 2>within the university community itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

8
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.350
<v Speaker 2>the first one has received some press </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

9
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe the second one has yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

10
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>October six,</v>

11
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:48.124
<v Speaker 2>2016 so this was produced by a variety </v>
<v Speaker 2>of student organizations and I'll </v>

12
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:52.354
<v Speaker 2>discuss who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the letter to the </v>

13
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 2>attention of the University of Toronto </v>
<v Speaker 2>Administration and the U of t community.</v>

14
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.443
<v Speaker 2>We the undersigned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Community members at the University of </v>

15
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.743
<v Speaker 2>Toronto are appalled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned and saddened by recent </v>

16
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:05.494
<v Speaker 2>transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist and anti black comments made by </v>

17
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:08.494
<v Speaker 2>professor Jordan Peterson and an online </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture series that he published on </v>

18
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:16.531
<v Speaker 2>Youtube on September 27th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2016 in October 3rd,</v>

19
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.523
<v Speaker 2>2016 Peterson has abused his position of</v>
<v Speaker 2>power as a tenured professor and has </v>

20
00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:21.904
<v Speaker 2>tried to use my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his academic freedom to disguise his </v>

21
00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 2>bigotry and prejudice as an intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreement.</v>

22
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to suggest that these comments add value</v>

23
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 2>to classroom discussion is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

24
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:34.504
<v Speaker 2>that's not a suggestion that I've made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would like to bring attention to the </v>

25
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.390
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto statement of </v>
<v Speaker 2>equity,</v>

26
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.253
<v Speaker 2>diversity and excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt they would like to bring </v>

27
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:45.244
<v Speaker 2>attention to that which states that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto will proactively </v>

28
00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:49.414
<v Speaker 2>seek to increase diversity among our </v>
<v Speaker 2>community members and it is our aim to </v>

29
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:53.554
<v Speaker 2>have a student body teaching and </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrative staff that mirror the </v>

30
00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:57.154
<v Speaker 2>diversity of the pool of potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualified applicants for those </v>

31
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:02.470
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

32
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:07.471
<v Speaker 2>and it is our responsibility to help in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the creation of an equitable community.</v>

33
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.573
<v Speaker 2>One that is diverse as well as inclusive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is respectful and protects the </v>

34
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.114
<v Speaker 2>human rights of its measure members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that requires the work of </v>

35
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 2>every member of the community across all</v>
<v Speaker 2>our sites and capitalists,</v>

36
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.290
<v Speaker 2>including students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching staff,</v>

37
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 2>administrative staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>visitors,</v>

38
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:22.720
<v Speaker 2>alumni and guests.</v>

39
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.880
<v Speaker 2>The university is committed to internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies on issues related to equity and</v>

40
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:28.714
<v Speaker 2>also operates in compliance with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation that bears on equity and </v>

41
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:32.014
<v Speaker 2>human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a recent two part lecture given by </v>

42
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was published on Youtube,</v>

43
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.973
<v Speaker 2>see the relevant urls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson goes on a 57 minute rant </v>

44
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.353
<v Speaker 2>regarding his disapproval of bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See 16 which proposes to include gender </v>

45
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:47.464
<v Speaker 2>identity and gender expression has </v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibited grounds for harassment and </v>

46
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:52.720
<v Speaker 2>discrimination under the Canadian Human </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rights Act and the criminal code.</v>

47
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.213
<v Speaker 2>This same bill is considered by many </v>
<v Speaker 2>political scholars and members of trans </v>

48
00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 2>communities as an advancement of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

49
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.913
<v Speaker 2>equal protection under the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson is also a man who has </v>

50
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.274
<v Speaker 2>complained that the Ontario human rights</v>
<v Speaker 2>commission's terms and definitions are </v>

51
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:06.754
<v Speaker 2>over inclusive and all encompassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surely inclusivity is an important </v>

52
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 2>factor when discussing human rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>protections.</v>

53
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.133
<v Speaker 2>In one of his lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson includes various disparaging </v>

54
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 2>comments about members of the Trans </v>
<v Speaker 2>Community.</v>

55
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.263
<v Speaker 2>He argues that there is no evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 2>support the existence of non binary </v>

56
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:22.684
<v Speaker 2>identities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not something I argued by the </v>

57
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a statement that is inaccurate.</v>

58
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.353
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when discussing the use of his students </v>

59
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 2>preferred pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson stated,</v>

60
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.823
<v Speaker 2>I won't recognize another person's right</v>
<v Speaker 2>to determine what pronouns I use to </v>

61
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 2>address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't do it.</v>

62
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is true.</v>

63
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Purposefully mis-gendering a trans </v>
<v Speaker 2>person is an act of violence.</v>

64
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.123
<v Speaker 2>While you better pay attention to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what that essentially means is </v>

65
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 2>that speech is now an act of violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that more importantly,</v>

66
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.943
<v Speaker 2>refusal to use the words that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else demands that you use is an act of </v>

67
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm being accused of.</v>

68
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.063
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my second 57 minute rant titled Part </v>

69
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Two Compulsory Education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political education,</v>

70
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 2>a real world case study at the U of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto.</v>

71
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.133
<v Speaker 2>Peterson states his disapproval of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandatory antidiscrimination and anti </v>

72
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:11.644
<v Speaker 2>bias training that the u of t has </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandated for its HR professionals and </v>

73
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 2>opinion that he was not asked for by </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

74
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 2>The black liberation collective was </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful in advocating for this equity</v>

75
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:23.404
<v Speaker 2>training to be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not for the comfort of those who have </v>

76
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 2>always been accommodated in welcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the institution,</v>

77
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.473
<v Speaker 2>but for those who are made voiceless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was crafted from a place of wanting </v>

78
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.364
<v Speaker 2>better in the environments that we as </v>
<v Speaker 2>students daily partake in keeping in </v>

79
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:36.964
<v Speaker 2>mind the ways in which people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful positions of this university </v>

80
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>are allowed to dehumanize students </v>
<v Speaker 2>through microaggressions,</v>

81
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.773
<v Speaker 2>gaslighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and blatant disrespect without any </v>

82
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:46.864
<v Speaker 2>accountability or repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to the U of t statements of </v>

83
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 2>institutional purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the University of firms,</v>

84
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.124
<v Speaker 2>it's dedication to fostering an academic</v>
<v Speaker 2>community in which the learning and </v>

85
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:57.784
<v Speaker 2>scholarship of every member may flourish</v>
<v Speaker 2>with vigilant protection for individual </v>

86
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 2>human rights and a resolute commitment </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the principle of equal opportunity,</v>

87
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:05.644
<v Speaker 2>equity and justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that a tenured professor </v>

88
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:11.680
<v Speaker 2>employed with uft refuses to acknowledge</v>
<v Speaker 2>the use of personal pronouns.</v>

89
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 2>They mean preferred pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

90
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.973
<v Speaker 2>I do actually use personal pronouns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>has the audacity to try and rationalize </v>

91
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:21.150
<v Speaker 2>and quantify racism is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjective I have.</v>

92
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:21.984
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea where that comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only discredits the lived </v>

93
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 2>experiences of students who have dealt </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this reality,</v>

94
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:31.210
<v Speaker 2>but also silences them more violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurs as someone in a position of power</v>

95
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 2>who not only has the nerve to say such </v>
<v Speaker 2>statements publicly,</v>

96
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.003
<v Speaker 2>can still be a respected member of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university community and not face any </v>

97
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 2>formal university backlash and continue </v>
<v Speaker 2>to enjoy tenure.</v>

98
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.683
<v Speaker 2>We are sick of discriminatory faculty </v>
<v Speaker 2>members denying our expertise in our </v>

99
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 2>experiences are not respecting who we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

100
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.803
<v Speaker 2>especially when we merely ask for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived realities to be respected and not </v>

101
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:54.184
<v Speaker 2>disregarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you'll see how much asking is </v>

102
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:56.734
<v Speaker 2>being done later in this letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are deeply concerned about the </v>

103
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 2>university's lack of action on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

104
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:01.544
<v Speaker 2>especially as Peterson continues to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spread is transphobic and racist </v>

105
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 2>ideologies through various media </v>
<v Speaker 2>outlets.</v>

106
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I really have no idea where the racism </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is going and I'm not transphobic,</v>

107
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 2>so Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

108
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.623
<v Speaker 2>The university has failed to act on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and this ultimately showcases </v>

109
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 2>that quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity,</v>

110
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:19.574
<v Speaker 2>inclusion and equal respect are simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>legalities and are not principles that </v>

111
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:23.534
<v Speaker 2>the u of t tends on upholding the UFT </v>
<v Speaker 2>has failed at maintaining a positive </v>

112
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 2>space and campuses free of hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a result,</v>

113
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:30.584
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the undersigned are demanding </v>

114
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.623
<v Speaker 2>accountability from the university </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration and governing console </v>

115
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.833
<v Speaker 2>with the following five demands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now one thing you'll note about the </v>

116

<v Speaker 2>environmental,</v>

149
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:17.324
<v Speaker 2>considered to be an educator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No student should have to endure a two </v>

<v Speaker 2>hour lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether gender identity,</v>

152
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Speaker 2>refused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately Peterson's comments erode the</v>

153
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:28.634
<v Speaker 2>safe campus learning environment to </v>
<v Speaker 2>which the university states a </v>

154
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 2>commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hope that the university will respond</v>

155
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:33.734
<v Speaker 2>to this situation within a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeframe and in accordance with the </v>

<v Speaker 2>Council.</v>

157
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.923
