1
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Well after all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to psychology to 30</v>

2
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>nice to see you all here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm gonna do today,</v>

3
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.093
<v Speaker 1>oh I'm going to start is I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you an overview of the content of </v>

4
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.144
<v Speaker 1>the course and then I'll give you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overview of the plas requirements rate </v>

5
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:28.150
<v Speaker 1>at the end of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we might as well jump right into</v>

6
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>the content to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

7
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>there's a website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like blackboard,</v>

8
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>so I have my own website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to Jordan Peterson,</v>

9
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Jordan B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>

10
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>dark palm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and underneath there there's a menu that</v>

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>lists all the courses and the full </v>
<v Speaker 1>syllabus is listed there.</v>

12
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.763
<v Speaker 1>So all the information that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to need about the course can be found </v>

13
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including most of the readings,</v>

14
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.573
<v Speaker 1>although there was also a textbook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I presume a majority of you who </v>

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.323
<v Speaker 1>have already purchased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it also lists the other things that </v>

16
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>you need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what days the tests are going to be</v>

17
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>and what the assignments are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll go over that anyways at the end</v>

18
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>of the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

19
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>but to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you what the course is</v>

20
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>about so you can decide whether you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the right class or not.</v>

21
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.813
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

22
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.313
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

23
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Personality is a somewhat peculiar field</v>
<v Speaker 1>of study in psychology because</v>

24
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.563
<v Speaker 1>it spans a number of sub disciplines </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't particularly well suited to </v>

25
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

26
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:46.874
<v Speaker 1>it spans</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychology and experimental </v>

27
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 1>psychology</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also spans</v>

28
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.833
<v Speaker 1>and approach that is associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally with single individuals </v>

29
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.493
<v Speaker 1>with an approach that analyzes </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual characteristics in large </v>

30
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.313
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is generally what you have to do </v>

31
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:11.714
<v Speaker 1>in experimental psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a relatively strange ad </v>

32
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:18.014
<v Speaker 1>mixture of philosophy and I would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering and medicine as well as </v>

33
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:27.194
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think of medicine as a </v>

34
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

35
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.683
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that it's not as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's concerned with the </v>

36
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>promotion of health and health is not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific category.</v>

37
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.583
<v Speaker 1>It's a category that can't help but be </v>
<v Speaker 1>value laden because you have to decide </v>

38
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.143
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes health health and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes illness or what constitutes </v>

39
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 1>wellness and what constitutes pathology.</v>

40
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.863
<v Speaker 1>And there's no way you can do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>without bringing value judgments into </v>

41
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:53.894
<v Speaker 1>the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly true in psychology </v>

42
00:02:55.761 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>because when you're thinking about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>a healthy might be,</v>

43
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>you generally don't merely think in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the absence of pathology.</v>

44
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>You think in terms of the presence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive traits,</v>

45
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And someone who's fully healthy mentally</v>

46
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>and physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the psychologists,</v>

47
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:12.844
<v Speaker 1>especially the humanistic psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the 60s might consider someone </v>

48
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>who's truly psychologically healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self actualized,</v>

49
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.014
<v Speaker 1>which would mean in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been able to develop the </v>

50
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>entirety of their positive potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>

51
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So because of these peculiarities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality psychology,</v>

52
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:33.364
<v Speaker 1>the course of course in personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology has to be pretty wide </v>

53
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:36.964
<v Speaker 1>ranging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this course is in fact wide </v>

54
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>ranging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

55
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.320
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it uh,</v>

56
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>brings in elements of cultural history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.493
<v Speaker 1>elements of moral philosophy and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements that I would consider almost </v>

58
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>completely biological.</v>

59
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.653
<v Speaker 1>And it does that in order to provide you</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a multidimensional view of what it </v>

60
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:01.354
<v Speaker 1>means to be a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some other principles that I </v>

61
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>abide by while I'm teaching this course </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

62
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.624
<v Speaker 1>And one of those is that I don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to tell you about anything that I </v>

63
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>don't think you will find useful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

64
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a difference between a fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a useful fact,</v>

65
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of facts.</v>

66
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:21.920
<v Speaker 1>You can go on Google and you can drown </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in facts.</v>

67
00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:22.754
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you do that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a useful fact to me is one that </v>

68
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.663
<v Speaker 1>transforms the way that you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world or the way that you act in the </v>

69
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>world in some manner that you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>

70
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.633
<v Speaker 1>And so another way of of describing </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful from that perspective is </v>

71
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:41.194
<v Speaker 1>relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the principles I abide by </v>

72
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>is that I don't really want to teach you</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that isn't relevant.</v>

73
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.913
<v Speaker 1>And my criteria for relevant is first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it going to make a difference to you </v>

74
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:53.014
<v Speaker 1>personally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are the things that you learn </v>

75
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>immediately meaningful to how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with the world?</v>

76
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.833
<v Speaker 1>And then the second is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there some evidence that the facts </v>

77
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:02.464
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be presented with </v>

78
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:05.254
<v Speaker 1>actually have some social utility or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some political utility or it's an </v>

79
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:08.554
<v Speaker 1>economic utility so that the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know them makes a difference to the </v>

80
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>way that you act in a way that also </v>
<v Speaker 1>affects the people around you.</v>

81
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.523
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for those multiple reasons that I </v>

82
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 1>brought together the material that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have brought together.</v>

83
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:31.701
<v Speaker 1>Now that means that there's some factors</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to take into account</v>

84
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.243
<v Speaker 1>before you take this course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's another personality course </v>

85
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:41.430
<v Speaker 1>being given at exactly the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

86
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:42.264
<v Speaker 1>I don't this semester anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it may be that that one's more </v>

87
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:46.860
<v Speaker 1>suitable for you than this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

88
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.110
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you what this one's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like.</v>

89
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.560
<v Speaker 1>And so if that isn't what you want or if</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what you're interested in,</v>

90
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.510
<v Speaker 1>then you probably shouldn't take this </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

91
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>So the first issue is that there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reading.</v>

92
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>There isn't as much reading as there </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be in this course.</v>

93
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

94
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>but there's still a lot of reading and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of that</v>

95
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.363
<v Speaker 1>original source material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both from the personality theorists </v>

96
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 1>themselves and then also original source</v>
<v Speaker 1>material from empirical papers.</v>

97
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that not only is there a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of reading,</v>

98
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>but the readings actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

99
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:21.483
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's useful given the way I </v>

100
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:24.674
<v Speaker 1>already defined utility to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I believe that reading what I </v>

101
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>present to you is going to be good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

102
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:33.860
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't have time to do a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reading,</v>

103
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to find this course </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrating.</v>

104
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.370
<v Speaker 1>So there's also because of the emphasis </v>
<v Speaker 1>on clinical theoreticians,</v>

105
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>which is a major part of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality theory,</v>

106
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>especially the more classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality theory,</v>

107
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is generally the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of personality theory that most</v>

108
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>students are most interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

109
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of what I would consider a</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical material.</v>

110
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's philosophical is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's concerned with how a person</v>

111
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:05.234
<v Speaker 1>should live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a much different question </v>

112
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:08.714
<v Speaker 1>than what a person is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's how a person should live or </v>

113
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:11.834
<v Speaker 1>perhaps how a person might transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves or act in order to transform </v>

114
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>themselves so that their personality is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

115
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:18.824
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better now you can substitute healthier </v>

116
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:23.474
<v Speaker 1>for better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a context like the one we're </v>

117
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 1>discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference is trivial really.</v>

118
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.013
<v Speaker 1>So then the last thing that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>caution you against is that I don't </v>

119
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:39.371
<v Speaker 1>lecture from the reading material so </v>
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>

120
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure even what I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell you when I come to class,</v>

121
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.923
<v Speaker 1>I know the material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to stick to a </v>

122
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.023
<v Speaker 1>prescribed outline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you about the things </v>

123
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:55.580
<v Speaker 1>that I think are important and so with </v>
<v Speaker 1>luck,</v>

124
00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>that'll make the lectures worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>attending and worth listening to.</v>

125
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.330
<v Speaker 1>But if you were more inclined from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamental perspective,</v>

126
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 1>do you want it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

127
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:07.274
<v Speaker 1>where things are laid out in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly fashion and they progress in a </v>

128
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:10.724
<v Speaker 1>linear fashion and it's predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the lectures reflect the reading </v>

129
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this is not a good course for you.</v>

130
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.370
<v Speaker 1>And so I would presume that would be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

131
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:21.830
<v Speaker 1>If you're orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

132
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the subdivisions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>big five personality trait model.</v>

133
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And orderly people tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>

134
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>but they like things cut and dried and </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out in a linear fashion.</v>

135
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that orderly.</v>

136
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm higher in openness and openness is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>

137
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dementia.</v>

138
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and open people tend to use relatively </v>

139
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:43.514
<v Speaker 1>loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loose associations when they speak and </v>

140
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:49.991
<v Speaker 1>to cover a wide amount of territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so some people will like that.</v>

141
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.533
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like reading literature for </v>

142
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:55.310
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably liked this course.</v>

143
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you probably won't.</v>

144
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.063
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

145
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.553
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much enough for the </v>

146
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 1>warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

147
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:05.154
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I will tell you what we're going to </v>

148
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:07.044
<v Speaker 1>talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that makes human </v>

149
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 1>beings unique</v>

150
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.080
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that were self conscious.</v>

151
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.143
<v Speaker 1>Now you'll see ethologists are people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who study animal behavior do relatively </v>

152
00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:29.950
<v Speaker 1>elementary tests of self consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>on animals.</v>

153
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.590
<v Speaker 1>So one of the most famous demonstrations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of such self consciousness is the mirror</v>

154
00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:37.870
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in the mirror test,</v>

155
00:09:37.871 --> 00:09:39.850
<v Speaker 1>what you essentially do is you take an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>

156
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe a chimp or maybe a three year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

157
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.633
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you put a lipstick mark on their </v>

158
00:09:46.241 --> 00:09:47.074
<v Speaker 1>forehead or on their nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you show them a reflection of </v>

159
00:09:49.511 --> 00:09:52.720
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they wipe off,</v>

160
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.700
<v Speaker 1>or Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're towards the lipstick mark,</v>

161
00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:55.534
<v Speaker 1>then you can make the presumption that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they understand that it's them that's </v>

162
00:09:58.841 --> 00:09:59.674
<v Speaker 1>being reflected in the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least they understand that well </v>

163
00:10:02.771 --> 00:10:07.771
<v Speaker 1>enough so that they can use the mirror </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a guide to action with their,</v>

164
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.510
<v Speaker 1>with their hand or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is that they happen to be</v>

165
00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:12.580
<v Speaker 1>pointing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reflection.</v>

166
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.593
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins seemed to be able to manage </v>

167
00:10:14.921 --> 00:10:18.280
<v Speaker 1>that there some members of the core of </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

168
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.323
<v Speaker 1>So those are basically crows and ravens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are really smart and they </v>

169
00:10:22.541 --> 00:10:25.390
<v Speaker 1>seem to possess rudimentary self </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

170
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I said dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cetaceans and general.</v>

171
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.043
<v Speaker 1>So whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I don't know if all whales are </v>

172
00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:33.010
<v Speaker 1>self conscious because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

173
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.650
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get a mirror and big enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show a blue whale,</v>

174
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.053
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

175
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.190
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about it.</v>

176
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.923
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a very good </v>

177
00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:47.034
<v Speaker 1>definition of self consciousness really </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the mere fact that you can </v>

178
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:52.770
<v Speaker 1>recognize yourself and it's also not </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair to some animals like dogs,</v>

179
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:53.604
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because dog would need a smell and </v>

180
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 1>mirror really because and most animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very,</v>

181
00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:00.320
<v Speaker 1>very smell predicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the brain is,</v>

182
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.773
<v Speaker 1>is structured with the olfactory system </v>
<v Speaker 1>has its core and like us really because </v>

183
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 1>our brains are structured with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual system at the core and that makes</v>

184
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:13.710
<v Speaker 1>us rather peculiar but so it's a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfair to animals like dogs are ready to</v>

185
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:17.310
<v Speaker 1>rats that relied primarily on olfaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>to orient themselves and world.</v>

186
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:18.144
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is I don't think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really a very good definition of self </v>

187
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rudimentary.</v>

188
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:23.604
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the first sort of step to </v>

189
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>being self conscious because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully self conscious,</v>

190
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I think you need two more things.</v>

191
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.093
<v Speaker 1>You need the capacity to imitate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a much more important capacity </v>

192
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>than people generally realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

193
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's a equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance.</v>

194
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>It's of equivalent importance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

195
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.953
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure that you could use </v>

196
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:49.380
<v Speaker 1>language if you can't imitate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

197
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.260
<v Speaker 1>obviously all the words you used are </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the words that other people use.</v>

198
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're not going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible.</v>

199
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:57.094
<v Speaker 1>So even the mere fact that you do speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you're relying on invitation </v>

200
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.520
<v Speaker 1>to get your point across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need imitation.</v>

201
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you need the invitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because once you can imitate,</v>

202
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.183
<v Speaker 1>you can use your body as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representational structure to represent </v>

203
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:12.874
<v Speaker 1>the world and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can even use your body as a </v>

204
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:17.770
<v Speaker 1>representational structure to represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

205
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 1>which you might do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

206
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:22.000
<v Speaker 1>if you're telling a joke at a dinner </v>
<v Speaker 1>party and then you,</v>

207
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act out of self parody and everyone </v>

208
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 1>laughs.</v>

209
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then with regards to language,</v>

210
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:29.614
<v Speaker 1>while language obviously enables you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build sophisticated models of the world </v>

211
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:33.604
<v Speaker 1>that are well articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to exchange those with other people and </v>

212
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

213
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:38.164
<v Speaker 1>so in order to be self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to recognize that </v>

214
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 1>you exist in this physical envelope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least here and now.</v>

215
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>You need to be able to imitate because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly how you come to understand</v>

216
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.033
<v Speaker 1>yourself and other creatures like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very important part of being </v>

217
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Speaker 1>self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

218
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:56.224
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything I learned about any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you is also going to help me understand </v>

219
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 1>the sort of creature that I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's for good or for evil.</v>

220
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.863
<v Speaker 1>And then with language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not only can we articulate our </v>

221
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:10.300
<v Speaker 1>representations about each other in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

222
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>but we can also store those articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations over very,</v>

223
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:15.161
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

224
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:16.630
<v Speaker 1>very long spans of time.</v>

225
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.423
<v Speaker 1>And we do that partly in ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the acting out of a </v>

226
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:21.874
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we do that partly with regards to </v>

227
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:25.054
<v Speaker 1>stories which are in some sense an </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated representation of an acting </v>

228
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:30.640
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

229
00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Because you can think of a story as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>

230
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.970
<v Speaker 1>So drama is behavior representing </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

231
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.660
<v Speaker 1>And then a story is an articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of a drama.</v>

232
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Now we have very old rituals and we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

233
00:13:45.431 --> 00:13:50.431
<v Speaker 1>very old stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of what we do in this course</v>

234
00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:51.524
<v Speaker 1>is we go back to as close to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning as we can possibly manage to </v>

235
00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:55.024
<v Speaker 1>start to understand how people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood themselves and represented </v>

236
00:13:58.721 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 1>themselves across the span of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

237
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.423
<v Speaker 1>And we're doing that because we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to put our current knowledge in </v>

238
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:10.330
<v Speaker 1>some kind of historical context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is,</v>

239
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that characterizes the</v>

240
00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>human personality is that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical phenomenon.</v>

241
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.023
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've heard in many classes </v>

242
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:24.820
<v Speaker 1>that much of what makes up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality is a cultural construct.</v>

243
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not much of it is or not </v>

244
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 1>isn't really the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly some of it is.</v>

245
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 1>And an important part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a cultural creature.</v>

246
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:32.883
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you have emerged </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a tradition that's been shaped </v>

247
00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:36.454
<v Speaker 1>and in any number of ways by an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily lengthy historical past </v>

248
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.143
<v Speaker 1>or historical and biological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means in part is that </v>

249
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.143
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>your history and that's your history as </v>

250
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 1>it matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily some collection of fats,</v>

251
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 1>then you don't understand yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

252
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:02.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings in their self conscious for</v>

253
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.200
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know how old we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

254
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.373
<v Speaker 1>more or less biologically or genetically</v>
<v Speaker 1>identical creatures to us existed at </v>

255
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:11.084
<v Speaker 1>least 150,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we seem to have discovered fire and </v>

256
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:19.100
<v Speaker 1>were able to master it maybe 2 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

257
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that required a fair bit of </v>

258
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:21.530
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

259
00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are,</v>

260
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 1>there are artifacts that indicate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly high level of,</v>

261
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.340
<v Speaker 1>of cultural capacity that are at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>50,000 years old.</v>

262
00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:34.334
<v Speaker 1>So we can't really say when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we got fully self conscious and </v>

263
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.873
<v Speaker 1>perhaps we might also say that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even fully self conscious yet because </v>

264
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:41.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really what the hell do you know about </v>

265
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:43.370
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

266
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.420
<v Speaker 1>you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

267
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:45.830
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really complicated.</v>

268
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.390
<v Speaker 1>And at best you have a partial model of </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are and that thing fails all the</v>

269
00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which as you can tell,</v>

270
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:52.664
<v Speaker 1>because you're always doing things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise you and often not in a </v>

271
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:58.490
<v Speaker 1>particularly positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no end of mystery.</v>

272
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:00.763
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the upshot of all of this is that we're </v>

273
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:04.964
<v Speaker 1>going to establish the context first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a historical context and I want </v>

274
00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:11.144
<v Speaker 1>to do that two ways that the first thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do is to talk to you about </v>

275
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 1>mythological representations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

276
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's more important than you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

277
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.940
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably more important than you do</v>

278
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.350
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

279
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.633
<v Speaker 1>by myth what I mean is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of human beings in </v>

280
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>extremely long lasting and persistent </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

281
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:37.723
<v Speaker 1>And so some of those are the stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are found in various religious </v>

282
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:41.144
<v Speaker 1>traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's oral traditions that </v>

283
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 1>surround those religious traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

284
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:45.734
<v Speaker 1>it's assuming that their religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions are written down and there's </v>

285
00:16:48.411 --> 00:16:51.410
<v Speaker 1>fairy tales and that sort of thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard narratives that,</v>

286
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 1>that people use to guide themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they move through the world.</v>

287
00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 1>And most of the clinical theories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss,</v>

288
00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:01.664
<v Speaker 1>so Freud's theory and young's theory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theory of the existentialists and </v>

289
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:05.744
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists in the humanists </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth are variants of those </v>

290
00:17:09.351 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>mythological stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

291
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>neat.</v>

292
00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:15.104
<v Speaker 1>You said once that a philosopher was </v>
<v Speaker 1>seldom anything other than the </v>

293
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:23.120
<v Speaker 1>unconscious advocate of their cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>

294
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.043
<v Speaker 1>So what he meant by that was you already</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to the scene with a set of </v>

295
00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

296
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:32.210
<v Speaker 1>some of those are embedded in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

297
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:33.620
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you walk,</v>

298
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.020
<v Speaker 1>when you attend a funeral and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to behave,</v>

299
00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:37.640
<v Speaker 1>he generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're quiet and solemn.</v>

300
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.013
<v Speaker 1>You might not be able to explicate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules that a person should follow at a </v>

301
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:43.730
<v Speaker 1>funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do it.</v>

302
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:44.803
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could perhaps articulate them if </v>

303
00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:48.770
<v Speaker 1>pressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like you're following those</v>

304
00:17:48.771 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go to a funeral,</v>

305
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 1>you just know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone pressed you,</v>

306
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:53.784
<v Speaker 1>you could turn it into a list of rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really more encoded in your </v>

307
00:17:57.151 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 1>actual behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just automatically know what to do.</v>

308
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 1>You can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.783
<v Speaker 1>when you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you interact with someone who's really </v>

310
00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:04.734
<v Speaker 1>socially fluent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that they're not </v>

311
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:10.560
<v Speaker 1>consciously processing the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're acting,</v>

312
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:11.483
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

313
00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.930
<v Speaker 1>they're self conscious and awkward.</v>

314
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.973
<v Speaker 1>They're just very fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's automatize behavior and it's coded </v>

315
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 1>right into them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a great philosopher,</v>

316
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:20.274
<v Speaker 1>then according to Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least what you do is you take a look </v>

317
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:25.350
<v Speaker 1>at how you act and what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you say,</v>

318
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.273
<v Speaker 1>well this is what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much that you're inventing </v>

319
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 1>new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that you're articulating the nature</v>

320
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:35.310
<v Speaker 1>of structures that are already there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine,</v>

321
00:18:35.311 --> 00:18:36.144
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're particularly </v>

322
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:41.110
<v Speaker 1>interested in wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you wrote,</v>

323
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:45.060
<v Speaker 1>you studied some wolves and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you see is that the wolves have a</v>

324
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:46.380
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

325
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.363
<v Speaker 1>there's a leader and then there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle in the pack to see who's going </v>

326
00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:52.044
<v Speaker 1>to be the dominant leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a couple of problems with </v>

327
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:56.190
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

328
00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we'll stay and wolf be fight and </v>

329
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:02.160
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty evenly matched and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tear each other to shreds,</v>

330
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.620
<v Speaker 1>then we'll see is going to come in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound both of them.</v>

331
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a particularly useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy for welfare,</v>

332
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.873
<v Speaker 1>for Wolf B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus then the pack loses the power of </v>

333
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Wolf and wolf be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's hardly useful at all.</v>

334
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:15.683
<v Speaker 1>So what's happened is that wolves have </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved dominance and submission </v>

335
00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:19.494
<v Speaker 1>strategies so that they can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is going to leave and who is going </v>

336
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:27.420
<v Speaker 1>to follow without having to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of physical combat that's going</v>

337
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:28.254
<v Speaker 1>to result in damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so usually what happens is that the </v>

338
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:31.974
<v Speaker 1>two wolves face off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably seen cats do this when </v>

339
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:35.850
<v Speaker 1>they encounter each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.713
<v Speaker 1>out on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they do is sort of </v>

341
00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Speaker 1>turned sideways and they puff themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and they dance back and forth.</v>

342
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It's quite comical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what the is trying to do is look bay</v>

343
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Speaker 1>and exposed to try and make the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat nervous enough to leave.</v>

344
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And so what wolves do is roughly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing they puff out.</v>

345
00:19:51.631 --> 00:19:52.464
<v Speaker 1>So they look big and they make all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ferocious noises and they threaten </v>

346
00:19:54.811 --> 00:19:55.644
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually what happens is one wolf </v>

347
00:19:57.991 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 1>will lose his nerve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flopped down,</v>

348
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 1>roll over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show his throat.</v>

349
00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And that basically means something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm useless and,</v>

350
00:20:04.831 --> 00:20:05.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

351
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:09.240
<v Speaker 1>and pathetic and you can tear out my </v>
<v Speaker 1>throat if you want because of that.</v>

352
00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:10.110
<v Speaker 1>And the other wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

353
00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a pretty useful and pathetic,</v>

354
00:20:12.451 --> 00:20:13.284
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna need you to morrow to hunt </v>

355
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:15.264
<v Speaker 1>down a deer so you know you can get up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and protect your miserable self and </v>

356
00:20:17.941 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Speaker 1>that'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you were watching that,</v>

357
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:23.530
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

358
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 1>just follow rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course they don't.</v>

359
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:26.873
<v Speaker 1>That's just how we'll Zack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you describe what the wills are </v>

360
00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you turn it into a rule.</v>

361
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.930
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't a rule to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a pattern of behavior.</v>

362
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Now human beings are like that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>chalked full of patterns of behavior and</v>

363
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.020
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the consequences of our biology,</v>

364
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.230
<v Speaker 1>which is something we'll talk about in </v>
<v Speaker 1>depth in the last half of the course.</v>

365
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.273
<v Speaker 1>And there are a consequence of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and they're built into our </v>

366
00:20:49.661 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 1>boardings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every,</v>

367
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 1>every time you interact with another </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

368
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 1>they're telling you how to behave right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be too obtuse.</v>

369
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Try to be a little bit witty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have something interesting to say.</v>

370
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Don't be too annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to say something funny,</v>

371
00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 1>make sure it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take turns while you talk.</v>

372
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Play nicely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your turn,</v>

373
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.830
<v Speaker 1>don't eat all the bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

374
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

375
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And so if you don't abide by those </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>

376
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.033
<v Speaker 1>then people lift their eyebrow at you or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't smile at your jokes are they </v>

377
00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 1>don't look at you or they roll their </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes when you come in,</v>

378
00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:26.470
<v Speaker 1>which is really not a good sign by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

379
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.383
<v Speaker 1>And you get punished severely for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you do act like they would </v>

380
00:21:32.231 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 1>like you to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

381
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:36.610
<v Speaker 1>then people smile at you and there they </v>
<v Speaker 1>invite you to their place for dinner.</v>

382
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:37.444
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have an intimate relationship </v>

383
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:39.724
<v Speaker 1>and some people that like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're exchanging information </v>

384
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:43.264
<v Speaker 1>about how we should manifest ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our bodies with every possible </v>

385
00:21:47.261 --> 00:21:48.094
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that shapes the </v>

386
00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:51.330
<v Speaker 1>way that we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

387
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.353
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or partly is that you don't really </v>

388
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:57.220
<v Speaker 1>understand the consequences of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

389
00:21:57.221 --> 00:22:00.150
<v Speaker 1>you can act it out more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on your social skill and,</v>

390
00:22:00.151 --> 00:22:02.320
<v Speaker 1>and the degree to which you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed to other people.</v>

391
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.333
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you're a conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have that you can consciously </v>

392
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:08.800
<v Speaker 1>articulate all the rules that underlie </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

393
00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you think that maybe you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fine.</v>

394
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine a well behaved four year old,</v>

395
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.353
<v Speaker 1>you know by four you've got a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social rules down because by four you </v>

396
00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 1>can play with others if you're ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to,</v>

397
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.930
<v Speaker 1>you can already do it by the time you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

398
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:26.883
<v Speaker 1>If you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you're four you are in </v>

399
00:22:28.811 --> 00:22:29.644
<v Speaker 1>serious trouble because other kids won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>play with you and then they won't teach </v>

400
00:22:32.081 --> 00:22:32.914
<v Speaker 1>you how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you stay immature and isolated </v>

401
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:35.764
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off in your little corner dejected and </v>

402
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.660
<v Speaker 1>bitter for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

403
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 1>you might think that's a little rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

404
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:45.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the data indicate.</v>

405
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

406
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.593
<v Speaker 1>what this means in part is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we've been shaping how all of us </v>

407
00:22:55.211 --> 00:23:00.211
<v Speaker 1>behave as long as we've been social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

408
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:02.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long have we been social?</v>

409
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans are social.</v>

410
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.863
<v Speaker 1>So lobsters for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves into dominance </v>

411
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:14.920
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies and they modify each other's</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

412
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:16.563
<v Speaker 1>And that's 400 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've been social and living in </v>

413
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:21.334
<v Speaker 1>groups since our ancestors</v>
<v Speaker 1>departed on the evolutionary timescale </v>

414
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:31.840
<v Speaker 1>from the ancestors of lobsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very,</v>

415
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>

416
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 1>There weren't any trees around back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

417
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.863
<v Speaker 1>So social life is older than trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can be sure that you're adapted </v>

418
00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 1>to it in a major way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's built into your biology.</v>

419
00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the historical element </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it too.</v>

420
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's quite,</v>

421
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.150
<v Speaker 1>we're quite flexible from a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

422
00:23:54.151 --> 00:23:55.440
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an example,</v>

423
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.800
<v Speaker 1>this guy named Robert Sapolsky who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I really like,</v>

424
00:23:58.801 --> 00:24:02.760
<v Speaker 1>he's a great scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went off to Africa to study baboons.</v>

425
00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Baboons are not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

426
00:24:06.901 --> 00:24:08.910
<v Speaker 1>there may fight a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bullies.</v>

427
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.010
<v Speaker 1>They bite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can really bite at bamboo and like,</v>

428
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

429
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.210
<v Speaker 1>a predatory cat will think twice about </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking on I baboons.</v>

430
00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.283
<v Speaker 1>They've got major teeth and their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their temperament is not particularly </v>

431
00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:20.424
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So polsky went and studied a group of </v>

432
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.500
<v Speaker 1>baboons and they were engaged in typical</v>
<v Speaker 1>baboon,</v>

433
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.600
<v Speaker 1>gang behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassing each other.</v>

434
00:24:27.601 --> 00:24:28.434
<v Speaker 1>All the time and bullying each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're all stressed out because </v>

435
00:24:30.181 --> 00:24:33.150
<v Speaker 1>it's the Polsky knew that because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>measured their levels of stress and,</v>

436
00:24:33.151 --> 00:24:33.984
<v Speaker 1>and testosterone and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was pretty miserable baboons </v>

437
00:24:36.901 --> 00:24:38.820
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what happened was that</v>

438
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.620
<v Speaker 1>the baboons went to feed somewhere that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>

439
00:24:43.621 --> 00:24:44.454
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them contracted tuberculosis </v>

440
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.010
<v Speaker 1>and it turned out that almost all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper aggressive male,</v>

441
00:24:50.011 --> 00:24:54.270
<v Speaker 1>it's got tuberculosis and died and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was left was the Beta males roughly</v>

442
00:24:54.271 --> 00:24:55.104
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the whole book bundle and </v>

443
00:24:56.181 --> 00:24:57.014
<v Speaker 1>culture transformed so that it became </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more agreeable in much more </v>

444
00:24:59.401 --> 00:25:00.234
<v Speaker 1>cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when aggressive baboons would </v>

445
00:25:02.221 --> 00:25:03.960
<v Speaker 1>move into that territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

446
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.950
<v Speaker 1>singly or their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'd get all placid and calm too.</v>

447
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.473
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting gate because </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously baboons aren't social to the </v>

448
00:25:12.391 --> 00:25:13.224
<v Speaker 1>degree that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does indicate that even at the </v>

449
00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:18.060
<v Speaker 1>advanced primate level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

450
00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:20.100
<v Speaker 1>their brains are pretty big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not as big as ours.</v>

451
00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:24.840
<v Speaker 1>That cultural transmission of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation can be quite powerful and it</v>

452
00:25:24.841 --> 00:25:28.800
<v Speaker 1>can transform quite rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

453
00:25:28.801 --> 00:25:31.110
<v Speaker 1>we've been shaping each other's behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a very,</v>

454
00:25:31.111 --> 00:25:31.801
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

455
00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:36.060
<v Speaker 1>very long time and a lot of that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>encoded deeply in biology,</v>

456
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Andean culture.</v>

457
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Now biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we'll talk about this a lot,</v>

458
00:25:41.371 --> 00:25:42.204
<v Speaker 1>when we get to the biological section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways that you can know how </v>

459
00:25:45.361 --> 00:25:46.194
<v Speaker 1>social you are is by noting how hurt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ashamed you get if you make a serious </v>

460
00:25:50.551 --> 00:25:52.250
<v Speaker 1>social error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

461
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.510
<v Speaker 1>So if you're at a party and you make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fool of yourself,</v>

462
00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on your level of neuroticism,</v>

463
00:25:56.701 --> 00:25:57.534
<v Speaker 1>which is also a big five trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that index is how sensitive you are to </v>

464
00:26:00.391 --> 00:26:03.150
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might obsess about what an idiot you</v>

465
00:26:03.151 --> 00:26:06.420
<v Speaker 1>are for the next three or four months or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even for the next five years.</v>

466
00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do not like social exclusion.</v>

467
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.233
<v Speaker 1>You know when you have a little counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more or less built into the back </v>

468
00:26:14.641 --> 00:26:18.810
<v Speaker 1>of your brain that roughly first of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimates how successful you are.</v>

469
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.050
<v Speaker 1>There's an estimation that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to occur right at birth,</v>

470
00:26:22.051 --> 00:26:25.020
<v Speaker 1>where when part of your neuroticism </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels are set,</v>

471
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:28.410
<v Speaker 1>and then that can be modified to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree by learning.</v>

472
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.273
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a talk baboons while </v>

473
00:26:32.101 --> 00:26:32.934
<v Speaker 1>you're going to experience less negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and more satisfaction than you </v>

474
00:26:35.911 --> 00:26:38.910
<v Speaker 1>are if you're a bottom baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's exactly the same with people.</v>

475
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.463
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we liked to be climbing up dominance </v>

476
00:26:42.751 --> 00:26:43.584
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like to be near the top of dominance </v>

477
00:26:44.931 --> 00:26:45.764
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the little counter out the back </v>

478
00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:47.724
<v Speaker 1>of your brain notices that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a good job of climbing </v>

479
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 1>towards the top of irrelevant dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

480
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:53.663
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to produce more </v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin and you're not going to be as </v>

481
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 1>in as much pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be as depressed,</v>

482
00:26:58.201 --> 00:26:59.034
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be as anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be stressed and so </v>

483
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:03.010
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

484
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.503
<v Speaker 1>so there's a biological basis for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>social being and it's extraordinarily </v>

485
00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:09.780
<v Speaker 1>important to us how we fit into social </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>

486
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.853
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've also been trying to figure out </v>

487
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.233
<v Speaker 1>what the hell we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we are for thousands and thousands </v>

488
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>

489
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Partly as a consequence of imitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.370
<v Speaker 1>cause I can act you out and that'll sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of help me understand what you're like.</v>

491
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.870
<v Speaker 1>And partly as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated communication,</v>

492
00:27:29.871 --> 00:27:30.704
<v Speaker 1>Lord of that storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people have been telling stories </v>

493
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:35.580
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea how long.</v>

494
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you go and visit peoples that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no written language and who've been</v>

495
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:42.594
<v Speaker 1>isolated from the rest of human society </v>
<v Speaker 1>for say tens of thousands of years and </v>

496
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:48.960
<v Speaker 1>such people still exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that they tell stories,</v>

497
00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 1>they dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they act each other out,</v>

498
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know certainly that the propensity</v>

499
00:27:54.601 --> 00:27:55.434
<v Speaker 1>to tell stories and to engage in ritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior is far older than our ability </v>

500
00:27:58.921 --> 00:27:59.754
<v Speaker 1>to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect you could push it back at </v>

501
00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:05.310
<v Speaker 1>least 50,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I suspect it's a lot older than</v>

502
00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:06.144
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happened is that across </v>

503
00:28:08.911 --> 00:28:09.744
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of timescales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've started to tell stories about one </v>

504
00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:16.500
<v Speaker 1>another that represent how we act.</v>

505
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.030
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

506
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:20.940
<v Speaker 1>some of those stories are interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and memorable and some of them aren't.</v>

507
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:21.774
<v Speaker 1>And then we tend to remember the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and memorable ones and pass </v>

508
00:28:24.571 --> 00:28:28.440
<v Speaker 1>them on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can also imagine human beings</v>

509
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.333
<v Speaker 1>aggregating together in groups of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of people over </v>

510
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:34.883
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>their stories to one another and </v>

511
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:37.644
<v Speaker 1>hammering those stories into some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mutually acceptable and </v>

512
00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:44.070
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

513
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.460
<v Speaker 1>one example of that is that if you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the creation stories,</v>

514
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.760
<v Speaker 1>the creation story that say occurs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Genesis in the Old Testament,</v>

515
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:51.863
<v Speaker 1>it's a member of a class of creation </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that characterized Middle </v>

516
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:56.783
<v Speaker 1>Eastern mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to have arisen out of the </v>

517
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:02.483
<v Speaker 1>Organization of separate Middle Eastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes thousands and thousands of years </v>

518
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.453
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each with their own traditions into a </v>

519
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:11.541
<v Speaker 1>relatively homogenous story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized a large group of people,</v>

520
00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:12.804
<v Speaker 1>central beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have information about how we act </v>

521
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:23.340
<v Speaker 1>from the representations that we've made</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those actions that we passed forward.</v>

522
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:27.240
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of those take the form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>myths,</v>

523
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.720
<v Speaker 1>religious stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of what we're going to do is</v>

524
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:35.721
<v Speaker 1>we're going to begin the course with two</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation establishing themes.</v>

525
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.370
<v Speaker 1>One has to do with the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological representations,</v>

526
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:43.983
<v Speaker 1>and the second has to do with a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals and processes and beliefs that </v>

527
00:29:49.001 --> 00:29:49.834
<v Speaker 1>have been identified more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldwide that have to do with shamonic </v>

528
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

529
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.200
<v Speaker 1>the title of this course is personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its transformations.</v>

530
00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's titled that way is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you aren't just who you are.</v>

531
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

532
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.830
<v Speaker 1>You're also something that changes all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

533
00:30:06.831 --> 00:30:08.810
<v Speaker 1>You're more like a river then like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock,</v>

534
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.850
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly transforming.</v>

535
00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

536
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Physicist Erwin Schrodinger thought that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were dissipative structures.</v>

537
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:19.803
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a dissipative structure is a </v>

538
00:30:22.171 --> 00:30:26.790
<v Speaker 1>structure that maintains its structural </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity while its elements transformed</v>

539
00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

540
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:31.960
<v Speaker 1>when you let the water out of the sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a whirlpool,</v>

541
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.063
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the whirlpool is a fairly stable </v>

542
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:35.890
<v Speaker 1>entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the water that the whirlpool is made</v>

543
00:30:35.891 --> 00:30:37.180
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's constantly changing.</v>

544
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a dissipative structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

545
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:41.950
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You maintain your form across time,</v>

546
00:30:41.951 --> 00:30:44.170
<v Speaker 1>but your elements are constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>transforming.</v>

547
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.500
<v Speaker 1>And people are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very transformative creatures.</v>

548
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

549
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.003
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

550
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Unlike animals really because animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>are sort of what they are and that's it.</v>

551
00:30:54.731 --> 00:30:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have some capacity learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>but not very much.</v>

552
00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Your typical beaver is acting more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less today.</v>

553
00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his great,</v>

554
00:31:01.841 --> 00:31:02.471
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

555
00:31:02.471 --> 00:31:05.020
<v Speaker 1>great grandfather was acting 5,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

556
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:10.410
<v Speaker 1>There's no real accretion of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with human beings we transformed</v>

557
00:31:11.681 --> 00:31:12.514
<v Speaker 1>like Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do that culturally things </v>

558
00:31:15.161 --> 00:31:17.260
<v Speaker 1>aren't much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many things for example,</v>

559
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:20.080
<v Speaker 1>that are different now than there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago that it's almost impossible</v>

560
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:20.914
<v Speaker 1>to manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so we transform on a cultural </v>

561
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:25.270
<v Speaker 1>scale quite rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we also do that individually.</v>

562
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys have all just made the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition to university.</v>

563
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Just roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

564
00:31:30.941 --> 00:31:34.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were in some ways when you were</v>

565
00:31:34.691 --> 00:31:35.524
<v Speaker 1>in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well hopefully you're better than </v>

566
00:31:37.181 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 1>you were in high school a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways as well.</v>

567
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.623
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be more mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your personality may have </v>

568
00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:44.230
<v Speaker 1>transformed substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

569
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:45.064
<v Speaker 1>And with any luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not done with your sequences of </v>

570
00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:48.574
<v Speaker 1>transformations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's going to be something </v>

571
00:31:50.801 --> 00:31:51.634
<v Speaker 1>that characterizes you for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life in so far as you're a dynamic </v>

572
00:31:55.061 --> 00:31:56.230
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes are open,</v>

573
00:31:56.231 --> 00:31:58.720
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you can learn.</v>

574
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.063
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you might say </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the most stable thing there is </v>

575
00:32:03.311 --> 00:32:06.070
<v Speaker 1>about the human personality is its </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to transform.</v>

576
00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something that's worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing.</v>

577
00:32:08.591 --> 00:32:10.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things I can tell you</v>

578
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:11.764
<v Speaker 1>about the great myths of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of them and they have </v>

579
00:32:14.471 --> 00:32:15.304
<v Speaker 1>different themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the most powerful themes is </v>

580
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.960
<v Speaker 1>the way you get yourself out of trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to transform your personality.</v>

581
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Now you think you kind of do that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you learn something,</v>

582
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

583
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Because you learn something in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>little different than you were before,</v>

584
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:31.563
<v Speaker 1>hopefully different in a significant way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully different in a way that </v>

585
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:36.970
<v Speaker 1>helps you solve some problems that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't solve before.</v>

586
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:41.600
<v Speaker 1>So you could say one of the late motifs </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being human is,</v>

587
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were encountering an obstacle I can</v>

588
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:47.270
<v Speaker 1>just transform it and I can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>some way of getting around it and that's</v>

589
00:32:47.271 --> 00:32:49.100
<v Speaker 1>something that makes us quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable.</v>

590
00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.493
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I could suggest </v>

591
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:53.144
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is one of the largest </v>

592
00:32:56.301 --> 00:32:57.134
<v Speaker 1>ideas that exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially communicable in this short a </v>

593
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:02.084
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's much better to identify </v>

594
00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:05.174
<v Speaker 1>with your capacity to transform then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to identify with who you are now and </v>

595
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:12.290
<v Speaker 1>that can get you out of an awful lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

596
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes the logs for example,</v>

597
00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:16.064
<v Speaker 1>or people who are trapped in fixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief systems is that they worship who </v>

598
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:23.540
<v Speaker 1>they are now and that'd be all fine if </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was going 100% for them,</v>

599
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:24.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's seldom the case.</v>

600
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.460
<v Speaker 1>And so unless your life is perfect and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems highly improbable,</v>

601
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you were someone else it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be better.</v>

602
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:33.883
<v Speaker 1>And you know that's all you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some sense because changing the </v>

603
00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 1>world in some way that's going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel better about it.</v>

604
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.761
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

605
00:33:40.761 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to do that in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>small way,</v>

606
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:43.304
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that you could or </v>
<v Speaker 1>should try to do that on large scale is </v>

607
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.480
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

608
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 1>so in the mythological representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>section,</v>

609
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to you about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental elements of narrative.</v>

610
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:03.650
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that I think that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary is because there's,</v>

611
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.513
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of two things that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to consider when you're talking about </v>

612
00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:07.844
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one is objectively what is a person </v>

613
00:34:12.531 --> 00:34:13.364
<v Speaker 1>light?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll same way you might think about </v>

614
00:34:14.271 --> 00:34:16.760
<v Speaker 1>what Iraq is like or maybe even what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock is like.</v>

615
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:18.523
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a scientific question in some </v>

616
00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:21.224
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's another question which </v>

617
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:25.370
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe two questions,</v>

618
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 1>how do people act and how should they </v>
<v Speaker 1>act?</v>

619
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:32.060
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the first one is a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

620
00:34:32.061 --> 00:34:32.894
<v Speaker 1>but the second one certainly isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that we explore how people </v>

621
00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:38.354
<v Speaker 1>do act and how they should act has a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>more with to do with narrative then it </v>

622
00:34:41.091 --> 00:34:43.010
<v Speaker 1>has to do with science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

623
00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:45.260
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh you have to do is think about it.</v>

624
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about where do you get most of</v>

625
00:34:46.941 --> 00:34:47.774
<v Speaker 1>your information about what people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're not actually just the </v>

626
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:51.704
<v Speaker 1>interacting with some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is quite </v>

627
00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:55.850
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read novels,</v>

628
00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.160
<v Speaker 1>he read literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go see movies,</v>

629
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you watch a game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you binge on game of thrones,</v>

630
00:35:02.001 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go watch star wars.</v>

631
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.293
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you line up for three days if </v>

632
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:08.750
<v Speaker 1>you're completely insane to go see star </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars,</v>

633
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.310
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask,</v>

634
00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:13.130
<v Speaker 1>well what in the world are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

635
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.383
<v Speaker 1>people are hungry for information about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how people do act and how they should </v>

636
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:18.704
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're absolutely compelled by </v>

637
00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:22.964
<v Speaker 1>narratives and there's reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well and you kind of know what a </v>

638
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:28.970
<v Speaker 1>narrative is and one isn't right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a movie and you think,</v>

639
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:30.543
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the character development is pretty </v>

640
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:32.460
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

641
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a story it was terrible.</v>

642
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.770
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you talk with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends about why it a terrible story.</v>

643
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 1>But the funny thing is you kind of know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

644
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like some things are stories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some things aren't.</v>

645
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.153
<v Speaker 1>And laying out what actually makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>something a story that's very difficult </v>

646
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.800
<v Speaker 1>but you still know it and you can come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some consensus even,</v>

647
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look on I mdb or rotten tomatoes,</v>

648
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.203
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people form large group consensus about </v>

649
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.793
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes an acceptable narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn quickly and there seems to </v>

650
00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 1>be at least a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement,</v>

651
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barring individual differences.</v>

652
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.283
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mythological and the shamonic </v>

653
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:20.330
<v Speaker 1>discussions that were going to undertake</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a couple of purposes.</v>

654
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:21.263
<v Speaker 1>One is to provide you with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations of a language that you can </v>

655
00:36:26.371 --> 00:36:30.180
<v Speaker 1>use to understand narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's going to prove very,</v>

656
00:36:30.181 --> 00:36:31.014
<v Speaker 1>very useful because most of the clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories that we're going to talk about </v>

657
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.293
<v Speaker 1>are really narrative based and once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand their mythological </v>

658
00:36:39.991 --> 00:36:40.824
<v Speaker 1>substructure so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a framework within which </v>

659
00:36:43.471 --> 00:36:45.810
<v Speaker 1>you can slot the theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

660
00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:46.644
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated about personality theory is </v>

661
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:52.470
<v Speaker 1>that there are a lot of personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories and you might think,</v>

662
00:36:52.471 --> 00:36:55.590
<v Speaker 1>well how the hell can that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's a theory,</v>

663
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.543
<v Speaker 1>theoretically there could only be one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's only one theory of </v>

664
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:01.830
<v Speaker 1>relativity rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

665
00:37:01.831 --> 00:37:05.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a little fuzzy around the edges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people agree on the core elements.</v>

666
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Well with personality theory there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's many,</v>

667
00:37:09.031 --> 00:37:13.350
<v Speaker 1>many different personality theories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you might think,</v>

668
00:37:13.351 --> 00:37:15.720
<v Speaker 1>well how are you supposed to make any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense out of that?</v>

669
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.733
<v Speaker 1>Well there's two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is to put all of them into a more </v>

670
00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:20.124
<v Speaker 1>fundamental underlying structure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I'm really going </v>

671
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 1>to strive to have you guys do while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking this course.</v>

672
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:26.843
<v Speaker 1>And the other is to actually adopt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly different set of </v>

673
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:31.560
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions about personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>

674
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:33.330
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

675
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.110
<v Speaker 1>there's only one theory of relativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you might say,</v>

676
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:39.000
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only one theory of relativity,</v>

677
00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:39.834
<v Speaker 1>but then consider a toolbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe some of you are relatively </v>

678
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:45.144
<v Speaker 1>handy and you have a toolbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's in the toolbox hammers or a </v>

679
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:52.020
<v Speaker 1>hammer saws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ranches,</v>

680
00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.730
<v Speaker 1>pliers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice grips,</v>

681
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.530
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

682
00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.780
<v Speaker 1>when you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

683
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.270
<v Speaker 1>there tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you need all those tools?</v>

684
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.740
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

685
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:05.574
<v Speaker 1>you can hammer a nail in with a ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be a lot better if you could </v>

686
00:38:08.281 --> 00:38:10.860
<v Speaker 1>use a hammer and you can probably bang a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bolt off with a hammer.</v>

687
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.780
<v Speaker 1>But it would be a lot better if you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a ranch.</v>

688
00:38:12.781 --> 00:38:14.190
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

689
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.390
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and sophisticated,</v>

690
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.673
<v Speaker 1>why not have a bunch of tools?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't generally think of </v>

691
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:27.030
<v Speaker 1>scientific theories as tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that is what they are.</v>

692
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Above all else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are tools.</v>

693
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.773
<v Speaker 1>And then when we're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something as complicated as a human </v>

694
00:38:32.491 --> 00:38:33.301
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you know,</v>

695
00:38:33.301 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 1>we may need more than one tool to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of it.</v>

696
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.173
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that to say understand a human </v>

697
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a complicated thing.</v>

698
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:43.444
<v Speaker 1>It's cause he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I understand to what end you don't </v>

699
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 1>mean comprehensive universal on </v>
<v Speaker 1>omniscient and understanding.</v>

700
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you mean I want to know x </v>
<v Speaker 1>about someone because I have some desire</v>

701
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.010
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to my interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

702
00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.670
<v Speaker 1>And so there's all sorts of tools that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can facilitate that.</v>

703
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.713
<v Speaker 1>So what I would say is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud to microscope and human is a </v>

704
00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:08.530
<v Speaker 1>telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

705
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:09.364
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no particular reason I </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated either of those with those </v>

706
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:13.774
<v Speaker 1>two tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that if you pay </v>

707
00:39:15.581 --> 00:39:18.010
<v Speaker 1>careful attention to personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>

708
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.383
<v Speaker 1>they can expand your capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent yourself in ways that's </v>

709
00:39:22.541 --> 00:39:23.374
<v Speaker 1>extremely useful because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should understand who you are and </v>

710
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:28.204
<v Speaker 1>why and what implications that has for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because you're a transformable </v>

711
00:39:33.191 --> 00:39:34.024
<v Speaker 1>creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have a fairly stable </v>

712
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:36.880
<v Speaker 1>underlying substructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

713
00:39:36.881 --> 00:39:41.881
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you just melt like an octopus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're this weird dynamic combination</v>

714
00:39:42.491 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 1>of relatively permanent structure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then embedded capacity to transform.</v>

715
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.123
<v Speaker 1>You have a nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so understanding your nature is </v>

716
00:39:51.391 --> 00:39:52.224
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily youth worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so hopefully what we're going to do </v>

717
00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:55.883
<v Speaker 1>during this course is give you a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of tools to understand yourself </v>

718
00:39:59.251 --> 00:40:02.370
<v Speaker 1>and other people with tools that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>really be useful,</v>

719
00:40:02.371 --> 00:40:03.204
<v Speaker 1>things you can use day to day to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand yourselves and your families </v>

720
00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:06.924
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to improve your future with any </v>

721
00:40:08.641 --> 00:40:11.550
<v Speaker 1>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also cover</v>

722
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.813
<v Speaker 1>the elements of you that are stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of which I would say have been </v>

723
00:40:17.011 --> 00:40:17.844
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the more objective sense by </v>

724
00:40:20.581 --> 00:40:21.414
<v Speaker 1>biological psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mostly animal research is peculiarly </v>

725
00:40:25.021 --> 00:40:26.100
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

726
00:40:26.101 --> 00:40:26.934
<v Speaker 1>so mythological representations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take a trip back through </v>

727
00:40:30.181 --> 00:40:31.014
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look at archaic and </v>

728
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:38.180
<v Speaker 1>ancient stories of mankind told by </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of our species to each other.</v>

729
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:42.540
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to concentrate on stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have lasted.</v>

730
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:43.643
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know we have stories that in the </v>

731
00:40:46.411 --> 00:40:51.000
<v Speaker 1>written form or 4,000 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the evidence suggests that those</v>

732
00:40:51.001 --> 00:40:54.660
<v Speaker 1>stories are based on traditions that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back far,</v>

733
00:40:54.661 --> 00:40:55.494
<v Speaker 1>far beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 50,000 years and maybe way </v>

734
00:41:00.271 --> 00:41:01.104
<v Speaker 1>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it will take a look at those and </v>

735
00:41:02.491 --> 00:41:05.810
<v Speaker 1>that'll give us a foundation that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>use to build on.</v>

736
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.653
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to look at shamonic</v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals and descriptions to get some </v>

737
00:41:10.741 --> 00:41:13.350
<v Speaker 1>sense of the archetype of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

738
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:14.940
<v Speaker 1>which sort of means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

739
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:15.953
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you have to undergo when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're changing and what are you likely </v>

740
00:41:19.831 --> 00:41:23.430
<v Speaker 1>to experience when that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can give you a bit of a preview.</v>

741
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.673
<v Speaker 1>It's not always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's seldom the case that if </v>

742
00:41:30.501 --> 00:41:32.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll learn something important that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

743
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happens to people all the time.</v>

744
00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:38.050
<v Speaker 1>So maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

745
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe you had a recent relationship that</v>
<v Speaker 1>went seriously sour and you know,</v>

746
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:45.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was because you were going out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a jerk or maybe it's because you're</v>

747
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:46.214
<v Speaker 1>just not very sophisticated and no doubt</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out which of </v>

748
00:41:49.581 --> 00:41:51.080
<v Speaker 1>those happens to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

749
00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:51.740
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

750
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.573
<v Speaker 1>considering the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But generally what happens to people </v>

751
00:41:55.731 --> 00:41:56.564
<v Speaker 1>when they're moving towards something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bottom falls out because </v>

752
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:04.520
<v Speaker 1>something occurs that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and couldn't predict maybe in</v>

753
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:05.354
<v Speaker 1>their own behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you had an affair while you were </v>

754
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:09.680
<v Speaker 1>in your relationship and you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect that.</v>

755
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:10.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that your current model </v>

756
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 1>of yourself and perhaps even of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is demonstrated as insufficient,</v>

757
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:19.940
<v Speaker 1>not rattles you up badly.</v>

758
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:24.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you're rattled up for some good</v>
<v Speaker 1>length of time,</v>

759
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.240
<v Speaker 1>not very motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat depressed,</v>

760
00:42:26.241 --> 00:42:28.580
<v Speaker 1>fairly anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of fell apart.</v>

761
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:32.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't know which way is up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe if you're lucky you think</v>

762
00:42:32.361 --> 00:42:35.270
<v Speaker 1>about it and talk about it and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself back together.</v>

763
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.313
<v Speaker 1>And when you come out the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a little smarter and a little </v>

764
00:42:38.481 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 1>more together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you work to begin with.</v>

765
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're unlucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just stay in the little pit for</v>

766
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.460
<v Speaker 1>people can stay in the little pit for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

767
00:42:46.461 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not so good.</v>

768
00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:49.941
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

769
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:50.774
<v Speaker 1>the process of transformation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually quite dangerous because it </v>

770
00:42:53.151 --> 00:42:57.620
<v Speaker 1>doesn't necessarily have to be completed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a successful manner,</v>

771
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.490
<v Speaker 1>but it does have a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pattern usually is you think you</v>

772
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:02.324
<v Speaker 1>know what you're doing and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>something happens to demonstrate that </v>

773
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:07.490
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

774
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.713
<v Speaker 1>And that puts you in a spin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then through careful analysis and </v>

775
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:13.274
<v Speaker 1>support and discussion and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes that we don't really </v>

776
00:43:16.101 --> 00:43:16.934
<v Speaker 1>understand very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come to incorporate the anomalous </v>

777
00:43:20.001 --> 00:43:20.834
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that knocked you on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You reconstruct your personality and </v>

778
00:43:25.731 --> 00:43:30.170
<v Speaker 1>your representations of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you move ahead,</v>

779
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:35.350
<v Speaker 1>hopefully more than you were before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's an interesting thing to know.</v>

780
00:43:36.111 --> 00:43:36.944
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things nick just said again </v>

781
00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:39.074
<v Speaker 1>was that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell the character of a human </v>

782
00:43:41.061 --> 00:43:43.580
<v Speaker 1>being by how much truth there willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate.</v>

783
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.013
<v Speaker 1>Now that's an interesting phrase because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you generally think of people because </v>

784
00:43:48.501 --> 00:43:49.334
<v Speaker 1>they're optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They generally think of truth as </v>

785
00:43:50.591 --> 00:43:53.240
<v Speaker 1>something positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's better to know the truth.</v>

786
00:43:53.241 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like no if you pulled the wool over</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes as a general rule,</v>

787
00:43:57.261 --> 00:43:59.810
<v Speaker 1>learning the truth is not a pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

788
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:03.320
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't necessarily mean that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not something you should do.</v>

789
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.700
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that the path to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment is blissful,</v>

790
00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:11.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very smart idea.</v>

791
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite the opposite.</v>

792
00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:19.660
<v Speaker 1>So the Shamana rituals basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest that's in an architectural way.</v>

793
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:23.240
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you see happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the typical,</v>

794
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:24.470
<v Speaker 1>the Sharman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

795
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:25.304
<v Speaker 1>shamanism is a worldwide phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be associated with a </v>

796
00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.820
<v Speaker 1>primordial or archaic psychology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

797
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:33.654
<v Speaker 1>It's often drug Aden and generally what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is that a shamonic </v>

798
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:39.144
<v Speaker 1>transformation is accompanied by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>descent into something approximating </v>

799
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.753
<v Speaker 1>psychological death and then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding and a rebirth that puts the </v>

800
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:49.014
<v Speaker 1>person out on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an initiation ritual and </v>

801
00:44:51.991 --> 00:44:52.824
<v Speaker 1>that's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you might think about it as the </v>

802
00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:56.034
<v Speaker 1>depression that possessed you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>during your first semester of </v>

803
00:44:58.021 --> 00:44:59.850
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which either</v>

804
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

805
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.233
<v Speaker 1>do you out of the university altogether </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that happens to a lot of people </v>

806
00:45:05.841 --> 00:45:09.150
<v Speaker 1>are which you recovered from and finally</v>
<v Speaker 1>became a university student.</v>

807
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Although perhaps that wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly pleasant transition.</v>

808
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.313
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done some testing with u of t </v>

809
00:45:14.851 --> 00:45:15.684
<v Speaker 1>students and it's interesting to note </v>
<v Speaker 1>that about a third of you meet criteria </v>

810
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 1>for clinical depression your first year </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

811
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.793
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that indicates to me is that the </v>

812
00:45:23.701 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 1>criteria for clinical depression are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little on the sensitive side,</v>

813
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.130
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but regardless,</v>

814
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:31.260
<v Speaker 1>because if a third of people meet the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criteria,</v>

815
00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:33.060
<v Speaker 1>thank yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a little sensitive,</v>

816
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.070
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

817
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:39.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy adjustment and the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>you has to die.</v>

818
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And generally that's not very pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

819
00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:44.923
<v Speaker 1>and it's a good way to think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impediments to learn it because you'll </v>

820
00:45:47.101 --> 00:45:50.130
<v Speaker 1>hardly ever learned something without </v>
<v Speaker 1>having part of you dies first.</v>

821
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.503
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are rather resistant to learning </v>

822
00:45:54.061 --> 00:45:55.410
<v Speaker 1>anything new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>

823
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:56.691
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

824
00:45:56.691 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 1>so you've got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now after that we're going to talk about</v>

825
00:45:59.281 --> 00:46:03.930
<v Speaker 1>piaget and piaget isn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as a personality psychologist,</v>

826
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:10.000
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget published a v,</v>

827
00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:10.893
<v Speaker 1>he was a developmental psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the greatest developmental </v>

828
00:46:12.851 --> 00:46:13.684
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>

829
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.270
<v Speaker 1>He published a very large number of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of books,</v>

830
00:46:18.271 --> 00:46:20.490
<v Speaker 1>many of which haven't even been </v>
<v Speaker 1>translated yet,</v>

831
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.350
<v Speaker 1>some of which haven't even been </v>
<v Speaker 1>published yet.</v>

832
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:25.290
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget thought a lot of things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things.</v>

833
00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:28.770
<v Speaker 1>And he's generally known for his stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory of development.</v>

834
00:46:28.771 --> 00:46:31.020
<v Speaker 1>But he really wasn't all that into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage theory.</v>

835
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:33.660
<v Speaker 1>It just seemed to be the part of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that</v>

836
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.053
<v Speaker 1>I would say rather dimwitted western </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals could grasp onto most </v>

837
00:46:38.911 --> 00:46:39.744
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's generally what you hear </v>

838
00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:42.720
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Piaget was a very,</v>

839
00:46:42.721 --> 00:46:46.590
<v Speaker 1>very sophisticated thinker and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things he was interested in was,</v>

840
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:52.380
<v Speaker 1>well he was interested in how the child </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense boots itself up.</v>

841
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:54.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a reasonable way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

842
00:46:54.231 --> 00:46:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know when you turn on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>

843
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:58.920
<v Speaker 1>what happens is a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive functions,</v>

844
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:02.250
<v Speaker 1>primitive fundamental functions come </v>
<v Speaker 1>online first.</v>

845
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.540
<v Speaker 1>And then those functions enable more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex functions to emerge.</v>

846
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:07.374
<v Speaker 1>And then Noah's functions may enable </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex functions to emerge and </v>

847
00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:12.600
<v Speaker 1>soon they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your computer is waiting for you.</v>

848
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.333
<v Speaker 1>And human beings are kind of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we're first born were very </v>

849
00:47:19.081 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 1>primitive when we're first born were </v>
<v Speaker 1>very immature.</v>

850
00:47:22.771 --> 00:47:23.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a better way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

851
00:47:23.911 --> 00:47:24.744
<v Speaker 1>We're not precisely primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still have very large brains and </v>

852
00:47:27.541 --> 00:47:29.620
<v Speaker 1>they're more connections in those brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>at birth.</v>

853
00:47:29.621 --> 00:47:31.870
<v Speaker 1>And there are any that there will be for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your life,</v>

854
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:33.183
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually dye into your personality </v>

855
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.550
<v Speaker 1>because what happens isn't so much that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make new connections,</v>

856
00:47:39.551 --> 00:47:40.384
<v Speaker 1>it's that a whole bunch of the ones you </v>
<v Speaker 1>already have that you don't use </v>

857
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:45.790
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty peculiar anyways.</v>

858
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.433
<v Speaker 1>When you first born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot to you in terms of </v>

859
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.060
<v Speaker 1>capacity to engage with the world.</v>

860
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Your mouth is pretty wired up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your lips and your tongue,</v>

861
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:55.953
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to breastfeed and that's actually not </v>

862
00:47:58.331 --> 00:47:59.164
<v Speaker 1>very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a clue to do that and </v>

863
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 1>it's the first complex social </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction you're likely to engage in.</v>

864
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:05.943
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're born with a fair bit of a </v>

865
00:48:08.591 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 1>priority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated wiring already in place,</v>

866
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:13.690
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

867
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not there much at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't control your arms.</v>

868
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:18.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch a baby in a crib,</v>

869
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.220
<v Speaker 1>a young baby and it's not swaddled up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

870
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:22.054
<v Speaker 1>their arm sort of float around in space </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so to their legs and now and then </v>

871
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:25.594
<v Speaker 1>they might hit themselves and January,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to come as quite a shock to </v>

872
00:48:28.031 --> 00:48:32.020
<v Speaker 1>the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not it's peripheral nervous system.</v>

873
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 1>The peripheral elements of its central </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system are not well developed at</v>

874
00:48:37.991 --> 00:48:38.650
<v Speaker 1>birth.</v>

875
00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And so it's almost as if the baby has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discover its limbs.</v>

876
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.760
<v Speaker 1>It sort of expands from the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>outwards.</v>

877
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:45.603
<v Speaker 1>It has to discover its limbs and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to figure out what to do with </v>

878
00:48:49.541 --> 00:48:50.374
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what piaget attempted to do was </v>

879
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:57.601
<v Speaker 1>to lay out the processes by which a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child unfolded into the world.</v>

880
00:48:58.750 --> 00:48:59.583
<v Speaker 1>Now some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a biological basis to that </v>

881
00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:05.971
<v Speaker 1>because you come into the world at birth</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a set of reflexes at hand,</v>

882
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.120
<v Speaker 1>and those reflexes are enough to get you</v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

883
00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:11.973
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one way of trying to understand </v>

884
00:49:15.341 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 1>piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it quite a bit.</v>

885
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:19.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit of an oversimplification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll do,</v>

886
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:20.973
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of different ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what the world is made </v>

887
00:49:22.871 --> 00:49:24.010
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

888
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:25.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a classically,</v>

889
00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're a classical scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think that the world is made</v>

890
00:49:28.481 --> 00:49:29.710
<v Speaker 1>out of matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

891
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:30.544
<v Speaker 1>and then matter is made out of atoms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>atoms are made out of God only knows </v>

892
00:49:34.241 --> 00:49:35.530
<v Speaker 1>what atoms are made out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

893
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:36.363
<v Speaker 1>Because by the time you get under Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have no idea what's going on </v>

894
00:49:39.761 --> 00:49:41.020
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

895
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:41.913
<v Speaker 1>we generally don't think about that too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much and we sort of assume newtonian </v>

896
00:49:45.401 --> 00:49:48.790
<v Speaker 1>reality and that everything is made out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hard little particles like dust.</v>

897
00:49:48.791 --> 00:49:52.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's the scientific model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's other ways of looking at the</v>

898
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:53.164
<v Speaker 1>world that are not only equally valid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but equally necessary and equally </v>

899
00:49:58.811 --> 00:49:59.644
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is that you can look at </v>

900
00:50:01.121 --> 00:50:04.510
<v Speaker 1>the world as a matrix of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

901
00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And so information generally has </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance and meaning,</v>

902
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:11.530
<v Speaker 1>or at least in so far as information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized by human beings.</v>

903
00:50:11.531 --> 00:50:12.364
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're two years old and you're </v>

904
00:50:15.371 --> 00:50:16.204
<v Speaker 1>crawling around on the floor and the dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a bone and you grab it and the dog </v>

905
00:50:18.701 --> 00:50:21.040
<v Speaker 1>nips you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's informative.</v>

906
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:23.523
<v Speaker 1>And so what piaget claims is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>children come into the world with an </v>

907
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:32.981
<v Speaker 1>information seeking structure and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>as they interact with the world,</v>

908
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.240
<v Speaker 1>phenomena emerge that they can model </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their bodies.</v>

909
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to drink this,</v>

910
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.670
<v Speaker 1>then I'd have to model it with my hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I can do so.</v>

911
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

912
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this thing sitting here,</v>

913
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:53.660
<v Speaker 1>especially if I'm thirsty and I look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

914
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:57.110
<v Speaker 1>my eyes tell my hands to get ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grab it.</v>

915
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:59.960
<v Speaker 1>And so when you say you understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

916
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:02.563
<v Speaker 1>what you mean is that at least part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you mean is that when you perceive </v>

917
00:51:06.231 --> 00:51:08.540
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it maps itself onto your body.</v>

918
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:12.140
<v Speaker 1>And so this happens at pretty low levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your nervous system.</v>

919
00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:14.510
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are blind.</v>

920
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 1>They say they're blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't see anything.</v>

921
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.593
<v Speaker 1>But if you move your hands up like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you asked them to guess which hand </v>

922
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.373
<v Speaker 1>you're lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do it with almost a hundred </v>

923
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:29.750
<v Speaker 1>percent accuracy and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how the hell can that possibly be?</v>

924
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:30.583
<v Speaker 1>They were blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the reason that happens is because </v>

925
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 1>your eyes are detecting patterns in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

926
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Some of those patterns you perceive as </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious reality,</v>

927
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.333
<v Speaker 1>but other patterns you just mapped right</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto your spine or or onto your </v>

928
00:51:46.071 --> 00:51:46.904
<v Speaker 1>emotional system doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need the perception of the </v>

929
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:52.010
<v Speaker 1>object in order to have that activated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

930
00:51:52.011 --> 00:51:53.840
<v Speaker 1>you probably think there's the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it,</v>

931
00:51:53.841 --> 00:51:55.940
<v Speaker 1>you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you evaluate it and then you act.</v>

932
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:56.803
<v Speaker 1>It's like that isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very seldomly how it works part </v>

933
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.220
<v Speaker 1>because it's just too damn slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

934
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:06.190
<v Speaker 1>If you had to think about everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be running over pedestrians,</v>

935
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 1>no Onstar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

936
00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:09.200
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to react very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

937
00:52:09.201 --> 00:52:10.034
<v Speaker 1>And part of the way you do that is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>having your sensory systems map right </v>

938
00:52:13.881 --> 00:52:16.850
<v Speaker 1>onto your motor output systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

939
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 1>so piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

940
00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:26.763
<v Speaker 1>for Pha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the way that the personality </v>

941
00:52:28.451 --> 00:52:29.284
<v Speaker 1>emerges out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the doldrums of infancy is that </v>

942
00:52:31.421 --> 00:52:32.254
<v Speaker 1>the child encounters the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporates the information that they </v>

943
00:52:36.851 --> 00:52:39.460
<v Speaker 1>gather as a consequence of bumping up </v>
<v Speaker 1>against it.</v>

944
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:44.230
<v Speaker 1>And then they build themselves in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense from their bodies and the ability,</v>

945
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:46.720
<v Speaker 1>the abilities that they're practicing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their bodies,</v>

946
00:52:46.721 --> 00:52:47.554
<v Speaker 1>like the gripping mechanism and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing mechanism and does scratching </v>

947
00:52:50.051 --> 00:52:51.970
<v Speaker 1>mechanism and all those things that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can build.</v>

948
00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:56.230
<v Speaker 1>They build those up to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can start to use abstractions.</v>

949
00:52:56.470 --> 00:53:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And so the baby sort of spirals out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere using it's exploratory capacity,</v>

950
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:04.750
<v Speaker 1>absorbing information from the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates its personality that way.</v>

951
00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a lovely marvel and we'll cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in some detail.</v>

952
00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.390
<v Speaker 1>The depths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>

953
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I concentrate primarily on young and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>

954
00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.420
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a personality course,</v>

955
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.433
<v Speaker 1>generally you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be introduced to Freud first and </v>

956
00:53:20.291 --> 00:53:21.490
<v Speaker 1>then you'll be introduced to young.</v>

957
00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:22.323
<v Speaker 1>And maybe I've learned some of the Neil </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday ideas more or less as after </v>

958
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:26.830
<v Speaker 1>thoughts to Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

959
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think that's appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

960
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I think you can make a strong case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ewm was,</v>

961
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:38.933
<v Speaker 1>that the utility of [inaudible] theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>is particularly evident when you're </v>

962
00:53:44.011 --> 00:53:47.370
<v Speaker 1>talking about radical similarities </v>
<v Speaker 1>between people.</v>

963
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 1>So young was very biologically oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways.</v>

964
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:53.543
<v Speaker 1>He was way ahead of biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrists and psychologists because </v>

965
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.760
<v Speaker 1>when young was beginning to formulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>his theories in the west,</v>

966
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.350
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in North America anyways,</v>

967
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:05.203
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the people who were studying </v>

968
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:09.444
<v Speaker 1>human beings where behaviorists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior is basically presumed that you </v>

969
00:54:11.761 --> 00:54:12.594
<v Speaker 1>are a blank slate at birth and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned how to do everything that you </v>

970
00:54:16.501 --> 00:54:18.330
<v Speaker 1>know how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

971
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.560
<v Speaker 1>that's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

972
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:26.100
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't learn everything that you know</v>

973
00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:26.934
<v Speaker 1>how to do because you have to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to start the whole process </v>

974
00:54:28.981 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

975
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

976
00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to learn really to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what a dog's grown means.</v>

977
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:36.503
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of wired into you and you </v>

978
00:54:37.861 --> 00:54:40.080
<v Speaker 1>already don't have to learn to be afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dark man.</v>

979
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 1>You've got that down by the time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were about three,</v>

980
00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:44.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of things that are built</v>

981
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:48.120
<v Speaker 1>right into people and and what exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means we are not sure about,</v>

982
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean it does look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example like snake phobia is,</v>

983
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.093
<v Speaker 1>is innate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if the actual phobia isn't an </v>

984
00:54:54.871 --> 00:54:57.960
<v Speaker 1>eight and it probably is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn to be phobic of snakes and</v>

985
00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:58.794
<v Speaker 1>no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like trying to become phobic of </v>

986
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.250
<v Speaker 1>pistols is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>

987
00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Now young was very interested in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what the best way to think about</v>

988
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:10.880
<v Speaker 1>it is the substrata of human cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

989
00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.440
<v Speaker 1>because human beings are a particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of thing.</v>

990
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.273
<v Speaker 1>It's not like our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our souls are disconnected from our </v>

991
00:55:17.761 --> 00:55:22.761
<v Speaker 1>bodies and that our knowledge is somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate or,</v>

992
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:28.560
<v Speaker 1>or universal in some way that would make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense if we didn't have bodies.</v>

993
00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 1>We're not like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in our bodies,</v>

994
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:36.730
<v Speaker 1>our brains are adapted to our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our minds are adapted to our bodies.</v>

995
00:55:36.731 --> 00:55:37.564
<v Speaker 1>It's so as our knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that our cognitive </v>

996
00:55:41.161 --> 00:55:41.994
<v Speaker 1>abilities are theories of the world have</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological substructures and those are </v>

997
00:55:47.431 --> 00:55:50.850
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions in some sense for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars that we don't have to learn.</v>

998
00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:52.381
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

999
00:55:52.381 --> 00:55:54.570
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have to learn that </v>
<v Speaker 1>being punched hers.</v>

1000
00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:58.800
<v Speaker 1>You just discover that you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to learn what a smile means.</v>

1001
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.930
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have to learn what </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger means,</v>

1002
00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:02.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll experience it.</v>

1003
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:04.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's right in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you,</v>

1004
00:56:04.531 --> 00:56:06.300
<v Speaker 1>aren't you like little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little babies.</v>

1005
00:56:06.301 --> 00:56:08.550
<v Speaker 1>When they're crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often angry.</v>

1006
00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:09.413
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by nine months of age or baby can more </v>

1007
00:56:11.611 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 1>or less</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify its mother.</v>

1008
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:20.190
<v Speaker 1>So someone walks into the baby's room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it takes a look at the baby and it's</v>

1009
00:56:20.191 --> 00:56:21.024
<v Speaker 1>not the baby's mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the baby starts crying and you </v>

1010
00:56:22.501 --> 00:56:23.500
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh baby.</v>

1011
00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

1012
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:28.000
<v Speaker 1>That baby is not sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That baby is angry.</v>

1013
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell if you look at the baby</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's turning all red.</v>

1014
00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's what people do when they cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're angry.</v>

1015
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a good thing to know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're arguing with someone and they get</v>

1016
00:56:37.121 --> 00:56:38.830
<v Speaker 1>upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they start to cry.</v>

1017
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1018
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 1>the poor person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then if you look,</v>

1019
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that they're all red and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means they'd like to strangle you,</v>

1020
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:46.390
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1021
00:56:46.391 --> 00:56:49.120
<v Speaker 1>they're social niceties is hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>preventing them.</v>

1022
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:50.343
<v Speaker 1>So that can certainly change your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude towards whether or not you </v>

1023
00:56:52.391 --> 00:56:54.580
<v Speaker 1>should be feeling sorry for them when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you hurt their feelings.</v>

1024
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:55.843
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's all sorts of things that are </v>

1025
00:56:57.821 --> 00:57:01.210
<v Speaker 1>universal about human beings and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>human was very,</v>

1026
00:57:01.211 --> 00:57:02.044
<v Speaker 1>very interested in what those universals</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and how they played out in patterns </v>

1027
00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:08.350
<v Speaker 1>of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine,</v>

1028
00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.450
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>instinct,</v>

1029
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:14.920
<v Speaker 1>say like anger and thinking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1030
00:57:14.921 --> 00:57:17.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like a cross section that person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>

1031
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.333
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine the facial </v>

1032
00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:20.280
<v Speaker 1>configuration that would go along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1033
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.710
<v Speaker 1>But in a more sophisticated way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want it to represent anger,</v>

1034
00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:27.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe you've represented like a drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a story you know began.</v>

1035
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.160
<v Speaker 1>That's actually what you want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone gets angry,</v>

1036
00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:33.580
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1037
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:35.283
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you took a thousand stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>about angry people and you boiled them </v>

1038
00:57:39.161 --> 00:57:43.150
<v Speaker 1>all into one story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that everything that was common about</v>

1039
00:57:43.151 --> 00:57:46.660
<v Speaker 1>all the stories about anger when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>capsulated in a single story,</v>

1040
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.273
<v Speaker 1>well that would be the architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of anger and everyone would </v>

1041
00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:51.874
<v Speaker 1>recognize it because it's like anger </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented like a movie in some sense </v>

1042
00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.110
<v Speaker 1>in its purest form.</v>

1043
00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:57.423
<v Speaker 1>Well that's an archetype and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing that human was </v>

1044
00:57:59.261 --> 00:58:02.260
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding and document.</v>

1045
00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:03.453
<v Speaker 1>And it's a tremendous amount of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we'll do is I'm </v>

1046
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:08.230
<v Speaker 1>going to show you some movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the lion king,</v>

1047
00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:09.064
<v Speaker 1>at least parts of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to show you how the </v>

1048
00:58:11.051 --> 00:58:14.650
<v Speaker 1>archetypal structure manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really worth knowing.</v>

1049
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.753
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a pain because then from </v>
<v Speaker 1>now on you go to movies and you'll </v>

1050
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:18.490
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well no,</v>

1051
00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:21.970
<v Speaker 1>that's that architectural structure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what that symbol means and you'll</v>

1052
00:58:21.971 --> 00:58:26.680
<v Speaker 1>really be annoying to your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's very entertaining and it's very</v>

1053
00:58:26.681 --> 00:58:27.514
<v Speaker 1>illuminating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly because what's really cool </v>

1054
00:58:29.561 --> 00:58:33.070
<v Speaker 1>about these archetypal story structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that not only they do,</v>

1055
00:58:33.071 --> 00:58:33.904
<v Speaker 1>they tell you who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they tell you in some sense who you </v>

1056
00:58:35.981 --> 00:58:36.814
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's cool because one of the </v>

1057
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:39.484
<v Speaker 1>things that modern people have a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with is trying to understand </v>

1058
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:44.110
<v Speaker 1>whether or not life has any meaning.</v>

1059
00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look at the world from the scientific</v>

1060
00:58:46.631 --> 00:58:48.070
<v Speaker 1>perspective and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1061
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.960
<v Speaker 1>it appears that all of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.033
<v Speaker 1>without meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean anything in any cosmic </v>

1063
00:58:52.901 --> 00:58:53.530
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1064
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:57.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty dope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dopey conclusion as far as I'm concerned</v>

1065
00:58:57.191 --> 00:58:58.024
<v Speaker 1>because the originators of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific method excluded subjective </v>

1066
00:59:02.321 --> 00:59:05.290
<v Speaker 1>meaning from the doctrine and at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outset.</v>

1067
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:06.401
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1068
00:59:06.401 --> 00:59:08.320
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the world scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

1069
00:59:08.321 --> 00:59:09.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's without subjective meaning,</v>

1070
00:59:09.851 --> 00:59:10.331
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1071
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:11.164
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously because science was set up so </v>

1072
00:59:13.871 --> 00:59:16.660
<v Speaker 1>that all of the subjected meeting would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be stripped away from the phenomenon.</v>

1073
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.741
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1074
00:59:17.741 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not something to be really shocked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about afterwards.</v>

1075
00:59:20.081 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 1>And it also doesn't mean that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>such thing as subjective.</v>

1076
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:23.954
<v Speaker 1>Meaning it just means that it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get a grip on it from a </v>

1077
00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:27.374
<v Speaker 1>purely scientific perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the lovely things about </v>

1078
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:30.524
<v Speaker 1>architectural stories is they tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's universally believable </v>

1079
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:37.453
<v Speaker 1>who you are.</v>

1080
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's very cool.</v>

1081
00:59:40.101 --> 00:59:40.934
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think you could learn this </v>

1082
00:59:42.021 --> 00:59:44.330
<v Speaker 1>in university too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just tears me up.</v>

1083
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:45.164
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn implicitly or explicitly and </v>

1084
00:59:48.231 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 1>almost all of the fields of study that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to undertake,</v>

1085
00:59:50.991 --> 00:59:51.824
<v Speaker 1>especially on the humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that moral gravity is relative and </v>

1086
00:59:55.401 --> 00:59:56.234
<v Speaker 1>that there's no ultimate meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really rotten thing to be </v>

1087
00:59:58.971 --> 01:00:01.100
<v Speaker 1>teaching people of your age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1088
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:04.060
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too damn young to be nihilistic.</v>

1089
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:04.903
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be nihilistic when you're 85 </v>

1090
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you're all done by them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to be nihilistic now that's a bloody</v>

1091
01:00:09.771 --> 01:00:11.360
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1092
01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's completely pointless because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of the notion that things are</v>

1093
01:00:16.101 --> 01:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>meaningless in some ultimate sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1094
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:24.050
<v Speaker 1>it's an extraordinarily primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical theory.</v>

1095
01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And it does not serve people well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes them sick.</v>

1096
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:29.803
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider that is that if you're stupid </v>

1097
01:00:32.601 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 1>theory makes you sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something wrong with it.</v>

1098
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.720
<v Speaker 1>It might be a criteria for the utility </v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps even the truth of the theory,</v>

1099
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:42.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you think about these </v>

1100
01:00:45.111 --> 01:00:45.861
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1101
01:00:45.861 --> 01:00:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1102
01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.760
<v Speaker 1>if a truth makes you sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean it's any less than the</v>

1103
01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe,</v>

1104
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe it really does mean that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

1105
01:00:53.481 --> 01:00:54.314
<v Speaker 1>much less of a truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends to some degree on what you </v>

1106
01:00:56.811 --> 01:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>mean by truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1107
01:00:59.331 --> 01:01:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Young's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1108
01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very useful for that.</v>

1109
01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.120
<v Speaker 1>He's a terrifying thinker really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

1110
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:07.663
<v Speaker 1>I read when I was about 23 or 24 I spent</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years and I read pretty much </v>

1111
01:01:11.421 --> 01:01:12.254
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wrote about 23 volumes and it just </v>

1112
01:01:15.591 --> 01:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>blew me into bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea what the hell was going on</v>

1113
01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>in my dreams changed really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>

1114
01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:22.423
<v Speaker 1>really rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading each at the same time and </v>

1115
01:01:24.111 --> 01:01:24.944
<v Speaker 1>he's just about as bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Nicha Sedi philosophize with a </v>

1116
01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1117
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.983
<v Speaker 1>And that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless he's taking a hammer to your </v>

1118
01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>skull and that's not nearly so pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1119
01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:35.084
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1120
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>he's a completely different sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>

1121
01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:38.114
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>you never really learned about them in </v>

1122
01:01:39.681 --> 01:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1123
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.313
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand and he looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird and if you do understand them a </v>

1124
01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:45.224
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's terrifying and you're bloody well </v>

1125
01:01:46.441 --> 01:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll thank God.</v>

1126
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:49.131
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

1127
01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really need to know that.</v>

1128
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>

1129
01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Freud tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice whipping boy for a psychologist's,</v>

1130
01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.733
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I also think is pretty pathetic </v>

1131
01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>because it's in gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ungrateful could begin with,</v>

1132
01:02:03.381 --> 01:02:04.214
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud was really the person who </v>

1133
01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>formalized the idea of the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1134
01:02:08.001 --> 01:02:11.360
<v Speaker 1>now everyone takes that for granted that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cognitive unconscious.</v>

1135
01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what the psychologist discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>in what the 1980s.</v>

1136
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a cognitive unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1137
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good work guys.</v>

1138
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:20.670
<v Speaker 1>They'd figured that out back in 1910.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1139
01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see credit being given to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud for making that sort of discovery.</v>

1140
01:02:25.021 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>If you look at experimental psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think,</v>

1141
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really ungrateful.</v>

1142
01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:31.323
<v Speaker 1>Freud's a strange guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take issue with especially the </v>

1143
01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>details of his theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't like the eatable complex for</v>

1144
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or penis envy,</v>

1145
01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:41.094
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it all in some ways they seem </v>

1146
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>laughably anachronistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1147
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.573
<v Speaker 1>sometimes someone can be wrong in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>details and right in the overall </v>

1148
01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>conception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1149
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>because theories are multilayered </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1150
01:02:56.461 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes I read a student essay,</v>

1151
01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1152
01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:01.890
<v Speaker 1>the pear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentences are just awful.</v>

1153
01:03:01.891 --> 01:03:02.724
<v Speaker 1>This person like on God only knows where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they learn to write probably in a high </v>

1154
01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>school somewhere and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1155
01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:12.000
<v Speaker 1>it's incomprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you read the whole thing,</v>

1156
01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:12.570
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1157
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>there's an idea in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1158
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:16.410
<v Speaker 1>the person is smarter than their ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to write.</v>

1159
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

1160
01:03:18.271 --> 01:03:19.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't write worth a damn.</v>

1161
01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:20.634
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty smart and you've got some </v>

1162
01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:23.424
<v Speaker 1>ideas here that if you could articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a really high quality so you </v>

1163
01:03:27.091 --> 01:03:29.430
<v Speaker 1>can be wrong in the details and right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overall picture.</v>

1164
01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:33.510
<v Speaker 1>And Freud was like that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Freud is also unbeatable.</v>

1165
01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:34.723
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1166
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:42.510
<v Speaker 1>In relationship to familial pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from Freud's perspective,</v>

1167
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.393
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1168
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:49.063
<v Speaker 1>a fundamental task of the emerging human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being was to extricate themselves from </v>

1169
01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:55.590
<v Speaker 1>their family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>

1170
01:03:55.591 --> 01:03:57.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that such a problem?</v>

1171
01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a couple of reasons.</v>

1172
01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:01.710
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents take care of you.</v>

1173
01:04:01.711 --> 01:04:04.140
<v Speaker 1>So it was like maybe you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispense with that too early,</v>

1174
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:07.230
<v Speaker 1>especially if they really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really take care of you.</v>

1175
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's the double situation from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday of perspective.</v>

1176
01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:11.454
<v Speaker 1>It's like the atypical situation arises </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a parent or two parents </v>

1177
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:20.610
<v Speaker 1>who do so much for you that you're no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer able to do anything for yourself.</v>

1178
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.170
<v Speaker 1>And that is not a good situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily pathological.</v>

1179
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:29.610
<v Speaker 1>And there is nobody like Freud who lays </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the details of that pathology.</v>

1180
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to watch your movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumb.</v>

1181
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.320
<v Speaker 1>It's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very disturbing movie,</v>

1182
01:04:34.321 --> 01:04:35.154
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose is a trigger warning for</v>
<v Speaker 1>those of you who think you need trigger </v>

1183
01:04:37.411 --> 01:04:38.240
<v Speaker 1>warnings.</v>

1184
01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

1185
01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:40.194
<v Speaker 1>very distressing documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will show you freddy and </v>

1186
01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:43.344
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've never seen it unless you happen </v>

1187
01:04:46.711 --> 01:04:49.590
<v Speaker 1>to live in a thoroughly eatable family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1188
01:04:49.591 --> 01:04:53.310
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get through the whole outline.</v>

1189
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:54.383
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you very briefly what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be required to do and then </v>

1190
01:04:56.461 --> 01:04:58.950
<v Speaker 1>we'll continue this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the next lecture.</v>

1191
01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:03.000
<v Speaker 1>So there's three exams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two midterms and a final.</v>

1192
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:05.310
<v Speaker 1>They're multiple choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1193
01:05:05.311 --> 01:05:06.144
<v Speaker 1>I'll post some of the questions before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the exam so that you know what you're </v>

1194
01:05:08.341 --> 01:05:09.174
<v Speaker 1>getting into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're particularly </v>

1195
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:12.930
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you will beg to differ.</v>

1196
01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.153
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's pressure on us this year to </v>

1197
01:05:15.301 --> 01:05:16.940
<v Speaker 1>curve the grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so beware.</v>

1198
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I may have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1199
01:05:18.431 --> 01:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Just in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know that,</v>

1200
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:21.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to write an essay,</v>

1201
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.030
<v Speaker 1>750 words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a very long essay,</v>

1202
01:05:25.031 --> 01:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>but that makes it actually more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

1203
01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>The signup for the topics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the essay or on the website,</v>

1204
01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.393
<v Speaker 1>you can just go there and sign up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 20 different topics and there's </v>

1205
01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:36.184
<v Speaker 1>15 slots for each topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would recommend that you do that </v>

1206
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>quite quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do a personality,</v>

1207
01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>self analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>7.5% of your grade.</v>

1208
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>The link to that is online too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get started on that whenever you</v>

1209
01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1210
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:53.320
<v Speaker 1>your ta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>

1211
01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:55.650
<v Speaker 1>that's Christine brophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's over there in the corner</v>

1212
01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:59.320
<v Speaker 1>patiently waiting for me to introduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

1213
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 1>She has office hours there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're posted online.</v>

1214
01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:05.520
<v Speaker 1>You can sign up for her office hours all</v>
<v Speaker 1>in line.</v>

1215
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:08.350
<v Speaker 1>You can also sign up for my office hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

1216
01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:10.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1217
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.630
<v Speaker 1>that's halfway through what the course </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be about.</v>

1218
01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:15.520
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see you on Thursday.</v>
