1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.343
<v Speaker 1>Apologies for my prolonged absence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been dealing over the last few </v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>weeks with my somewhat shaky current </v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It seems probable that I could use a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest if I had the opportunity and I knew</v>

4
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>how I should probably be having a rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.233
<v Speaker 1>but be that as it may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have prepared this letter </v>

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.533
<v Speaker 1>presumptuously to the world or at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that corner of it with which I can </v>

7
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:30.471
<v Speaker 1>communicate here at the dawn of the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Year in these perilous times,</v>

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>although I usually speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>extemporaneously.</v>

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>That takes a level of capacity that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot quite currently manifest,</v>

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to read instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a careful argument,</v>

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.843
<v Speaker 1>I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it required the editing for which </v>

12
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>only the written word can suffice.</v>

13
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Dear world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On January 16th,</v>

14
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk with Sam Harris on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

15
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.823
<v Speaker 1>waking up with Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Harris is one of the so called new </v>

16
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which there are four,</v>

17
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>like the other three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Hitchens,</v>

18
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Dan Dennett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Richard Dawkins,</v>

19
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.863
<v Speaker 1>who by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted particularly to debate </v>

20
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.883
<v Speaker 1>Dr Harris is a smart guy and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not complaining that or will </v>

21
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:25.671
<v Speaker 1>encounter him instead of darkens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm preparing my arguments carefully,</v>

22
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.443
<v Speaker 1>although I have been doing so for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The specific ideas I'm going to share </v>

23
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:31.224
<v Speaker 1>with you today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're obsessing me from the moment I </v>

24
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:34.914
<v Speaker 1>woke up somewhat fitfully this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I dictated them to my son and then </v>

25
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:41.934
<v Speaker 1>edited them with his help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The central problem of human beings </v>

26
00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 1>isn't religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the new atheists insist,</v>

27
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 1>it's tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know this in part because chimps,</v>

28
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>our closest biological kin go to war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not religious,</v>

29
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>although they are tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tribalism also has a central problem and</v>

30
00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:09.004
<v Speaker 1>it's not competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite the tendency of competition to </v>

31
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:14.920
<v Speaker 1>produce at least temporarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>winners and losers.</v>

32
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.170
<v Speaker 1>The problem of tribalism is cooperation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because cooperation is what allows us to</v>

33
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:24.344
<v Speaker 1>exist is bounded groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A group by definition is a collective </v>

34
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.693
<v Speaker 1>cooperatively aiming at something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be aimed at nothing because </v>

35
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:35.660
<v Speaker 1>nothing cannot unite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only divides</v>

36
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.383
<v Speaker 1>thus attacks on collective purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of its tendency to produce </v>

37
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:43.130
<v Speaker 1>tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merely divide</v>

38
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.653
<v Speaker 1>the politics of identity which emerge </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the central purpose is criticized </v>

39
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.753
<v Speaker 1>to destructively inevitably produced the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation described in the story of the </v>

40
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Tower of Babel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone fragments into primitive tribes</v>

41
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>and speaks their own mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible language.</v>

42
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.570
<v Speaker 1>One alternative to fragmentation is of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

43
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.620
<v Speaker 1>union under a banner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a collective ideal cause or purpose.</v>

44
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.923
<v Speaker 1>The problem with uniting under a banner </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the postmodernist to push identity </v>

45
00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:22.730
<v Speaker 1>politics rightly pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that to value something means similar</v>

46
00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:23.564
<v Speaker 1>caneously to devalue other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thus to value isn't exclusionary </v>

47
00:03:29.031 --> 00:03:34.031
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the alternative is valueless snus,</v>

48
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.083
<v Speaker 1>which is equivalent denialism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism does not produce freedom from </v>

49
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:41.794
<v Speaker 1>exclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes everyone excluded and </v>

50
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>that's an intolerable state </v>
<v Speaker 1>directionless,</v>

51
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>uncertain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic,</v>

52
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:55.051
<v Speaker 1>and angst ridden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When such uncertainty reaches a critical</v>

53
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the counter response appears first,</v>

54
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.243
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the collectively expressed </v>

55
00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>demand for a leader possessed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of totalitarian,</v>

56
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>certainty who promises above all to </v>
<v Speaker 1>restore order.</v>

57
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>The society without a unifying principle</v>
<v Speaker 1>oscillates unmoored between nihilism and</v>

58
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:18.064
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings have been wrestling with </v>

59
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:21.844
<v Speaker 1>this problem since the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization when our capacity to form </v>

60
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:25.864
<v Speaker 1>large groups for all its advantages also</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to pose a new threat that the </v>

61
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>hyper domination of the state collective</v>
<v Speaker 1>or purpose,</v>

62
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.553
<v Speaker 1>but without the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just fragmentation into smaller </v>

63
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:38.014
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The group itself cannot be done away </v>

64
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>with because for better or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are social animals,</v>

65
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>not loners like sharks are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tigers were team players,</v>

66
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.243
<v Speaker 1>but being on one team means not being on</v>
<v Speaker 1>others just means that any given team </v>

67
00:04:55.031 --> 00:05:00.031
<v Speaker 1>sidelines marginalizes and alienates </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who cannot play their game as well</v>

68
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>as conflicting with other teams in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>

69
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Starting in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years ago,</v>

70
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.993
<v Speaker 1>a new idea began to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evolve is not too strong a word in the </v>

71
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 1>collective imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might following,</v>

72
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 1>darkens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider this a meme,</v>

73
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.030
<v Speaker 1>although this is far too weak a word</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes idea it.</v>

74
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.993
<v Speaker 1>Development can be traced back through </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt and Mesopotamia before </v>

75
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:29.761
<v Speaker 1>disappearing into unwritten history is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that of the divine individual.</v>

76
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.023
<v Speaker 1>Just beyond old work of the imagination </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a dramatic presentation of an </v>

77
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:41.640
<v Speaker 1>emergent idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the solution to how to organize</v>

78
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:44.580
<v Speaker 1>social being without falling prey to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic,</v>

79
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:48.150
<v Speaker 1>divisiveness or deceitful totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty.</v>

80
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.970
<v Speaker 1>The group must unite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but under the banner of the individual,</v>

81
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.493
<v Speaker 1>the individual is the source of new </v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom that updates the antiquated </v>

82
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic or totalitarian detritus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>glory of the past.</v>

83
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.173
<v Speaker 1>For better or for worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea reaches its apogee and </v>

84
00:06:12.631 --> 00:06:13.464
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The divine individual is masculine </v>

85
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.753
<v Speaker 1>because the feminine is not individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The divine feminine is instead mother </v>

86
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:26.920
<v Speaker 1>and child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

87
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.023
<v Speaker 1>it is a hallmark of Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposition that the redemption of both </v>

88
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:31.744
<v Speaker 1>men and women come through the masculine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because the masculine is the </v>

89
00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:36.444
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The central realization express </v>

90
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.734
<v Speaker 1>dramatically and symbolically is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the subordination of the group to the </v>

91
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:47.474
<v Speaker 1>ideal of the divine individual is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to the paradox of nihilism and </v>

92
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:52.694
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The divine individual is the man that </v>

93
00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:02.501
<v Speaker 1>every man admires and the man whom all </v>
<v Speaker 1>women want their men to be.</v>

94
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.803
<v Speaker 1>The divine individual is the ideal firm </v>
<v Speaker 1>which deviations are punished by the </v>

95
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:10.334
<v Speaker 1>group with contempt and disgrace and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fidelity to which is rewarded by the </v>

96
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:15.074
<v Speaker 1>group with attention and honor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The divine individual is not the winter </v>

97
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:20.194
<v Speaker 1>of any individual game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the player who plays fairly and is </v>

98
00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Speaker 1>there for continually invited to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The divine individual is the builder,</v>

99
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.240
<v Speaker 1>maintainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and expander of the state.</v>

100
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.900
<v Speaker 1>He who boldly goes where no man has gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>before and someone who eternally watches</v>

101
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:38.590
<v Speaker 1>over the widows and the children</v>

102
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.640
<v Speaker 1>is power of direct and honest </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication is that which identifies,</v>

103
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.683
<v Speaker 1>discusses and then resolves the </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually emergent problems of human </v>

104
00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:50.364
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is for this reason that he is </v>

105
00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:53.844
<v Speaker 1>regarded as the savior of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The primary image for women is not the </v>

106
00:08:01.771 --> 00:08:04.770
<v Speaker 1>divine individual because of the heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>burden they bear.</v>

107
00:08:04.771 --> 00:08:05.604
<v Speaker 1>For reproduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is instead the divine mother and </v>

108
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:09.414
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not to say that man is the </v>

109
00:08:12.331 --> 00:08:13.164
<v Speaker 1>divine individual and woman is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although such confusion is </v>

110
00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:18.630
<v Speaker 1>understandable given the complexity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

111
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:20.863
<v Speaker 1>Men like women have the divine mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>and child as an element of their </v>

112
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>personality in man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

113
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>it's in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

114
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 1>as the divine individuals in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background of the psyche for women,</v>

115
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.000
<v Speaker 1>men by necessity play a less primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>role in the care of children.</v>

116
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.183
<v Speaker 1>This frees them to act as individuals in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a manner that up to now has been nearly </v>

117
00:08:44.971 --> 00:08:45.804
<v Speaker 1>impossible for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Identification with these images is </v>

118
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 1>belief in belief is not the statement of</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement with a set of facts,</v>

119
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 1>but the willingness to act something </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

120
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>to become something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stake your life on something</v>

121
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.523
<v Speaker 1>for men and women alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means voluntary adoption of </v>

122
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

123
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:16.050
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for oneself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and state.</v>

124
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.410
<v Speaker 1>It's in that responsibility and not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reits.</v>

125
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.460
<v Speaker 1>That meaning itself resides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning that makes life bearable.</v>

126
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.893
<v Speaker 1>Societies that refuse to honor both of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these elements therefore doom their </v>

127
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants to purposelessness </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappiness,</v>

128
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 1>sterility and the aforementioned dangers</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nihilistic,</v>

129
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.920
<v Speaker 1>divisible and deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive totalitarian,</v>

130
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:47.754
<v Speaker 1>certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The meaning and responsibility is the </v>

131
00:09:52.161 --> 00:09:52.994
<v Speaker 1>necessary meaning in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can serve as a counterbalance to </v>

132
00:09:57.191 --> 00:09:58.024
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible fragility and tenuousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People must unite under the banner not </v>

133
00:10:04.091 --> 00:10:08.020
<v Speaker 1>of their group and not of nothingness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the individual.</v>

134
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.393
<v Speaker 1>This is a brilliant and intrinsically </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical solution to the problems of </v>

135
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:20.481
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic nothingness and too rigid </v>
<v Speaker 1>group identity alike.</v>

136
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.473
<v Speaker 1>It's the consciousness of the individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>which transforms the chaos of potential </v>

137
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:30.853
<v Speaker 1>into habitable cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has the greatest origin stories </v>

138
00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:35.174
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly insist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is that same consciousness which </v>

139
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:40.194
<v Speaker 1>stands up rebellious and revelatory to </v>
<v Speaker 1>break down the pathological and too </v>

140
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 1>rigid order of that cosmos when it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>become old,</v>

141
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.100
<v Speaker 1>infirm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>willfully blind and corrupt.</v>

142
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.050
<v Speaker 1>It is that consciousness which is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of God.</v>

143
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.870
<v Speaker 1>It dwells within every embodied human </v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

144
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.483
<v Speaker 1>The fact of its existence is the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the law of the land itself must be </v>

145
00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:13.970
<v Speaker 1>bound by ultimate respect for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual regardless of his or her sins</v>

146
00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:14.870
<v Speaker 1>and crimes.</v>

147
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.943
<v Speaker 1>It is that consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the objective material substrate of </v>

148
00:11:21.311 --> 00:11:24.310
<v Speaker 1>being which should be regarded as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate reality.</v>

149
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.223
<v Speaker 1>There is no self evident reason why dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>mattered should be given ontological </v>

150
00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:30.004
<v Speaker 1>primacy over living spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although doing so as produced a massive </v>

151
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:36.354
<v Speaker 1>increase in human technological power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has left that power in the hands of </v>

152
00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:45.561
<v Speaker 1>an increasingly disenchanted populous </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that presents a mortal danger.</v>

153
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.213
<v Speaker 1>Such power must be wielded by those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have truly and voluntarily accepted the </v>

154
00:11:53.111 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of being less to prove </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatal.</v>

155
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.793
<v Speaker 1>The West has long been the civilized </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of the idea of the divine </v>

156
00:12:05.161 --> 00:12:10.161
<v Speaker 1>individual who does exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the voluntary lifting of the</v>

157
00:12:11.271 --> 00:12:14.060
<v Speaker 1>cross of suffering symbolically </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents.</v>

158
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.653
<v Speaker 1>For all its faults which are manifold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the West has therefore served as a </v>

159
00:12:21.591 --> 00:12:22.424
<v Speaker 1>shining beacon of hope</v>
<v Speaker 1>to those destined to inhabit places too </v>

160
00:12:29.191 --> 00:12:33.360
<v Speaker 1>chaotic or too rigid for the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit to tolerate,</v>

161
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.070
<v Speaker 1>but the West is in grave danger of </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing its way.</v>

162
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.430
<v Speaker 1>The negative consequences of this can </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly be overstated.</v>

163
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.040
<v Speaker 1>A close reading of 20th century history </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates as nothing else can,</v>

164
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 1>the horrors that accompany</v>
<v Speaker 1>loss of faith in the idea</v>

165
00:12:55.070 --> 00:13:00.070
<v Speaker 1>of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is only the individual.</v>

166
00:13:00.111 --> 00:13:02.180
<v Speaker 1>After all who suffers,</v>

167
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:09.350
<v Speaker 1>the group does not suffer</v>
<v Speaker 1>only those who compose it.</v>

168
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.550
<v Speaker 1>That's the reality of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>must be regarded as primary.</v>

169
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:36.020
<v Speaker 1>If suffering is to be regarded seriously</v>
<v Speaker 1>without such regard,</v>

170
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.890
<v Speaker 1>there can be no motivation to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and therefore no respites.</v>

171
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.373
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the production of individual suffering </v>

172
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 1>can and has</v>
<v Speaker 1>and will be again,</v>

173
00:13:56.781 --> 00:14:01.781
<v Speaker 1>rationalized and justified for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly benefits for the future,</v>

174
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.353
<v Speaker 1>and the group</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective birth control has emerged as </v>

175
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>one of the consequences of our powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological materialism.</v>

176
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.613
<v Speaker 1>This has been accompanied by the rise of</v>
<v Speaker 1>states efficiently civilized so that </v>

177
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 1>women who inhabit them can walk the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets,</v>

178
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:30.694
<v Speaker 1>unaccompanied in safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do not yet know how to balance the </v>

179
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:35.104
<v Speaker 1>opportunities provided for expanded </v>
<v Speaker 1>female individuality with the eternal </v>

180
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.240
<v Speaker 1>necessity for a woman to serve as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother of the divine individual.</v>

181
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:44.523
<v Speaker 1>Dividing our civilization into polarized</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological camps of female group </v>

182
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 1>identity and male group identity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not the answer.</v>

183
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.533
<v Speaker 1>We have to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male and female alike about what we </v>

184
00:14:57.031 --> 00:15:00.480
<v Speaker 1>really want as individuals and talk it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

185
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.793
<v Speaker 1>We know beyond dispute the societies who</v>
<v Speaker 1>emancipate their women are more </v>

186
00:15:04.681 --> 00:15:07.770
<v Speaker 1>productive and peaceful and that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is causal.</v>

187
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.813
<v Speaker 1>That's not a matter of if but how</v>
<v Speaker 1>but such immense amounts of patient </v>

188
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:17.684
<v Speaker 1>places a dual burden on the now more </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous woman who is required to </v>

189
00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:22.814
<v Speaker 1>balance manifesting the potential of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual spirit within necessity of </v>

190
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:28.064
<v Speaker 1>desire to bear and rear the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of mankind to live with free </v>

191
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.390
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gain the advantages of their freedom and</v>

192
00:15:36.391 --> 00:15:37.224
<v Speaker 1>sophistication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man Must therefore bring their shadowed </v>

193
00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:41.634
<v Speaker 1>psychic identification with the divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and child into the light without </v>

194
00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:48.270
<v Speaker 1>losing their divine individuality in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

195
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.840
<v Speaker 1>They must consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily,</v>

196
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:52.883
<v Speaker 1>deliberately and strategically except </v>
<v Speaker 1>their responsibility for the </v>

197
00:15:56.851 --> 00:16:00.060
<v Speaker 1>relationship between autonomous female </v>
<v Speaker 1>companionship,</v>

198
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.500
<v Speaker 1>support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

199
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.980
<v Speaker 1>and the responsibility of producing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>next generation.</v>

200
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.833
<v Speaker 1>This means rejecting among other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>the misbegotten idea of casual sexual </v>

201
00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:16.821
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sex is either the impulsive,</v>

202
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.383
<v Speaker 1>short term gratification of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>domineering biological instinct or the </v>

203
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Union of two conscious spirits taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for what they are doing.</v>

204
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:30.323
<v Speaker 1>The former is simply not commensurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the demands of an advanced </v>

205
00:16:33.331 --> 00:16:34.164
<v Speaker 1>civilization which requires the adoption</v>
<v Speaker 1>of responsibility above all for its </v>

206
00:16:39.061 --> 00:16:40.800
<v Speaker 1>preservation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance,</v>

207
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:41.663
<v Speaker 1>and expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is for this reason that the </v>

208
00:16:44.911 --> 00:16:49.050
<v Speaker 1>sexualized interactions between young </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women in universities,</v>

209
00:16:49.051 --> 00:16:49.884
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are increasingly and inevitably falling </v>

210
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:57.200
<v Speaker 1>under the harsh and tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation of the state.</v>

211
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.760
<v Speaker 1>In the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are as well.</v>

212
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.253
<v Speaker 1>Shuttering are great cathedrals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was marvelous monumental </v>

213
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:09.694
<v Speaker 1>embodiments of the idea of the divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual on which our civilization is </v>

214
00:17:13.631 --> 00:17:14.464
<v Speaker 1>based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is no mirror practical material </v>

215
00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:20.104
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbolic and ideational process </v>

216
00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:29.271
<v Speaker 1>whose importance cannot be overstated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without that central idea,</v>

217
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:36.020
<v Speaker 1>we will dissolve and be lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is time for each of us to consciously</v>

218
00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:40.464
<v Speaker 1>realize what the great symbolic stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the past insist upon that we are all </v>

219
00:17:46.471 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 1>sons and daughters of the divine logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness itself,</v>

220
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.193
<v Speaker 1>bearers of it's light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we must act in accordance with </v>

221
00:17:56.301 --> 00:18:00.110
<v Speaker 1>that great central fact last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all hell break loose.</v>

222
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.340
<v Speaker 1>This means above all to tell the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to care for one another,</v>

223
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:08.863
<v Speaker 1>starting at the level of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>and proceeding from that out to the </v>

224
00:18:11.511 --> 00:18:15.170
<v Speaker 1>broader reaches of society itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alternative,</v>

225
00:18:15.171 --> 00:18:17.900
<v Speaker 1>as the same stories have always </v>
<v Speaker 1>insisted,</v>

226
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.813
<v Speaker 1>is the more permanent instantiation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the horror that we already saw manifest </v>

227
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:30.380
<v Speaker 1>in multiple forums in the last bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible century.</v>

228
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.400
<v Speaker 1>We need to wake up individual man and </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman alike and we need to do it now.</v>

229
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Each of us must take the world on her </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders</v>

230
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.153
<v Speaker 1>in so far as we're capable of that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopt individual responsibility for the </v>

231
00:18:54.761 --> 00:18:58.390
<v Speaker 1>horrors and suffering its existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>entails</v>

232
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:00.923
<v Speaker 1>in that we will find the meaning without</v>
<v Speaker 1>which life is merely the suffering that </v>

233
00:19:05.131 --> 00:19:10.131
<v Speaker 1>breeds first resentment and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire for vengeance and destruction.</v>

234
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:21.210
<v Speaker 1>We need to take responsibility instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of incessantly insisting on our rights.</v>

235
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.080
<v Speaker 1>We need to become adults instead of aged</v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

236
00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.860
<v Speaker 1>We need to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need justice and compassion,</v>

237
00:19:35.701 --> 00:19:36.534
<v Speaker 1>conjoined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not judgment in pity which crushing </v>

238
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:45.210
<v Speaker 1>devour</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in the coming year.</v>

239
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Plan to make yourself a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fix what you can and would fix.</v>

240
00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Start now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something right in front of you,</v>

241
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.010
<v Speaker 1>demanding repair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling out to your conscience.</v>

242
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.790
<v Speaker 1>If you would only attend to it for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrective efforts,</v>

243
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 1>however primitive they may yet be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start small.</v>

244
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.193
<v Speaker 1>Have you mastered the process?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can safely and competently expand </v>

245
00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:23.544
<v Speaker 1>your reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will then be able to fix bigger </v>

246
00:20:25.801 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 1>things instead of making them worse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arrogance of your ignorance.</v>

247
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.143
<v Speaker 1>If you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be less pointless and </v>

248
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:44.151
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary suffering in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For all its shortcomings and faults will</v>

249
00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:50.711
<v Speaker 1>be a better place</v>
<v Speaker 1>until we can imagine better than that.</v>

250
00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.230
<v Speaker 1>That's meaning and purpose enough.</v>

251
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Happy New Year and best wishes to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
