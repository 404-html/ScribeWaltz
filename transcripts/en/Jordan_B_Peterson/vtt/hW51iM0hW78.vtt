00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.613
<v Speaker 1>Hi everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a little air BNB in Manhattan a </v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.600
<v Speaker 1>few days before this event that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to talk to you about.</v>

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to talk to Jonathan Heit today,</v>

4
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>so that should be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:18.261
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to tell you about an event </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's coming up on November 11th call,</v>

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.160
<v Speaker 1>the stifling of free speech on </v>
<v Speaker 1>university campuses and it's going to be</v>

7
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:28.161
<v Speaker 1>held at the Canada Christian College,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is at 50 Jervais drive in Toronto.</v>

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>And it'll start at 1:00 PM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all put all that information.</v>

9
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:34.944
<v Speaker 1>In the description of the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about the state of </v>

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 1>free discussion on campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.993
<v Speaker 1>this event has actually mushrooms into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was far beyond its </v>

12
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>original borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

13
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was scheduled for August 22nd</v>

14
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>and had been canceled by Ryerson </v>
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

15
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you why that is as I go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this video.</v>

16
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.543
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you who's going to be </v>

17
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:01.344
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is actually organized by Ms </v>

18
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Serena Singh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a former social worker and a newly</v>

19
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>hatched political and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentator.</v>

20
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.913
<v Speaker 1>You can find out more about her and her </v>
<v Speaker 1>views and her work at a channel called </v>

21
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:15.954
<v Speaker 1>recovery social worker on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serena has served as a social worker in </v>

22
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:22.194
<v Speaker 1>the child welfare system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really rough place to work </v>

23
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years and has been disturbed deeply</v>

24
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>about the rising tide of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness in social work in particular</v>

25
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>because social work is a discipline </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been almost entirely corrupted by</v>

26
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by political correctness.</v>

27
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:37.944
<v Speaker 1>And so because of her concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she decided to speak out and also to </v>

28
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:43.764
<v Speaker 1>organize this event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's been very challenging as this </v>

29
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>is the first thing of this sort that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's done.</v>

30
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>So the panelists include doctor </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and doctor or an [inaudible]</v>

31
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>and myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you,</v>

32
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>most of you know about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Gad sad I s I presume some of you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about doctor Aminay as well.</v>

34
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Give you a little background information</v>
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

35
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.804
<v Speaker 1>So Dr Sad is a professor at Concordia </v>
<v Speaker 1>University in Montreal and host of the </v>

36
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Youtube Channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sad truth.</v>

37
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.520
<v Speaker 1>And he's the author of a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

38
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>They're consuming instinct and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary basis of consumption.</v>

39
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>And he's also served as the editor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary psychology and the business</v>

40
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctor [inaudible].</v>

41
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Doctor [inaudible] is at clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>

42
00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>a media consultant and a lecturer at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryerson University in Toronto.</v>

43
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>He's host of the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real reality.</v>

44
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I actually served on his Phd Defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>Committee a number of years ago,</v>

45
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>but a while back he invited me to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his class at Ryerson University.</v>

46
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:38.544
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that talk was recorded and was released </v>

47
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>as an incendiary discussion at Ryerson </v>
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

48
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.443
<v Speaker 1>It's garnered about 400,000 views on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube and I'll put a link to that in </v>

49
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:50.934
<v Speaker 1>the discussion as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are the three people that </v>

50
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>are going to be speaking at the panel as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as me.</v>

51
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.403
<v Speaker 1>The panel discussion was originally for </v>
<v Speaker 1>our August 22nd but was canceled by </v>

52
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:04.294
<v Speaker 1>Univer Ryerson University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the irony of that was not lost on us </v>

53
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:08.314
<v Speaker 1>because what that meant was that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a panel on the suppression of free </v>

54
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>speech at university campuses that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually canceled by a university.</v>

55
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's only,</v>

56
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just an example of all the odd </v>

57
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>things that have been happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere recently.</v>

58
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.783
<v Speaker 1>administrators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their quote prioritize safety unquote </v>

60
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:28.234
<v Speaker 1>over free speech in light of recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>events and they were referring to the </v>

61
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Charlottesville meeting and the tragedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that occurred there.</v>

62
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I guess they had their reasons to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

63
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.590
<v Speaker 1>The BBC covered the cancellation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.533
<v Speaker 1>and quoted the administrators who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the cancellation as </v>

65
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>follows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is often attention at universities</v>

66
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>resulting from our commitment to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place for free speech and our commitment</v>

67
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>to be a place that is civil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe and welcoming.</v>

68
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.123
<v Speaker 1>In light of recent events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryerson University is prioritizing </v>

69
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>campus safety said university </v>
<v Speaker 1>spokesperson,</v>

70
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Michael Forbes and an email Mr. Forbes </v>
<v Speaker 1>said a part time instructor had rented a</v>

71
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:05.224
<v Speaker 1>room on campus to host the event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after conducting a standard safety </v>

72
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:08.854
<v Speaker 1>review,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university decided that quote </v>

73
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Ryerson is not equipped to provide the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary level of public safety for the</v>

74
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>event to go forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.283
<v Speaker 1>you can make of that what you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that Ryerson who had agreed to </v>

76
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:21.544
<v Speaker 1>host the talk could have decided that </v>
<v Speaker 1>long before one or two days before the </v>

77
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in any case it was canceled.</v>

78
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.893
<v Speaker 1>We would have got about two or 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at the event if it would've gone </v>

79
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.094
<v Speaker 1>forward in Ryerson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was some organized opposition </v>

80
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.783
<v Speaker 1>to the event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically claimed that it was </v>

81
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:40.770
<v Speaker 1>being run by Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It neonazis a,</v>

82
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>that was actually what they posted on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their facebook site,</v>

83
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 1>although they took that down after it </v>
<v Speaker 1>became publicized at,</v>

84
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>that was the sort of symbolism that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were using to object to the event.</v>

85
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>And then in the aftermath of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful campaign to have Ryerson shut</v>

86
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:55.804
<v Speaker 1>it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which involve multiple phone calls to </v>

87
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:02.521
<v Speaker 1>the administrators and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They scheduled a post cancellation rally</v>

88
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>where about a hundred or so might've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been up to 200 people,</v>

89
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>came out at Ryerson and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a celebration party,</v>

90
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.873
<v Speaker 1>well waving around banners that </v>
<v Speaker 1>prominently displayed the hammer and </v>

91
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:17.314
<v Speaker 1>sickle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that gives you some idea of who is </v>

92
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 1>behind this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then later the same people shut down</v>

93
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:24.120
<v Speaker 1>a comedy event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.323
<v Speaker 1>which was entitled something </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximating a free speech comedy </v>

95
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

96
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>And that was rescheduled as well for </v>
<v Speaker 1>November 4th,</v>

97
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>which I think is two days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the sixth today.</v>

98
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they disrupted that as well.</v>

99
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.833
<v Speaker 1>So we expect some level of disruption at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the November 11th event and are </v>

100
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.453
<v Speaker 1>organizing security to minimize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that it will be either </v>

101
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.044
<v Speaker 1>disrupted or shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you never know what's going to </v>

102
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:52.390
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've sold about 950 tickets so far.</v>

103
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that happened recently,</v>

104
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:55.804
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is a good indication of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of opposition that we're going </v>

105
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>to be facing as that my neighborhood was</v>
<v Speaker 1>postered with uh,</v>

106
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>a number of posters claiming that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a risk to the,</v>

107
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.810
<v Speaker 1>to the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

108
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.803
<v Speaker 1>I think they were entitled a community </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety warning describing me as a well </v>

109
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>as a reprehensible person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And funnily enough,</v>

110
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.413
<v Speaker 1>the photograph they used with of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was actually one where I appear </v>

111
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>quite angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was taken from a free speech rally where</v>

112
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:27.254
<v Speaker 1>the same sort of people showed up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition and they took the microphone </v>

113
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>and shut down the PA system and blasted </v>
<v Speaker 1>white noise.</v>

114
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.583
<v Speaker 1>So in order to make myself heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to speak very loudly and that's </v>

115
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 1>the picture they took to indicate what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>public safety menace I am.</v>

116
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.583
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of people that are </v>

117
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>opposing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm encouraging you to buy tickets or</v>

118
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.443
<v Speaker 1>you can get them at Brown paper tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put the link in the video </v>

119
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:57.490
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

120
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.603
<v Speaker 1>I would also say though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're planning to come and your an </v>

121
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:04.244
<v Speaker 1>advocate for the sort of thing that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been doing and doctor [inaudible] and </v>

122
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.224
<v Speaker 1>doctor sad and Serena as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really would like to emphasize the </v>

123
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>necessary necessity for calm and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and detachment.</v>

124
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 1>And there's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the protesters are there,</v>

125
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.274
<v Speaker 1>I suspect there'll be quite provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't put it past them to plant </v>

126
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.830
<v Speaker 1>provocateurs in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the crowd to cause trouble.</v>

127
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.853
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing I want on any of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the panel want is for anybody to be </v>

128
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 1>hurt or for anything stupid to happen.</v>

129
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>disruptions are one thing and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly don't want them,</v>

131
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:45.164
<v Speaker 1>but we don't want anyone hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would like to implore all of you </v>

132
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 1>who are coming to support us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were,</v>

133
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:51.554
<v Speaker 1>who were just interested in this issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain your cool regardless of </v>

134
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:57.134
<v Speaker 1>level of provocation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably important because in </v>

135
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>the social media climate that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

136
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:09.130
<v Speaker 1>the misbehavior of any single individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>has ramifications that can echo far past</v>

137
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.063
<v Speaker 1>what would normally be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's of extreme importance for </v>

138
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:19.214
<v Speaker 1>everyone who's in favor of let's say </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech and in favor of supporting </v>

139
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.280
<v Speaker 1>the endeavors that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a number of people are,</v>

140
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.323
<v Speaker 1>are uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in to sure that free speech </v>

141
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:43.121
<v Speaker 1>remains a priority in our society and on</v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses that no one behaves badly.</v>

142
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

143
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>regardless of provocation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your damn cool,</v>

144
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.690
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's really important.</v>

145
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.643
<v Speaker 1>It's crucially important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have good security as far as I can </v>

146
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:55.514
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done our best to vet them and all of </v>

147
00:08:56.611 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

148
00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.813
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just isn't the time or place for </v>

149
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>anything untoward to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

150
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to invite you to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get tickets.</v>

151
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>As I said at Brown paper tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll post that.</v>

152
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 1>There's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the venue is somewhat expandable.</v>

153
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 1>So although we've sold approximately a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand tickets,</v>

154
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:19.674
<v Speaker 1>which is of course it's about five times</v>
<v Speaker 1>as many people as we would have </v>

155
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:22.884
<v Speaker 1>originally talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty funny too because you </v>

156
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:25.464
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another reason to maintain calm </v>

157
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 1>is just because the protesters show up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if they caused trouble,</v>

158
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.940
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that they're obtaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>any more than a local trivial victory.</v>

159
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medium term and long term </v>

160
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:40.104
<v Speaker 1>consequences of them shutting us down at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryerson is that we're going to talk to </v>

161
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 1>five times as many people at the Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian College.</v>

162
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 1>The reason we picked the Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian college just because,</v>

163
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all it was a large venue,</v>

164
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

165
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.713
<v Speaker 1>we believe that there they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who run the college would </v>

166
00:09:58.141 --> 00:09:58.974
<v Speaker 1>have enough courage to withstand </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure from activist types who mount </v>

167
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:06.570
<v Speaker 1>phone call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

168
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns to have this shutdown and that</v>

169
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:12.060
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't shut it down no matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

170
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's definitely proved to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

171
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:15.594
<v Speaker 1>So thank you very much to the people at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Canada Christian College for having </v>

172
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the courage to host this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To begin with.</v>

173
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 1>And also the courage not to shut it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

174
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 1>So I'm also going to link in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of this video,</v>

175
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.663
<v Speaker 1>a number of the news stories that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>published in Canada and to some degree </v>

176
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 1>internationally about the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>shutdown.</v>

177
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to invite you to come.</v>

178
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:43.610
<v Speaker 1>It should be an interesting event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Gad and Orrin are good speakers there.</v>

179
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Well-Informed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serena has a variety of very interesting</v>

180
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:49.170
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready for the panel discussion.</v>

181
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it could be an excellent event </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully it will go smoothly.</v>

182
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.413
<v Speaker 1>And even if it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully people will have enough sense </v>

183
00:10:57.781 --> 00:10:58.614
<v Speaker 1>to maintain their cool and react </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligently and not respond to </v>

184
00:11:02.581 --> 00:11:07.581
<v Speaker 1>provocation because that's the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward in this particular situation.</v>

185
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.373
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.220
<v Speaker 1>thanks very much.</v>
