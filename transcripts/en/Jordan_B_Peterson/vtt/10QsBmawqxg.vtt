1
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

2
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to answer them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is [inaudible] and I'm an editor</v>

3
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:23.864
<v Speaker 1>for a stout which is the largest Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 1>web luck in the world today and once </v>

4
00:00:27.591 --> 00:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>again joined by a man and no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs any introduction.</v>

5
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Dr Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing?</v>

6
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for sitting down with us again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice to see you again.</v>

7
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.813
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time we sat down for a talk in </v>

8
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>our studio in two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will be exactly one year ago.</v>

9
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.763
<v Speaker 1>And then with us and it was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you responded on video to the </v>

10
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 1>aftermath of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the getting human interview.</v>

11
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.843
<v Speaker 1>And we also did a discussion of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>distillation into five points of your </v>

12
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 1>philosophy for the people at home for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people watching.</v>

13
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.660
<v Speaker 1>You can find a link in the description </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to,</v>

14
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>if you want to check it out today.</v>

15
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I again want to do five things and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to run through it.</v>

16
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:04.074
<v Speaker 1>And before we start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do a year review of 2018 </v>

17
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.180
<v Speaker 1>in which I just want to hear how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look back on last year.</v>

18
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>What you've been through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

19
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.413
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the defining experiences and </v>

20
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.490
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to discuss how in </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics,</v>

21
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>a collective narrative substitutes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual experience,</v>

22
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.530
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to leave the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical world and go metaphysical.</v>

23
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.633
<v Speaker 1>We're going to discuss the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>gladiator and why it is so ingrained in </v>

24
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.650
<v Speaker 1>my generation psyche more so than any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other movie of it,</v>

25
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to discuss how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become sorry,</v>

26
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.253
<v Speaker 1>out to become something approximating </v>
<v Speaker 1>the male archetype or we don't to focus </v>

27
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>especially on the human notion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuation and delve into that.</v>

28
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 1>And five and final point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss the idea,</v>

29
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.533
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the artist is a portal </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the dream world and the </v>

30
00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>collective unconscious on one hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

31
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:01.424
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if we should reverse the order </v>

32
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:04.244
<v Speaker 1>of the fourth and fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So start with art and then </v>

33
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>individuation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

34
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noted.</v>

35
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that'll make a better flow.</v>

36
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do that.</v>

37
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without further ado,</v>

38
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:22.731
<v Speaker 1>let's delve into it year review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to do that.</v>

39
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018.</v>

40
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.293
<v Speaker 1>What were your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the defining experiences for </v>

41
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you look back on it?</v>

42
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>You visited over 100 cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One on.</v>

43
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't even name 100 cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's impressive.</v>

44
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.513
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did visit a couple of points so but I </v>

45
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:44.441
<v Speaker 2>think it was 115 lectures and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 cities.</v>

46
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 2>The defining features of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

47
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.043
<v Speaker 2>back in January,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when my book came out and it was </v>

48
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:54.824
<v Speaker 2>at that point that I started to </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoroughly realized that there was </v>

49
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:00.544
<v Speaker 2>enough of a market for what it was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about to risk </v>

50
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.330
<v Speaker 2>experimenting with large scale venues </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

51
00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:12.164
<v Speaker 2>I found that out</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of my experience to experience </v>

52
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.653
<v Speaker 2>this year before I had done a series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>biblical lectures on Genesis and I </v>

53
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:30.031
<v Speaker 2>rented a theater in Toronto more out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity than a good sense,</v>

54
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:35.161
<v Speaker 2>let's say to see if there might be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience for such a thing.</v>

55
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.560
<v Speaker 2>And the theater held about 500 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I get 50 lectures over the course of</v>

56
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:47.011
<v Speaker 2>a couple of months and every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sold out every time so that.</v>

57
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.833
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

58
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.843
<v Speaker 2>you might call that a data point was </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because it wasn't obvious </v>

59
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:55.894
<v Speaker 2>that a discussion of something as Arcane</v>
<v Speaker 2>and archaic and hypothetically outdated </v>

60
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.663
<v Speaker 2>as the book of Genesis would draw an </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience and the audience was also </v>

61
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:14.101
<v Speaker 2>primarily composed of the people who you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would least likely to come and attend to</v>

62
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:15.154
<v Speaker 2>such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was mostly men and they held </v>

63
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:18.724
<v Speaker 2>you in like a rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like plus when you entered stage </v>

64
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.461
<v Speaker 2>yet I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

65
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's a strange thing to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

66
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.343
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially in the context of the </v>

67
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:29.660
<v Speaker 2>discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

69
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 2>well then I went to London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've got the itinerary,</v>

70
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.573
<v Speaker 2>the timeline correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have mixed up except for a </v>

71
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:43.294
<v Speaker 2>couple of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I went to London to talk about the </v>

72
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 2>launch of my book because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>published their first and I think it was</v>

73
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 2>published on January 23rd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's almost a year behind us now as</v>

74
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the publishers,</v>

75
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:02.270
<v Speaker 2>they're wanting to arrange a public talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they first read it,</v>

76
00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:03.104
<v Speaker 2>that 300 seat auditorium theater and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sold out instantly and so they </v>

77
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>moved it to a thousand seats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

78
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 2>And then to a very large venue of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Apollo,</v>

79
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that was in January.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although as I said,</v>

80
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly certain that might have </v>
<v Speaker 2>followed my.</v>

81
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>

82
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.203
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was extremely interesting as </v>

83
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that went very well.</v>

84
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>

85
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.163
<v Speaker 2>After I came back from London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughter and I decided to try to do </v>

86
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.693
<v Speaker 2>the same thing in La at the orpheum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we contacted them and of course they </v>

87
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 2>were very skeptical and they had every </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to be because they didn't know who</v>

88
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I was and I wasn't represented by any </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization</v>

89
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.023
<v Speaker 2>or if you have sold out to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are all theaters of about 2,500 </v>

90
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 2>pasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're fairly large scale.</v>

91
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time,</v>

92
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 2>around the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly enough,</v>

93
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:17.861
<v Speaker 2>I was contacted by an organization in La</v>
<v Speaker 2>called CAA creative artists agency.</v>

94
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 2>And it's the largest,</v>

95
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.273
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

96
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 2>it's the largest agency of its type and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose the most prestigious,</v>

97
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I was negotiating with another one at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time or as an alternative,</v>

98
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 2>but they contacted me more or less out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the blue it said that they would like</v>

99
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 2>to represent me and they were associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with live nation,</v>

100
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:37.694
<v Speaker 2>which does theatrical bookings for </v>
<v Speaker 2>performers of all sorts all over the </v>

101
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so things just fell into place.</v>

102
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.973
<v Speaker 2>Christie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oddly enough,</v>

103
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 2>my daughter Mckenna pushed very hard for</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

104
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my enrollment with Ca.</v>

105
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 2>She thought after multiple conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them that they were very competent,</v>

106
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:58.004
<v Speaker 2>which they have turned out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so things just started to roll from </v>

107
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

108
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.953
<v Speaker 2>we hit major cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the major markets first in the United </v>

109
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that went very successfully.</v>

110
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:17.051
<v Speaker 2>And so we extended that to Canada and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then into smaller markets.</v>

111
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.050
<v Speaker 2>US and</v>
<v Speaker 2>115</v>

112
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 2>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about a hundred of them sold out</v>

113
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other ones did well sometimes those,</v>

114
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 2>we're in markets that I returned to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few months previously.</v>

115
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those are highlights.</v>

116
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:36.584
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highlight though really is the fact </v>

117
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:44.291
<v Speaker 2>that the lecture series has been so </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>

118
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the events are unbelievably causative.</v>

119
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.593
<v Speaker 2>They're not political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say they're fundamentally </v>

120
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:53.510
<v Speaker 2>psychological.</v>

121
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.130
<v Speaker 2>They concentrate on individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

122
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I speak about politics from time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

123
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 2>but more from a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

124
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:03.704
<v Speaker 2>outlining the temperamental reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 2>people might lean to the left or to the </v>

125
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:11.660
<v Speaker 2>right and emphasizing the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>both perspectives,</v>

126
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.523
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

127
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.663
<v Speaker 2>and the what med necessity of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging in continual dialogue in order </v>

128
00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:22.991
<v Speaker 2>to keep the ship of state sailing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sailing upright and,</v>

129
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.733
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and oriented towards the proper </v>

130
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:30.410
<v Speaker 2>destination and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else?</v>

131
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.244
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time it was still a </v>

132
00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:39.101
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of media attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often negative,</v>

133
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 2>sometimes positive.</v>

134
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.873
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

135
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.750
<v Speaker 2>a lot of contentious interviews with </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists.</v>

136
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly enough,</v>

137
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.590
<v Speaker 2>the more contentious interviews like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kathy Newman interview,</v>

138
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 2>but more recently an interview I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Gq</v>

139
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 2>tend to attract the most attention on </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube.</v>

140
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.113
<v Speaker 2>I'm also the most stressful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult of interviews and something </v>

141
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:06.504
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of my own psychological </v>

142
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 2>stability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should probably be somewhat avoided.</v>

143
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Takes me about three days to recover </v>
<v Speaker 2>from an interview like that,</v>

144
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 2>and then also the overwhelming success </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the book,</v>

145
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:20.874
<v Speaker 2>which has now been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have contracts in place to translate </v>

146
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 2>12 rules for life into 50 languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which pretty much does all the languages</v>

147
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 2>where there's reasonable publication </v>
<v Speaker 2>market and um,</v>

148
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.550
<v Speaker 2>it's so two and a half million copies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in hardcover trade paperback,</v>

149
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.873
<v Speaker 2>primarily hardcover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That also includes ebooks and kindle </v>

150
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:41.904
<v Speaker 2>downloads and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The English language world and maybe </v>

151
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:49.551
<v Speaker 2>another half a million in the countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>where translations have appeared.</v>

152
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.093
<v Speaker 2>Those so far I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a huge market for unpacking </v>

153
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 2>old stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

154
00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:00.990
<v Speaker 2>apparently there's a huge market and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge market.</v>

155
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:01.824
<v Speaker 2>More importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say for a discussion that </v>

156
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 2>centers on the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and meaning,</v>

157
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 2>which is also something that I'm working</v>
<v Speaker 2>on delineating in my next book,</v>

158
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:15.270
<v Speaker 2>which I'm writing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

159
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I was writing it just reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 2>a central chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chapter six,</v>

161
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:20.634
<v Speaker 2>which is called a notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That opportunity lurks where </v>

162
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:25.584
<v Speaker 2>responsibility has been abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I noticed in the </v>

163
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:30.534
<v Speaker 2>lectures is that whenever I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between responsibility </v>

164
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 2>and meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lecture hall always goes dead silent</v>

165
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:40.803
<v Speaker 2>and that's very significant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because it's happened more </v>

166
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 2>than 100 times and I really be watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

167
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 2>So I read that most specifically that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a void in our culture,</v>

168
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.823
<v Speaker 2>I think produced by nonstop discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>of rights and privileges and that void </v>

169
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 2>has to do with the necessity for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterbalancing discussion,</v>

170
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:04.140
<v Speaker 2>which is a discussion of responsibility.</v>

171
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Thing is is the conservative people tend</v>
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

172
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.310
<v Speaker 2>market responsibility as duty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

173
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Sort of as should or should not often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should not sometimes should.</v>

174
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.623
<v Speaker 2>And that's perfectly reasonable because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have duties and they're necessary </v>

175
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.573
<v Speaker 2>because we're social creatures and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to engage in reciprocal </v>

176
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 2>interactions with others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it still misses the point.</v>

177
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 2>A point which has also missed by people </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the left who were always,</v>

178
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:38.094
<v Speaker 2>I would say collaborating about rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and who are entering hierarchical in </v>

179
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:43.794
<v Speaker 2>their fundamental orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the sustaining meaning that </v>

180
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:49.914
<v Speaker 2>people find in their lives is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of them adopting </v>

181
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.380
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

182
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.933
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that's very much worth </v>

183
00:11:59.111 --> 00:11:59.944
<v Speaker 2>deeply considered to be audience goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thailand because somehow it's encoded </v>

184
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:08.530
<v Speaker 2>into their psyche than if they adopt </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

185
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Something good happens to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they know.</v>

186
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely know what they ever </v>

187
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.823
<v Speaker 2>heard it articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's two things that people </v>

188
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:23.941
<v Speaker 2>usually tell me when they come up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another thing that's happened a</v>

189
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:26.700
<v Speaker 2>lot in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was just out yesterday,</v>

190
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.780
<v Speaker 2>walked down to the gym with my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about five blocks later.</v>

191
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:35.790
<v Speaker 2>So when I was probably stopped by 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>people or so on the street,</v>

192
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 minute period of time,</v>

193
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.163
<v Speaker 2>no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that happens pretty much wherever I </v>

194
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:44.704
<v Speaker 2>go now regardless of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also extremely interesting and </v>

195
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 2>a testament to the insane breach of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say youtube and podcasts.</v>

196
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 2>People always tell me one of two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:12:58.541 --> 00:12:59.374
<v Speaker 2>they say that they've been listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>my youtube lectures or watching them or </v>

198
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.723
<v Speaker 2>podcasts or reading the book and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been useful to them in terms of </v>

199
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:11.524
<v Speaker 2>finding direction and purpose and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>affirmation even though that's a word </v>

200
00:13:16.301 --> 00:13:17.134
<v Speaker 2>that should be used very cautiously now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's sort of being mouth to </v>

201
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:22.210
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a strength,</v>

202
00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:25.960
<v Speaker 2>let's say an encouragement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those was a better words or they tell me</v>

203
00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:26.794
<v Speaker 2>that it found words to describe things </v>
<v Speaker 2>they always knew to be true but didn't </v>

204
00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:34.150
<v Speaker 2>know how to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is also extremely useful for people</v>

205
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:34.993
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps the fundamental purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual adventure and discourse on </v>

206
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 2>the humanities end of the distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

207
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:42.964
<v Speaker 2>To articulate truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient truths and to bring it up to </v>

208
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:50.500
<v Speaker 2>date and that's very useful for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and see.</v>

209
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 2>I kinda Kinda laid out a fairly standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument in some sense in the lectures.</v>

210
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.093
<v Speaker 2>The first a set of propositions and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to make them inviolable in some </v>

211
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 2>sense propositions that no one would </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with.</v>

212
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.580
<v Speaker 2>The first is that life is very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rife with suffering and contaminated</v>

213
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:15.780
<v Speaker 2>by malevolence at every level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's natural level.</v>

214
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the proclivity of nature to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill you,</v>

215
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 2>and there's social malevolence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual malevolence and um,</v>

216
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.020
<v Speaker 2>and that worsens the essential tragedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>of life.</v>

217
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.040
<v Speaker 2>And so the fundamental truth as </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious types have always had this,</v>

218
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.013
<v Speaker 2>life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The consequences of that is that you </v>

219
00:14:38.771 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 2>need to sustaining meaning to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help you avoid bitterness.</v>

220
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.290
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

221
00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:48.730
<v Speaker 2>where is that sustaining meaning to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>found?</v>

222
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 2>If it can be found at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that seems</v>

223
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.023
<v Speaker 4>to be not in rights and privileges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sending pulse of freedom and </v>

224
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 4>instantaneous gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not In any of that,</v>

225
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:00.644
<v Speaker 4>but in the adoption of responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the appalling conditions of the </v>

226
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:06.134
<v Speaker 4>world at all of those levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the determination to do </v>

227
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 4>something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I do believe that people,</v>

228
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.280
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you tell people that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand it,</v>

229
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.890
<v Speaker 4>and it's partly because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

230
00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:21.724
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I speak to people about who they </v>

231
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:27.731
<v Speaker 4>spontaneously admired because aberration</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the instinct for imitation.</v>

232
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.240
<v Speaker 4>Let's at the themes in gladiator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

233
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

234
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.223
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

235
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.153
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one,</v>

236
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.260
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the themes of leadership per</v>
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>

237
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:41.803
<v Speaker 4>Hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a leader is someone admirable and </v>

238
00:15:44.101 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 4>someone admirable is someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>follow to follow,</v>

239
00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:49.810
<v Speaker 4>is to imitate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imitate this,</v>

240
00:15:49.811 --> 00:15:50.644
<v Speaker 4>to practice a mode of being so that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can undertake that motive being </v>

241
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.270
<v Speaker 4>autonomously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

242
00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.770
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at who or what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>spontaneously admired,</v>

243
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 4>you could get some sense of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>constitutes that,</v>

244
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.113
<v Speaker 4>which is a value and it's inevitably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe inevitably the people who are </v>

245
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:12.284
<v Speaker 4>admired are people who take </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility and the more </v>

246
00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:18.580
<v Speaker 4>responsibility that they take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more admirable they become.</v>

247
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 4>And so I don't see how any of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is disputable in some fundamental sense.</v>

248
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's develop this further when we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to glare.</v>

249
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

250
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I wanted to ask you,</v>

251
00:16:32.711 --> 00:16:36.520
<v Speaker 1>you were quite recently actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are in a breitbart event and turning</v>

252
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.383
<v Speaker 1>point USA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I want to just ask you a straight </v>

253
00:16:39.461 --> 00:16:41.570
<v Speaker 1>question about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you?</v>

254
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Are you comfortable there?</v>

255
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't a Friday.</v>

256
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.890
<v Speaker 4>It was a turning point USA event and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was interviewed by Breitbart,</v>

257
00:16:49.891 --> 00:16:50.530
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

258
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a dual event.</v>

259
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.480
<v Speaker 1>It had both Breitbart and turning point </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

260
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.263
<v Speaker 1>on the posters.</v>

261
00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could be,</v>

262
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.620
<v Speaker 4>that could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not an indictment,</v>

263
00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:04.830
<v Speaker 4>but I just felt</v>
<v Speaker 4>comfortable there.</v>

264
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

265
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.650
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean no.</v>

266
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.000
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

267
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:11.543
<v Speaker 4>I find American political events,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I tend to view that to some degree </v>

268
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.880
<v Speaker 4>from the perspective of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>anthropologist.</v>

269
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.900
<v Speaker 4>The American political scene is very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very different than the Canadian</v>

270
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.413
<v Speaker 4>evangelical element to the American </v>
<v Speaker 4>political scene that's completely </v>

271
00:17:27.181 --> 00:17:30.590
<v Speaker 4>absent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>

272
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.820
<v Speaker 4>kind of a circus element and being </v>
<v Speaker 4>critical,</v>

273
00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:38.060
<v Speaker 4>like there's some real enthusiasm </v>
<v Speaker 4>nearby,</v>

274
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:39.263
<v Speaker 4>but you could really see like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Protestant revival isn't that </v>

275
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.680
<v Speaker 4>characterizes American political </v>
<v Speaker 4>discourse and I've seen that many of the</v>

276
00:17:46.681 --> 00:17:47.514
<v Speaker 4>larger scale American political </v>
<v Speaker 4>spectacles that peripherally or century </v>

277
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 4>involves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's strange and interesting.</v>

278
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:59.930
<v Speaker 4>But I wouldn't say it's a situation that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel particularly comfortable in.</v>

279
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.233
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any objection to speaking </v>

280
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:05.484
<v Speaker 4>in such events because I think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not I should speak at such a </v>

281
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:15.291
<v Speaker 4>dance is dependent to a large degree on </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is that I'm speaking about and I</v>

282
00:18:16.421 --> 00:18:20.070
<v Speaker 4>spoken twice to the turning point people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've outlined,</v>

283
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 4>well a lot of the themes that I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't run with you and you know,</v>

284
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:28.860
<v Speaker 4>I've encouraged them to act </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility,</v>

285
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.980
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a message that </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatives have that salable to young</v>

286
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:35.244
<v Speaker 4>people in a way that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hasn't been for maybe three </v>

287
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:39.684
<v Speaker 4>generations.</v>

288
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

289
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.943
<v Speaker 1>So I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that they're bad people </v>

290
00:18:43.851 --> 00:18:44.684
<v Speaker 1>you shooting per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should not be associated with the thing </v>

291
00:18:47.031 --> 00:18:50.870
<v Speaker 1>is mostly that those events are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically hypercharged.</v>

292
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

293
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.463
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

294
00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.440
<v Speaker 4>my participation serves as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a balance to that,</v>

295
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as something that brings it back down to</v>

296
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:08.541
<v Speaker 4>earth because I'm not talking to them as</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conservative Party activists,</v>

297
00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:12.980
<v Speaker 4>let's say I'm talking to them as </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals,</v>

298
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.440
<v Speaker 4>as people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as individuals.</v>

299
00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:16.580
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

300
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.550
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

301
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:19.763
<v Speaker 4>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at both turning point events that I've </v>

302
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:24.990
<v Speaker 4>attended,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I attempted to lay out the rationale for</v>

303
00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:25.824
<v Speaker 4>the left of center viewpoint and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>explain why that also has to be taken </v>

304
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:30.684
<v Speaker 4>into account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange thing in some sense that </v>

305
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:37.911
<v Speaker 4>they invite me because I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>partisan person in any,</v>

306
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.900
<v Speaker 4>in any fundamental sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've also been working quite extensively</v>

307
00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:47.901
<v Speaker 4>with the Democrats in one manner in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>US as well,</v>

308
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:48.744
<v Speaker 4>trying to help a group of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>attempting to pull the central party </v>

309
00:19:53.551 --> 00:19:55.890
<v Speaker 4>narrative away from the radical </v>
<v Speaker 4>leftists.</v>

310
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.823
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

311
00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.210
<v Speaker 1>So when it comes to party politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your main thesis that I always hear from</v>

312
00:20:01.211 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 1>you is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

313
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.500
<v Speaker 1>the openness of say the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivity for order for the ride,</v>

314
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I have to keep each other in balance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dialogue.</v>

315
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.143
<v Speaker 4>You want to ensure neither proclivity </v>
<v Speaker 4>become so polarized or both so that the </v>

316
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.390
<v Speaker 4>dialogue ceases then well then you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>something approximating,</v>

317
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.820
<v Speaker 4>well if not more than at least conflict </v>
<v Speaker 4>or repression or.</v>

318
00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes,</v>

319
00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.490
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to watch the experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you have to keep the dialogue going.</v>

320
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.903
<v Speaker 1>That can be managed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a good point to </v>

321
00:20:40.221 --> 00:20:43.760
<v Speaker 1>transition to the identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter of our talk.</v>

322
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 1>So what I wanted to discuss is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and well it's narrative substitution and</v>

323
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:51.064
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came up with it myself and don't ever </v>

324
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.330
<v Speaker 1>makes any sense but sounds impressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's good enough for me.</v>

325
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 1>So what I kinda mean by this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Weinstein,</v>

326
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:59.803
<v Speaker 1>last September with Dave Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he inserted that the concept of safe </v>

327
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:06.670
<v Speaker 1>spaces don't serve to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

328
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.653
<v Speaker 1>They serve to protect narratives that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can cannot survive scrutiny from the </v>

329
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:14.000
<v Speaker 1>outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've tried to develop this,</v>

330
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.113
<v Speaker 1>this thought a little further and I came</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with the following thought that I </v>

331
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:22.000
<v Speaker 1>wanted to present to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in identity politics.</v>

332
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.863
<v Speaker 1>People's actual individual experience is</v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced by the embodiment of a </v>

333
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:27.394
<v Speaker 1>narrative of collective oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't necessarily reflect their </v>

334
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.340
<v Speaker 1>actual position in society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in short,</v>

335
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 1>there are not as oppressed as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

336
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:38.000
<v Speaker 1>They subscribe to big states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

337
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.380
<v Speaker 4>the data on that from the logical </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature is quite clear.</v>

338
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.040
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you survey minority group members,</v>

339
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.363
<v Speaker 4>let's say</v>
<v Speaker 4>they almost inevitably state the amount </v>

340
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:55.214
<v Speaker 4>of oppression suffered by their group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>far exceeds the oppression they </v>

341
00:21:58.461 --> 00:22:01.710
<v Speaker 4>experienced as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very common finding.</v>

342
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

343
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do we,</v>

344
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.660
<v Speaker 1>how do you cope with this very grave </v>
<v Speaker 1>disparity between data and narrative and</v>

345
00:22:10.431 --> 00:22:11.264
<v Speaker 1>never different body by individuals even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it doesn't reflect their actual </v>

346
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.790
<v Speaker 1>position in society?</v>

347
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:16.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

348
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.070
<v Speaker 4>let's go back a couple of steps to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>original propositions.</v>

349
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.583
<v Speaker 4>Weinstein's conference for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were that the purpose of safe spaces </v>

350
00:22:26.161 --> 00:22:26.994
<v Speaker 4>wasn't to protect individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to protect a narrative that may or </v>

351
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.840
<v Speaker 4>scrutiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I certainly believe that because when.</v>

352
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.850
<v Speaker 4>This is something I hope to do in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next year,</v>

353
00:22:35.851 --> 00:22:40.290
<v Speaker 4>I've been looking into some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental propositions of the identity</v>

354
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.940
<v Speaker 4>politics and of the political spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of patriarchy,</v>

355
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:50.100
<v Speaker 4>the idea of intersectionality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that</v>

356
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.650
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>performance increments can be accrued as</v>

357
00:22:55.651 --> 00:22:56.484
<v Speaker 4>a consequence of diversification of view</v>
<v Speaker 4>points along the standard identity </v>

358
00:23:00.481 --> 00:23:01.314
<v Speaker 4>politics lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those ideas are intellectually week </v>

359
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.250
<v Speaker 4>almost beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

360
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.310
<v Speaker 4>The only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I looked up,</v>

361
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.220
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Kate Millett,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

362
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.200
<v Speaker 4>my memory might be fading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked,</v>

363
00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:19.243
<v Speaker 4>I looked up the research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it on the idea of white </v>

364
00:23:24.301 --> 00:23:25.134
<v Speaker 4>privilege on the idea of the Patriarchy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the idea of intersectionality and I </v>

365
00:23:29.611 --> 00:23:33.810
<v Speaker 4>went and tracked down the people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>formulated the ideas and started to look</v>

366
00:23:33.811 --> 00:23:34.644
<v Speaker 4>seriously at what they have written and </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussed and frankly it's me </v>

367
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.953
<v Speaker 4>intellectually week and I think the only</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason it survived at all is because so </v>

368
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 4>it was all formulated in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universities.</v>

369
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.920
<v Speaker 4>The idea of white privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

370
00:23:52.921 --> 00:23:53.754
<v Speaker 4>was formulated that wet else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had the idea of intersectionality at </v>

371
00:23:56.961 --> 00:24:01.961
<v Speaker 4>the law school at Ucla and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 4>only reason that these ideas have gained</v>

372
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:04.603
<v Speaker 4>currency is the serious scholars in </v>
<v Speaker 4>universities and those were mostly but </v>

373
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:14.600
<v Speaker 4>not all be those who are pursuing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>research in the stem disciplines.</v>

374
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:15.434
<v Speaker 4>Because of the fundamental corruption of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the humanities and the social sciences </v>

375
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:19.663
<v Speaker 4>have just ignored them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They haven't been subject to January </v>

376
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:25.790
<v Speaker 4>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hypothetically.</v>

377
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:26.624
<v Speaker 4>They're peer reviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're peer reviewed by people </v>

378
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:31.340
<v Speaker 4>who've already taken the poison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

379
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:33.620
<v Speaker 4>or who are possessed by the same set of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

380
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you analyze those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fall apart.</v>

381
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.533
<v Speaker 4>So other disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other academic disciplines have plainly </v>

382
00:24:40.941 --> 00:24:42.290
<v Speaker 4>ignored this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

383
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:43.124
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's because they never thought </v>

384
00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:49.271
<v Speaker 4>that the ideas were worthy of criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has a real criticism.</v>

385
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 4>Your ideas aren't even worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticism.</v>

386
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.533
<v Speaker 4>We're going to ignore them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the problem is is that's actually </v>

387
00:24:56.511 --> 00:24:59.030
<v Speaker 4>not worked out very well because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

388
00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 4>the stem types,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say we're busy peering through the</v>

389
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:03.584
<v Speaker 4>microscopes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the activist pipes were busy corrupting </v>

390
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:10.620
<v Speaker 4>the entire structure of the university </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then spreading that,</v>

391
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.680
<v Speaker 4>that pathology of appallingly bad ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>out into the broader culture,</v>

392
00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.490
<v Speaker 4>like the idea of intersectionality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We run a real focus on that.</v>

393
00:25:19.491 --> 00:25:22.130
<v Speaker 4>It's like we could just take that apart </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a bit.</v>

394
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:24.990
<v Speaker 4>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be an intersection,</v>

395
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 4>intersection list,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's a word,</v>

396
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.010
<v Speaker 4>means that you have to buy the </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppression narrative.</v>

397
00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:31.923
<v Speaker 4>You have to buy the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That history isn't a battle ground </v>

398
00:25:34.581 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 4>between the oppressed and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressors.</v>

399
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.513
<v Speaker 4>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a Marxist presumption derived </v>

400
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.963
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's an analog of the </v>

401
00:25:42.471 --> 00:25:43.304
<v Speaker 4>proletariat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] struggled that was outlined </v>

402
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 4>as fundamental marks.</v>

403
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.043
<v Speaker 4>So it's a very bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's any doubt about </v>

404
00:25:50.001 --> 00:25:50.834
<v Speaker 4>that jeff or Bible out and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an appalling poetry one </v>

405
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:59.990
<v Speaker 4>side or the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though there is oppression and that</v>

406
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:02.940
<v Speaker 4>characterizes all social institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

407
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:04.203
<v Speaker 4>but that's by no means all the story </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have to buy the idea that the </v>

408
00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:08.834
<v Speaker 4>oppression occurs along the canonical </v>
<v Speaker 4>lines drawn identity lines drawn by the </v>

409
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Speaker 4>identity politics type.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that would be essentially,</v>

410
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.420
<v Speaker 4>let's say race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ethnicity,</v>

411
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:25.510
<v Speaker 4>sexuality and gender as an article,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

412
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:26.533
<v Speaker 4>categories and I don't think the </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence for that is overwhelming as </v>

413
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:30.824
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then having accepted those </v>

414
00:26:34.131 --> 00:26:36.500
<v Speaker 4>propositions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unquestionably,</v>

415
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:40.310
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you noticed that oppression is more than</v>

416
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:41.750
<v Speaker 4>one dimensional St.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

417
00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:42.584
<v Speaker 4>if you're black and female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then your oppression is either the </v>

418
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.540
<v Speaker 4>summer or the product of those two </v>
<v Speaker 4>minority statuses.</v>

419
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.113
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't find that particularly </v>

420
00:26:55.171 --> 00:26:57.150
<v Speaker 4>compelling or original idea.</v>

421
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.313
<v Speaker 4>I think it's obvious and it's also self </v>
<v Speaker 4>contradictory and it's easy to think </v>

422
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:10.521
<v Speaker 4>that through because as you multiply the</v>
<v Speaker 4>number of identically</v>

423
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.640
<v Speaker 4>which you could be oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you reduced the number of people in each</v>

424
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:18.663
<v Speaker 4>super ordinate category and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>suspicions are that you could figure </v>

425
00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:23.574
<v Speaker 4>this out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>arithmetically with a bit of work </v>

426
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.780
<v Speaker 4>approximately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least imagine that each person can be</v>

427
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:33.290
<v Speaker 4>placed into 10 idea identity categories </v>
<v Speaker 4>switch,</v>

428
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.510
<v Speaker 4>which I don't think it's unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The actually the number of categories is</v>

429
00:27:36.511 --> 00:27:38.310
<v Speaker 4>the limit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's limitless.</v>

430
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.823
<v Speaker 4>You ended up with no groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You end up right back to the individual </v>

431
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 4>and so so which is essentially what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>West discovered.</v>

432
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:53.210
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's some multiple thousands</v>
<v Speaker 4>of years ago.</v>

433
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.733
<v Speaker 4>It's really want to take everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences into account which is what </v>

434
00:27:58.801 --> 00:27:59.634
<v Speaker 4>the intersection was claim you should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing and what you end up doing is </v>

435
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.550
<v Speaker 4>responding to each person as if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 4>unique individual.</v>

436
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.073
<v Speaker 4>So and that's just one example of how </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably show these ideas are and </v>

437
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:14.484
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how easily they're subject to what I </v>

438
00:28:16.651 --> 00:28:19.320
<v Speaker 4>would say devastating criticism and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>does support.</v>

439
00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:21.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do think that what is often </v>

440
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.960
<v Speaker 1>overlooked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're so dominant in our,</v>

441
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.080
<v Speaker 1>the way our perception is shaped what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>often overlooked.</v>

442
00:28:29.081 --> 00:28:32.170
<v Speaker 1>But actually very few people subscribe </v>
<v Speaker 1>to identity politics.</v>

443
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I think there was only</v>
<v Speaker 1>one study,</v>

444
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

445
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.413
<v Speaker 1>at around 8,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the conclusion was that only eight </v>

446
00:28:42.431 --> 00:28:44.800
<v Speaker 1>percent actually subscribed to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative and</v>

447
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.710
<v Speaker 1>media and education.</v>

448
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can imagine,</v>

449
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.833
<v Speaker 4>you can hypothesize that the political,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you consider political affiliation </v>

450
00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.253
<v Speaker 4>unit dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not clear that you could make a </v>

451
00:28:59.251 --> 00:29:04.251
<v Speaker 4>normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The extremes are rare and yeah.</v>

452
00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.130
<v Speaker 4>Then of course the question is how do </v>
<v Speaker 4>you define what constitutes extreme,</v>

453
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:11.203
<v Speaker 4>but it does appear that a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 4>estimate on both the right and the left </v>

454
00:29:14.171 --> 00:29:16.430
<v Speaker 4>is something approximating five to eight</v>
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>

455
00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:17.613
<v Speaker 4>And in that same study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the people who were identified as </v>

456
00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:21.374
<v Speaker 4>relatively extreme in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 4>their left wing identity politics </v>

457
00:29:24.951 --> 00:29:25.784
<v Speaker 4>position of 40 percent of them had also </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreed with the idea that political </v>

458
00:29:30.891 --> 00:29:33.020
<v Speaker 4>correctness has gone too far.</v>

459
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this identity narrative is basically </v>

460
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.930
<v Speaker 1>it has consolidated its position in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities</v>

461
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:40.880
<v Speaker 4>and then media</v>

462
00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:46.960
<v Speaker 2>and human resources departments in large</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations as well.</v>

463
00:29:46.961 --> 00:29:49.330
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't underestimate the danger </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

464
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:51.040
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the new fifth.</v>

465
00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Call them inside the capitalist system </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

466
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 2>welcomed by the capitalists who want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have it both ways,</v>

467
00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 2>but you have to give the identitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

468
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:01.653
<v Speaker 2>they're due credit because if their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if their doctor is indeed as </v>

469
00:30:05.381 --> 00:30:06.214
<v Speaker 2>intellectually week as it appears to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've accomplished quite a lot with </v>

470
00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:11.590
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

471
00:30:11.591 --> 00:30:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Well continuous subsidies for 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>House and hurt,</v>

472
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:15.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they've managed to do is blur the </v>

473
00:30:16.991 --> 00:30:17.824
<v Speaker 2>distinction between education and </v>
<v Speaker 2>indoctrination and it's easy to blur </v>

474
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:23.374
<v Speaker 2>that distinction because you would hope </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to some degree what people you </v>

475
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.880
<v Speaker 2>learn in university can be transposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>into action now.</v>

476
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:34.803
<v Speaker 2>And so drawing a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 2>education and indoctrination is very </v>

477
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:40.490
<v Speaker 2>good to call thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

478
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:45.280
<v Speaker 2>but it still needs to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've recommended to politicians,</v>

479
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:50.540
<v Speaker 4>Canada and the US mostly in Canada so </v>
<v Speaker 4>far that they</v>

480
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.920
<v Speaker 4>ask universities to generate in Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 4>with my home problems.</v>

481
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 4>The newly elected conservative </v>
<v Speaker 4>government has required the universities</v>

482
00:31:04.891 --> 00:31:09.891
<v Speaker 4>and colleges to formulate a statement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a free speech policy statement,</v>

483
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.513
<v Speaker 4>and all of the colleges in Ontario have </v>
<v Speaker 4>now complied and most of them have </v>

484
00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:20.310
<v Speaker 4>adopted some variant of the Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 4>University of Chicago statement,</v>

485
00:31:20.311 --> 00:31:21.144
<v Speaker 4>which is a real move forward and I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been thinking that an equally useful </v>

486
00:31:25.771 --> 00:31:30.771
<v Speaker 4>thing to do would be to ask ologist in </v>
<v Speaker 4>universities to formulate policy,</v>

487
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.730
<v Speaker 4>dissociating education from </v>
<v Speaker 4>indoctrination.</v>

488
00:31:35.731 --> 00:31:38.990
<v Speaker 4>And there is precedent for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nonpartisan.</v>

489
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.580
<v Speaker 4>So for the Canadian Revenue Agency,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is equivalent to the irs in the US</v>

490
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:49.810
<v Speaker 2>tax agency for bids charities from </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging in political activism.</v>

491
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:52.223
<v Speaker 2>And so that means there's already a set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of definitions regarding what </v>

492
00:31:55.431 --> 00:31:58.640
<v Speaker 2>constitutes activism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say rather than charitable work,</v>

493
00:31:58.641 --> 00:31:59.474
<v Speaker 2>which</v>

494
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.383
<v Speaker 4>something that can be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You applied in the education field </v>

495
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:03.703
<v Speaker 4>distinguishing activism from education.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the problem is is that part of </v>

496
00:32:07.311 --> 00:32:11.390
<v Speaker 4>the problem is is that there is a small </v>
<v Speaker 4>minority of very disruptive people,</v>

497
00:32:11.391 --> 00:32:12.224
<v Speaker 4>in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who have been subsidized or they're </v>

498
00:32:14.991 --> 00:32:19.991
<v Speaker 4>destructive work for about 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's given them a power that's far</v>

499
00:32:20.001 --> 00:32:23.030
<v Speaker 4>of proportion to their intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 4>rigor,</v>

500
00:32:23.031 --> 00:32:26.780
<v Speaker 4>to the credibility of their ideas and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>their numerical prevalence.</v>

501
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense.</v>

502
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.963
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the way to defeat this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to embody that the male archetype or </v>

503
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 2>ear or I know men or women</v>

504
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.083
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think we can go through that third </v>

505
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.533
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

506
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.090
<v Speaker 4>just make a swot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just big aside.</v>

507
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.890
<v Speaker 4>Move quickly because I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

508
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.580
<v Speaker 4>so one of the things that's happened in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hungary,</v>

509
00:32:51.581 --> 00:32:55.870
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the president has cuts funding,</v>

510
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.823
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to women's studies and I know that in </v>

511
00:32:59.771 --> 00:33:02.210
<v Speaker 4>Brazil there's no pressure being placed </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

512
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:03.044
<v Speaker 4>I don't know this very well on my part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's pressure being placed on </v>

513
00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:07.893
<v Speaker 4>lgbt activists trips and so you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>say that one way of dealing with the </v>

514
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:15.283
<v Speaker 4>unfortunate and I'm reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 4>subsidization of this particular </v>

515
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:25.530
<v Speaker 4>political viewpoint would be to stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>funding that at the university or public</v>

516
00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.350
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with that is it opens up</v>

517
00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:34.380
<v Speaker 4>the specter of direct government </v>
<v Speaker 4>interference with the autonomy be bad.</v>

518
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:36.783
<v Speaker 4>So then we can go to the other topic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is I think the way that you </v>

519
00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:43.730
<v Speaker 4>undermine a bad story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no undermine is right.</v>

520
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:45.363
<v Speaker 4>I think the way that you engage in </v>
<v Speaker 4>proper discourse in relationship to set </v>

521
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.583
<v Speaker 4>video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>logical presuppositions is by </v>

522
00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:01.620
<v Speaker 4>formulating and communicating better </v>
<v Speaker 4>story or better story with.</v>

523
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:05.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's a better transition.</v>

524
00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully,</v>

525
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.243
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully it's the right way of going </v>

526
00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.173
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He person who tells the best story wins </v>

527
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.673
<v Speaker 4>and that that echoes back to Weinstein's</v>
<v Speaker 4>caution that the purpose of the safe </v>

528
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.840
<v Speaker 4>springs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are clearly purpose of this space,</v>

529
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:24.550
<v Speaker 4>is clearly not to produce more resilient</v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals.</v>

530
00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.413
<v Speaker 4>Jonathan Heit and his coauthor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just finished the American mind just </v>

531
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:34.580
<v Speaker 4>published,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

532
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Yanis Ganahl the piano off his name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

533
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:40.143
<v Speaker 4>lay out the evidence that the safe space</v>
<v Speaker 4>doctrine actually weakens individuals </v>

534
00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:50.580
<v Speaker 4>very clearly than I think any reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist or a psychiatrist knows the</v>

535
00:34:51.011 --> 00:34:51.844
<v Speaker 4>literature on exposure to anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 4>provoking stimuli would have to agree </v>

536
00:34:56.651 --> 00:34:57.484
<v Speaker 4>that protecting people from any exposure</v>
<v Speaker 4>to things that they're afraid of or </v>

537
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:05.830
<v Speaker 4>contentious like Lidl to weaken them </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than just cranking them.</v>

538
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.110
<v Speaker 4>So I think it is to protect the </v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative.</v>

539
00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:09.443
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

540
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.560
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

541
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.510
<v Speaker 4>but I think the best way to combat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathological narrative a better story.</v>

542
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

543
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.373
<v Speaker 1>And talking about or stories I think I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would now like to discuss one of the </v>

544
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.063
<v Speaker 1>best stories I've seen in modern cinema </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm talking about the movie </v>

545
00:35:29.921 --> 00:35:33.700
<v Speaker 1>gladiator that came out in 2000 starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia crow and Jacqueline Phoenix.</v>

546
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.010
<v Speaker 1>You totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw last night?</v>

547
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:37.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had watched it before so I knew we </v>

548
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 1>were going to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

549
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.470
<v Speaker 1>I was very surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I avoided it</v>

550
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:50.243
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a movie of substantial </v>

551
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:55.590
<v Speaker 1>cultural significance that you just miss</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was what I missed.</v>

552
00:35:55.591 --> 00:35:56.820
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

553
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Well you made up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

554
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.863
<v Speaker 1>so gladiator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this movie is ingrained in the </v>

555
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:06.960
<v Speaker 1>psyche of my generation more so than any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

556
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:10.740
<v Speaker 1>like epic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epic movie of it's open source.</v>

557
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.700
<v Speaker 1>So there's not a character's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

558
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.733
<v Speaker 1>there's Aragorn from Lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's hector from Troy is William </v>

559
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Wallace from braveheart or spartacus.</v>

560
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:18.923
<v Speaker 1>There's Leah night is from 300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these characters are the same </v>

561
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:27.020
<v Speaker 1>archetipal figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow only maximum ms dot meridius</v>

562
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.480
<v Speaker 1>really strict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really sticks through the years.</v>

563
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.460
<v Speaker 1>And I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

564
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:33.294
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've put some thought into this and I </v>

565
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:40.440
<v Speaker 1>have some ideas about why particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>this character in this movie sticks.</v>

566
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:42.743
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to present to you three points </v>
<v Speaker 1>that culminate in what I think is the </v>

567
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.790
<v Speaker 1>implicit central thesis difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the movie.</v>

568
00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.213
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to list now the three </v>
<v Speaker 1>points and then the central thesis or </v>

569
00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:58.260
<v Speaker 1>number one is that maximum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is by far the best modern portrayal</v>

570
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.690
<v Speaker 1>of the male archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

571
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 1>he's highly capable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very gentle and these modest in word</v>

572
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:06.204
<v Speaker 1>and body language and these admired and </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved solely for his character and </v>

573
00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:09.650
<v Speaker 1>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

574
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the portrayal of the architect's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>

575
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.343
<v Speaker 1>is that the movie also contains the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>best modern portrayal of the embittered </v>

576
00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:17.934
<v Speaker 1>villain whose character and skill are </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply insufficient and he makes up for </v>

577
00:37:20.791 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 1>it through deceit and cruelness while </v>
<v Speaker 1>still knowing every step of the way that</v>

578
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:26.220
<v Speaker 1>eventually build it.</v>

579
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.410
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And three,</v>

580
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 1>the characters themselves are exclusive </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their own rights,</v>

581
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:39.210
<v Speaker 1>but in this movie there juxtaposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a hostile brother framework which</v>

582
00:37:39.211 --> 00:37:40.044
<v Speaker 1>makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a deeply architecture </v>

583
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:43.730
<v Speaker 1>framework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might be the reason that it's,</v>

584
00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:47.240
<v Speaker 1>it sticks so much more than all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other architects figures.</v>

585
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:49.860
<v Speaker 1>And this brings me to the central </v>
<v Speaker 1>thesis.</v>

586
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.753
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

587
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.593
<v Speaker 1>I only figured this out two days ago and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited to get to share this </v>

588
00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:54.654
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that central complicit thesis </v>

589
00:37:57.301 --> 00:37:59.240
<v Speaker 1>throughout the whole movie is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>follows,</v>

590
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:04.910
<v Speaker 1>that no matter how powerful someone is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bane of a man who sold,</v>

591
00:38:05.391 --> 00:38:06.224
<v Speaker 1>who has been irreversibly corrupted far </v>
<v Speaker 1>out exceeds the pain of a righteous man </v>

592
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.750
<v Speaker 1>whose wife and son had been murdered and</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been reduced to epic,</v>

593
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.080
<v Speaker 1>which is really something to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

594
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

595
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.593
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the themes that you've been </v>

596
00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:27.120
<v Speaker 1>developing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

597
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:29.410
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing we might also note </v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

598
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.013
<v Speaker 1>last over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the right way of thinking </v>

599
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:34.914
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said</v>

600
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Maximus is a paragon of soldierly </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtue,</v>

601
00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.713
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's physical combat and a warrior </v>

602
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:51.190
<v Speaker 2>beautiful up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He serves his commander,</v>

603
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.400
<v Speaker 2>but also serves the principals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More importantly,</v>

604
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:55.743
<v Speaker 2>principles that govern his commander</v>
<v Speaker 2>principals more than the commander </v>

605
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:06.121
<v Speaker 2>himself and you can tell that because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>chooses not to serve the new emperor</v>

606
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.020
<v Speaker 2>because he doesn't believe that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>abides by the proper principles.</v>

607
00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:14.020
<v Speaker 2>And Communists of course also killed his</v>
<v Speaker 2>own father,</v>

608
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.920
<v Speaker 2>which means that he killed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles by which the state,</v>

609
00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

610
00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:24.720
<v Speaker 2>he's like elder gods in the Mesopotamian</v>
<v Speaker 2>creationists who kill app suit,</v>

611
00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.370
<v Speaker 2>who's their father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then try to live on this course.</v>

612
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:31.240
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work out well for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that does is breed chaos.</v>

613
00:39:31.241 --> 00:39:35.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie gladiator.</v>

614
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Maximus as son is an interesting son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is also an interesting character because</v>

615
00:39:45.191 --> 00:39:46.024
<v Speaker 2>he becomes son as a consequence of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtue rather than as a consequence of </v>

616
00:39:49.631 --> 00:39:51.970
<v Speaker 2>his birthright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carbon has the,</v>

617
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.133
<v Speaker 2>has the advantage of birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maximus has the advantage of virtue </v>

618
00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.640
<v Speaker 2>is the virtue of strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

619
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:06.640
<v Speaker 2>that makes the movie in some sense also </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely barbaric.</v>

620
00:40:06.641 --> 00:40:07.474
<v Speaker 2>There's just endless and killing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very strange thing when you're </v>

621
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:16.360
<v Speaker 2>talking about someone who's operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>within a fundamentally moral framework.</v>

622
00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:17.943
<v Speaker 2>And I guess part of the moral of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story is that it's better to be a </v>

623
00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:22.750
<v Speaker 2>soldier than a coward</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

624
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:24.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

625
00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:25.933
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that on one hand that self </v>

626
00:40:30.111 --> 00:40:34.760
<v Speaker 2>evident and on the other hand that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery because the coward might be able</v>

627
00:40:34.761 --> 00:40:35.594
<v Speaker 2>to avoid the mayhem and killing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterizes the life of the soldier </v>

628
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.833
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maximus does organize himself under the </v>

629
00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.150
<v Speaker 2>virtues of courage and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for parents and strength.</v>

630
00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my observation is actually of course,</v>

631
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.673
<v Speaker 1>is a very powerful soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my observation is that that is not </v>

632
00:40:58.091 --> 00:40:58.924
<v Speaker 1>the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so much the reason this archetype </v>

633
00:41:01.061 --> 00:41:03.250
<v Speaker 1>sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

634
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:04.323
<v Speaker 1>I read this character that he is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute embodiment of the </v>

635
00:41:07.391 --> 00:41:08.224
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that allow you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>content with tragedy and malevolence in </v>

636
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:13.900
<v Speaker 1>an optimal way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just on the battlefield.</v>

637
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not really about the battlefield.</v>

638
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:15.931
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

639
00:41:15.931 --> 00:41:16.764
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see his soldierly capability as a </v>

640
00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:25.440
<v Speaker 2>representation of competence itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>guided by principles.</v>

641
00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's reasonable.</v>

642
00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.513
<v Speaker 2>I also think that that's probably how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conduct of the soldier should be </v>

643
00:41:30.811 --> 00:41:31.644
<v Speaker 2>judged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It that soldiers are necessary despite </v>

644
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.093
<v Speaker 2>the mayhem that warfare produces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't figured out how to dispense </v>

645
00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:46.910
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you think.</v>

646
00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that Kayden,</v>

647
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.963
<v Speaker 2>do you think that the Cain and Abel </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework in which it is implicitly a </v>

648
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.433
<v Speaker 2>structure it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that adds to do how much a </v>

649
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 2>story sticks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

650
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

651
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.833
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the story of Cain and Abel does </v>

652
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:10.601
<v Speaker 2>lay out very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very elegantly and and it was incredible</v>

653
00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:11.924
<v Speaker 2>compression to fundamentally opposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>modes of being both being characterized </v>

654
00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:18.323
<v Speaker 2>as able to favorite song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most being that characterizes Cain </v>

655
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:26.800
<v Speaker 2>and Abel is competent and virtuous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>God theory,</v>

656
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.720
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more practically,</v>

657
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:34.200
<v Speaker 2>which means he's allied with the highest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of principles.</v>

658
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.380
<v Speaker 2>That's the right way to think about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically.</v>

659
00:42:36.381 --> 00:42:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the higher the highest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>principals might be.</v>

660
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.133
<v Speaker 2>There was an attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that you might </v>

661
00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.773
<v Speaker 2>consider psychologically is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement from polytheism to monotheism </v>

662
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.543
<v Speaker 2>parallels parallels the integration of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual psyche and the </v>

663
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:01.880
<v Speaker 2>development of larger and larger scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>social organizations.</v>

664
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.770
<v Speaker 2>All those things happened at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

665
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.030
<v Speaker 2>so you imagine that the larger scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the organization,</v>

666
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:09.343
<v Speaker 2>the human organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the more people included under the </v>

667
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:13.243
<v Speaker 2>umbrella of the same state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more organized and orderly the </v>

668
00:43:17.591 --> 00:43:18.424
<v Speaker 2>principles by which that state have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>function must be because of the </v>

669
00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:23.204
<v Speaker 2>increasing complexity and also the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem of having to determine how the </v>

670
00:43:29.211 --> 00:43:32.800
<v Speaker 2>state can remain intact over a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time without fragment,</v>

671
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:34.123
<v Speaker 2>so the state has to organize itself so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the needs and wants of the bulk of </v>

672
00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:40.334
<v Speaker 2>the population are met with sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>regularity so that the state itself </v>

673
00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:49.811
<v Speaker 2>doesn't fragment and that means that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>state has to organize itself in what you</v>

674
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:53.960
<v Speaker 2>might regard as a virtuous manner.</v>

675
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:58.960
<v Speaker 2>That can be iterated and at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time the people who compose the state in</v>

676
00:43:59.231 --> 00:44:00.064
<v Speaker 2>its increasing complexity have to ally </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves with that longterm state </v>

677
00:44:04.371 --> 00:44:06.260
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a.</v>

678
00:44:06.261 --> 00:44:07.094
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a coalition between psychological </v>

679
00:44:08.781 --> 00:44:13.460
<v Speaker 2>integration and sociological complexity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and and that's,</v>

680
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.983
<v Speaker 2>that is foreshadowed we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or accompany by the movement from </v>

681
00:44:20.211 --> 00:44:21.044
<v Speaker 2>polytheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the polling of people in all </v>

682
00:44:23.241 --> 00:44:26.490
<v Speaker 2>directions by fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational and natural forces.</v>

683
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Into monotheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the direction of the</v>

684
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.220
<v Speaker 2>under the rubric of a single set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>

685
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:37.620
<v Speaker 2>So single super ordinate set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>

686
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Now what those principles are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious,</v>

687
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:42.900
<v Speaker 2>which is partly why we're having the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion of gladiator.</v>

688
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.830
<v Speaker 2>So I can give you an example of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

689
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Old Testament,</v>

690
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:50.873
<v Speaker 2>you see the articulation of the guiding </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles emerge in its most fully </v>

691
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:03.000
<v Speaker 2>formed manner with the commandments of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Moses.</v>

692
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:09.190
<v Speaker 2>So you might say all of the diverse </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources that might be polled people,</v>

693
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:14.271
<v Speaker 2>hither and yon have being aggregated </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a list of thou shalt nots.</v>

694
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.403
<v Speaker 2>Here's how to regulate yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's how to get yourself across time </v>

695
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.670
<v Speaker 2>so that you can have a stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm,</v>

696
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:22.583
<v Speaker 2>large scale society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's a mystery that emerges </v>

697
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.600
<v Speaker 2>in the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

698
00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:29.550
<v Speaker 2>it emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

699
00:45:29.551 --> 00:45:32.010
<v Speaker 2>with Christ is asked by the scribes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pharisees,</v>

700
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:34.140
<v Speaker 2>which is the greatest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>commandments.</v>

701
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:39.880
<v Speaker 2>And Christ actually performs a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent sleight of hand.</v>

702
00:45:39.881 --> 00:45:40.750
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

703
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.430
<v Speaker 2>you have to love God with all your heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all your soul.</v>

704
00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 2>And you have to love your brother as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's yourself.</v>

705
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Love your neighbor as yourself on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on those propositions,</v>

706
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:56.570
<v Speaker 2>all the commandments and the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an attempt to integrate even the</v>

707
00:45:56.791 --> 00:45:57.624
<v Speaker 2>commandments into something that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher order principle and that </v>

708
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:04.650
<v Speaker 2>principle actually manifests itself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judeo Christian society as the logos,</v>

709
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.513
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's something like truthful </v>

710
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:08.664
<v Speaker 2>communication devoted towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest good and the embodiment of that </v>

711
00:46:13.381 --> 00:46:14.214
<v Speaker 2>becomes the fundamental principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in gladiator you see movement </v>

712
00:46:18.271 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 2>towards that and embodiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

713
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:20.783
<v Speaker 2>Because maximus is an organized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplined person who's governed by </v>

714
00:46:25.351 --> 00:46:27.270
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

715
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.370
<v Speaker 2>and the question is posed throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

716
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what his role right now asked for,</v>

717
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:36.030
<v Speaker 2>asked by Marcus Aurelius because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed log.</v>

718
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:36.923
<v Speaker 2>What he's done is a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's asked by communists and it's asked </v>

719
00:46:39.361 --> 00:46:43.590
<v Speaker 2>by the sister whose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose name escapes me at the moment.</v>

720
00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.270
<v Speaker 2>It's what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's loosened.</v>

721
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:49.861
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

722
00:46:49.861 --> 00:46:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

723
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.480
<v Speaker 2>and they all asked for what his role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she comes the closest.</v>

724
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:57.750
<v Speaker 2>She says it's a great idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

725
00:46:57.751 --> 00:47:01.710
<v Speaker 2>It's an animating principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>

726
00:47:01.711 --> 00:47:03.360
<v Speaker 2>what is the animating principle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

727
00:47:03.361 --> 00:47:04.194
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maximus embodies that far more than </v>

728
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:08.023
<v Speaker 2>common does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maximus is a able figure l whereas </v>

729
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:18.000
<v Speaker 2>comedy or comedic is</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly a failure of,</v>

730
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.043
<v Speaker 2>of cane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it proper sacrifices and they're </v>

731
00:47:22.531 --> 00:47:25.200
<v Speaker 2>never well regarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says constantly,</v>

732
00:47:25.201 --> 00:47:25.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he,</v>

733
00:47:25.741 --> 00:47:28.140
<v Speaker 2>all he ever did was try to please his </v>
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

734
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his sacrifices went on,</v>

735
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:33.123
<v Speaker 2>appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what made him bitter and </v>

736
00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:35.164
<v Speaker 2>resentful and murderous and catastrophic</v>
<v Speaker 2>death and evil and to tyrant and all </v>

737
00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.040
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

738
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally archetypical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who do you.</v>

739
00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 2>This is like a compressed version of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thesis.</v>

740
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you think in this story?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it common as well?</v>

741
00:47:56.831 --> 00:47:57.664
<v Speaker 2>It's the same question that the social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's posted in the Gulag archipelago to </v>

742
00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:02.710
<v Speaker 2>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

743
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:04.990
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to lose your.</v>

744
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.140
<v Speaker 2>What's worse to put your life at risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

745
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.290
<v Speaker 2>or to put everything you love at risk or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lose your conscience.</v>

746
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.073
<v Speaker 2>And Solzhenitsyn's conclusion was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no suffering greater than that </v>

747
00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:20.700
<v Speaker 2>which accompanies last</v>
<v Speaker 2>exhale.</v>

748
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:23.973
<v Speaker 2>There's something very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very profound about that because one of </v>

749
00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:27.480
<v Speaker 2>the things I've just been reading about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

750
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:32.490
<v Speaker 2>interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the prophet Elijah who,</v>

751
00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:35.620
<v Speaker 2>who first seems to have.</v>

752
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:41.860
<v Speaker 2>It's in the story of the profitable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>profitable Asia as far as I can tell,</v>

753
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:48.120
<v Speaker 2>where there's the first intimation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>God might speak to human beings,</v>

754
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:52.390
<v Speaker 2>not as the external force of natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

755
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:54.430
<v Speaker 2>storms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>

756
00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:58.240
<v Speaker 2>wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter earthquakes,</v>

757
00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:02.290
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the overwhelming natural forces that</v>

758
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:03.124
<v Speaker 2>human beings were subject to or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>even not as internal forces that would </v>

759
00:49:09.341 --> 00:49:10.174
<v Speaker 2>more characterize some of the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>polytheistic gods like lost or rage or </v>

760
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:19.410
<v Speaker 2>or terror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as the voice of conscience itself,</v>

761
00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:21.363
<v Speaker 2>which which is which is described in one</v>
<v Speaker 2>kings which is this contains the story </v>

762
00:49:27.881 --> 00:49:32.210
<v Speaker 2>of Elijah asked the still small voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first time that that frees.</v>

763
00:49:32.211 --> 00:49:33.044
<v Speaker 2>It merges and so it's the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something that there's a </v>

764
00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:40.570
<v Speaker 2>psychological factor conscious itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>that calls to you,</v>

765
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:41.603
<v Speaker 2>that that has a dialogue with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even more importantly because it's </v>

766
00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.140
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't tell you what to do.</v>

767
00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:52.840
<v Speaker 2>It hints at what you shouldn't do and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a deterministic force.</v>

768
00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:54.600
<v Speaker 2>It's not like when your conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>scripts you,</v>

769
00:49:54.601 --> 00:49:58.450
<v Speaker 2>you're forced to act in a manner that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in accordance with your conscience.</v>

770
00:49:58.660 --> 00:49:59.493
<v Speaker 2>You can choose to violate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's this idea that God </v>

771
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:09.270
<v Speaker 2>transforms himself or becomes known as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the voice of conscience and the facts,</v>

772
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:12.880
<v Speaker 2>the late between human beings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>divinity itself.</v>

773
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 2>I actually think this is a highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>credible hypothesis.</v>

774
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.183
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that what you need and </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful sustaining meaning to keep you </v>

775
00:50:21.521 --> 00:50:22.354
<v Speaker 2>from the bitterness of cane and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be found in the relationship with </v>

776
00:50:25.841 --> 00:50:29.600
<v Speaker 2>something of divine significance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

777
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:32.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's mediated through your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience</v>

778
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:37.480
<v Speaker 2>and this relationship is absent within </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kane.</v>

779
00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:42.680
<v Speaker 2>He severed his relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and consciousness,</v>

780
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:45.350
<v Speaker 2>but with conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience of</v>

781
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 2>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

782
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right,</v>

783
00:50:49.431 --> 00:50:50.264
<v Speaker 2>because conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his management conscience is the </v>

784
00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:58.030
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of the instate for good </v>
<v Speaker 2>and evil.</v>

785
00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

786
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.153
<v Speaker 2>So we can take the argument that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit about what makes people </v>

787
00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:09.020
<v Speaker 2>bitter is that they feel that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong in the world.</v>

788
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:13.360
<v Speaker 2>It might be a large scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Society is unfair.</v>

789
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:14.323
<v Speaker 2>The natural world is a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human beings are intrinsically </v>

790
00:51:16.971 --> 00:51:21.971
<v Speaker 2>malevolent that the structure of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself is wrong in some moral sense.</v>

791
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:24.223
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's interesting because they </v>

792
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:26.234
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be bothered by that if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have some sense of morality </v>

793
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:32.200
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

794
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.133
<v Speaker 2>that what that means is that conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the conscious that's driving them </v>

795
00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:37.214
<v Speaker 2>towards their cynicism is the dawning of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the realization of a moral dimension to </v>

796
00:51:42.081 --> 00:51:43.850
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

797
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.013
<v Speaker 2>conscience doesn't seem to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself as an alien force that cannot be </v>

798
00:51:49.731 --> 00:51:50.564
<v Speaker 2>denied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more something that beckons and </v>

799
00:51:54.171 --> 00:51:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Harkins and also something that you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to enter into a negotiation with.</v>

800
00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Old Testament,</v>

801
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:06.220
<v Speaker 2>even before the transformation of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say into the voice of conscience,</v>

802
00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:09.410
<v Speaker 2>you have continual intimations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

803
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:10.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

804
00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:13.310
<v Speaker 2>is is something that can be negotiated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

805
00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:14.893
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham negotiates with Yahuah when he </v>

806
00:52:18.141 --> 00:52:23.141
<v Speaker 2>tries to save the inhabitants of Sodom </v>
<v Speaker 2>from being decimated by God's wrath,</v>

807
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:24.890
<v Speaker 2>he bargains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

808
00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:26.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could find 50 good men,</v>

809
00:52:26.961 --> 00:52:29.120
<v Speaker 2>will you spare the city?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And God says,</v>

810
00:52:29.121 --> 00:52:29.920
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of,</v>

811
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.750
<v Speaker 2>if I can find 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could find 10,</v>

812
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.930
<v Speaker 2>if I can find a single good map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And God,</v>

813
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.660
<v Speaker 2>strangely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite his own audience,</v>

814
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.600
<v Speaker 2>agrees this bargain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so god,</v>

815
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:45.320
<v Speaker 2>even in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Old Testament,</v>

816
00:52:45.321 --> 00:52:49.240
<v Speaker 2>God's often pilloried as a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>intransigent and tyrannical va,</v>

817
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:50.683
<v Speaker 2>but it's clear even in the earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories that he could be negotiated </v>

818
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.710
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oddly enough.</v>

819
00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Then you see the same thing with Jacob </v>
<v Speaker 2>who eventually becomes Israel,</v>

820
00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:00.123
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Israel means he who wrestles with </v>

821
00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:03.530
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very,</v>

822
00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:04.970
<v Speaker 2>very interesting idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

823
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Is that if God can be assimilated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience,</v>

824
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:10.133
<v Speaker 2>then what that means is that the true </v>
<v Speaker 2>followers of God are those who wrestled </v>

825
00:53:13.911 --> 00:53:18.020
<v Speaker 2>with their conscience and Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he's transformed into Israel.</v>

826
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Jacob's a trickster figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

827
00:53:20.601 --> 00:53:22.310
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a maneuver.</v>

828
00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.170
<v Speaker 2>He's a salesman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>

829
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:28.680
<v Speaker 2>he's someone who's not above using </v>
<v Speaker 2>trickery to gain is an because he cheats</v>

830
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:29.780
<v Speaker 2>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

831
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:30.623
<v Speaker 2>out of his birthright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is subject to the same </v>

832
00:53:32.251 --> 00:53:34.830
<v Speaker 2>treatment at the hands of his uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in any case,</v>

833
00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:35.673
<v Speaker 2>he's not classically moral person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wrestles with the angel on the </v>

834
00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:40.674
<v Speaker 2>banks of the river when he returns to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the product that he's betrayed and </v>

835
00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:44.893
<v Speaker 2>he wrestled all night with an angel who </v>
<v Speaker 2>also turns out to be God who puts his </v>

836
00:53:48.571 --> 00:53:49.404
<v Speaker 2>hip joint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very contentious battle and he </v>

837
00:53:51.871 --> 00:53:52.704
<v Speaker 2>actually defeats the angel who is gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and requires him to bless it in the </v>

838
00:53:58.771 --> 00:53:59.604
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the blessing is that Jacob will now </v>

839
00:54:01.541 --> 00:54:02.374
<v Speaker 2>be called Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's he who wrestles successfully </v>

840
00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:09.080
<v Speaker 2>with believably interesting sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas because it all.</v>

841
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.500
<v Speaker 2>It also speaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

842
00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 2>to something approximating human </v>
<v Speaker 2>destiny.</v>

843
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

844
00:54:13.981 --> 00:54:18.981
<v Speaker 2>what's the purpose of man with God in </v>
<v Speaker 2>God's absence?</v>

845
00:54:19.111 --> 00:54:22.080
<v Speaker 2>What will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget God's absence for a moment,</v>

846
00:54:22.081 --> 00:54:22.914
<v Speaker 2>but assuming God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the purpose of man given the </v>

847
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.170
<v Speaker 2>garden to the president and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

848
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:34.140
<v Speaker 2>and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>omnipotent.</v>

849
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:35.813
<v Speaker 2>What's the purpose of man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it looks like the the fundamental </v>

850
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:39.984
<v Speaker 2>idea that's emerging as monotheism </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergency in the West is that go on and </v>

851
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:49.080
<v Speaker 2>enter into a partnership to cocreate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

852
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.153
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you do that under the guidance of </v>

853
00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:53.430
<v Speaker 2>your conscious.</v>

854
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.533
<v Speaker 1>So the destiny of men would be to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcend in dialog with God </v>

855
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:58.620
<v Speaker 1>symbolically speaking,</v>

856
00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.553
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to overcome suffering to the degree </v>

857
00:55:01.211 --> 00:55:02.044
<v Speaker 2>that that can be managed and to overcome</v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolence to the degree that that can </v>

858
00:55:05.441 --> 00:55:09.520
<v Speaker 2>be managed at the dialogue with God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

859
00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:10.383
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea that emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the great monotheistic idea and </v>

860
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.330
<v Speaker 2>the thing that it sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuation,</v>

861
00:55:16.331 --> 00:55:21.331
<v Speaker 2>but stay up the argument I was making </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with you before about responsibility</v>

862
00:55:21.911 --> 00:55:22.870
<v Speaker 2>in meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

863
00:55:22.871 --> 00:55:23.621
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's.</v>

864
00:55:23.621 --> 00:55:24.454
<v Speaker 2>Let's assume that you find meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and that you need a </v>

865
00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:31.360
<v Speaker 2>meeting that will sustain you through </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering and malevolence.</v>

866
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.901
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

867
00:55:31.901 --> 00:55:33.670
<v Speaker 2>where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

868
00:55:33.671 --> 00:55:38.290
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's to be found in hearkening</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the clarion call of conscience.</v>

869
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:42.340
<v Speaker 2>It cody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't see how that's wrong.</v>

870
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you can also reverse engineer </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

871
00:55:46.231 --> 00:55:48.120
<v Speaker 1>that if you take communists as a test </v>
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>

872
00:55:48.121 --> 00:55:50.730
<v Speaker 1>that when you sever the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the individual,</v>

873
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.260
<v Speaker 1>the individual and conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then suffering is maximized.</v>

874
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:56.743
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

875
00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:57.643
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He suffers terribly isolated from </v>

876
00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:00.874
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the the thing he suffers most from </v>

877
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.250
<v Speaker 2>is the fact that is alienated from his </v>
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

878
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

879
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.230
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that torments him terribly.</v>

880
00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually why he hates maximus</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

881
00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Retail against the team enabled stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Maximus,</v>

882
00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:19.630
<v Speaker 2>for all of the terrible things that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to him,</v>

883
00:56:19.631 --> 00:56:23.740
<v Speaker 2>he's never severed from the father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

884
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:26.930
<v Speaker 4>and that's the thing come you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot tolerate.</v>

885
00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:30.950
<v Speaker 4>And I do think that this suffering </v>
<v Speaker 4>exceeds that of maximus.</v>

886
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect.</v>

887
00:56:32.511 --> 00:56:36.110
<v Speaker 4>Because it's so pointless</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>

888
00:56:36.111 --> 00:56:41.111
<v Speaker 4>It's such a striking and interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea then that then to be corrupt,</v>

889
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:44.840
<v Speaker 4>until it's more suffering than to be the</v>
<v Speaker 4>victim of corruption.</v>

890
00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.270
<v Speaker 4>If you're righteous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're righteous victim.</v>

891
00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:49.043
<v Speaker 4>It feels so profound and not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not not that intuitively true because </v>

892
00:56:55.221 --> 00:56:58.200
<v Speaker 4>maximum he loses everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His wife and son are murdered.</v>

893
00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:00.310
<v Speaker 4>He didn't slip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's not</v>

894
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.550
<v Speaker 4>as common as emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

895
00:57:04.551 --> 00:57:05.384
<v Speaker 4>so it's not at face value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obvious then maximus suffers less than </v>

896
00:57:09.351 --> 00:57:10.940
<v Speaker 4>comedy is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

897
00:57:10.941 --> 00:57:12.730
<v Speaker 4>I agree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seems,</v>

898
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:13.583
<v Speaker 4>but it seems to be the thesis running </v>
<v Speaker 4>throughout the theme was perhaps the </v>

899
00:57:18.501 --> 00:57:19.334
<v Speaker 4>only reason that Maxima suffers less to </v>
<v Speaker 4>some degree is that the fact that he's </v>

900
00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:25.874
<v Speaker 4>maintained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his virtue makes this suffering </v>

901
00:57:28.761 --> 00:57:31.550
<v Speaker 4>bearable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you see that as well.</v>

902
00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:35.300
<v Speaker 4>When he has the argument with the man </v>
<v Speaker 4>who comes to own him,</v>

903
00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.193
<v Speaker 4>the former of gladiator decides to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>the honorable thing and to smuggle </v>

904
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.293
<v Speaker 4>maximum sort of the of the prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He also decides to to take the path of </v>

905
00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:51.643
<v Speaker 4>virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That in some sense gives a transcendent </v>

906
00:57:54.651 --> 00:57:57.410
<v Speaker 4>meaning to his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet every deems him because he wasn't.</v>

907
00:57:57.411 --> 00:57:59.210
<v Speaker 4>He was also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was also a miserable.</v>

908
00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

909
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.963
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the redemption that interesting </v>

910
00:58:03.291 --> 00:58:04.124
<v Speaker 4>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The redemption comes at the cost of his </v>

911
00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:06.314
<v Speaker 4>own death and there's a very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>architectural theme there as well </v>

912
00:58:10.281 --> 00:58:11.114
<v Speaker 4>because it is seeing what happens is </v>
<v Speaker 4>monotheism develops in the West as a </v>

913
00:58:18.181 --> 00:58:21.390
<v Speaker 4>carbonates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least along the Christian mind,</v>

914
00:58:21.391 --> 00:58:22.224
<v Speaker 4>is thinking in the figure of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the principle that becomes the </v>

915
00:58:26.511 --> 00:58:28.670
<v Speaker 4>highest ideal is</v>

916
00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:31.083
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

917
00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.153
<v Speaker 4>It's the mode of being that takes </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering voluntarily onto itself as </v>

918
00:58:35.791 --> 00:58:37.500
<v Speaker 4>it's full responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

919
00:58:37.501 --> 00:58:40.260
<v Speaker 4>That's the acceptance of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>crucifixion,</v>

920
00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.040
<v Speaker 4>the betrayal that goes along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

921
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ spaces statement in the desert,</v>

922
00:58:45.481 --> 00:58:49.800
<v Speaker 4>so that's the confrontation with </v>
<v Speaker 4>malevolence and accepts the necessity of</v>

923
00:58:49.801 --> 00:58:52.950
<v Speaker 4>its own bodily death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's natural.</v>

924
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:53.903
<v Speaker 4>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the terrible power of nature </v>

925
00:58:55.561 --> 00:58:56.394
<v Speaker 4>manifested in death and the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>power of society manifested in the </v>

926
00:58:59.611 --> 00:59:01.620
<v Speaker 4>ability to punch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so any faces,</v>

927
00:59:01.621 --> 00:59:03.180
<v Speaker 4>all of those things voluntarily,</v>

928
00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:06.560
<v Speaker 2>and the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

929
00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:07.753
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

930
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:09.083
<v Speaker 4>psychological process that enables that </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sense of the transcendence is </v>

931
00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:17.460
<v Speaker 4>the death and rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rebirth,</v>

932
00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.960
<v Speaker 4>and to be redeemed means allow yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>to die when necessary.</v>

933
00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:27.160
<v Speaker 4>See what happens with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the,</v>

934
00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:30.020
<v Speaker 4>with the gladiator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the head gladiators.</v>

935
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:34.380
<v Speaker 4>He allows himself to die necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he dies a physical death,</v>

936
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:37.910
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's metaphysical deaths that can</v>

937
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:42.110
<v Speaker 4>be undertaken continually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a spiritual death.</v>

938
00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:42.973
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you find yourself entangled in </v>

939
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:53.620
<v Speaker 4>corruption and you need to set yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>right as a consequence,</v>

940
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:55.303
<v Speaker 4>what that means is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice some of yourself to the </v>

941
01:00:00.111 --> 01:00:03.590
<v Speaker 4>erroneous part of yourself and so the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea is that you can.</v>

942
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:07.490
<v Speaker 4>You can die and be reborn in a spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

943
01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:09.470
<v Speaker 4>That's what baptism is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

944
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:10.543
<v Speaker 4>and that that's what leads you is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>identification with that part of you </v>

945
01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:14.174
<v Speaker 4>that will die and be reborn in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>furtherance in pursuit of a higher </v>

946
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:18.974
<v Speaker 4>order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Principles</v>

947
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:23.360
<v Speaker 4>are then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the Holy Ghost.</v>

948
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:24.743
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the idea of the holy </v>
<v Speaker 4>ghost fleets as like a gel or something </v>

949
01:00:28.281 --> 01:00:29.114
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

950
01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.300
<v Speaker 4>Let me just see what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would be the best transition</v>

951
01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.610
<v Speaker 4>because we do more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we're talking about.</v>

952
01:00:40.611 --> 01:00:45.140
<v Speaker 4>Art is the next thing and you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>refer us to the last two.</v>

953
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 4>So we still have individualization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>individuation.</v>

954
01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.060
<v Speaker 4>Let's start with art,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>

955
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.100
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was looking,</v>

956
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:52.934
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a painting last night which was </v>

957
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:58.670
<v Speaker 4>Rafales transfiguration of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's this,</v>

958
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:59.743
<v Speaker 4>so the transfiguration occurs when </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ goes up on the mountain with his </v>

959
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:05.180
<v Speaker 4>disciples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's Peter,</v>

960
01:01:05.181 --> 01:01:10.181
<v Speaker 4>James and John,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and on the mountain he meets Moses,</v>

961
01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.600
<v Speaker 4>so bearer of the mosaic law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he meets a lot of show and Elijah is</v>

962
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:19.660
<v Speaker 4>a prophet who encounters the still small</v>
<v Speaker 4>voice and he's transfigured,</v>

963
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.760
<v Speaker 4>his face shines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His clothing is,</v>

964
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:24.140
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

965
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:29.750
<v Speaker 4>is lightened to an unbearable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some like whiteness and it's.</v>

966
01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:35.060
<v Speaker 4>It's too much for the disciples to </v>
<v Speaker 4>tolerate to see all this and so,</v>

967
01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.000
<v Speaker 4>so that's his transfiguration.</v>

968
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.340
<v Speaker 4>Then when he comes down from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountaintop,</v>

969
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.263
<v Speaker 4>this is all portrayed in this painting </v>
<v Speaker 4>for she seemed the transfiguration at </v>

970
01:01:45.081 --> 01:01:45.914
<v Speaker 4>the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the second part of the story at </v>

971
01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:49.970
<v Speaker 4>the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he comes down and he cast that demon out</v>

972
01:01:49.971 --> 01:01:52.850
<v Speaker 4>of a young man and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

973
01:01:52.851 --> 01:01:57.510
<v Speaker 4>that's unbelievably apropos because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

974
01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:00.470
<v Speaker 4>while you're smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see why it's apropos.</v>

975
01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:01.304
<v Speaker 4>At least to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I think that we all have the </v>

976
01:02:05.151 --> 01:02:05.984
<v Speaker 4>proclivity to be possessed to to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>greater or lesser degree by the modern </v>

977
01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:11.813
<v Speaker 4>day equivalent of of demons and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideological possession or possession by </v>

978
01:02:16.341 --> 01:02:17.174
<v Speaker 4>cynicism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>possession by that cynicism </v>

979
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:24.430
<v Speaker 4>characterized in possession by nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 4>or these totalitarian ideologies and the</v>

980
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:27.091
<v Speaker 4>question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

981
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:31.200
<v Speaker 4>how are those cast out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is,</v>

982
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:34.330
<v Speaker 4>and this is portrayed in the painting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's portrayed in the story,</v>

983
01:02:34.331 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 4>but strange story of Christ's </v>
<v Speaker 4>transfiguration and its association with</v>

984
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:39.024
<v Speaker 4>Moses and Elijah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably complex narrative </v>

985
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:42.990
<v Speaker 4>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

986
01:02:42.991 --> 01:02:43.824
<v Speaker 4>Pointing at something that was not fully</v>
<v Speaker 4>articulated like that's intuited by the </v>

987
01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:49.464
<v Speaker 4>storytellers and the artist step,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the willingness to die and be reborn in </v>

988
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:55.374
<v Speaker 4>the service of the highest principle is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the process by which possession is </v>

989
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.353
<v Speaker 4>eradicated.</v>

990
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.203
<v Speaker 4>That's an idea that idea so </v>
<v Speaker 4>overwhelmingly complicated and </v>

991
01:03:10.881 --> 01:03:11.714
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated than it has to be dreamed </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and it has to be represented </v>

992
01:03:15.451 --> 01:03:17.790
<v Speaker 4>artistically before it can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>comprehended.</v>

993
01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:21.540
<v Speaker 4>The painting by Rafaelle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one I'm describing that was regarded</v>

994
01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:26.541
<v Speaker 4>as the greatest oil painting in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world for 300 years.</v>

995
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:31.380
<v Speaker 4>It's a non trivial piece of art like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it was painted.</v>

996
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.573
<v Speaker 4>Let me just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me just check this because I might </v>

997
01:03:34.391 --> 01:03:39.391
<v Speaker 4>as well get the date right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a renaissance painting.</v>

998
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:44.760
<v Speaker 4>Rafaelle.</v>

999
01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:55.860
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so from 15,</v>

1000
01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.400
<v Speaker 4>20 to 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>

1001
01:03:57.401 --> 01:04:00.040
<v Speaker 4>that was regarded as the greatest oil </v>
<v Speaker 4>painting in the world.</v>

1002
01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:01.500
<v Speaker 4>That's three centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

1003
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:02.743
<v Speaker 4>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to think about something like </v>

1004
01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:08.530
<v Speaker 4>that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what's being represented there?</v>

1005
01:04:08.531 --> 01:04:10.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's what's being represented is</v>

1006
01:04:10.841 --> 01:04:11.674
<v Speaker 4>something akin to what I've just been </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussing and that's a good example of </v>

1007
01:04:14.621 --> 01:04:15.454
<v Speaker 4>how the artists to storytellers and at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the end the image makers are lay the </v>

1008
01:04:22.421 --> 01:04:23.254
<v Speaker 4>pathway for articulated representations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the same thing happening in </v>

1009
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.930
<v Speaker 4>cardiac,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1010
01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:28.773
<v Speaker 4>Because it's a story but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a moral to the story and </v>

1011
01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:33.183
<v Speaker 4>there's a pointer towards an articulated</v>
<v Speaker 4>set of principles potentially </v>

1012
01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:40.780
<v Speaker 4>articulated set of principles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea you just laid out,</v>

1013
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:41.703
<v Speaker 4>you think that it had to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It had to manifest itself in a dream </v>

1014
01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:50.050
<v Speaker 4>restory version before it could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>articulated like in an operational way.</v>

1015
01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:53.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because of the ideas have to look.</v>

1016
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:55.030
<v Speaker 4>The way I look at it this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this waves,</v>

1017
01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.013
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to some degree these ideas are encoded </v>

1018
01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:02.890
<v Speaker 4>in behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1019
01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:06.070
<v Speaker 4>in Exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moses received the law,</v>

1020
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:07.883
<v Speaker 4>but remember before he received the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's wandering around in the desert for </v>

1021
01:05:11.501 --> 01:05:12.334
<v Speaker 4>a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's in chaos with with a group of </v>

1022
01:05:15.881 --> 01:05:16.714
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary these</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are constantly fighting amongst </v>

1023
01:05:20.471 --> 01:05:24.190
<v Speaker 4>themselves and who are constantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>tempted to worship other idols.</v>

1024
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:30.030
<v Speaker 4>So in in a chaotic state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the temptation of principles,</v>

1025
01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.313
<v Speaker 4>we really manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What principle should be guiding us and </v>

1026
01:05:36.101 --> 01:05:40.220
<v Speaker 4>that's portrayed in the exit was story </v>
<v Speaker 4>as the proclivity to chase after false.</v>

1027
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:41.793
<v Speaker 4>Now the Israelites actually come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Moses for a very long period of time in </v>

1028
01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:49.000
<v Speaker 4>pairs or families to adjudicate </v>
<v Speaker 4>disputes,</v>

1029
01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:51.530
<v Speaker 4>and so he does that to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 4>exhaustion.</v>

1030
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:53.740
<v Speaker 4>This is prior to receiving the 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>commandments,</v>

1031
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.530
<v Speaker 4>and so what's what happens with the 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>commandments.</v>

1032
01:05:57.110 --> 01:05:57.943
<v Speaker 4>As Moses comes to realize to revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he comes to realize it and articulated </v>

1033
01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 4>manner to principles that the Israelites</v>
<v Speaker 4>are already,</v>

1034
01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:10.533
<v Speaker 4>to some degree implicitly guided by that</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually produce peace and harmony </v>

1035
01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.013
<v Speaker 4>behavioral patterns that no one knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they are because they're not </v>

1036
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.300
<v Speaker 4>conscious enough that they have mapped </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves enough.</v>

1037
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:23.163
<v Speaker 4>So the mosaic revelation is part of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>process of mapping and the mapping </v>

1038
01:06:28.331 --> 01:06:29.164
<v Speaker 4>itself is represented in the story of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Moses and within the story of Moses is </v>

1039
01:06:33.101 --> 01:06:36.110
<v Speaker 4>actually contained the articulated </v>
<v Speaker 4>virtue,</v>

1040
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 4>the commandments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1041
01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.620
<v Speaker 4>but that's only part of the process of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the unfolding of the virtue.</v>

1042
01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.820
<v Speaker 4>It still doesn't answer the question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the question.</v>

1043
01:06:44.821 --> 01:06:46.540
<v Speaker 4>It's eventually posted to Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1044
01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:47.680
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all well and good,</v>

1045
01:06:47.681 --> 01:06:50.560
<v Speaker 4>but what's the highest virtue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1046
01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:54.010
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's any insanely complicated question</v>

1047
01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:55.450
<v Speaker 4>because it's no different than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1048
01:06:55.451 --> 01:06:57.490
<v Speaker 4>how should you conduct your life?</v>

1049
01:06:57.790 --> 01:06:58.211
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1050
01:06:58.211 --> 01:06:59.044
<v Speaker 4>it's the hardest questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we've had to gather as a </v>

1051
01:07:03.431 --> 01:07:06.880
<v Speaker 4>collective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've had to gather information about,</v>

1052
01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.380
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

1053
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:09.603
<v Speaker 4>What does it look like when someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when a particular person lives in </v>

1054
01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:13.863
<v Speaker 4>undesirable life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We tell the story of someone who lives </v>

1055
01:07:16.751 --> 01:07:17.584
<v Speaker 4>in undesirable life or maybe he tells </v>
<v Speaker 4>his own story and then we aggregate a </v>

1056
01:07:20.231 --> 01:07:21.064
<v Speaker 4>hundred stories of undesirable life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then we abstract out from those stories </v>

1057
01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.740
<v Speaker 4>what constitutes undesirable and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like a picture of cane,</v>

1058
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:31.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a portrait of cane.</v>

1059
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:33.023
<v Speaker 4>We do the same thing on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We we listen to people who who've lived </v>

1060
01:07:36.611 --> 01:07:41.140
<v Speaker 4>triumphantly and we aggregate their </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories and we set the size of you say,</v>

1061
01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:41.974
<v Speaker 4>well then we we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we extract from that a portrait of able </v>

1062
01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:45.243
<v Speaker 4>and that's a precursor like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the successful and the unsuccessful are </v>

1063
01:07:50.501 --> 01:07:55.501
<v Speaker 4>precursors to Abel and Cain and Abel and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cain are precursors to the divine,</v>

1064
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.823
<v Speaker 4>the divine finger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the divine figures of Christ that </v>

1065
01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:00.860
<v Speaker 4>Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1066
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:01.703
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an abstract process of continual </v>

1067
01:08:04.091 --> 01:08:04.924
<v Speaker 4>abstraction and that's all done through </v>
<v Speaker 4>at least to begin with through ritual </v>

1068
01:08:09.191 --> 01:08:13.690
<v Speaker 4>and narrative and art is so complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can't be done then the other way,</v>

1069
01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:19.620
<v Speaker 4>so first it's acted out and an entrusted</v>
<v Speaker 4>domain of ritual art and narratives.</v>

1070
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:24.930
<v Speaker 4>Then it becomes operational like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>traditional loop,</v>

1071
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because once,</v>

1072
01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.150
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you get the image of the ritual,</v>

1073
01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 4>then those modes of communication start </v>
<v Speaker 4>to alter behavior,</v>

1074
01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:35.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like,</v>

1075
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:37.460
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why we're having this discussion.</v>

1076
01:08:37.461 --> 01:08:38.294
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about a movie that's an </v>

1077
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:41.534
<v Speaker 4>artistic representation and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussing it to articulate principles </v>

1078
01:08:44.811 --> 01:08:45.644
<v Speaker 4>and we're also articulating those </v>
<v Speaker 4>principles so that in principle our </v>

1079
01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:51.770
<v Speaker 4>behavior can be altered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I never thought about the loop.</v>

1080
01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See these things,</v>

1081
01:08:54.111 --> 01:08:56.090
<v Speaker 4>these things feed back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1082
01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:57.300
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1083
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:58.243
<v Speaker 4>it's the collective behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that negotiation at the collective </v>

1084
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:05.350
<v Speaker 4>level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fractious centuries long linear,</v>

1085
01:09:05.351 --> 01:09:09.140
<v Speaker 4>long negotiation that produces something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1086
01:09:09.141 --> 01:09:09.974
<v Speaker 4>Synthesis synthesis is represented in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in drama and mythology and ritual and </v>

1087
01:09:15.471 --> 01:09:17.000
<v Speaker 4>art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then next articulate.</v>

1088
01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:17.913
<v Speaker 4>But those notes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the whole process starts to </v>

1089
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.770
<v Speaker 4>spiral up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spiral upward editing,</v>

1090
01:09:24.771 --> 01:09:28.180
<v Speaker 4>increasingly rapid rate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So look,</v>

1091
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.693
<v Speaker 4>when I was always wondering that if this</v>
<v Speaker 4>archetypal patterns that lead to the </v>

1092
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:36.560
<v Speaker 4>most favorable life are already known </v>
<v Speaker 4>for such a long time,</v>

1093
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:39.500
<v Speaker 4>why does any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every generation seems to have to invent</v>

1094
01:09:39.501 --> 01:09:40.820
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1095
01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:41.763
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no to known like one of the </v>

1096
01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:44.384
<v Speaker 4>things but plato,</v>
<v Speaker 4>socrates insisted on was that learning </v>

1097
01:09:49.671 --> 01:09:50.750
<v Speaker 4>was remembering.</v>

1098
01:09:52.690 --> 01:09:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's say that when you're born you,</v>

1099
01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:59.920
<v Speaker 4>you have a proclivity to manifest the </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of patterns and you certainly do.</v>

1100
01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.980
<v Speaker 4>You can manifest the patterns of rage </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fear and hunger and thirst and like,</v>

1101
01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.340
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then also imagined,</v>

1102
01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:11.410
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's something like this,</v>

1103
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:18.170
<v Speaker 4>as this looping process occurred,</v>

1104
01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.633
<v Speaker 4>the people who are more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest the pattern that is being </v>

1105
01:10:25.301 --> 01:10:30.301
<v Speaker 4>pointed to are more practically likely </v>
<v Speaker 4>to live and to successfully propagate.</v>

1106
01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:35.973
<v Speaker 4>So there's an evolutionary elephant that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the society values something and the </v>

1107
01:10:42.101 --> 01:10:42.934
<v Speaker 4>degree to which you manifest that value </v>
<v Speaker 4>is proportionate to your success and </v>

1108
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:50.080
<v Speaker 4>your success is proportionate to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>reproductive fitness.</v>

1109
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:51.303
<v Speaker 4>Then as that overtime the proclivity for</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of ethical behavior will </v>

1110
01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:02.350
<v Speaker 4>become coded in some sense in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>genetic structure selected for,</v>

1111
01:11:05.651 --> 01:11:07.210
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then you might say,</v>

1112
01:11:07.211 --> 01:11:10.300
<v Speaker 4>well that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is Mrs. What the archetype is.</v>

1113
01:11:10.301 --> 01:11:11.134
<v Speaker 4>In some sense it exists as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility of being gripped by a </v>

1114
01:11:15.391 --> 01:11:16.224
<v Speaker 4>particular kind division.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there might be enough diversity in </v>

1115
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:24.120
<v Speaker 4>the ideal so that you can't emerge from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the womb</v>

1116
01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:29.220
<v Speaker 4>fully Christian if you don't know what I</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean,</v>

1117
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:33.403
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that there won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>be something that can suit you as a </v>

1118
01:11:37.441 --> 01:11:38.274
<v Speaker 4>consequence of observing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifestation of a kind of ideal and it </v>

1119
01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:45.990
<v Speaker 4>doesn't to you because otherwise you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be gripped by the damn stories.</v>

1120
01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.160
<v Speaker 4>But here's the rub to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't be hard coded.</v>

1121
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:56.490
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's,</v>

1122
01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:59.850
<v Speaker 4>here's something interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity.</v>

1123
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:05.300
<v Speaker 4>It was actually posed as an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>question in and the musical Jesus Christ</v>

1124
01:12:05.881 --> 01:12:08.470
<v Speaker 4>superstar near the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1125
01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:09.603
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1126
01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:10.503
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actor who played Judas asked Christ </v>

1127
01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:16.830
<v Speaker 4>after he's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of a,</v>

1128
01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:20.730
<v Speaker 4>there's a scene where everyone's singing</v>
<v Speaker 4>and dancing.</v>

1129
01:12:20.731 --> 01:12:25.731
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange sort of disco scene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Judas asks why Christ had to come to</v>

1130
01:12:26.281 --> 01:12:27.114
<v Speaker 4>Earth at such a strange time and in such</v>
<v Speaker 4>an isolated place because he appears as </v>

1131
01:12:32.071 --> 01:12:35.690
<v Speaker 4>a carpenter in a region,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1132
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:37.680
<v Speaker 4>2000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why then,</v>

1133
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:38.603
<v Speaker 4>why is there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that answer is the divine principle </v>

1134
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:48.590
<v Speaker 4>has to manifest itself constantly within</v>
<v Speaker 4>the confines of an individual life.</v>

1135
01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:54.080
<v Speaker 4>With all of the peculiar idiosyncrasies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and limitation for that individual life,</v>

1136
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:55.823
<v Speaker 4>and so part of the reason that the ideal</v>
<v Speaker 4>beckons is because you can't just be </v>

1137
01:13:01.621 --> 01:13:06.621
<v Speaker 4>born as Christ</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Christ represents,</v>

1138
01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this overarching idea.</v>

1139
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:09.053
<v Speaker 4>It's actually been union of the divine </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the particulars of your time and </v>

1140
01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:16.620
<v Speaker 4>place and so because your particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes.</v>

1141
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.143
<v Speaker 4>Then you have to determine how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest the archetype in your </v>

1142
01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:23.184
<v Speaker 4>conditions and your specific conditions </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's partly associated with that </v>

1143
01:13:27.811 --> 01:13:31.350
<v Speaker 4>dialogue with your conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's an architecture mode of being</v>

1144
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:33.083
<v Speaker 4>supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideally we'd have to integrate in with </v>

1145
01:13:34.891 --> 01:13:39.090
<v Speaker 4>your surroundings and what needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>met.</v>

1146
01:13:39.091 --> 01:13:42.090
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to be manifest in the particulars</v>

1147
01:13:42.091 --> 01:13:45.450
<v Speaker 4>of your time and place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the individuation process.</v>

1148
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:50.160
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what it is because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>regard the self.</v>

1149
01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:54.440
<v Speaker 4>You'll regard to Christ as a symbol of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the self.</v>

1150
01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:55.323
<v Speaker 4>He actually reversed the spiritual and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychological and sociological and </v>

1151
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.240
<v Speaker 4>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he thought he was thinking about the</v>

1152
01:14:03.241 --> 01:14:07.130
<v Speaker 4>cosmic Christ as for Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>selfless,</v>

1153
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:07.973
<v Speaker 4>the totality of individual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was everything that you were </v>

1154
01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 4>right</v>

1155
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:14.800
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that you were in the past,</v>

1156
01:14:14.801 --> 01:14:15.634
<v Speaker 2>but also everything that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly become a cross your set of </v>

1157
01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 2>potential futures.</v>

1158
01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:24.173
<v Speaker 1>Here's there's one paragraph from young </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to send to you in the </v>

1159
01:14:26.901 --> 01:14:30.060
<v Speaker 1>chat right now and I would like to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>you if you could,</v>

1160
01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.093
<v Speaker 1>could read it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that long because I think that </v>

1161
01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.320
<v Speaker 1>illustrates exactly what what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1162
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm sending you a link.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you click on it,</v>

1163
01:14:46.161 --> 01:14:46.994
<v Speaker 1>it's an image.</v>

1164
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:53.760
<v Speaker 2>What is summit is for each</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the bug unfolds and from the lesser</v>

1165
01:14:55.851 --> 01:14:59.240
<v Speaker 2>to greater emergence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As Nietzsche says,</v>

1166
01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.133
<v Speaker 2>one becomes two and a greater faker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which always was but which remained </v>

1167
01:15:04.671 --> 01:15:05.504
<v Speaker 2>invisible appears to the lesser </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality with the force of </v>

1168
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.980
<v Speaker 2>revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1169
01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:12.260
<v Speaker 2>and that's the manifestation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>self.</v>

1170
01:15:12.261 --> 01:15:15.110
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that is is an intimation of who you</v>

1171
01:15:15.111 --> 01:15:20.111
<v Speaker 2>could be and it's also an intimation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're associated with.</v>

1172
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:22.820
<v Speaker 2>That might guide you to what you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

1173
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.030
<v Speaker 2>so you might say it's a revelation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your old core stability,</v>

1174
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's your rev revelation of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility in relationship to something</v>

1175
01:15:31.251 --> 01:15:33.220
<v Speaker 2>that's infinite transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1176
01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.100
<v Speaker 2>That's the one I would also say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that does.</v>

1177
01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:38.023
<v Speaker 2>That is also very commonly manifested by</v>
<v Speaker 2>a transformation in the relationship </v>

1178
01:15:43.131 --> 01:15:46.280
<v Speaker 2>with conscious because when something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this happens,</v>

1179
01:15:46.281 --> 01:15:48.350
<v Speaker 2>sometimes this happens to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1180
01:15:48.351 --> 01:15:52.700
<v Speaker 2>in a hallucinatory or psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

1181
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:54.103
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start to take their conscience </v>

1182
01:15:55.641 --> 01:16:00.560
<v Speaker 2>seriously as the CEO believed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least to some degree that</v>

1183
01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:04.883
<v Speaker 2>what guided your interest and that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>include your conscious was a </v>

1184
01:16:07.381 --> 01:16:08.214
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of the totality of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>self in the restricted domain of the </v>

1185
01:16:13.411 --> 01:16:15.040
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1186
01:16:15.041 --> 01:16:15.781
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1187
01:16:15.781 --> 01:16:17.330
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay.</v>

1188
01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Which one always was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but which remained invisible,</v>

1189
01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:23.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the heavenly father.</v>

1190
01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:26.870
<v Speaker 2>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The markets are really as principal,</v>

1191
01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.970
<v Speaker 2>that manifested itself in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1192
01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:29.933
<v Speaker 2>in Maximus that resists and which </v>
<v Speaker 2>markets really has also made himself </v>

1193
01:16:37.711 --> 01:16:40.830
<v Speaker 2>subordinate to at least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1194
01:16:40.890 --> 01:16:44.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the one which always was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but which remained invisible.</v>

1195
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:45.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1196
01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:51.740
<v Speaker 2>He was truly an hopelessly little will </v>
<v Speaker 2>always drank.</v>

1197
01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:52.574
<v Speaker 2>The revelation of the greater down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of this littleness and will </v>

1198
01:16:57.201 --> 01:17:00.750
<v Speaker 2>never understand that the day of </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgment for his littleness has dawn,</v>

1199
01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:07.320
<v Speaker 2>the man who is inwardly great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll know that the long expected friend</v>

1200
01:17:07.321 --> 01:17:08.154
<v Speaker 2>of his soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the immortal one has now really come to </v>

1201
01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:12.194
<v Speaker 2>lead captivity captive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is to seize hold of him by who was </v>

1202
01:17:16.561 --> 01:17:17.394
<v Speaker 2>a mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had always been confined and held </v>

1203
01:17:18.951 --> 01:17:22.100
<v Speaker 2>prisoner and to make his life flow into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that greater life.</v>

1204
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:24.380
<v Speaker 2>A moment of deadliest peril.</v>

1205
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:28.223
<v Speaker 2>Just prophetic vision of the tightrope </v>
<v Speaker 2>Walker reveals the awful danger that </v>

1206
01:17:31.861 --> 01:17:32.694
<v Speaker 2>lies in having a tight rope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking attitude towards an event to </v>

1207
01:17:35.971 --> 01:17:39.330
<v Speaker 2>which St Paul gave the most exalted name</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could find.</v>

1208
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's quite a.</v>

1209
01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:46.610
<v Speaker 2>that's quite the densely pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one</v>

1210
01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:49.883
<v Speaker 2>it's from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's from the archetypes and the </v>

1211
01:17:50.911 --> 01:17:55.020
<v Speaker 2>collective unconscious page 1:21 if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's volume one,</v>

1212
01:17:55.021 --> 01:17:56.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because volume two is ion,</v>

1213
01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:59.010
<v Speaker 2>which is even more frightening books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>

1214
01:17:59.011 --> 01:17:59.844
<v Speaker 2>because in apparel talks about there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the parallel psychosis at least in part </v>

1215
01:18:04.231 --> 01:18:08.760
<v Speaker 2>inflation because the manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1216
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:11.850
<v Speaker 2>that second figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but say the self,</v>

1217
01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:13.170
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1218
01:18:13.170 --> 01:18:14.003
<v Speaker 2>it's a devil's temptation as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>because once you see that there's a </v>

1219
01:18:18.241 --> 01:18:21.000
<v Speaker 2>relationship between you and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent,</v>

1220
01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:24.510
<v Speaker 2>let's say you start to take that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously and you can,</v>

1221
01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.823
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can become inflated by that </v>

1222
01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:31.560
<v Speaker 2>prophetic duty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1223
01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:35.130
<v Speaker 2>and and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a very dangerous.</v>

1224
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:39.220
<v Speaker 2>He actually writes this like 20 pages </v>
<v Speaker 2>further,</v>

1225
01:18:39.221 --> 01:18:40.054
<v Speaker 2>use this for the great psych danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which always is always connected with </v>

1226
01:18:42.901 --> 01:18:43.734
<v Speaker 2>individuation lies in the identification</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ego consciousness with the self is </v>

1227
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:49.230
<v Speaker 2>produced inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which Trenton,</v>

1228
01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:53.030
<v Speaker 2>which threatens conscience consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>is illusion.</v>

1229
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote a great essay,</v>

1230
01:18:54.941 --> 01:18:58.410
<v Speaker 2>a great essay called relations between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ego and the unconscious,</v>

1231
01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.633
<v Speaker 2>which is completely unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incomprehensible unless you know the </v>

1232
01:19:02.311 --> 01:19:03.144
<v Speaker 2>background that we're discussing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't very carefully that you have </v>

1233
01:19:07.261 --> 01:19:10.910
<v Speaker 2>to stay in the proper relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the self,</v>

1234
01:19:10.911 --> 01:19:12.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the self overtakes the,</v>

1235
01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:14.043
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1236
01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:15.023
<v Speaker 2>the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's a descent into like manic </v>

1237
01:19:18.811 --> 01:19:23.340
<v Speaker 2>religious insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That ones has to be struck where there's</v>

1238
01:19:23.341 --> 01:19:24.174
<v Speaker 2>a relationship with the transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also still the grounding in </v>

1239
01:19:28.381 --> 01:19:32.400
<v Speaker 2>the particular stuff here and now you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see this echoed this idea equity.</v>

1240
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:33.253
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the superhero mythology that </v>

1241
01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:39.180
<v Speaker 2>dominated the adolescents imagination in</v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century,</v>

1242
01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 2>every superhero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine the superhero.</v>

1243
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:46.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like a partial manifestation of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>redemptive archetype.</v>

1244
01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Every superhero has to have an alter </v>
<v Speaker 2>ego.</v>

1245
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.090
<v Speaker 2>And the alter ego well for Superman is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clark camp,</v>

1246
01:19:54.091 --> 01:19:57.240
<v Speaker 2>mild mannered reporter and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spiderman,</v>

1247
01:19:57.241 --> 01:19:58.170
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1248
01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.590
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>troubled high school,</v>

1249
01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:01.443
<v Speaker 2>cause I nerd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's so interesting about those </v>

1250
01:20:05.431 --> 01:20:10.080
<v Speaker 2>stories is that they understand without </v>
<v Speaker 2>the alter ego,</v>

1251
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:15.200
<v Speaker 2>there's no superhero that both of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to exist at the same time,</v>

1252
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:16.853
<v Speaker 2>the limitations and the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the transcendence of the limitations </v>

1253
01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:25.750
<v Speaker 2>have to both be there at that terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradoxical juxtaposition</v>

1254
01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:28.713
<v Speaker 2>because the character isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The character can't exist without that </v>

1255
01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:35.520
<v Speaker 2>tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's.</v>

1256
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:36.683
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that motif wouldn't recur continually </v>

1257
01:20:38.581 --> 01:20:43.581
<v Speaker 2>unless there was something to it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was narratively precise and accurate.</v>

1258
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:45.953
<v Speaker 1>There's something in this paragraph that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to tie it together when our </v>

1259
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:52.320
<v Speaker 1>previous stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you talks about the end stage of</v>

1260
01:20:52.321 --> 01:20:55.680
<v Speaker 1>individuation as a coming together with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the immortal.</v>

1261
01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:56.573
<v Speaker 1>It goes with the immortal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Joseph Campbell Campbell does </v>

1262
01:20:58.711 --> 01:20:59.850
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1263
01:20:59.851 --> 01:21:00.684
<v Speaker 1>the Christ in you doesn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Christ and you survived the death </v>

1264
01:21:03.271 --> 01:21:05.910
<v Speaker 1>and resurrection and use that in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>last talk.</v>

1265
01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.730
<v Speaker 1>When you close your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1266
01:21:09.650 --> 01:21:10.483
<v Speaker 1>you've never elaborated on the death of </v>
<v Speaker 1>socrates and how he died in truth and </v>

1267
01:21:14.601 --> 01:21:15.434
<v Speaker 1>honor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you said that part of the </v>

1268
01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:20.040
<v Speaker 1>spirit doesn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is this theme of</v>

1269
01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:26.660
<v Speaker 1>these people are somehow connected with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is immortal and eternal,</v>

1270
01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:32.430
<v Speaker 1>could not be understood simply as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have</v>

1271
01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:38.040
<v Speaker 1>established a relationship with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal mode of being that is eternal</v>

1272
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.870
<v Speaker 1>and that continues to exist beyond them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and before them,</v>

1273
01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:44.003
<v Speaker 1>but they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've established a relationship with </v>

1274
01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:46.210
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what that,</v>

1275
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:47.150
<v Speaker 1>what he means by,</v>

1276
01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:50.330
<v Speaker 2>by the immortal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1277
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:52.000
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is what's meant.</v>

1278
01:21:52.001 --> 01:21:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that.</v>

1279
01:21:53.290 --> 01:21:55.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the turtle pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's theater.</v>

1280
01:21:56.230 --> 01:22:00.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're the eternal music and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the music goes on.</v>

1281
01:22:00.461 --> 01:22:01.294
<v Speaker 2>Even if you depart the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Christian is a Christian insistence </v>

1282
01:22:05.101 --> 01:22:05.934
<v Speaker 2>so that that I also wouldn't overlook </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that also characterized as the </v>

1283
01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:13.540
<v Speaker 2>finite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1284
01:22:13.541 --> 01:22:18.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the promise of the resurrection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The resurrection of the body is that the</v>

1285
01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:18.993
<v Speaker 2>Christians insists that about </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent factor exists and that's </v>

1286
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:24.183
<v Speaker 2>the Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the word that's there at the </v>

1287
01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:29.020
<v Speaker 2>beginning of time and at the end of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>as as the judging revelation,</v>

1288
01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:33.200
<v Speaker 2>write this transcendent locals that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>eternal,</v>

1289
01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:37.510
<v Speaker 2>but that's no more valuable in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

1290
01:22:37.570 --> 01:22:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Then the particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>creature that's that's,</v>

1291
01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:42.613
<v Speaker 2>that's subject to apparent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparent permanent death and it's very </v>

1292
01:22:49.061 --> 01:22:49.894
<v Speaker 2>difficult for modern people to grant the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of the bodily resurrection any </v>

1293
01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.153
<v Speaker 2>credence and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not something of which anyone can </v>

1294
01:23:01.211 --> 01:23:03.790
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe with any degree of</v>

1295
01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:08.873
<v Speaker 2>what would you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing the Oregon consort or something </v>

1296
01:23:11.161 --> 01:23:14.280
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same token,</v>

1297
01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:18.420
<v Speaker 2>the world is a very strange place and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't obvious to me that</v>

1298
01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I've learned to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned to be very cautious in</v>

1299
01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Housley dismissing deep and ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas regardless of their strangeness,</v>

1300
01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:37.810
<v Speaker 2>and I do think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1301
01:23:37.811 --> 01:23:38.644
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's so interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Christian insistence is that it </v>

1302
01:23:41.890 --> 01:23:46.890
<v Speaker 2>valorizes the particular unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>important because you could say,</v>

1303
01:23:47.171 --> 01:23:48.004
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's merely a matter of the eternal </v>

1304
01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.113
<v Speaker 2>and the particular doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then if the particular doesn't </v>

1305
01:23:54.221 --> 01:23:55.054
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ended up with that kind of </v>

1306
01:23:55.721 --> 01:24:00.000
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic Buddhism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the suffering that characterizes or even</v>

1307
01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:00.853
<v Speaker 2>in the proclivity for Christianity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>degenerate into the forums that Nisha </v>

1308
01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 2>criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is well,</v>

1309
01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:10.810
<v Speaker 2>when you chase everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do an eternal beyond.</v>

1310
01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.033
<v Speaker 2>It justifies everything terrible that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening on earth as trivial and </v>

1311
01:24:14.861 --> 01:24:15.694
<v Speaker 2>insignificant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That relieves you of your moral </v>

1312
01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:19.450
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for addressing it.</v>

1313
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:22.810
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the very minimum,</v>

1314
01:24:22.811 --> 01:24:23.644
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the body is resurrected </v>
<v Speaker 2>valorization of the value of the </v>

1315
01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:29.644
<v Speaker 2>particular here and now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an emphasis on the fact that that </v>

1316
01:24:34.061 --> 01:24:37.780
<v Speaker 2>has defined value as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be attended to and cared for</v>

1317
01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:40.120
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At minimum it stopped.</v>

1318
01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:44.330
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one.</v>

1319
01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.460
<v Speaker 1>One thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1320
01:24:45.461 --> 01:24:46.294
<v Speaker 1>under paragraph I want to reflect on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the when you sense that </v>

1321
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.280
<v Speaker 1>individuation is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be a moment of deadliest apparel.</v>

1322
01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 1>And then he refers to the tightrope </v>
<v Speaker 1>walker from now.</v>

1323
01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:57.243
<v Speaker 1>What this means is that it can be so the</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger can be so great when you embark </v>

1324
01:25:02.221 --> 01:25:07.221
<v Speaker 1>on individuation in almost by definition</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that the lesser you,</v>

1325
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:10.950
<v Speaker 1>unless they're part of your soul and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your soul as to die,</v>

1326
01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.710
<v Speaker 1>and then I think I've been there and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my own life,</v>

1327
01:25:15.711 --> 01:25:16.544
<v Speaker 1>and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that requires violence and recovery is </v>

1328
01:25:20.731 --> 01:25:21.930
<v Speaker 1>by no means guaranteed,</v>

1329
01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:22.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly.</v>

1330
01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why.</v>

1331
01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:24.563
<v Speaker 2>That's why that Motif,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the Motif of going into the </v>

1332
01:25:27.151 --> 01:25:28.510
<v Speaker 2>abyss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to to,</v>

1333
01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:32.400
<v Speaker 2>to rescue your father like it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>abyss.</v>

1334
01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:36.860
<v Speaker 2>There's no guarantee that you'll emerge </v>
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>

1335
01:25:38.690 --> 01:25:41.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's genuine peril.</v>

1336
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Now the you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1337
01:25:45.450 --> 01:25:49.170
<v Speaker 2>the what you need to be armed with in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense to face.</v>

1338
01:25:49.171 --> 01:25:54.171
<v Speaker 2>That is the willingness to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that faith in rebirth,</v>

1339
01:25:54.810 --> 01:25:56.080
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1340
01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:59.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1341
01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:00.093
<v Speaker 2>the willingness as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the decision to start abide by the </v>

1342
01:26:04.131 --> 01:26:08.040
<v Speaker 2>truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in a moment of great peril,</v>

1343
01:26:08.041 --> 01:26:08.874
<v Speaker 2>this is another thing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things I think that </v>

1344
01:26:11.431 --> 01:26:12.264
<v Speaker 2>terrified me into</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempting to abide by the truth to the </v>

1345
01:26:16.841 --> 01:26:18.570
<v Speaker 2>degree that I've been able to manage </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1346
01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:19.613
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to understand not least by </v>

1347
01:26:21.101 --> 01:26:24.640
<v Speaker 2>reading young that there were some </v>
<v Speaker 2>points in my life where I needed to rely</v>

1348
01:26:24.641 --> 01:26:25.474
<v Speaker 2>on my own judgment that I would be in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular situation that no one could </v>

1349
01:26:29.821 --> 01:26:34.800
<v Speaker 2>advise me about because no one would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have access to the information about the</v>

1350
01:26:34.801 --> 01:26:37.380
<v Speaker 2>particularities of my situation that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have</v>

1351
01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:39.270
<v Speaker 1>and that I can call on</v>

1352
01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:42.800
<v Speaker 2>my relationship with the eternal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say to some degree.</v>

1353
01:26:42.801 --> 01:26:46.670
<v Speaker 2>But if I had worked and corrupted my own</v>
<v Speaker 2>judgment</v>

1354
01:26:48.730 --> 01:26:49.563
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the necessity for a decision </v>

1355
01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.690
<v Speaker 1>emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would make the wrong decision and then</v>

1356
01:26:55.691 --> 01:26:56.524
<v Speaker 1>I'd be lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What stood out to me the few times you </v>

1357
01:26:59.111 --> 01:27:03.350
<v Speaker 1>talked about this in a few lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as a sidetrack,</v>

1358
01:27:03.370 --> 01:27:06.170
<v Speaker 1>you talked about the death of the soul </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

1359
01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:09.070
<v Speaker 1>what stood out to me is that you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>this in a very,</v>

1360
01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:11.380
<v Speaker 1>very efficient route when you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt.</v>

1361
01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:14.500
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to me like you felt the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity of it.</v>

1362
01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:16.043
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you kind of laid out your </v>

1363
01:27:20.351 --> 01:27:22.660
<v Speaker 1>own story that you had to stop drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop smoking,</v>

1364
01:27:22.661 --> 01:27:25.390
<v Speaker 1>do to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to focus more on your work</v>

1365
01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:28.490
<v Speaker 1>intuitively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was to,</v>

1366
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:29.533
<v Speaker 1>it was a kind of a disparity between how</v>
<v Speaker 1>visceral you could talk about the death </v>

1367
01:27:33.521 --> 01:27:37.660
<v Speaker 1>of the soul and what you described as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that meant for you,</v>

1368
01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:42.190
<v Speaker 1>which I interpreted as mainly changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>your lifestyle a little and,</v>

1369
01:27:42.210 --> 01:27:43.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1370
01:27:43.090 --> 01:27:48.090
<v Speaker 1>and focus on your studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question would be why?</v>

1371
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think I saw the disparity and</v>

1372
01:27:51.370 --> 01:27:52.203
<v Speaker 1>if the disparities in the there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you can talk about the </v>

1373
01:27:55.091 --> 01:27:56.680
<v Speaker 1>death of the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which such figures?</v>

1374
01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I do think that there are things</v>

1375
01:28:02.021 --> 01:28:02.854
<v Speaker 2>that are worse than death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that psychological </v>

1376
01:28:07.001 --> 01:28:07.834
<v Speaker 2>disintegration might be worse than death</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it can go on for so long and it </v>

1377
01:28:12.571 --> 01:28:17.310
<v Speaker 2>can be so incredibly painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To your point about communists,</v>

1378
01:28:17.370 --> 01:28:18.203
<v Speaker 2>communists is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the state that he exists in is </v>

1379
01:28:21.151 --> 01:28:22.200
<v Speaker 2>worse than death.</v>

1380
01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:23.843
<v Speaker 1>It's hell</v>

1381
01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:28.050
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The disparity.</v>

1382
01:28:28.051 --> 01:28:30.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure exactly what you meant by </v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1383
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:33.343
<v Speaker 1>meant</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk with such vigor and then start </v>

1384
01:28:36.261 --> 01:28:38.420
<v Speaker 1>your fist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're awake about the death of the soul.</v>

1385
01:28:38.890 --> 01:28:42.280
<v Speaker 1>And then when you talked about letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of yourself die,</v>

1386
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:43.633
<v Speaker 1>you said it was mainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was stopped drinking and stopped </v>

1387
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:48.103
<v Speaker 1>smoking.</v>

1388
01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:49.613
<v Speaker 2>Zero responsibility I would say needs to</v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree is the letting go of that </v>

1389
01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:59.700
<v Speaker 2>because I had to make a choice between </v>
<v Speaker 2>something approximating gratifying,</v>

1390
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:02.543
<v Speaker 2>immediate pleasure seeking and hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>social or hyper social way of Ba now </v>

1391
01:29:07.501 --> 01:29:12.501
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't sustainable and in many ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>for obvious reasons and doing,</v>

1392
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:15.083
<v Speaker 2>doing the difficult intellectual work </v>
<v Speaker 2>already had decided to embark on and </v>

1393
01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 2>that was a death of a previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

1394
01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:26.450
<v Speaker 2>It is trivial in some sense because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1395
01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.753
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's burning off that which obviously </v>

1396
01:29:30.241 --> 01:29:33.810
<v Speaker 2>needs to be burned off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would also say by the same token,</v>

1397
01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:36.270
<v Speaker 2>that that doesn't make it a straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward process.</v>

1398
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:38.130
<v Speaker 2>You alluded to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1399
01:29:38.131 --> 01:29:38.964
<v Speaker 2>you said that you underwent a similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>set of experiences where the old parts </v>

1400
01:29:44.401 --> 01:29:45.840
<v Speaker 2>of you had to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1401
01:29:45.841 --> 01:29:46.950
<v Speaker 2>well that's</v>

1402
01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:53.430
<v Speaker 2>sub optimal and immature as they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1403
01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.433
<v Speaker 2>NGOs are still parts that are alive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>still and still an element of your </v>

1404
01:29:58.861 --> 01:29:59.694
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might even be parts that you love </v>

1405
01:30:01.681 --> 01:30:02.514
<v Speaker 2>and that other people love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are certainly things that </v>

1406
01:30:05.491 --> 01:30:06.324
<v Speaker 2>you're familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their modes of being that you're </v>

1407
01:30:08.730 --> 01:30:09.563
<v Speaker 2>familiar with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a major sacrifice to live elements </v>

1408
01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:16.470
<v Speaker 2>of your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a proper sacrifice.</v>

1409
01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:20.850
<v Speaker 2>It was not an indictment on your report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

1410
01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:21.993
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with the identity politics </v>

1411
01:30:24.451 --> 01:30:29.220
<v Speaker 2>types as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the proclivity is always to sacrifice</v>

1412
01:30:29.230 --> 01:30:34.230
<v Speaker 2>someone else feel oppressive and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>always externalized the oppressor,</v>

1413
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:40.230
<v Speaker 2>but in the individuation process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the oppressor.</v>

1414
01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:44.100
<v Speaker 2>You are the oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's much.</v>

1415
01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.870
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is also the problem,</v>

1416
01:30:45.871 --> 01:30:46.704
<v Speaker 2>this is something I really came to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what I was writing the </v>

1417
01:30:48.301 --> 01:30:51.270
<v Speaker 2>forward for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new version of social gets in school</v>

1418
01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:54.430
<v Speaker 2>like archipelago was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the problem here?</v>

1419
01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.313
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something has to be sacrificed and put </v>

1420
01:30:58.291 --> 01:31:01.600
<v Speaker 2>the world right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well who,</v>

1421
01:31:01.650 --> 01:31:04.000
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who or what is going to be sacrificed,</v>

1422
01:31:04.001 --> 01:31:04.834
<v Speaker 2>but you better make the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifices established the right </v>

1423
01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:10.090
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1424
01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:15.120
<v Speaker 2>let's identify the evil as something </v>
<v Speaker 2>external to us and sacrifice that well.</v>

1425
01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:16.960
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1426
01:31:16.961 --> 01:31:20.380
<v Speaker 2>what it meant in the Russian revolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that everyone died,</v>

1427
01:31:21.130 --> 01:31:23.910
<v Speaker 2>but more specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was killed.</v>

1428
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:26.830
<v Speaker 2>They were made into a burnt offering</v>

1429
01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.950
<v Speaker 2>to God and it was inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1430
01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:34.500
<v Speaker 2>what if you're going to sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to sacrifice yourself,</v>

1431
01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:36.293
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>

1432
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:37.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>

1433
01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:42.860
<v Speaker 2>That's the crucifixion metaphor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifices.</v>

1434
01:31:43.890 --> 01:31:46.620
<v Speaker 2>You allow those parts of you that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unworthy to die.</v>

1435
01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:49.580
<v Speaker 2>You encourage them to die even and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1436
01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:50.503
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want to be foolish to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's merely a matter of pursuing </v>

1437
01:31:55.111 --> 01:31:56.430
<v Speaker 2>your bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1438
01:31:56.431 --> 01:31:57.180
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1439
01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:02.180
<v Speaker 2>in the Joseph Campbell manner or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe in the city.</v>

1440
01:32:06.810 --> 01:32:09.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's being a bit hard on Campbell,</v>

1441
01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:12.290
<v Speaker 2>but it was an unfortunate phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1442
01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:17.340
<v Speaker 2>because if he knew better because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew about the journey into the abyss,</v>

1443
01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:21.210
<v Speaker 2>the sacrifice is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's partial,</v>

1444
01:32:21.211 --> 01:32:22.260
<v Speaker 2>it's still a depth.</v>

1445
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I think also that this is why the death </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rebirth,</v>

1446
01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:31.290
<v Speaker 1>rebirth theme resonates so immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1447
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:34.550
<v Speaker 1>in popular culture and in literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1448
01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:35.533
<v Speaker 1>Gandalf who fell into the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bell rock and then emerged as the </v>

1449
01:32:40.611 --> 01:32:41.130
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

1450
01:32:41.130 --> 01:32:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone's,</v>

1451
01:32:42.011 --> 01:32:43.450
<v Speaker 2>everyone's soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1452
01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.353
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1453
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:49.510
<v Speaker 2>that's a real representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transfiguration of Moses Christ Gandalf,</v>

1454
01:32:49.561 --> 01:32:50.394
<v Speaker 2>the white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like tolkien didn't know </v>

1455
01:32:53.311 --> 01:32:57.060
<v Speaker 2>these things and he knew these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly well.</v>

1456
01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:58.830
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In such a relief.</v>

1457
01:32:58.831 --> 01:33:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was a kid reading Lord</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the rings for the first time,</v>

1458
01:33:01.561 --> 01:33:02.394
<v Speaker 2>I was so appalled when gandalf </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappeared and so relieved when he </v>

1459
01:33:05.150 --> 01:33:06.800
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was like,</v>

1460
01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.690
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>GANDALF's garden.</v>

1461
01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the death of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1462
01:33:11.011 --> 01:33:12.660
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to do?</v>

1463
01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Open the great wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has disappeared.</v>

1464
01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1465
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.733
<v Speaker 2>And it is a terrible trial and you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with Gandalf's experiences in </v>

1466
01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.970
<v Speaker 2>underworld and he comes out white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1467
01:33:23.971 --> 01:33:24.804
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes up white white's interesting </v>

1468
01:33:26.191 --> 01:33:28.890
<v Speaker 2>because white is the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then white is purity,</v>

1469
01:33:28.891 --> 01:33:31.290
<v Speaker 2>but why is also age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1470
01:33:31.291 --> 01:33:32.124
<v Speaker 2>and to undergo those experiences is also</v>
<v Speaker 2>to risk all the physiological </v>

1471
01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:40.280
<v Speaker 2>psychophysiological stress that widens </v>
<v Speaker 2>your beard and that,</v>

1472
01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.880
<v Speaker 2>that crazy your hair.</v>

1473
01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:46.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tweet out now Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson says white is purity.</v>

1474
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1475
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Know the thing is you also see this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>more general popular culture.</v>

1476
01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of Dragon Ball z?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1477
01:33:59.040 --> 01:33:59.873
<v Speaker 1>It was a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an enemy and you have these </v>

1478
01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:05.820
<v Speaker 1>creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're called sayings,</v>

1479
01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:06.693
<v Speaker 1>and whenever they're warriors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever they're in a fight with some </v>

1480
01:34:09.191 --> 01:34:12.550
<v Speaker 1>eternal enemy and the moment they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to die,</v>

1481
01:34:13.570 --> 01:34:16.870
<v Speaker 1>they can their their spirit and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>body can't take anymore.</v>

1482
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:18.263
<v Speaker 1>They become super science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the resurrect and they </v>

1483
01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:23.110
<v Speaker 1>transcend and their hair stands up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns,</v>

1484
01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:24.730
<v Speaker 1>turns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns yellow,</v>

1485
01:34:24.731 --> 01:34:26.230
<v Speaker 1>and they get electricity all around </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1486
01:34:26.231 --> 01:34:30.550
<v Speaker 1>So whenever they are about to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when they transcend.</v>

1487
01:34:30.610 --> 01:34:31.443
<v Speaker 1>So they have been completely destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when their transcendence </v>

1488
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:36.340
<v Speaker 1>occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning.</v>

1489
01:34:36.341 --> 01:34:40.390
<v Speaker 1>They can control it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a theme that keeps the entire</v>

1490
01:34:40.391 --> 01:34:43.600
<v Speaker 1>saga together is this continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendence of the.</v>

1491
01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:45.213
<v Speaker 2>One of the themes that I developed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>maps of meaning is that there's ways of </v>

1492
01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:52.540
<v Speaker 2>construing yourself like you Construe </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yourself as who you are.</v>

1493
01:34:53.710 --> 01:34:56.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a stable state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say who you are right now.</v>

1494
01:34:56.501 --> 01:34:57.380
<v Speaker 2>That's me.</v>

1495
01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:58.833
<v Speaker 4>And then that all falls apart and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you consider yourself as the chaos that </v>

1496
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:07.580
<v Speaker 4>ensues when everything falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a state of hopelessness.</v>

1497
01:35:07.581 --> 01:35:08.414
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe you recovered from that </v>

1498
01:35:10.701 --> 01:35:14.570
<v Speaker 4>and you establish a new sense of order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>

1499
01:35:14.571 --> 01:35:15.404
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I passed through the underworld and now </v>

1500
01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:19.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm in a better place and this is me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this better place,</v>

1501
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:22.700
<v Speaker 4>but then it's subject to fragmentation </v>
<v Speaker 4>as well,</v>

1502
01:35:22.701 --> 01:35:23.534
<v Speaker 4>and so what you learn is that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>the order no matter how compelling and </v>

1503
01:35:29.961 --> 01:35:30.794
<v Speaker 4>secure and promising that order is and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not the chaos that ensues when </v>

1504
01:35:34.941 --> 01:35:39.020
<v Speaker 4>that order is fragmented and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>even the reestablishment of new order.</v>

1505
01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.033
<v Speaker 4>You're the process by which that </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation continually occurs and </v>

1506
01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:45.613
<v Speaker 4>that is the process of death and rebirth</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's where you identified with is </v>

1507
01:35:48.621 --> 01:35:49.454
<v Speaker 4>that ever renewing process of death and </v>
<v Speaker 4>rebirth and that identification with </v>

1508
01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:55.933
<v Speaker 4>cracks that the Christians and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian narrative is aiming at </v>

1509
01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:01.480
<v Speaker 4>instilling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aiming to,</v>

1510
01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:04.010
<v Speaker 4>to the degree that something like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>aims.</v>

1511
01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.633
<v Speaker 4>So is this also the Nietzsche refers to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the man is a road between Beeston over </v>

1512
01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:12.053
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that's not exactly the Christian </v>

1513
01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:17.430
<v Speaker 4>the delineation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but instilled in more.</v>

1514
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:21.560
<v Speaker 4>I think that's probably more associated </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the idea that we were talking about</v>

1515
01:36:21.561 --> 01:36:23.500
<v Speaker 4>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean these ideas are all late,</v>

1516
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:24.343
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's more associated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of the partnership between man </v>

1517
01:36:28.641 --> 01:36:30.620
<v Speaker 4>and God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mediated by conscious</v>

1518
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:38.020
<v Speaker 4>man is that is that intermediary</v>
<v Speaker 4>finger because we're.</v>

1519
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:39.223
<v Speaker 4>We're moving towards the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're clearly not that that is a </v>

1520
01:36:43.821 --> 01:36:46.610
<v Speaker 4>tight rope lights because moving towards</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idealist,</v>

1521
01:36:46.611 --> 01:36:47.444
<v Speaker 4>precarious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the ideal and you can tumble at any </v>

1522
01:36:50.541 --> 01:36:54.530
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seriousness to our being</v>

1523
01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:56.923
<v Speaker 4>psychically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologically and spiritually as well </v>

1524
01:36:59.601 --> 01:37:03.070
<v Speaker 4>as physically it's well not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's part of aA.</v>

1525
01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:08.380
<v Speaker 4>turtle crucifixion as well as a constant</v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerability of being a burden of being</v>

1526
01:37:11.391 --> 01:37:12.224
<v Speaker 4>human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The necessary burden I suppose to me in </v>

1527
01:37:16.011 --> 01:37:21.011
<v Speaker 4>my more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call them?</v>

1528
01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:26.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have these moments of thinking where</v>

1529
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:32.820
<v Speaker 4>they're more metaphysical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more metaphysical moments I suppose.</v>

1530
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:33.833
<v Speaker 4>I do see that go on in there and engaged</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a partnership to bring about the </v>

1531
01:37:39.630 --> 01:37:41.030
<v Speaker 4>Kingdom of God on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

1532
01:37:41.031 --> 01:37:44.130
<v Speaker 4>That there's something about that story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly right.</v>

1533
01:37:44.131 --> 01:37:44.964
<v Speaker 4>That we should be struggling up yield </v>
<v Speaker 4>with our burdens towards the highest </v>

1534
01:37:48.451 --> 01:37:49.284
<v Speaker 4>possible ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if there's something about that </v>

1535
01:37:50.651 --> 01:37:55.150
<v Speaker 4>that's true or at least it's more true </v>
<v Speaker 4>than anything else we can conceive of.</v>

1536
01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.260
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the great adventure of </v>
<v Speaker 4>lights.</v>

1537
01:37:58.261 --> 01:37:59.094
<v Speaker 4>That's what you want to be cold too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you are called to that by your </v>

1538
01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:07.290
<v Speaker 4>conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1539
01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.740
<v Speaker 4>Refer we we've talked for about 90 </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes now.</v>

1540
01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:13.210
<v Speaker 4>I think this is a good time to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:15.790
<v Speaker 4>This is a great note to close off on.</v>
