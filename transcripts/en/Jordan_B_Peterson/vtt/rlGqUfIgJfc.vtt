WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go through quite a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>material today and it's a bit of,</v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>it will be reviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not very much.</v>

3
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:05.994
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we started with this fundamental </v>

4
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:08.454
<v Speaker 1>propositions here that you're viewing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world through a narrative framework </v>

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>and the narrative framework basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>lays out the world for you as a place in</v>

6
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:17.334
<v Speaker 1>which you can act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that you act is to make </v>

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.993
<v Speaker 1>the state that you're in currently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that state that you're moving to </v>

8
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>next better than the state you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.263
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that I had you write </v>

10
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:34.011
<v Speaker 1>about your past was because the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive scientists sort of took it for</v>

11
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>granted that your model of where you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>now wasn't actually a model.</v>

12
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.953
<v Speaker 1>It was just reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you look out in the world and you </v>

13
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:42.534
<v Speaker 1>can see the reality and there you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not true because because </v>

14
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

15
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.523
<v Speaker 1>you're as constrained with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the information that you have at hand </v>

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>about the present just as much as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are about the future or the past,</v>

17
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your conceptualization of the present is</v>

18
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>also a model.</v>

19
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Just like your conceptualization of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

20
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:06.414
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that's so important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know is that if when you're moving from </v>

21
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>point a to point b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make an error.</v>

22
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.943
<v Speaker 1>The error could be that you've predicted</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future or construed the future </v>

23
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:18.234
<v Speaker 1>inaccurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it could also be that you've </v>

24
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>construed the present or the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>inaccurately.</v>

25
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.843
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>start from where you thought you were </v>

26
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>starting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happens for example,</v>

28
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.114
<v Speaker 1>that'll happen if you're moving forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you discovered that you have </v>

29
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:33.654
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses of one form or another that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know about when you made the </v>

30
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>original plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that what that means is that your,</v>

31
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.933
<v Speaker 1>your current conception of yourself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently inaccurate so that you </v>

32
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:49.341
<v Speaker 1>can't move from that conception to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future desired state without error.</v>

33
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.573
<v Speaker 1>And the other reason I'm telling you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is because one of what that also </v>

34
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:54.114
<v Speaker 1>helps you understand is how broad the </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of potential error is when </v>

35
00:01:57.841 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>something you don't understand happens.</v>

36
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.833
<v Speaker 1>Because not only does it throw the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future that you're conceptualizing into </v>

37
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:05.034
<v Speaker 1>doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also throws the conceptualization of </v>

38
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>you as a being in the present into </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>

39
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.483
<v Speaker 1>And it's not obvious at all when you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the initial search where in which of </v>

40
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>those domains you're going to find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>error or where.</v>

41
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And so it's error is a more complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem than the,</v>

42
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>than the cognitive scientists who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in the comparitor models of,</v>

43
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.083
<v Speaker 1>of cybernetic processing had an had ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized cause they thought they </v>

44
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:34.584
<v Speaker 1>kind of thought and behavior his terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is while the world just presents </v>

45
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:38.334
<v Speaker 1>itself to you as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're not going to be making any </v>

46
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:41.694
<v Speaker 1>errors of fundamental perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just might be making areas of </v>

47
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's far too optimistic.</v>

48
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Now we also know that this fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative framework,</v>

49
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.003
<v Speaker 1>which gives you a sense of the value of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your current position and a destination </v>

50
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>because you're a mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a moving creature,</v>

51
00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.753
<v Speaker 1>you're an active living creature that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the world and </v>

52
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>transforming it all the time.</v>

53
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also,</v>

54
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.263
<v Speaker 1>there are also constraints on which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative that you were going to </v>

55
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize an act out can exist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the constraints are,</v>

56
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>well they're piaget Yeti and constraints</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense.</v>

57
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is that you're doing has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support you while you're doing it.</v>

58
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>That's constraint number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you're,</v>

59
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.463
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the path you take has to fulfill </v>

60
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.293
<v Speaker 1>whatever constitute the list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessities that you can't move forward </v>

61
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:39.604
<v Speaker 1>without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of those we think of as basic </v>

62
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to breathe and you have to</v>

63
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:44.854
<v Speaker 1>eat and you have to have sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have sufficient water and </v>

64
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you have to have shelter and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

65
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:51.191
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>the parameters within which those needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be fulfilled are pretty broad,</v>

67
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:56.494
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't think of it necessarily as </v>

68
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.603
<v Speaker 1>a simple problem or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that there are simple solutions but </v>

69
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.413
<v Speaker 1>they're still obvious constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only do you have to fulfill all </v>

70
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:08.134
<v Speaker 1>those</v>

71
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.980
<v Speaker 1>fundamental obligations to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to do it in a manner that's</v>

72
00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:16.880
<v Speaker 1>relatively non contradictory so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're pursuing one,</v>

73
00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:17.714
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't decrease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chance that you're going to obtain </v>

74
00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:20.114
<v Speaker 1>another and you have to do it in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the way you do it now doesn't </v>

75
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:29.060
<v Speaker 1>compromise you doing it next week or </v>
<v Speaker 1>next month or next year.</v>

76
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.610
<v Speaker 1>That's where delay of gratification </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in.</v>

77
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.773
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have to do it in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fulfills your basic needs in a non </v>

78
00:04:36.621 --> 00:04:37.454
<v Speaker 1>contradictory manner over different </v>
<v Speaker 1>spans of time and space while other </v>

79
00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:44.210
<v Speaker 1>people are doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>

80
00:04:44.211 --> 00:04:46.670
<v Speaker 1>see that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tight set of constraints.</v>

81
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:47.504
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that that this narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be anything is wrong because it </v>

82
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.213
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to serve many masters </v>

83
00:04:56.241 --> 00:05:00.050
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying there aren't multiple</v>

84
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:00.884
<v Speaker 1>solutions to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like there are multiple ways of </v>

85
00:05:03.351 --> 00:05:04.184
<v Speaker 1>playing or winning a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a constrained set of </v>

86
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.390
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

87
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.210
<v Speaker 1>now the next proposition is that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're moving from point a to point b,</v>

88
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.130
<v Speaker 1>there's basically there's two or three </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes of things that can happen.</v>

89
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.263
<v Speaker 1>One is things that you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happen and that obviously is </v>

90
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 1>symbolically represented by the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>blue unhappy face.</v>

91
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:31.334
<v Speaker 1>And then there are positive things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can happen and the positive things are </v>

92
00:05:34.551 --> 00:05:35.384
<v Speaker 1>two fold in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have two fundamental elements and </v>

93
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:40.124
<v Speaker 1>behaviorists never tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's one of the fundamental flaws in </v>

94
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:44.300
<v Speaker 1>behavioral theory.</v>

95
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Things that indicate that you're moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards a desired goal are positive.</v>

96
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>That's classic sophisticated behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

97
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Those are incentive rewards because an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward indicates to you that a</v>

98
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.423
<v Speaker 1>consumer story reward is forthcoming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different neuro biological </v>

99
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>systems that underlie those two types of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>

100
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Conservatory reward basically produces </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction,</v>

101
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>whereas incentive reward produces </v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement,</v>

102
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and movement forward.</v>

103
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually the kind of reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you liked better,</v>

104
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>which is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>because you'd think that the most potent</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward would be consumed matory reward.</v>

106
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>But people will work harder for </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward,</v>

107
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 1>then they will for consumer Tory reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

108
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>people very peculiar creatures.</v>

109
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:33.644
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the incentive reward system is </v>

110
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>part of the broader seeking system as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaak Panksepp describes it.</v>

111
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:47.021
<v Speaker 1>And so because the incentive reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>system not only tells you that a reward,</v>

112
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>like an expected reward might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>forthcoming,</v>

113
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>it also tells you that an unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 1>reward might be forthcoming.</v>

114
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that's so important is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you actually view the world that</v>

115
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand partly through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lens of threat because of something that</v>

116
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be dangerous,</v>

117
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 1>but also through the lens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

118
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Because if something you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand happens,</v>

119
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 1>that means there's an indeterminate </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of reward.</v>

120
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 1>And like these things turn out to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely important.</v>

121
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:21.644
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a long term sexual </v>

122
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:24.644
<v Speaker 1>relationship with a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which that relationship </v>

123
00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 1>might be sexually pleasurable will </v>
<v Speaker 1>decline.</v>

124
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:31.934
<v Speaker 1>And they're part of the reason for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's the novelty disappears </v>

125
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 1>because novelty enhances incentive </v>
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>

126
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:40.094
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain the romance in a </v>

127
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:44.234
<v Speaker 1>relationship is to mix some novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And however you might be able to do </v>

128
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that usually involves playing in one</v>

129
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>form or another in a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

130
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a trivial issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an important issue.</v>

131
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.913
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when when you're moving forward and you </v>

132
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>encounter something that indicates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to achieve your goal,</v>

133
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.503
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that's happening at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time is that the fact that that </v>

134
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:12.620
<v Speaker 1>thing appears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>validates your entire perceptual scheme.</v>

135
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a,</v>

136
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>you're moving forward to the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but b,</v>

137
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.343
<v Speaker 1>the whole plan that you're using to </v>
<v Speaker 1>construe the world in order so that you </v>

138
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 1>can act so that you can move towards the</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal is also sufficiently.</v>

139
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:26.324
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big source of incentive </v>

140
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:32.501
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only your conception of the present,</v>

141
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 1>but the whole framework itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your conception of the present,</v>

142
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 1>the future and your choice about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors to implement.</v>

143
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

144
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.393
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm imagining you're in a relationship </v>

145
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.053
<v Speaker 2>with young children or if your goal is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be on a fulfilling relationship and </v>

146
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.223
<v Speaker 2>so to get from where you are to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Subaru ordinance involves going through </v>

147
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 2>some daily face might be faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as you move towards your goal,</v>

148
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 2>not always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not always feeling,</v>

149
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>

150
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.283
<v Speaker 1>As you move towards a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't want and things you do </v>

151
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 1>want might be happening and if something</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want happens,</v>

152
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.933
<v Speaker 1>then it depends on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on the relationship of the </v>

153
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 1>thing that didn't happen to your whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal hierarchy and the problem is,</v>

154
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's where we're going to go next </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when the unexpected thing happens.</v>

155
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that it can be modified here</v>

156
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.154
<v Speaker 1>and now with very little disruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it has an incalculable effect on </v>

157
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:55.854
<v Speaker 1>the integrity of the entire plant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that's why unexpected things in </v>

158
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:00.864
<v Speaker 1>particular are a class of their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's complicated a because normally </v>

159
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 1>when you're moving towards a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any obstacle appears,</v>

160
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.873
<v Speaker 1>it's unexpected obviously because partly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're trying to do when you lay </v>

161
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:16.674
<v Speaker 1>out a good plan is to make sure that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway doesn't have any obstacles in </v>

162
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:22.710
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you almost never encounter,</v>

163
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:23.544
<v Speaker 1>just like you never encounter an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward without also </v>

164
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>encountering a piece of evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your plan is good.</v>

165
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.823
<v Speaker 1>You never encounter an obstacle without </v>
<v Speaker 1>also encountering evidence that your </v>

166
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 1>plan is flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>

167
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how flawed?</v>

168
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.973
<v Speaker 1>And that's the big question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there's a third category </v>

169
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 1>of events that occur as you're laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>your plans,</v>

170
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.173
<v Speaker 1>as you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're laying your plans out in the </v>

171
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:50.154
<v Speaker 1>world and implementing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that category is things you didn't </v>

172
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 1>expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not merely obstacles,</v>

173
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:57.024
<v Speaker 1>but there things you didn't expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now that's what this diagram </v>

174
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:02.634
<v Speaker 1>basically indicates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you're moving from the unbearable </v>

175
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:07.410
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unbearable because you want to make</v>

176
00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:08.244
<v Speaker 1>it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also something to think about </v>

177
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>when you're considering why human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>are constantly dissatisfied.</v>

178
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.311
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

179
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't vaguely dissatisfied with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the present,</v>

180
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be doing anything to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change it into the future.</v>

181
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:22.074
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a certain amount of vague</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dissatisfaction that's actually a </v>

182
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 1>necessary motivator.</v>

183
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.953
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hope that there are times when you </v>

184
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:32.610
<v Speaker 1>think things are good enough for right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

185
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 1>So you can take a break from constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking up hill.</v>

186
00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 1>But you can also see that if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely satisfied,</v>

187
00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>we know this from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from animals like lions,</v>

188
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:43.404
<v Speaker 1>you know after a kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the lions do is lay around until </v>

189
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 1>they've digested all the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

190
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:48.354
<v Speaker 1>and they're probably satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't obviously the case that </v>

191
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.193
<v Speaker 1>that's the best possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you're moving from the unbearable </v>

192
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:57.754
<v Speaker 1>present to the desired future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think that positive things </v>

193
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:02.044
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those facilitate your movement </v>

194
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:04.834
<v Speaker 1>forward and negative things happen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that interferes with your movement </v>

195
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can think differently.</v>

196
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:12.604
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a slight reconceptualization </v>

197
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 1>you can say that predicted things happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that unpredicted things happen.</v>

198
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a slightly different shift,</v>

199
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.074
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

200
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Because when you talk about unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected,</v>

201
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're not referring to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's only a manifestation in</v>

202
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:32.284
<v Speaker 1>the actual world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a relationship that you have </v>

203
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:35.614
<v Speaker 1>with the thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because expected means not only does it </v>

204
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you knew it was going to happen.</v>

205
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Whereas unexpected means not only does </v>
<v Speaker 1>it happen,</v>

206
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a subjective element and then</v>

207
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.280
<v Speaker 1>you could change that another way too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

208
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.533
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most accurate way to think </v>

209
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:51.934
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is it's not expected and </v>

210
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:55.894
<v Speaker 1>unexpected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's desired an undesired and there the </v>

211
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:02.920
<v Speaker 1>utility and making that transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

212
00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:03.754
<v Speaker 1>it brings motivation into the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never only expecting or not </v>

213
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:11.650
<v Speaker 1>expecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wanting and not want.</v>

214
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.843
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

215
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:16.803
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

216
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>

217
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 1>If you lay out a good plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may say,</v>

218
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.893
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's 10 things that I don't want to </v>

219
00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:33.760
<v Speaker 1>have happen that are relatively high </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability,</v>

220
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.120
<v Speaker 1>and then you could build a little sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan around each of those.</v>

221
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 1>That constitutes a micro strategy within</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plant.</v>

222
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.493
<v Speaker 1>But the way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to conceptualize that </v>

223
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 1>effectively is to think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't,</v>

224
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.153
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that plan ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a nested series of plants and </v>

225
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:56.710
<v Speaker 1>you're operating at one level of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nested series out of time.</v>

226
00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

227
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:03.910
<v Speaker 1>if the expected and if it's an expected </v>
<v Speaker 1>undesirable thing,</v>

228
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.130
<v Speaker 1>it usually affects a micro element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the plan.</v>

229
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.163
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that you can change that and fix </v>

230
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:12.880
<v Speaker 1>it without too much effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a macro element,</v>

231
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

232
00:14:15.171 --> 00:14:16.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

233
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 1>you fail a course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

234
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Another thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.083
<v Speaker 1>east European cyber criminals hijack </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hard drive and encode it and they </v>

236
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:28.414
<v Speaker 1>charge you $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to decode it and then you don't have </v>

237
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:32.500
<v Speaker 1>enough money to go to university.</v>

238
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:33.851
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

239
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of those events is more serious?</v>

240
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously failing the exam is not a </v>

241
00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 1>positive event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

242
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a somewhat unexpected event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likely if you were doing the work,</v>

243
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.200
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't blow apart your entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>

244
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

245
00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 1>the theft of all your resources is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>macro failure.</v>

246
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.283
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you not getting from point a to </v>

247
00:14:58.881 --> 00:14:59.714
<v Speaker 1>point B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the framework within which you're </v>

248
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:07.070
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing point a and B is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might even be worse than that.</v>

249
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a super ordinate framework that </v>
<v Speaker 1>blows apart 10 or 11 different plants.</v>

250
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.813
<v Speaker 1>So it's that it's complicated because </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are never only predicted and an </v>

251
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.493
<v Speaker 1>unpredicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their desired and undesired and then </v>

252
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 1>their desired and undesired to different</v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>

253
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>And the degree depends on the place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy where the unexpected thing</v>

254
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 1>is doing the disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

255
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:30.104
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way of getting towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that level of description without </v>

256
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 1>starting off as if you're only </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementing one plan at a time.</v>

257
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:38.683
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an oversimplification that's </v>

258
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:44.990
<v Speaker 1>necessary before we develop a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated idea of,</v>

259
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.330
<v Speaker 1>of how it is that you're interacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the world.</v>

260
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a desired outcome,</v>

261
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.483
<v Speaker 1>that's an incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you hopeful and positive and </v>

262
00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:00.620
<v Speaker 1>alert and energetic and willing to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

263
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you want.</v>

264
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a dopaminergic reaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

265
00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if something that you happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens that you don't want,</v>

266
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:14.260
<v Speaker 1>well that's both threatening technically</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>

267
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.253
<v Speaker 1>it indicates that a punishment is likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't necessarily know the </v>

268
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:19.904
<v Speaker 1>magnitude of the punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also punishing in and of </v>

269
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.530
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are,</v>

270
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 1>that's obviously a category that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to have happen.</v>

271
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.950
<v Speaker 1>And the other problem is it's not easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bind it,</v>

272
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at it this way,</v>

273
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 1>you have a relationship with someone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of conflict laid,</v>

274
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think each time you have a </v>

275
00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think,</v>

276
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.290
<v Speaker 1>should I be in this relationship?</v>

277
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.573
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a big problem because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually don't know how much conflict </v>

278
00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 1>should you have before you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a relationship.</v>

279
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 1>And an answer to that is while you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know now there's actually some empirical</v>

280
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:02.750
<v Speaker 1>work on the topic so I can give you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>provisional answer,</v>

281
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:07.080
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a a research psychologist a</v>

282
00:17:07.081 --> 00:17:07.914
<v Speaker 1>while back who I thought I did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant study and they had couples </v>

283
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.510
<v Speaker 1>record positive events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just qualitatively,</v>

284
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:15.344
<v Speaker 1>how many positive interactions did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have with your partner during the day </v>

285
00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:22.880
<v Speaker 1>versus how many negative interactions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they quantified the degree</v>

286
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 1>to which they were positive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>

287
00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:29.150
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to assume that across</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple instances that would wash out.</v>

288
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.283
<v Speaker 1>And what they found was it's quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found that if you had fewer than </v>

289
00:17:34.641 --> 00:17:38.150
<v Speaker 1>five positive interactions to every </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative interaction,</v>

290
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 1>the relationship was going to collapse.</v>

291
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.410
<v Speaker 1>So now you can start counting and see if</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's appropriate to you.</v>

292
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.470
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing they found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was really lovely,</v>

293
00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:49.304
<v Speaker 1>was that if you had more than 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive interactions to one negative </v>

294
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:54.770
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship was also doomed.</v>

295
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 1>And so you think you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand that,</v>

296
00:17:58.021 --> 00:17:58.471
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd,</v>

297
00:17:58.471 --> 00:17:59.304
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows that because if someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering around treating you like a </v>

298
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 1>goddess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless,</v>

299
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:03.924
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you're going to do is be</v>
<v Speaker 1>just contemptuous of them and then </v>

300
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.373
<v Speaker 1>completely bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want the person to harass you a bit </v>

301
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 1>just so that you learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>

302
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.763
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so it's also evidence that there's </v>

303
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 1>actually someone there that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with,</v>

304
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:18.264
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if someone just does everything </v>

305
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:21.750
<v Speaker 1>you want all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

306
00:18:21.751 --> 00:18:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean that might sound like an ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy,</v>

307
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:26.640
<v Speaker 1>but you know perfectly well that if that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever happened,</v>

308
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:27.983
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to get completely </v>

309
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 1>tired of that instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus there's no,</v>

310
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.260
<v Speaker 1>there's no life in the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

311
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Which is a big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

312
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.410
<v Speaker 3>there's also people who are too afraid </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pick a fight with one another.</v>

313
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:42.621
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

314
00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Arguably worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

315
00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:44.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

316
00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:45.824
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing too is you can be sure </v>

317
00:18:46.671 --> 00:18:48.830
<v Speaker 1>that didn't have a relationship where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no conflict.</v>

318
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is being decided because thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>is conflict.</v>

319
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Even if you do it by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

320
00:18:55.911 --> 00:18:56.744
<v Speaker 1>And so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are two of you in a boat and </v>

321
00:18:57.951 --> 00:19:00.140
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to decide where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going in the future,</v>

322
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.080
<v Speaker 1>it started like that self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be some,</v>

323
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.053
<v Speaker 1>you have to have an opinion and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner has to have an opinion and </v>

324
00:19:07.011 --> 00:19:07.844
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason at all to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>those opinions either will be or should </v>

325
00:19:10.731 --> 00:19:12.830
<v Speaker 1>be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

326
00:19:12.831 --> 00:19:13.664
<v Speaker 1>you hope the relationship is solid </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that it can withstand the </v>

327
00:19:17.391 --> 00:19:18.224
<v Speaker 1>tension of the conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you've said about </v>

328
00:19:20.031 --> 00:19:20.864
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was because you can get </v>

329
00:19:22.251 --> 00:19:23.084
<v Speaker 1>a very nice job of trying to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a psychological perspective why in </v>

330
00:19:26.961 --> 00:19:28.940
<v Speaker 1>the world you should bother being </v>
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>

331
00:19:28.941 --> 00:19:31.220
<v Speaker 1>which is really a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

332
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things,</v>

333
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he said was that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need to tie two things together if</v>

334
00:19:37.161 --> 00:19:39.680
<v Speaker 1>they'll just stay together of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>accord.</v>

335
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.440
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that marriage is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your human universal,</v>

336
00:19:42.441 --> 00:19:43.274
<v Speaker 1>which it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates that there is enough tension </v>

337
00:19:45.531 --> 00:19:48.140
<v Speaker 1>within intimate relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scent,</v>

338
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.870
<v Speaker 1>scent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>centrifical tension to blow them apart.</v>

339
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.650
<v Speaker 1>And some of that's just because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are different and they clash.</v>

340
00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:58.100
<v Speaker 1>But it's also because as you go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>life in a single boat,</v>

341
00:19:58.101 --> 00:20:00.770
<v Speaker 1>you encounter huge waves and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might get swamped.</v>

342
00:20:00.771 --> 00:20:01.604
<v Speaker 1>So it's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His point was that the marriage vow was </v>

343
00:20:04.791 --> 00:20:09.791
<v Speaker 1>necessary because if you're a response </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

344
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:12.963
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

345
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:17.200
<v Speaker 1>potential conflict was I can leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have the conflict.</v>

346
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

347
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Speaker 1>you can't have the conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

348
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:21.571
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

349
00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:22.404
<v Speaker 1>if on the other hand you're with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think there's no bloody way I </v>

350
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:27.900
<v Speaker 1>can get rid of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what I do short of murder,</v>

351
00:20:27.901 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm stuck with you for the next 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

352
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 1>then we better work this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that makes the,</v>

353
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.150
<v Speaker 1>he thought of that as a container within</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a transformation could take place.</v>

354
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:43.230
<v Speaker 1>It was no chemical motif and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>without that pressure,</v>

355
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.770
<v Speaker 1>people weren't going to be sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated to really hash out problems.</v>

356
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.990
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of that,</v>

357
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.093
<v Speaker 1>think of that in whatever way you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought it was an absolutely </v>

358
00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:54.730
<v Speaker 1>brilliant observation.</v>

359
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that divorce is too readily</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered?</v>

360
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is it doesn't solve the </v>

361
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.453
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't solve any problems usually </v>

362
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.103
<v Speaker 1>because for a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is it's probably you and not your </v>

363
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:15.010
<v Speaker 1>partner anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least there's a 50 50 chance,</v>

364
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:15.844
<v Speaker 1>and if it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to bring your </v>

365
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:19.810
<v Speaker 1>stupidity to the next relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>torture someone else to death,</v>

366
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big problem.</v>

367
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.583
<v Speaker 1>The next problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you can't work out the bugs </v>

368
00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 1>in this relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think you're going to be able</v>

369
00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:28.774
<v Speaker 1>to do it in the next relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially now that you're older and </v>

370
00:21:30.761 --> 00:21:33.460
<v Speaker 1>more set in your ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third is,</v>

371
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:34.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.510
<v Speaker 1>what about the kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fourth is,</v>

373
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever seen people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a protracted custody battle,</v>

374
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:42.783
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to ruin your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good way of doing it </v>

375
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:45.904
<v Speaker 1>because that'll take you out for about </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years and it'll cost you pretty much </v>

376
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:52.930
<v Speaker 1>all your money and it'll destroy your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your closest relationships.</v>

377
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:53.973
<v Speaker 1>And I'll also make it virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for you to be happy with the </v>

378
00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:56.764
<v Speaker 1>next person that you're with because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be burdened by this </v>

379
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:00.844
<v Speaker 1>absolute catastrophe that's surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 1>you with regards to how you organize </v>

380
00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:05.650
<v Speaker 1>your interrelationships with the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you love.</v>

381
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so generally speaking,</v>

382
00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that it usually solves the</v>

383
00:22:11.981 --> 00:22:12.771
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

384
00:22:12.771 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my sense is it's probably introduced</v>

385
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.460
<v Speaker 1>more problems than it solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

386
00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:19.294
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might know for </v>

387
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:21.394
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the only people who now get </v>

388
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:26.320
<v Speaker 1>married are people who are relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy.</v>

389
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.903
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we've disrupted the </v>

390
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:34.021
<v Speaker 1>structure of marriage as an institution </v>
<v Speaker 1>since about 1965 say what that's meant.</v>

391
00:22:34.571 --> 00:22:35.404
<v Speaker 1>What that has meant is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's benefits are now only available to </v>

392
00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 1>people who are privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can look up the stats yourself,</v>

393
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:43.144
<v Speaker 1>but if you're middle class and above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the divorce rates haven't moved much </v>

394
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:51.331
<v Speaker 1>since the early seventies if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class and below,</v>

395
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a complete catastrophe.</v>

396
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.333
<v Speaker 1>And what that's meant is that most ma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many children who are in rougher socio </v>

397
00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:00.644
<v Speaker 1>economic straights are being raised by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single person who has absolutely and </v>

398
00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 1>100% overwhelmed by their multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitments,</v>

399
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fulltime responsibility for children and</v>

400
00:23:11.951 --> 00:23:15.310
<v Speaker 1>generally in employment in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily dismal,</v>

401
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.340
<v Speaker 1>low paying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unstable and exploitative job.</v>

402
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.590
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

403
00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:21.424
<v Speaker 1>if you're like you guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all going to be middle class or </v>

404
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:24.730
<v Speaker 1>above in all likelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

405
00:23:24.731 --> 00:23:25.564
<v Speaker 1>it's fine for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to make a bloody bit of </v>

406
00:23:26.831 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things considered.</v>

407
00:23:28.301 --> 00:23:31.960
<v Speaker 1>But for people who are poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just been a catastrophe.</v>

408
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

409
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.210
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

410
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.970
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There</v>

411
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.080
<v Speaker 1>it's all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

412
00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:50.240
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become socially acceptable,</v>

413
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.673
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Divorce wasn't socially acceptable and </v>

414
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:54.370
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

415
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.080
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty hard on people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to get divorced.</v>

416
00:23:57.081 --> 00:23:57.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

417
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 1>obviously any rule is hard on people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that break it,</v>

418
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be rules,</v>

419
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now what rules there should be.</v>

420
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

421
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.510
<v Speaker 1>out of wedlock childbirth has become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>norm.</v>

422
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:12.523
<v Speaker 1>It was absolutely rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 19 in the early 1960s vanishingly </v>

423
00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:18.090
<v Speaker 1>rare and that's become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

424
00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.470
<v Speaker 1>it's acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though all the evidence suggests,</v>

425
00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 1>like if you actually look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>

426
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.740
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely clear that kids who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>two parents do better than kids who have</v>

427
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:29.870
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know people,</v>

428
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:30.704
<v Speaker 1>when you tell people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will tell you an anecdote about </v>

429
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:33.224
<v Speaker 1>someone they knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe their own parent who did a </v>

430
00:24:34.341 --> 00:24:37.160
<v Speaker 1>wonderful job of raising them as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single person.</v>

431
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:37.993
<v Speaker 1>It's like the anecdotes are irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's relevant is the bulk of the </v>

432
00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:42.560
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

433
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:46.310
<v Speaker 1>there are situations where people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better apart than together,</v>

434
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.473
<v Speaker 1>and of course there are situations where</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person can do a better job than to </v>

435
00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:53.090
<v Speaker 1>people who were at each other's throats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

436
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:53.924
<v Speaker 1>it's aggregate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's aggregated examples that you use </v>

437
00:24:56.811 --> 00:24:57.644
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing a scientific survey </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the results of those surveys are </v>

438
00:24:59.811 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 1>crystal clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

439
00:25:01.461 --> 00:25:05.150
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen very soon,</v>

440
00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 1>is that there's going to be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

441
00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:08.114
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very large number of elderly people who </v>

442
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:16.061
<v Speaker 1>are alone and be an elderly and alone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like no family.</v>

443
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:19.760
<v Speaker 1>That is not something you want to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward to,</v>

444
00:25:19.761 --> 00:25:20.594
<v Speaker 1>especially when you start thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be elderly for like 40 </v>

445
00:25:23.061 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

446
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.083
<v Speaker 1>because say say it starts around 65 I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how long you guys are going </v>

447
00:25:29.651 --> 00:25:30.484
<v Speaker 1>to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably 95 is not an </v>

448
00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:35.180
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable estimate and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer than that.</v>

449
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:36.763
<v Speaker 1>So because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're adding about three months to the </v>

450
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:42.320
<v Speaker 1>total lifespan every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

451
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.423
<v Speaker 1>That's the rate of technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement in relationship to overall </v>

452
00:25:46.221 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 1>mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

453
00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:53.231
<v Speaker 1>and that the degree to which we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>adding that extra lifespan is increasing</v>

454
00:25:53.721 --> 00:25:55.340
<v Speaker 1>each year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

455
00:25:55.341 --> 00:25:56.174
<v Speaker 1>and it may hit get to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're increasing lifespan a year every </v>

456
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:00.950
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

457
00:26:00.951 --> 00:26:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it cause it'll probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll probably be an essay,</v>

458
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.813
<v Speaker 1>a Sim tote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has been increasing for a very </v>

459
00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

460
00:26:09.471 --> 00:26:10.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to think about the </v>

461
00:26:12.951 --> 00:26:13.784
<v Speaker 1>maximization of day to day freedom when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're between say 15 and 40 45 after </v>

462
00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:23.060
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different story.</v>

463
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:23.953
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but modern people never think about the </v>

464
00:26:25.161 --> 00:26:27.320
<v Speaker 1>last half of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

465
00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:28.970
<v Speaker 1>so why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

466
00:26:28.971 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they're afraid to or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

467
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:34.460
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

468
00:26:34.461 --> 00:26:37.070
<v Speaker 1>So here's the other way of looking at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when you're,</v>

469
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:38.263
<v Speaker 1>so there's lots of ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing what you encountered </v>

470
00:26:40.511 --> 00:26:41.690
<v Speaker 1>when you move into the world.</v>

471
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 1>So we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

472
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's positive things you encounter,</v>

473
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:45.564
<v Speaker 1>negative things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's expected things and unexpected </v>

474
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:48.084
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's desired things and undesired </v>

475
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:51.750
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another way of thinking about it,</v>

476
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:55.830
<v Speaker 1>which is more in some sense it's more a </v>
<v Speaker 1>empirical,</v>

477
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.410
<v Speaker 1>is that you encountered tools and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles,</v>

478
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And tools move you forward.</v>

479
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.003
<v Speaker 1>And tools are a funny thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of half objective and half </v>

480
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:05.330
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

481
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 1>There are thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is defined by their use.</v>

482
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.590
<v Speaker 1>But weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to define thing by use.</v>

483
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mentioned this before,</v>

484
00:27:15.541 --> 00:27:18.480
<v Speaker 1>so most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're thinking about language,</v>

485
00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:20.850
<v Speaker 1>things that you use words to label </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

486
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.193
<v Speaker 1>but it seems much more likely that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>use categories as tools to act in the </v>

487
00:27:25.531 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't see things,</v>

488
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.520
<v Speaker 1>we see the use of things or the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they get in our way.</v>

489
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:33.863
<v Speaker 1>And so you're trying to set up the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that what surrounds you are entities </v>

490
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:42.480
<v Speaker 1>that you can use to get what you desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to eliminate obstacles.</v>

491
00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:44.490
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you generally do if you're a</v>

492
00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:45.540
<v Speaker 1>good manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

493
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:48.270
<v Speaker 1>A big part of being a good manager is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

494
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:49.104
<v Speaker 1>lay out a plan for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hierarchy and and where the </v>

495
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:53.574
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical levels don't conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing is you get rid of </v>

496
00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:58.350
<v Speaker 1>obstacles for them so that they can come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and say,</v>

497
00:27:58.351 --> 00:27:59.184
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this because this isn't the </v>

498
00:28:00.241 --> 00:28:01.074
<v Speaker 1>way your job is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get it out of the way so that they </v>

499
00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:04.580
<v Speaker 1>can move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on.</v>

500
00:28:04.581 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good way of conceptualizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a manager.</v>

501
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:08.693
<v Speaker 1>So now part of there's obstacles that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand and those would </v>

502
00:28:12.571 --> 00:28:15.810
<v Speaker 1>correspond to the micro levels of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

503
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

504
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.110
<v Speaker 1>And then there's obstacles that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand.</v>

505
00:28:19.111 --> 00:28:21.360
<v Speaker 1>And when they come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just blow apart your whole plant.</v>

506
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.840
<v Speaker 1>So now associated with that expected </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected,</v>

507
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:31.590
<v Speaker 1>desired undesired tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obstacle is a corollary,</v>

508
00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:36.591
<v Speaker 1>which is all the things that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing as tools or obstacles or</v>

509
00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:39.750
<v Speaker 1>as things you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're irrelevant.</v>

510
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.273
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really useful thing to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it means that whenever you're </v>

511
00:28:44.641 --> 00:28:45.474
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the world has a sea of snakes </v>

512
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.380
<v Speaker 1>and you're only concentrating on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake at a time.</v>

513
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.890
<v Speaker 1>But then if you make a mistake dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that single snake,</v>

514
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.910
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you're neck deep in </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes because all of the things,</v>

515
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.640
<v Speaker 1>the thing is when you make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a critical issue,</v>

516
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:07.140
<v Speaker 1>when you make a mistake and you blow the</v>
<v Speaker 1>framework within which you're construing</v>

517
00:29:07.141 --> 00:29:09.510
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Framework that narrows it for you,</v>

518
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.733
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that all the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been ignoring become potentially </v>

519
00:29:14.581 --> 00:29:15.414
<v Speaker 1>relevant.</v>

520
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:16.703
<v Speaker 1>And that's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why your body reacts </v>

521
00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:23.520
<v Speaker 1>as if it's under tremendous stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

522
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.770
<v Speaker 1>you know how these things work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

523
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:27.480
<v Speaker 1>I think betrayals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best example,</v>

524
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:32.690
<v Speaker 1>if you have a partner and they be trey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you then all the things that you thought</v>

525
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:34.014
<v Speaker 1>were true about the mart and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you ignored as irrelevant turned </v>

526
00:29:37.441 --> 00:29:39.960
<v Speaker 1>out not to be irrelevant at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

527
00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:40.794
<v Speaker 1>maybe the person told on a twice weekly </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis that they were too busy studying </v>

528
00:29:44.621 --> 00:29:46.810
<v Speaker 1>to spend any time with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

529
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:47.644
<v Speaker 1>you just put that down into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant zone after some coming to </v>

530
00:29:52.331 --> 00:29:54.040
<v Speaker 1>terms with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you find out,</v>

531
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.730
<v Speaker 1>well that isn't what they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>during that time.</v>

532
00:29:57.731 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 1>And then the next question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

533
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 1>what else did they tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't the way it was.</v>

534
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:05.110
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could it be anything?</v>

535
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.620
<v Speaker 1>It means every single thing about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship past,</v>

536
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:13.360
<v Speaker 1>present and future has now been cast </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the realm of potential relevance.</v>

537
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And almost all the relevance is </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>

538
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.653
<v Speaker 1>And that's the descent into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the best way to conceptualize </v>

539
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:21.124
<v Speaker 1>chaos is because what happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your plan is what's narrows the world </v>

540
00:30:25.181 --> 00:30:27.970
<v Speaker 1>for you and constrains that makes most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it irrelevant.</v>

541
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.490
<v Speaker 1>The parts that aren't relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>

542
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.040
<v Speaker 1>and the negative elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively rare.</v>

543
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:35.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what the intact hierarchical plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

544
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.903
<v Speaker 1>If you blow the hierarchical plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all your nice little subdivisions </v>

545
00:30:40.151 --> 00:30:43.600
<v Speaker 1>are now irrelevant and every little </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster comes up to face you.</v>

546
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's the descent into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>

547
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people do not like that.</v>

548
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.253
<v Speaker 1>And no wonder the reason they don't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is because it places them in a </v>

549
00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:58.651
<v Speaker 1>situation that's so complex that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could easily exceed their resources,</v>

550
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

551
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.233
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens to </v>

552
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:05.530
<v Speaker 1>elderly people sometimes this isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely of betrayal,</v>

553
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:06.364
<v Speaker 1>is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been with someone for 40 years </v>

554
00:31:08.081 --> 00:31:12.250
<v Speaker 1>and the person dies while the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that the partner will die in</v>

555
00:31:12.251 --> 00:31:16.660
<v Speaker 1>the following year is much elevated </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to their normal mortality.</v>

556
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:21.070
<v Speaker 1>And part of that is they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that they're grieving.</v>

557
00:31:21.071 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although they are.</v>

558
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.993
<v Speaker 1>What's happened is that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental axioms of the structures </v>

559
00:31:29.141 --> 00:31:29.974
<v Speaker 1>that they use to encapsulate the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been blown out and everything comes </v>

560
00:31:35.081 --> 00:31:35.914
<v Speaker 1>crashing down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes people just don't have </v>

561
00:31:39.251 --> 00:31:42.100
<v Speaker 1>the resources to make it through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just done.</v>

562
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:43.503
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know how to pick up the </v>

563
00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:46.480
<v Speaker 1>pieces and start again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

564
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:49.990
<v Speaker 1>And at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe God only knows at some point,</v>

565
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:50.824
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's not what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know what you do after </v>

566
00:31:53.051 --> 00:31:55.540
<v Speaker 1>you're married 75 years and your partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>dies.</v>

567
00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.613
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have a party if it's been an </v>

568
00:31:57.551 --> 00:31:59.170
<v Speaker 1>absolutely dreadful marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

569
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.600
<v Speaker 1>but in all likelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:32:01.601 --> 00:32:02.560
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

571
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like a stroke that leaves you with </v>
<v Speaker 1>only half your body.</v>

572
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear that you can recover from</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

573
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.753
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

574
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:14.883
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

575
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say what,</v>

576
00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's exactly from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking of the framework.</v>

577
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:24.763
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework breaks and then the person is </v>

578
00:32:27.741 --> 00:32:28.574
<v Speaker 1>cast into such a state of physiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>shock that the shark actually starts to </v>

579
00:32:33.561 --> 00:32:34.394
<v Speaker 1>destroy them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if I stress you enough for a </v>

580
00:32:37.461 --> 00:32:40.670
<v Speaker 1>reasonable length of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to blow out at your weakest</v>

581
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a nice way to think about the</v>

582
00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 1>genetics of pathology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology.</v>

583
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody has a weakest point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

584
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you blow up a balloon </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

585
00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:53.030
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to blow out where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weakest.</v>

586
00:32:53.031 --> 00:32:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of you has a weak point.</v>

587
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.533
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you will have a threshold for </v>

588
00:32:58.341 --> 00:32:59.174
<v Speaker 1>that weakness that's lower than others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally if I push hard enough on </v>

589
00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:04.430
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

590
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:05.720
<v Speaker 1>something's going to happen.</v>

591
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.553
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get hypoglycemic and </v>

592
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:08.864
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to eat too much and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to become obese or </v>

593
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:11.204
<v Speaker 1>you're going to turn to alcohol because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really useful antianxiety agent </v>

594
00:33:14.091 --> 00:33:15.550
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>

595
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.393
<v Speaker 1>you're going to develop some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other stress related illness may be </v>

596
00:33:18.321 --> 00:33:19.154
<v Speaker 1>diabetes or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to develop an anxiety </v>

597
00:33:21.081 --> 00:33:21.914
<v Speaker 1>disorder post traumatic stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe if you have a family history </v>

598
00:33:25.221 --> 00:33:26.054
<v Speaker 1>towards psychosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to develop delusions and </v>

599
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.710
<v Speaker 1>paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on,</v>

600
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.730
<v Speaker 1>it depends fundamentally on exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

601
00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where your most flawed in your,</v>

602
00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:37.754
<v Speaker 1>in your psychophysiological makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can necessarily </v>

603
00:33:40.791 --> 00:33:41.624
<v Speaker 1>predict how that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you can sometimes if somebody </v>

604
00:33:44.721 --> 00:33:47.120
<v Speaker 1>has a loaded family history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

605
00:33:47.121 --> 00:33:51.440
<v Speaker 1>and even with with with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses like schizophrenia,</v>

606
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.860
<v Speaker 1>the standard models are always stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>dye thesis.</v>

607
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.963
<v Speaker 1>There's a preexisting vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 1>which will not necessarily manifest </v>

608
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 1>itself unless the person is put under </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

609
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's interesting to think we tend to</v>

610
00:34:05.331 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 1>think about stress in some sense as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological phenomenon,</v>

611
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:11.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>

612
00:34:11.271 --> 00:34:16.271
<v Speaker 1>Often even though it is related to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way in which you construe the world,</v>

613
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:19.303
<v Speaker 1>the complexity of the world is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>stresses people that hasn't </v>

614
00:34:23.001 --> 00:34:25.340
<v Speaker 1>psychological cause the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

615
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.400
<v Speaker 1>The psychological element is well are </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

616
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:33.410
<v Speaker 1>is your tool kit kit generally adequate </v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with that complexity?</v>

617
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And some of that has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective factors,</v>

618
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of it has to do with familial </v>

619
00:34:38.751 --> 00:34:40.040
<v Speaker 1>and social factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

620
00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.453
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've considered construed a normally </v>

621
00:34:48.971 --> 00:34:52.570
<v Speaker 1>as normal or revolutionary using Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kuhn's terms.</v>

622
00:34:52.571 --> 00:34:53.404
<v Speaker 1>And a normal bit of a normally is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can deal with without blowing </v>

623
00:34:56.381 --> 00:34:59.080
<v Speaker 1>the framework within which you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>working and so on.</v>

624
00:34:59.081 --> 00:34:59.914
<v Speaker 1>I hope everyone understands this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've gone over it a couple of </v>

625
00:35:01.691 --> 00:35:02.360
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

626
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.193
<v Speaker 1>it's a very critical issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it make sense that the anomaly is </v>

627
00:35:07.361 --> 00:35:12.361
<v Speaker 1>normal if it only disrupts subsidiary </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of the plant?</v>

628
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is everyone clear about what that means?</v>

629
00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.513
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

630
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:31.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a spectrum because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and we'll,</v>

631
00:35:31.231 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 1>we'll look at the hierarchy again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is that the,</v>

632
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.450
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress,</v>

633
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.333
<v Speaker 1>the stress of the normally is </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportionate to its position in the </v>

634
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:42.234
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most stressful and normally blows </v>

635
00:35:44.761 --> 00:35:47.400
<v Speaker 1>out your top level plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

636
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.100
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a near death experience.</v>

637
00:35:50.101 --> 00:35:52.310
<v Speaker 1>It means everything that you hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>

638
00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.283
<v Speaker 1>I would be what would happen if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy collapsed and your family was </v>

639
00:35:56.161 --> 00:36:00.630
<v Speaker 1>killed in a car accident and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner left you on the same day.</v>

640
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.523
<v Speaker 1>It would be something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the bottom drops out of </v>

641
00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:05.490
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

642
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:07.260
<v Speaker 1>And that does happen to people now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

643
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.770
<v Speaker 1>And we know what happens to people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations like that,</v>

644
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.230
<v Speaker 1>depending on their level of resiliency </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that,</v>

645
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.123
<v Speaker 1>that is another issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the most common precipitants </v>

646
00:36:17.611 --> 00:36:21.240
<v Speaker 1>of severe depression is unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you might say,</v>

647
00:36:21.241 --> 00:36:22.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that psychological?</v>

648
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:23.783
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

649
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.070
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say not really.</v>

650
00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:29.923
<v Speaker 1>There's a psychological element in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not be as well prepared for </v>

651
00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.730
<v Speaker 1>about of an unemployment as you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceivably be.</v>

652
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:38.803
<v Speaker 1>But if I have someone in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a client who's depressed and </v>

653
00:36:41.661 --> 00:36:42.494
<v Speaker 1>unemployed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I try to do is treat the </v>

654
00:36:44.511 --> 00:36:46.160
<v Speaker 1>unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the depression,</v>

655
00:36:46.161 --> 00:36:47.840
<v Speaker 1>because what the hell are they going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

656
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.360
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you not be depressed when you're</v>

657
00:36:50.361 --> 00:36:51.194
<v Speaker 1>looking at a narrow way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world of narrowing opportunities </v>

658
00:36:53.631 --> 00:36:56.210
<v Speaker 1>followed by losing your house and ending</v>
<v Speaker 1>up on the street.</v>

659
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.073
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly a psychological </v>

660
00:36:59.151 --> 00:36:59.984
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

661
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Better limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you bring those levels?</v>

662
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:11.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

663
00:37:11.891 --> 00:37:12.724
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the thing is it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like being able to move on your </v>

664
00:37:15.161 --> 00:37:16.300
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say,</v>

665
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you want to have your,</v>

666
00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.550
<v Speaker 1>the first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you have a meaningful life,</v>

667
00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:22.653
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're going to start from the </v>

668
00:37:23.171 --> 00:37:28.060
<v Speaker 1>proposition that unvarnished life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very dismal and dreadful,</v>

669
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:29.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're not prepared for it,</v>

670
00:37:29.501 --> 00:37:32.110
<v Speaker 1>we'll just grind you up and that will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>very painful.</v>

671
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.273
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to use that as a </v>

672
00:37:33.581 --> 00:37:34.414
<v Speaker 1>baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The baseline isn't that you're going to </v>

673
00:37:35.651 --> 00:37:39.280
<v Speaker 1>be secure and happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The baseline is there isn't much of you.</v>

674
00:37:39.281 --> 00:37:41.860
<v Speaker 1>You're very fragile and things will </v>
<v Speaker 1>grind you into nothing.</v>

675
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a Buddhist stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

676
00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Cause the Buddhists say first dictum of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism is life is suffering.</v>

677
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.590
<v Speaker 1>The first dictum isn't that life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

678
00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.250
<v Speaker 1>So the Buddhists basically say chaos is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the normative condition.</v>

679
00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

680
00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.150
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>

681
00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.950
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you deal with that?</v>

682
00:37:59.951 --> 00:38:02.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not how you fight against it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>defend against it.</v>

683
00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think those are appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conceptuals conceptualizations.</v>

684
00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not positive illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not defense mechanisms.</v>

685
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.030
<v Speaker 1>It's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you may also use that.</v>

686
00:38:13.031 --> 00:38:17.680
<v Speaker 1>What it is is do you have an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship that works?</v>

687
00:38:17.681 --> 00:38:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a family that's that's net </v>
<v Speaker 1>work well together and strong?</v>

688
00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:22.923
<v Speaker 1>Do you have some sort of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation that regularizes your </v>

689
00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:27.574
<v Speaker 1>schedule gives you something productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do on a longterm basis is stable and </v>

690
00:38:31.691 --> 00:38:32.680
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

691
00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.693
<v Speaker 1>Do you have something that you find to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do or maybe more than one thing outside </v>

692
00:38:37.661 --> 00:38:38.890
<v Speaker 1>of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

693
00:38:38.891 --> 00:38:42.780
<v Speaker 1>And Are you compromising your mental and</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical health by doing any things that</v>

694
00:38:42.781 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 1>are particularly stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

695
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.113
<v Speaker 1>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like the top one of those I </v>

696
00:38:47.981 --> 00:38:49.720
<v Speaker 1>would say is probably alcoholism.</v>

697
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.183
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's one thing you really want to </v>

698
00:38:52.841 --> 00:38:56.260
<v Speaker 1>avoid that screws up your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's drinking too much,</v>

699
00:38:56.261 --> 00:38:59.050
<v Speaker 1>it is unbelievably dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

700
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.090
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing we might say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

701
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:04.900
<v Speaker 1>let's optimize those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the more you optimize those,</v>

702
00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.153
<v Speaker 1>the more the more pillars there are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your plant and they're only somewhat </v>

703
00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:11.164
<v Speaker 1>correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you can lose one or maybe you </v>

704
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:16.870
<v Speaker 1>can even lose too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to knock you down,</v>

705
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:18.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to sink you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

706
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:22.300
<v Speaker 1>And then you might also want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>variants on those plans to some degree.</v>

707
00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 1>So like one of the things I mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier is that it's always nice to have</v>

708
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:27.544
<v Speaker 1>an an alternative to your current job at</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand because it stops you from being </v>

709
00:39:33.551 --> 00:39:34.384
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also stops you from being a slave or </v>

710
00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:36.664
<v Speaker 1>a victim or maybe even stops you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a tyrant because you've got some </v>

711
00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:40.624
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

712
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:41.643
<v Speaker 1>So you diversify your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hierarchy of plants essentially </v>

713
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:49.083
<v Speaker 1>just like you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it as stock market </v>

714
00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 1>investing in some sense it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogous idea.</v>

715
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.720
<v Speaker 1>You don't put all your eggs in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>basket.</v>

716
00:39:55.721 --> 00:39:58.840
<v Speaker 1>You diversify across multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>portfolios.</v>

717
00:39:58.841 --> 00:39:59.674
<v Speaker 1>So if one sector gets knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully it doesn't knock you </v>

718
00:40:02.951 --> 00:40:05.760
<v Speaker 1>completely out of the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

719
00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.213
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly what a guide you </v>

720
00:40:08.081 --> 00:40:08.914
<v Speaker 1>through in the F in the future authoring</v>
<v Speaker 1>program too because it asks you to </v>

721
00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:15.610
<v Speaker 1>consider what I think are the main six </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of your life,</v>

722
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:17.103
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I do when a </v>

723
00:40:18.161 --> 00:40:22.300
<v Speaker 1>client comes is I just do a rough walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>through of those dimensions.</v>

724
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:23.163
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does anybody care if you're alive or </v>

725
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:26.620
<v Speaker 1>dead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

726
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:27.850
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any friends?</v>

727
00:40:27.851 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you have anybody that loves you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an intimate relationship?</v>

728
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:33.010
<v Speaker 1>How are things going with your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a job?</v>

729
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Are you as educated as you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligent?</v>

730
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any room for advancement in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future?</v>

731
00:40:37.451 --> 00:40:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you do anything interesting outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your job?</v>

732
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:44.800
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer to all those is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're not depressed,</v>

733
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 1>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just are screwed.</v>

734
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if someone,</v>

735
00:40:50.021 --> 00:40:53.710
<v Speaker 1>like someone comes to me and they're 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the issue,</v>

736
00:40:53.711 --> 00:40:54.544
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're also drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Humpty dumpty has hit the </v>

737
00:40:58.421 --> 00:41:02.020
<v Speaker 1>floor and no one is going to put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces together because it's just,</v>

738
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.590
<v Speaker 1>it's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too much people,</v>

739
00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:06.424
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a whole lifetime to put those </v>

740
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:08.584
<v Speaker 1>things together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a sudden that might have </v>

741
00:41:10.101 --> 00:41:10.934
<v Speaker 1>started as a psychological problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the time it's fully manifest in </v>

742
00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 1>your 40 that's not a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

743
00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 1>It's just a complete catastrophe.</v>

744
00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:23.683
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

745
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Well I think sometimes antidepressants </v>
<v Speaker 1>help and the reason they help his,</v>

746
00:41:28.171 --> 00:41:31.050
<v Speaker 1>cause they actually buffer the stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

747
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.273
<v Speaker 1>So you know you're being ground down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world because essentially what you are </v>

748
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:35.900
<v Speaker 1>is you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

749
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you're not even in the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

750
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.060
<v Speaker 1>you're so low in the dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that you're not even in it.</v>

751
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're an outcast fundamentally.</v>

752
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.083
<v Speaker 1>So maybe buffering the stress response </v>
<v Speaker 1>will help the person just not die from </v>

753
00:41:48.681 --> 00:41:51.680
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you start with one thing,</v>

754
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you,</v>

755
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.233
<v Speaker 1>you lay out the potential areas for </v>
<v Speaker 1>improval improvement on the table and </v>

756
00:41:59.301 --> 00:41:59.871
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

757
00:41:59.871 --> 00:42:00.704
<v Speaker 1>can we think of some small steps that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might take in one or more of those </v>

758
00:42:03.531 --> 00:42:08.390
<v Speaker 1>domains to start putting something solid</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath your feet?</v>

759
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.660
<v Speaker 1>But it's what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

760
00:42:11.661 --> 00:42:12.494
<v Speaker 1>is that as you lose those pillars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that problems manifest </v>

761
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 1>themselves in your life becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>networked.</v>

762
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.213
<v Speaker 1>And so you might make progress here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some other catastrophe that's </v>

763
00:42:25.101 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 1>looming over here is going to knock you </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

764
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.840
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

765
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 3>So there's that real happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy.</v>

766
00:42:43.381 --> 00:42:44.290
<v Speaker 3>What about people?</v>

767
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that you're,</v>

768
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.983
<v Speaker 1>you're better protected against being </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreadfully miserable and swamp than you </v>

769
00:42:50.171 --> 00:42:51.004
<v Speaker 1>would otherwise be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say you have to do those </v>

770
00:42:54.161 --> 00:42:57.220
<v Speaker 1>things before you can even address the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue of being happy.</v>

771
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if,</v>

772
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:59.543
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't established yourself in </v>

773
00:43:02.921 --> 00:43:05.110
<v Speaker 1>one or one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or two of those domains,</v>

774
00:43:05.111 --> 00:43:10.111
<v Speaker 1>say there's some obvious things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do to decrease the degree to which</v>

775
00:43:10.181 --> 00:43:12.910
<v Speaker 1>your life is negative that you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet done.</v>

776
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:14.103
<v Speaker 1>So I would say you shouldn't even get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existential problem before you've </v>

777
00:43:16.601 --> 00:43:17.434
<v Speaker 1>solved the practical problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you may find that if you solve the </v>

778
00:43:20.351 --> 00:43:21.184
<v Speaker 1>practical problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existential problems would become </v>

779
00:43:23.231 --> 00:43:24.190
<v Speaker 1>bearable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

780
00:43:24.191 --> 00:43:26.480
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

781
00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Because I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's another class of people and</v>

782
00:43:30.041 --> 00:43:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I would say this is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologies of being creative.</v>

783
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:37.540
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a high open person and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all those things,</v>

784
00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.400
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to be enough.</v>

785
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:43.510
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to pick another </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain where you're working on something</v>

786
00:43:43.511 --> 00:43:44.344
<v Speaker 1>that's positive and somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary because like the creative </v>

787
00:43:49.211 --> 00:43:50.044
<v Speaker 1>impulse is for someone who's open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know it's a fundamental personality </v>

788
00:43:53.621 --> 00:43:54.880
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've watched,</v>

789
00:43:54.881 --> 00:43:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I'd have clients who are very high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness and others who aren't.</v>

790
00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And if the ones who are high in openness</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't doing something creative,</v>

791
00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.000
<v Speaker 1>then they're like dead sticks there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't live properly.</v>

792
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.790
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know that.</v>

793
00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.890
<v Speaker 1>And I think those are the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

794
00:44:11.891 --> 00:44:16.150
<v Speaker 1>who benefit particularly from depth </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological approaches,</v>

795
00:44:16.151 --> 00:44:20.170
<v Speaker 1>especially young Ian approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that all of ewing's clients were</v>

796
00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.930
<v Speaker 1>high in openness because I've watched my</v>
<v Speaker 1>clients,</v>

797
00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I'll try union ideas out on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they're high in openness,</v>

798
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.280
<v Speaker 1>they worked like a charm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just fits right in with their psyche.</v>

799
00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:34.410
<v Speaker 1>But if conservative people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally conservative people low in</v>

800
00:44:34.411 --> 00:44:37.110
<v Speaker 1>openness and high in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

801
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't click because the union </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach is aesthetic and creative and,</v>

802
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.280
<v Speaker 1>and lots of people aren't either of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

803
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:47.580
<v Speaker 1>So there was another question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

804
00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they fight.</v>

805
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're orderly,</v>

806
00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:55.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause conscientiousness is partly </v>

807
00:44:56.511 --> 00:44:57.344
<v Speaker 1>orderliness and part of the openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was like that he was extremely </v>

808
00:45:01.701 --> 00:45:02.534
<v Speaker 1>orderly and extremely high in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways he solved that </v>

809
00:45:06.321 --> 00:45:08.000
<v Speaker 1>problem was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was quite interesting,</v>

810
00:45:08.001 --> 00:45:09.760
<v Speaker 1>is that whenever there were art </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibits,</v>

811
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.500
<v Speaker 1>exhibitions in Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were two types.</v>

812
00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:13.573
<v Speaker 1>There was the approved Nazi art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was very structured and </v>

813
00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:19.760
<v Speaker 1>conventional and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

814
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.570
<v Speaker 1>bordered on the propaganda stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was forbidden art,</v>

815
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:26.510
<v Speaker 1>which was really chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like often it was a,</v>

816
00:45:26.511 --> 00:45:27.344
<v Speaker 1>the expressionists stuff for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really emotionally expressive </v>

817
00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:31.453
<v Speaker 1>but chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Heather would have both exhibitions </v>

818
00:45:34.071 --> 00:45:36.530
<v Speaker 1>going on at the same time and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them would be forbidden,</v>

819
00:45:36.531 --> 00:45:38.510
<v Speaker 1>then the other would be approved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

820
00:45:38.511 --> 00:45:41.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with orderliness is that</v>

821
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.270
<v Speaker 1>you want everything to be in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

822
00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.160
<v Speaker 1>And no wonder we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

823
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.190
<v Speaker 1>we've described why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're open,</v>

824
00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:50.600
<v Speaker 1>you're always thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

825
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:53.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a better way of putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things into a category.</v>

826
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:55.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough,</v>

827
00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:56.683
<v Speaker 1>so orderly open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are always at odds with </v>

828
00:45:58.611 --> 00:45:59.480
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

829
00:45:59.481 --> 00:46:00.314
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

830
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:04.243
<v Speaker 3>industrial and high in openness but like</v>
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily like I can see by the </v>

831
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:14.340
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] but I also really old.</v>

832
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well people like that are often </v>

833
00:46:16.011 --> 00:46:17.410
<v Speaker 1>extremely successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

834
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

835
00:46:18.531 --> 00:46:19.364
<v Speaker 1>And it looks like industriousness is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of conscientiousness that predicts </v>

836
00:46:22.131 --> 00:46:22.964
<v Speaker 1>longterm life success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And orderliness is the part that </v>

837
00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.850
<v Speaker 1>predicts conservative political </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes,</v>

838
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.810
<v Speaker 1>but low openness is also associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative political attitudes.</v>

839
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:38.300
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>

840
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:42.444
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

841
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:46.110
<v Speaker 1>the descent into the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is basically what occurs.</v>

842
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:49.350
<v Speaker 1>It can occur at any level of your plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

843
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:52.080
<v Speaker 1>From the macro levels to the micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

844
00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:52.914
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that it's a descent </v>
<v Speaker 1>into chaos if the unexpected thing is </v>

845
00:46:56.341 --> 00:47:01.080
<v Speaker 1>big enough to invalidate the framework </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're using to deal with the world</v>

846
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:03.000
<v Speaker 1>at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

847
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:07.950
<v Speaker 1>And then the degree to which you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion is proportionate to the</v>

848
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:09.023
<v Speaker 1>importance of that plan to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization of your perception and </v>

849
00:47:12.541 --> 00:47:15.390
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about it as you could</v>

850
00:47:15.391 --> 00:47:18.420
<v Speaker 1>think about what you bring to bear on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

851
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you can think about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as how Google maps manages it.</v>

852
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.680
<v Speaker 1>You know how you can take Google maps </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

853
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.360
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's a cybernetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

854
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:28.223
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole gps process because you say </v>

855
00:47:30.401 --> 00:47:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm here and I'm going there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it maps to rude out for you and</v>

856
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:38.830
<v Speaker 1>if you go off route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes through a little period of chaos</v>

857
00:47:38.831 --> 00:47:40.030
<v Speaker 1>and then it finds another route.</v>

858
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:41.103
<v Speaker 1>So it's really an intelligent system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you noticed that Google maps is </v>

859
00:47:44.711 --> 00:47:45.544
<v Speaker 1>scalable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can look at probably if you're </v>

860
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:53.131
<v Speaker 1>going from here to Mississauga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using a map of Canada is the wrong map,</v>

861
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:54.993
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to scale the thing down until </v>

862
00:47:56.471 --> 00:47:57.304
<v Speaker 1>you hit the level of resolution that </v>
<v Speaker 1>both that best represents the situation </v>

863
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:03.580
<v Speaker 1>so that you can move to where you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>

864
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:04.623
<v Speaker 1>You can scale up and down in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so finding out that the entire </v>

865
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:09.484
<v Speaker 1>country is being destroyed by nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs is going to be a much bigger a </v>

866
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.920
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe in relationship to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>

867
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:15.883
<v Speaker 1>Then finding out that there's a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles in the street on your way to </v>

868
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Mississauga that haven't been marked on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the map.</v>

869
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.240
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

870
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:27.290
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be much more upset when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire superordinate,</v>

871
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:28.763
<v Speaker 1>the low resolution plans are disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when the high resolution plans are </v>

872
00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:34.630
<v Speaker 1>disrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly how your mind,</v>

873
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.753
<v Speaker 1>part of the problem we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve here is how upset should you be </v>

874
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:41.500
<v Speaker 1>when something you don't want happens?</v>

875
00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually impossible to compute.</v>

876
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.670
<v Speaker 1>But then the problem is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compute it because if you don't,</v>

877
00:48:48.671 --> 00:48:50.620
<v Speaker 1>you'll burn yourself out with stress and</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry.</v>

878
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:51.923
<v Speaker 1>And that's not psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll just kill you because it's </v>

879
00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:57.850
<v Speaker 1>actually a physic psychophysiological he</v>
<v Speaker 1>damaging process.</v>

880
00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:58.893
<v Speaker 1>So you have to constrain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's some of the ways that you </v>

881
00:49:01.361 --> 00:49:02.890
<v Speaker 1>constrain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

882
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.740
<v Speaker 1>you're born with a baseline level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

883
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.383
<v Speaker 1>So if you're higher in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna think that smaller things </v>

884
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:13.570
<v Speaker 1>are more catastrophic than someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower in neuroticism.</v>

885
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:14.980
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

886
00:49:14.981 --> 00:49:15.814
<v Speaker 1>who's right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is it depends completely </v>

887
00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:20.710
<v Speaker 1>on the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's random.</v>

888
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:21.573
<v Speaker 1>It's fundamentally random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there's a normal </v>

889
00:49:23.021 --> 00:49:25.210
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On average,</v>

890
00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:30.211
<v Speaker 1>we would say that typical person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>matched to the typical environment,</v>

891
00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:33.310
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes the terrified people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be right.</v>

892
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:35.200
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the people that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bother,</v>

893
00:49:35.201 --> 00:49:36.670
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

894
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one,</v>

895
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.450
<v Speaker 1>it's crapshoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is,</v>

896
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you in a dominance hierarchy?</v>

897
00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.093
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand is how should you </v>

898
00:49:48.701 --> 00:49:49.534
<v Speaker 1>regard yourself as an active and </v>
<v Speaker 1>competent organism when you're facing </v>

899
00:49:52.391 --> 00:49:53.224
<v Speaker 1>problems that you can't compute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is we're not </v>

900
00:49:56.831 --> 00:49:57.664
<v Speaker 1>going to solve that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to distribute the problem </v>

901
00:50:00.071 --> 00:50:03.370
<v Speaker 1>into the social network and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to let everyone else solve it.</v>

902
00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.580
<v Speaker 1>And so if you rise up in the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

903
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.450
<v Speaker 1>your brain reacts as if the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy structure,</v>

904
00:50:10.451 --> 00:50:15.130
<v Speaker 1>which is composed of many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many brains has run its computations and</v>

905
00:50:15.131 --> 00:50:17.050
<v Speaker 1>decided that you're pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>competent.</v>

906
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:18.303
<v Speaker 1>And so the way your brain responds to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is it cranks up your serotonin </v>

907
00:50:20.711 --> 00:50:23.380
<v Speaker 1>production and decreases your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

908
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.040
<v Speaker 1>And it's perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>computation because a,</v>

909
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.153
<v Speaker 1>if everybody says you're competent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're competent enough so that you're </v>

910
00:50:30.981 --> 00:50:34.310
<v Speaker 1>going to get more rewarded for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence than other people are,</v>

911
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.800
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to make you more secure</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your job.</v>

912
00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:40.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's gonna make you more desirable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in demand among other people,</v>

913
00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:43.700
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to give you access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources you wouldn't otherwise have.</v>

914
00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a,</v>

915
00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:48.944
<v Speaker 1>there's a correlated element to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of your level of self </v>

916
