1
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.263
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.680
<v Speaker 2>was a couple of things I want to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you about today.</v>

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Many things I want to tell you about.</v>

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 2>give you a schema that's going to enable</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to understand.</v>

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.523
<v Speaker 2>I think it will enable you to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories like the one I told you last </v>

7
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:26.334
<v Speaker 2>time you remember Jonah and the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to provide you with this Schema </v>

8
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 2>so that you can understand stories like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 2>But many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many more stories like that.</v>

10
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 2>And partly what I'm telling you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 2>in some sense our archetypes and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a vr and an archetype isn't,</v>

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.953
<v Speaker 2>it's an idea that was made most popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last hundred years by Carl </v>

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 2>Young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a much older idea that not,</v>

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 2>it's really a platonic ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in some ways,</v>

15
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 2>and it means it means something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental pattern.</v>

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 2>And so an architect can manifest itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>in different ways.</v>

17
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 2>It could be a pattern of emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

18
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 2>So that could be something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

19
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 2>It could be the way that that emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>response displays itself on your body,</v>

20
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:08.994
<v Speaker 2>on your face.</v>

21
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.953
<v Speaker 2>It could be the way that that emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>fields and displays itself on your face </v>

22
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 2>and then plays itself out as a drama in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your local environment.</v>

23
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 2>So like an angry argument is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>architect will phenomenon.</v>

24
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 2>And the reason it's archetipal is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

25
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have one them,</v>

26
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 2>you have them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have them,</v>

27
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 2>you have them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has them.</v>

28
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 2>And so you can't really think about them</v>
<v Speaker 2>as individual.</v>

29
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 2>You have to think about them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>universal and you can't think about them</v>

30
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 2>as something that you create in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although in a sense you do,</v>

31
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 2>but also as something that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

32
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.373
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you read about young and </v>

33
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.083
<v Speaker 2>archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite confusing because you can </v>

34
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 2>never be sure whether he's talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>an instinct and emotion,</v>

35
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.533
<v Speaker 2>a motivational system or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>subpersonality or the subpersonality </v>

36
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 2>within which those things manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

37
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:02.994
<v Speaker 2>or even the social drama that's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>played out in time and space in the </v>

38
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:06.744
<v Speaker 2>social world.</v>

39
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.643
<v Speaker 2>But our real archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say is all of those things at </v>

40
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:09.774
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we use archetipal means of </v>

41
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:13.584
<v Speaker 2>expression to represent how we act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not the same thing as resent </v>

42
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 2>representing what the world is made out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

43
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a very different thing and so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could say in some sense,</v>

44
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 2>we tell stories and understand stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that we can figure out how people act</v>

45
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:27.564
<v Speaker 2>and how they should act and then we </v>
<v Speaker 2>conduct science so that we can figure </v>

46
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:30.864
<v Speaker 2>out what the world's like from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>material objective perspective and the </v>

47
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.064
<v Speaker 2>two things coexist on easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the more primary form of </v>

48
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:39.294
<v Speaker 2>knowledge is actually how to act with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientific model nested inside it </v>

49
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:43.974
<v Speaker 2>because it's the most important question</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to solve as a living </v>

50
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 2>organism isn't what the world is made </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of.</v>

51
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 2>It's how you should act in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say from a Darwinian perspective even so</v>

52
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 2>that you can live long enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduce.</v>

53
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 2>That's basically from a strict </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological perspective.</v>

54
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:00.484
<v Speaker 2>In some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you have to do in order to </v>

55
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 2>be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of obvious,</v>

56
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.704
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not very successful if </v>

57
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.384
<v Speaker 2>you just go and die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course death from a genetic </v>

58
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>perspective and failing to leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>offspring are much the same thing.</v>

59
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.530
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>now one of the questions might be how is</v>

60
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 2>it that we conceive of the world as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place to act in?</v>

61
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.113
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to outline a hypothesis for </v>

62
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 2>you and then explain the significance of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hypothesis.</v>

63
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:35.164
<v Speaker 2>And the hypothesis involves the </v>
<v Speaker 2>description of what you might consider </v>

64
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 2>constituent elements and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation processes.</v>

65
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as far as I can tell,</v>

66
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.403
<v Speaker 2>the constituent elements of the stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we tell about how people act and </v>

67
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 2>should act our characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that makes sense,</v>

68
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you really can't have a drama or</v>

69
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>a story without characters.</v>

70
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is the characters have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be understandable.</v>

71
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 2>And so for them to be understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sort of have to be like you or they</v>

72
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 2>have to be like someone that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to be human.</v>

73
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly that they're human.</v>

74
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:16.621
<v Speaker 2>Because even when you're telling a story</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what happened to you today,</v>

75
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to think about what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

76
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 2>So someone might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

77
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 2>how was your day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

78
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe that's the lowest level,</v>

79
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 2>lowest resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highest abstract story.</v>

80
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 2>My Day was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty boring story.</v>

81
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 2>It's better than terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

82
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.274
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not interesting and it's not </v>

83
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:38.014
<v Speaker 2>detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but person gets the notion that things </v>

84
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 2>went according to what according to plan</v>
<v Speaker 2>or more specifically the things unfolded</v>

85
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:46.174
<v Speaker 2>the way he wanted them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not exactly the same as according </v>

86
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 2>to plan because a plan is kind of a cold</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive thing,</v>

87
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or or,</v>

88
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 2>or expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expectation.</v>

89
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 2>The cognitive scientists sort of use </v>
<v Speaker 2>weather well while what you,</v>

90
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.483
<v Speaker 2>how you wanted them to implies that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have desires and emotions and </v>

91
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:04.414
<v Speaker 2>motivations and that they inform the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're acting in the world because </v>

92
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:08.344
<v Speaker 2>you don't just act in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you act in the world so that you've </v>

93
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 2>tried to turn it into something better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is right now.</v>

94
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Assuming you have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 2>because some people act on the world to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it worse than it is now,</v>

96
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to forget about those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people for now.</v>

97
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 2>So when you say find someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you basically say,</v>

98
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.233
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got what I wanted today without undue </v>

99
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 2>hassle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

100
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.250
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really condensed version of the</v>

101
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>events of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a very good story,</v>

102
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 2>although it might suffice for casual </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

103
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.361
<v Speaker 2>Person might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

104
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:43.790
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

105
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 2>What did you do today?</v>

106
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

107
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I woke up this morning and I went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

108
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:51.790
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 2>the subway took a lot longer than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually does.</v>

110
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:59.440
<v Speaker 2>I used that to do some studying and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to school at night.</v>

112
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I particularly don't lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lunch was really good and I met some</v>

113
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's kind of a story,</v>

114
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

115
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 2>the person that you're talking to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might listen to you.</v>

116
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not a particularly compelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

117
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably better than fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

118
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:15.884
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you select those elements to </v>

119
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 2>talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

120
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 2>you didn't talk about how many times you</v>
<v Speaker 2>blinked your eyes.</v>

121
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.173
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first minute that you woke up and </v>

122
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 2>you didn't describe the motor movements </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you use to put your left leg on the</v>

123
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:29.024
<v Speaker 2>floor and you didn't describe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what bowl you used for </v>

124
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 2>breakfast.</v>

125
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 2>And the reason you didn't do that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a,</v>

126
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't remember for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and B,</v>

127
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 2>you don't care and neither does have </v>
<v Speaker 2>your listener.</v>

128
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:41.744
<v Speaker 2>But that's the peculiar things that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>listener is going to care about some </v>

129
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 2>things and not care about other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a good storyteller,</v>

130
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.183
<v Speaker 2>you kind of automatically know which of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things that you should talk about </v>

131
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.563
<v Speaker 2>so that you're interested in which of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things you should ignore it so that </v>

132
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 2>you're not boring your listener to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

133
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.010
<v Speaker 2>And you also understand that they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>also understand them,</v>

134
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.293
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know how you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you know is that you're trying to </v>

135
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:05.774
<v Speaker 2>tell an interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in some sense what you're doing is </v>

136
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:09.464
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to reduce a sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions and conceptions of exceptional </v>

137
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 2>complexity to the just right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like the essential or the moral</v>

138
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 2>in some sense.</v>

139
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 2>And you're trying to convey that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other person is listening partly</v>

140
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 2>because they want to indicate that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>care for you.</v>

141
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.883
<v Speaker 2>And we'd like to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to stay caught up with your </v>

142
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 2>ongoing narrative so that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand you.</v>

143
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 2>And maybe also because they might think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they'll garner some,</v>

144
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of information factual or behavioral</v>

145
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 2>that might aid them in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:38.894
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're doing that to each other all </v>

147
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:40.694
<v Speaker 2>the time and we automatically do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We automatically know how to tell </v>

148
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:43.724
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I'm saying is that even the </v>

149
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:46.034
<v Speaker 2>person that you describe when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe yourself to someone else isn't </v>

150
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:50.354
<v Speaker 2>exactly you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some representation of you as a </v>

151
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:58.130
<v Speaker 2>sort of generic human being that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>about doing certain kinds of interesting</v>

152
00:07:58.131 --> 00:07:58.964
<v Speaker 2>things in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or here's a way of thinking about it </v>

153
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 2>roughly is that you make yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero of your own story.</v>

154
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.883
<v Speaker 2>And so you kind of know that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go to a movie and movies are </v>

155
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 2>usually romances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say or hero stories,</v>

156
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 2>we'll romances or adventures or both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

157
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes they turn out well and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a comedy and sometimes they don't</v>

159
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 2>turn out so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a tragedy.</v>

160
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.483
<v Speaker 2>But when you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you basically see as a story about </v>

161
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.873
<v Speaker 2>another person who sort of like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the hero and what you do is you </v>

162
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 2>track them through a sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventures.</v>

163
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:31.994
<v Speaker 2>And usually what you track them through </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't things were good and then they </v>

164
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:36.854
<v Speaker 2>stayed good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the end they were still the </v>

165
00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>same as they were at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And good.</v>

166
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because why do you want to watch that?</v>

167
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.013
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you should because isn't that </v>

168
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:47.144
<v Speaker 2>pleasant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person's happy and then they stay </v>

169
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 2>happy and then they end happy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's happy.</v>

170
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.000
<v Speaker 2>It's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't that interesting?</v>

171
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.223
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really what want to see is you </v>

172
00:08:56.611 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 2>either see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to see someone get into trouble</v>

173
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 2>and fail in a spectacularly interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

174
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.023
<v Speaker 2>or you want to see someone get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble and then overcome it in a </v>

175
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:10.410
<v Speaker 2>spectacularly interesting way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this idea in the,</v>

176
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.543
<v Speaker 2>in the story that the person has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergo some kind of transformation in </v>

177
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 2>the midst of their travails and efforts </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order for it to be interesting.</v>

178
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 2>So they have to start in one place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to end up somewhere that's not</v>

179
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:26.130
<v Speaker 2>so good in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated way.</v>

180
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.143
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe by transforming nerve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their character by transforming the </v>

181
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:34.270
<v Speaker 2>surroundings are bread coming to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of realization or maybe just by dim</v>

182
00:09:34.271 --> 00:09:35.104
<v Speaker 2>wit and luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they managed to solve the set of </v>

183
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 2>problems that emerge triumphant at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other end.</v>

184
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.013
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the meaning of Jonah and the </v>

185
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 2>whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you remember what happens to Jonah is</v>

186
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:50.430
<v Speaker 2>that he's got this destiny he supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be pursuing.</v>

187
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Any decides that it's too much trouble?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

188
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 2>not unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you remember what he was told</v>

189
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 2>to do was go to tale a whole city that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were misbehaving,</v>

190
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.133
<v Speaker 2>assuming rightly as he did that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would not make him pretty particularly </v>

191
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:07.370
<v Speaker 2>park popular and maybe he'd get killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and even if he didn't,</v>

192
00:10:07.371 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 2>it would be extraordinarily difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought,</v>

193
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:10.194
<v Speaker 2>there's no damn way I'm doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he denied his destiny and as a </v>

194
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 2>consequence he fell into the abyss and </v>
<v Speaker 2>was swallowed up.</v>

195
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.930
<v Speaker 2>And then because he repented and decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>to carry on with what he was to carry on</v>

196
00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:27.040
<v Speaker 2>with his responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the creature of the abyss spit them back</v>

197
00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:29.440
<v Speaker 2>up and he got to go along his merry way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>

198
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:30.274
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that has ever happened to </v>

199
00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:32.440
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's wrong.</v>

200
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Things like that happen to all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know it.</v>

201
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.210
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

202
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.163
<v Speaker 2>here's a couple of examples and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to draw all sorts of examples </v>

203
00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:41.080
<v Speaker 2>from your own life.</v>

204
00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

205
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a story of betrayal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

206
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.380
<v Speaker 2>maybe in one of your relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>uninformed</v>

207
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.403
<v Speaker 1>no</v>

208
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.470
<v Speaker 2>salaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ended up establishing a relationship</v>

209
00:10:57.471 --> 00:10:59.390
<v Speaker 2>with someone who was really not good for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

210
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.273
<v Speaker 2>And that might mean while they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a bad personality match or </v>

211
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:06.740
<v Speaker 2>it might mean they really weren't good </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you because you know,</v>

212
00:11:06.741 --> 00:11:07.574
<v Speaker 2>you could get pretty unlucky and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get tangled up with someone who's very </v>

213
00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:10.934
<v Speaker 2>deceitful and very malevolent and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>could care less about your maybe who </v>

214
00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:14.384
<v Speaker 2>even wants to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can establish a trusting </v>

215
00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:18.890
<v Speaker 2>relationship with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or at least you trust them.</v>

216
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:20.360
<v Speaker 2>And then one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:11:20.361 --> 00:11:23.630
<v Speaker 2>you find out that they are not who they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said they weren't.</v>

218
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Or even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are not who you thought they were.</v>

219
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.340
<v Speaker 2>And so then maybe you're in a committed </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship and they'd be trey you with</v>

220
00:11:31.341 --> 00:11:33.230
<v Speaker 2>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you think,</v>

221
00:11:33.231 --> 00:11:36.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you are at home and you're,</v>

222
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're perfectly happy about being at </v>

223
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:38.714
<v Speaker 2>home and then your partner comes home </v>
<v Speaker 2>and for one reason or now that you find </v>

224
00:11:40.641 --> 00:11:41.474
<v Speaker 2>out that they're having an affair or </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they'd be trained you or that </v>

225
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:45.290
<v Speaker 2>they'd lied to you.</v>

226
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.210
<v Speaker 2>And some other spectacularly important </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

227
00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:49.280
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's a lover and maybe it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>family member,</v>

228
00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:51.080
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's a sibling and maybe it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend,</v>

229
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.120
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

230
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 2>And so here's the way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

231
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.433
<v Speaker 2>The minute before they come home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in one place and you remember a </v>

232
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 2>place isn't just a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

233
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.360
<v Speaker 2>A place as a place in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we live in space time,</v>

234
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:10.240
<v Speaker 2>we live in time and place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is you can be in the</v>

235
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:11.074
<v Speaker 2>same place in one minute and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different place in the next </v>

236
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.790
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you haven't even moved.</v>

237
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 2>And so place is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated idea.</v>

238
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.973
<v Speaker 2>So you're sitting at home and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching oprah and you're perfectly </v>

239
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:24.964
<v Speaker 2>content to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the person comes home and the </v>

240
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:27.694
<v Speaker 2>bottom of your world falls out and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you're not where you </v>

241
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:31.294
<v Speaker 2>thought you were and it's a really weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>place that you are now because it's not </v>

242
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 2>where you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

243
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:37.743
<v Speaker 2>But you also don't know where it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know who that person </v>

244
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:42.274
<v Speaker 2>is that's in that room with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what your past with them </v>

245
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.683
<v Speaker 2>was or what it meant or anything else </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it because it was predicated on </v>

246
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.303
<v Speaker 2>absolute misperceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So none of your memories about those </v>

247
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 2>events are valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you have them as memories.</v>

248
00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.073
<v Speaker 2>And then you have a worst problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is if you're betrayed badly </v>

249
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:03.820
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only are you not going to understand</v>

250
00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:05.950
<v Speaker 2>your immediate past with that person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

251
00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.900
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your future's also gone.</v>

252
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:08.734
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big problem as is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your presence has become radically more </v>

253
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:12.424
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's worse than that because if </v>

254
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:16.120
<v Speaker 2>you're really be trained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're also going to think,</v>

255
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.800
<v Speaker 2>who am I that I could be that stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're going to think,</v>

256
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 2>what is a human being that they can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>that corrupt.</v>

257
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:25.743
<v Speaker 2>And so not only at have has the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the fundamentals being kicked out </v>

258
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:30.034
<v Speaker 2>of the substructure of your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your notion of what it means to be </v>

259
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 2>you and what it needs to be human </v>
<v Speaker 2>might've been seriously disrupted.</v>

260
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:38.434
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about that is that's a </v>

261
00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:40.264
<v Speaker 2>nontrivial event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People call that traumatic it didn't </v>

262
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 2>like and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like a physical wound.</v>

263
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 2>And in fact it has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly if the trauma's great enough,</v>

264
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 2>it can produce a psychophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>wound because that sort of trauma,</v>

265
00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.253
<v Speaker 2>a deep betrayal is a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will damage your brain and maybe you'll </v>

266
00:13:57.611 --> 00:13:58.444
<v Speaker 2>recover from it and maybe you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways that that's being </v>

267
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:02.914
<v Speaker 2>represented forever in mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories is by being swallowed up by a </v>

268
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:08.134
<v Speaker 2>subterranean beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that comes up from the </v>

269
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 2>depths and pulls you down and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in it.</v>

270
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Now why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

271
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.050
<v Speaker 2>that's an extraordinarily complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

272
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 2>But here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the answer.</v>

273
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:23.254
<v Speaker 2>As nearly as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we evolved a very complicated </v>

274
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:31.000
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychological system to signal </v>
<v Speaker 2>alarm.</v>

275
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.150
<v Speaker 2>So that's anxiety threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the threat sensitive,</v>

276
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that makes us freeze for example.</v>

277
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at how an animal uses </v>
<v Speaker 2>that system,</v>

278
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:41.164
<v Speaker 2>let's say a mammal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to keep it simple cause we're all </v>

279
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:44.560
<v Speaker 2>mammals and so we can kind of understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals.</v>

280
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.693
<v Speaker 2>So if a rabbit sees a wolf for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to freeze so that the wolf </v>

281
00:14:49.871 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 2>can't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I,</v>

282
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.693
<v Speaker 2>if a rack smells a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it has never smelled a cow in </v>

283
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 2>its whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to also freeze.</v>

284
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:57.494
<v Speaker 2>And interestingly with rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you put rats in a natural </v>

285
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.234
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means they get to help little rap </v>

286
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.310
<v Speaker 2>dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies,</v>

287
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.980
<v Speaker 2>little rat families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not like little white rats,</v>

288
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:07.814
<v Speaker 2>a logan a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're happy family rats and they've </v>

289
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:11.384
<v Speaker 2>got their burrows and they live in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>little societies that maybe there is a </v>

290
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 2>part of their territory where they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>go get food and they're used to that.</v>

291
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.673
<v Speaker 2>So those scary out there in the day kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of hiding because they don't like light </v>

292
00:15:21.561 --> 00:15:22.394
<v Speaker 2>or maybe they'll scurry out at night </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause rats are night things and they'll </v>

293
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 2>get their food and they'll eat it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it back or whatever they,</v>

294
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.213
<v Speaker 2>whatever they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>share it with their family or at least </v>

295
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:30.854
<v Speaker 2>bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well let's say that you put a cat out </v>

296
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Speaker 2>there or maybe you even just put it out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and take it away so that the place</v>

297
00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:37.244
<v Speaker 2>smells like cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well one of those rocks goes out there </v>

298
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:41.000
<v Speaker 2>and sees that cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

299
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:45.560
<v Speaker 2>it's going to freeze and it is not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy thing because imagine you're a rat</v>

300
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:46.603
<v Speaker 2>and a thing that's four times as big as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lion suddenly appears on your front </v>

301
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:50.780
<v Speaker 2>yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

302
00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:51.770
<v Speaker 2>that's rough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

303
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.980
<v Speaker 2>You're going to freeze and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go hike downstairs and what are</v>

304
00:15:54.981 --> 00:15:55.814
<v Speaker 2>you going to do?</v>

305
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a rat,</v>

306
00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:57.524
<v Speaker 2>you're going to screen for 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is nonstop with your little beak </v>

307
00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:04.130
<v Speaker 2>poking out of your borough so everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>can hear you scream.</v>

308
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same given the length of </v>
<v Speaker 2>robots,</v>

309
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.990
<v Speaker 2>life as you screaming nonstop for two </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>

310
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:10.363
<v Speaker 2>So like that rats nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not happy about the whole cap </v>

311
00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe,</v>

312
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:15.044
<v Speaker 2>maybe if no more cat odor happens by and</v>
<v Speaker 2>no hypervigilant rat see any more cats </v>

313
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:20.804
<v Speaker 2>than after it screens for two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts to calm down a little bit and </v>

314
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:27.500
<v Speaker 2>maybe then it starts to remember that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hungry and that you know,</v>

315
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 2>there's things to attend to and so then </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it very,</v>

316
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 2>very carefully goes back out where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was foraging for food,</v>

317
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:35.084
<v Speaker 2>sort of crouched over and hypervigilant </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not moving very much in case that </v>

318
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:42.440
<v Speaker 2>damn cats around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe slowly it regains control</v>

319
00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 2>over its territory.</v>

320
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.533
<v Speaker 2>It runs back and forth trying to ensure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that none of that place that used to be </v>

321
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:50.930
<v Speaker 2>safe has got troublesome cats associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it anymore.</v>

322
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 2>And so in some sense the bottom fell out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that box life.</v>

323
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:55.723
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is the rat has predator </v>
<v Speaker 2>detection systems that are associated </v>

324
00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:04.040
<v Speaker 2>with extreme anxiety and escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're automatically activated whenever</v>

325
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a Predator in site and we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>those systems too.</v>

326
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 2>But human beings are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

327
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

328
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.180
<v Speaker 2>rats have predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies,</v>

329
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.750
<v Speaker 2>humans have predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entities.</v>

330
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then we might say,</v>

331
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:21.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's a human predator slash?</v>

332
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Enemy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

333
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.763
<v Speaker 2>it depends on how long a period of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>over which you wish to calculate what </v>

334
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 2>constitutes human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we know,</v>

335
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:33.260
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that 60 million years ago,</v>

336
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.260
<v Speaker 2>your primary Predator when you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering around in trees,</v>

337
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.930
<v Speaker 2>and we're only about this big with </v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes,</v>

338
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 2>and so snake is a Predator and an enemy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

339
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:43.814
<v Speaker 2>you guys can easily learn how to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of snakes and maybe you're </v>

340
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:47.870
<v Speaker 2>innately afraid of them to begin with.</v>

341
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:48.703
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The science on that is not exactly </v>

342
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:51.714
<v Speaker 2>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's certainly indicates that </v>

343
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:53.634
<v Speaker 2>you can easily learn snake fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a probably indicates that really </v>

344
00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 2>it's innate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's innate in chimpanzees.</v>

345
00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.760
<v Speaker 2>So why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It knocks,</v>

346
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that long.</v>

347
00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:02.214
<v Speaker 2>Since we split off the evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway from the common chimp human </v>

348
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 2>ancestor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so enemies,</v>

349
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:08.730
<v Speaker 2>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

350
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.623
<v Speaker 2>How about crocodiles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most things pulled a lot of your </v>

351
00:18:11.881 --> 00:18:13.980
<v Speaker 2>ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well not your ancestors do.</v>

352
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 2>They got pulled under water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we were wandering around on the</v>

353
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.100
<v Speaker 2>African Veldt and we went down to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>river to have some water,</v>

354
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 2>you can be sure that a fair number of us</v>
<v Speaker 2>got pulled underneath by crocodiles.</v>

355
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 2>And so crocodiles and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are creepy things.</v>

356
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:27.871
<v Speaker 2>Crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

357
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:28.704
<v Speaker 2>it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they figure it nightmares and they </v>

358
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:30.774
<v Speaker 2>figure in horror movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can imagine yourself in Florida </v>

359
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.120
<v Speaker 2>out there with alligators.</v>

360
00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.370
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 2>it'd be just as well if they didn't come</v>
<v Speaker 2>too close to your boat with their little</v>

362
00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:40.790
<v Speaker 2>beady eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're great big teeth that,</v>

363
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're unpleasant things.</v>

364
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:46.380
<v Speaker 2>And then there's lions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyenas.</v>

365
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.281
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are,</v>

366
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:48.114
<v Speaker 2>what are those things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might think a lion in a hygiene or </v>

367
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 2>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not,</v>

368
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I would say they're large tooth </v>
<v Speaker 2>mammalian carnivores.</v>

369
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like a medic category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they sort of fit in that Predator</v>

370
00:18:58.711 --> 00:18:59.544
<v Speaker 2>enemy category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your nervous system is prepared to </v>

371
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:02.544
<v Speaker 2>respond to predatory eyes and teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no wonder because predatory eyes </v>

372
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:09.180
<v Speaker 2>track you down at teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat you at a bite,</v>

373
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:10.014
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a good thing that you're </v>

374
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 2>aware of those and that you can detect </v>
<v Speaker 2>them rapidly.</v>

375
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:16.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

376
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

377
00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.940
<v Speaker 2>What else is a human enemy?</v>

378
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 2>How about another human?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would that be?</v>

379
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.580
<v Speaker 2>You think more people have died from </v>
<v Speaker 2>other humans are from predators.</v>

380
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.131
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

381
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:34.680
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that since we'd actually been </v>
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>

382
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:35.514
<v Speaker 2>if that's maybe 150,000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's about when it appears </v>

383
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 2>that we were more or less genetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>identical to what we are now.</v>

384
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.370
<v Speaker 2>My guess is that humans have got it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over predators.</v>

385
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of us,</v>

386
00:19:45.171 --> 00:19:49.440
<v Speaker 2>God eat and let's not be too shy about </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing that,</v>

387
00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:51.360
<v Speaker 2>but now at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

388
00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 2>it's other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

389
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:55.380
<v Speaker 2>well what about yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you as your own enemy?</v>

390
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Then you can make it psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's not other people may,</v>

391
00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's the evil in their hearts for </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's an evil in your hearts.</v>

392
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.303
<v Speaker 2>So you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is the way of thinking about is </v>

393
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.660
<v Speaker 2>that we have a circuit to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>threats,</v>

394
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 2>but the threats exist all the way from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the primordial biological,</v>

395
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:17.940
<v Speaker 2>like actual predators like snakes all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way up to the incredibly abstract.</v>

396
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.773
<v Speaker 2>Like my great enemy is the evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentions that other people harbored </v>

397
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.000
<v Speaker 2>towards me or that maybe I have in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>own heart.</v>

398
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.253
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's that entire complex of </v>

399
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 2>predatory slash threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slash.</v>

400
00:20:30.571 --> 00:20:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Evil because it's become psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that point.</v>

401
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.730
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that can be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>character in a movie.</v>

402
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 2>And it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

403
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the antagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the adversary that's the,</v>

404
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.023
<v Speaker 2>that's the archetypal element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing that opposes you would </v>

405
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:46.680
<v Speaker 2>every way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can locate that and all sorts of</v>

406
00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:47.620
<v Speaker 2>different places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

407
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.573
<v Speaker 2>You could have a story about how someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>is grappling with their own evil </v>

408
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:52.654
<v Speaker 2>impulses up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the name of that serial killer </v>

409
00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:55.940
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

410
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.093
<v Speaker 2>Dexter Dexter's got that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are pretty fascinated by that </v>

411
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:01.414
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

412
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:02.403
<v Speaker 2>A serial killer who can do good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of like a human being in some </v>

413
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:06.394
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

414
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.413
<v Speaker 2>So Dexter's got this psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>battle between good and evil in his </v>

415
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:12.070
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe the,</v>

416
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 2>maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enemy is externalized.</v>

417
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.280
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's Batman and the joker and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the joker is a pretty,</v>

418
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.210
<v Speaker 2>the joker is really a figure of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of chaotic evil fundamentally,</v>

419
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Best Batman movie,</v>

420
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.430
<v Speaker 2>which was the one with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

421
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 2>well with the joker and it wasn't Jack </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicholson who played the,</v>

422
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

423
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Heath Ledger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

424
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 2>that was rough on old heath and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder,</v>

425
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:36.034
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he embodied this architectural </v>

426
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 2>character and that joker was so much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>an adversary that he didn't even want to</v>

427
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:43.090
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

428
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:45.310
<v Speaker 2>You can understand the adversaries that </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to win.</v>

429
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.520
<v Speaker 2>It's adversaries that want to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone lose,</v>

430
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:51.520
<v Speaker 2>that are really hard to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of what made that movie,</v>

431
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively striking and memorable.</v>

432
00:21:53.831 --> 00:21:55.810
<v Speaker 2>And he really embodied that character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

433
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.123
<v Speaker 2>And so one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's two sets of characters that make </v>

434
00:21:59.891 --> 00:22:01.060
<v Speaker 2>up stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>

435
00:22:01.061 --> 00:22:03.250
<v Speaker 2>adversary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

436
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can,</v>

437
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 2>you can understand that at multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels simultaneously.</v>

438
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's another set of characters.</v>

439
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:11.703
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's why I think these characters are </v>

440
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:15.754
<v Speaker 2>fundamental elements of our cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure called a cognitive </v>

441
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 2>substructure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

442
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that really what we want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

443
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:23.410
<v Speaker 2>it's not what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we want to know how to act,</v>

444
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.410
<v Speaker 2>how to conduct ourselves in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're moving creatures,</v>

445
00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:27.244
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't just sit there on a rock and </v>

446
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Speaker 2>filter seawater through our guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to go out there and contend with</v>

447
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:34.690
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we need to know how to do that.</v>

448
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 2>We need to know how to do it and how not</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

449
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:40.620
<v Speaker 2>So we can look for good examples and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can look for bad examples.</v>

450
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.733
<v Speaker 2>We don't want just any old good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want a good example that's boiled </v>

451
00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:45.664
<v Speaker 2>right down to excellent example and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want a bad example that's boiled right </v>

452
00:22:48.521 --> 00:22:50.500
<v Speaker 2>down to excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad example.</v>

453
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.693
<v Speaker 2>And so a good example would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>character who is an amalgam of all the </v>

454
00:22:55.181 --> 00:22:56.014
<v Speaker 2>good things about good people and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil character would be an announcement </v>

455
00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.253
<v Speaker 2>of all the evil things about bad people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the more pure in some sense in </v>

456
00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:03.694
<v Speaker 2>essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of those characters are the more </v>

457
00:23:05.111 --> 00:23:07.300
<v Speaker 2>architectural of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so an architectural story,</v>

458
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 2>he's good versus evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might think you don't believe in</v>

459
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:10.894
<v Speaker 2>good versus evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't really matter what you </v>

460
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you go to movies,</v>

461
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 2>you watched that and you watch it as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe it.</v>

462
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.710
<v Speaker 2>And I would say this is an existential </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim by the way,</v>

463
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.230
<v Speaker 2>is that it doesn't matter what you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe,</v>

464
00:23:23.231 --> 00:23:27.100
<v Speaker 2>because what do you know about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What matters is how you act out what you</v>

465
00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:27.934
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you really want to find out what </v>

466
00:23:29.561 --> 00:23:32.380
<v Speaker 2>you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't ask yourself what you believe.</v>

467
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.620
<v Speaker 2>You Watch yourself act and you deduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that what you believe.</v>

468
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.440
<v Speaker 2>And so if you don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

469
00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:43.750
<v Speaker 2>in a good versus evil archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle,</v>

470
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 2>then what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watching wars,</v>

471
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

472
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously that's an archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

473
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:52.160
<v Speaker 2>just like every partner is an archetypal</v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

474
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 2>And both of those are archetypal stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>about good versus evil.</v>

475
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next set of categories.</v>

476
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.460
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that we've been living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>familial groups for who knows how long,</v>

477
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.070
<v Speaker 2>let's say 3 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for the sake of argument.</v>

478
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.030
<v Speaker 2>We were living in tribal groups way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way longer than that.</v>

479
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.923
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about a tribal group is </v>

480
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:17.024
<v Speaker 2>something that might extend back farther</v>
<v Speaker 2>than chimpanzees were living in </v>

481
00:24:20.571 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies for way longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>than tribal groups.</v>

482
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:24.314
<v Speaker 2>But the family group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to think we'd be living in </v>

483
00:24:27.351 --> 00:24:28.184
<v Speaker 2>family groups for about as long as we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been extraordinarily dependent as </v>

484
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:35.210
<v Speaker 2>infants and as long as we've had really </v>
<v Speaker 2>large brains.</v>

485
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.590
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

486
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.830
<v Speaker 2>you can't draw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

487
00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.240
<v Speaker 2>pipe line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because we'd been getting bigger and</v>

488
00:24:41.241 --> 00:24:44.330
<v Speaker 2>bigger brains for quite a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

489
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.490
<v Speaker 2>it's in the millions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

490
00:24:46.491 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing that you might think</v>

491
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 2>about is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cognitive apparatus,</v>

492
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:53.354
<v Speaker 2>your perceptual apparatus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're emotional apparatus has </v>

493
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:57.043
<v Speaker 2>originated within an environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously now we tend to think of the </v>

494
00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:03.140
<v Speaker 2>environment as the natural environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we tend to think of the natural</v>

495
00:25:03.141 --> 00:25:03.974
<v Speaker 2>environment is like a forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the natural environment for </v>

496
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.633
<v Speaker 2>propriety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nate's say is only for us to some </v>

497
00:25:09.561 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

498
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:11.414
<v Speaker 2>first of all we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't just dwell in forests because </v>

499
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:16.520
<v Speaker 2>we were also veldt dwelling creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also we,</v>

500
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.290
<v Speaker 2>we didn't really dwell among trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We dwelled among other primates like us.</v>

501
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.860
<v Speaker 2>And so our primary environment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually other people.</v>

502
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

503
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 2>what are the fundamental categories of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other people?</v>

504
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about mother?</v>

505
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one because the probability</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you had a mother,</v>

506
00:25:35.501 --> 00:25:38.240
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's up there at about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent you know?</v>

507
00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:40.370
<v Speaker 2>And if there wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're,</v>

508
00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:43.190
<v Speaker 2>if you lost your biological mother at </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth,</v>

509
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.850
<v Speaker 2>if someone didn't fulfill the archetipal</v>
<v Speaker 2>role of mother,</v>

510
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.000
<v Speaker 2>then you don't live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

511
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:51.890
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't just mean providing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>with food and water and shelter.</v>

512
00:25:51.891 --> 00:25:52.724
<v Speaker 2>Because if you provide a child under f </v>
<v Speaker 2>one with food and water and shelter and </v>

513
00:25:56.631 --> 00:25:58.040
<v Speaker 2>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they die.</v>

514
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.920
<v Speaker 2>You have to pick them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to touch them,</v>

515
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.580
<v Speaker 2>you have to rock the back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to communicate with them.</v>

516
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.400
<v Speaker 2>If you don't give them physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

517
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.860
<v Speaker 2>their nervous systems shut down and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

518
00:26:09.861 --> 00:26:14.861
<v Speaker 2>And so that's part of the reason why in </v>
<v Speaker 2>well in eastern European orphanages,</v>

519
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.350
<v Speaker 2>orphanages before the wall fell down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the death rate,</v>

520
00:26:18.351 --> 00:26:21.530
<v Speaker 2>especially in places like Romania in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>orphanages,</v>

521
00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:24.350
<v Speaker 2>it's an awful story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was unbelievably high.</v>

522
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.183
<v Speaker 2>And if the kids didn't die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just so crippled </v>

523
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:28.310
<v Speaker 2>psychologically that they never </v>
<v Speaker 2>recovered.</v>

524
00:26:28.311 --> 00:26:31.040
<v Speaker 2>And that was because people didn't touch</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and didn't interact with them.</v>

525
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.293
<v Speaker 2>And so you need a creature playing out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the architectural role of mother to </v>

526
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:40.730
<v Speaker 2>entice you into life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you just perish.</v>

527
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 2>So mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a category man.</v>

528
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well for others,</v>

529
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.050
<v Speaker 2>the category two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the same thing,</v>

530
00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 2>applies there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if you don't have a farther,</v>

531
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a male power structure around </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

532
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.370
<v Speaker 2>a dominance heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they roughly speaking,</v>

533
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.473
<v Speaker 2>that acts in the paternal role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no getting away from that </v>

534
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:02.430
<v Speaker 2>unless you don't live in a society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you don't live in a society,</v>

535
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:04.740
<v Speaker 2>then you just died because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>live by yourself.</v>

536
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 2>So father and mother are primary </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>

537
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:12.420
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the primary category of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual because wherever you are,</v>

538
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:13.350
<v Speaker 2>there you are.</v>

539
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's been the case for every human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being that's ever existed.</v>

540
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 2>So the fundamental categories are </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

541
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.890
<v Speaker 2>mother and father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

542
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:25.140
<v Speaker 2>and there's another fundamental category</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we alluded to,</v>

543
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:29.040
<v Speaker 2>which is horrible thing that lives at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of a pit that will devour you</v>

544
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.100
<v Speaker 2>and that has a psychological reality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

545
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.960
<v Speaker 2>objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

546
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:34.794
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's equivalent to the story of Jonah </v>

547
00:27:36.241 --> 00:27:38.460
<v Speaker 2>being gobbled up by the whale that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

548
00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:39.294
<v Speaker 2>That sort of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very Comic Pinocchio is a story like </v>

549
00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:42.534
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

550
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio has an existential problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know how to be a real boy.</v>

551
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.890
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out that in order to become</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real boy,</v>

552
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.980
<v Speaker 2>we might regard that as a fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed individual.</v>

553
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.230
<v Speaker 2>He has to go down to the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean,</v>

554
00:27:55.290 --> 00:28:00.290
<v Speaker 2>into a whale and rescue his father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you,</v>

555
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:01.853
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take a lot of imagination to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the kinship between that story and </v>

556
00:28:05.881 --> 00:28:06.840
<v Speaker 2>the story of Jonah.</v>

557
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.033
<v Speaker 2>It's the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonah had to reestablish his </v>

558
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:11.004
<v Speaker 2>relationship with God the father in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to successfully make a passage </v>

559
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:16.074
<v Speaker 2>from aimless and disobedient character </v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone who was alive on shore and </v>

560
00:28:21.481 --> 00:28:24.510
<v Speaker 2>pursuing a particular tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same motif.</v>

561
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:25.231
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

562
00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:26.064
<v Speaker 2>very common motif.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that actual </v>

563
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.760
<v Speaker 2>people transform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

564
00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:32.643
<v Speaker 2>when they hit an obstacle of some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just blows them into pieces and </v>

565
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.710
<v Speaker 2>they go down into the depths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the abyss and they are,</v>

566
00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 2>they lived down there for a while and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not pleasant.</v>

567
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:44.963
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they learn something while </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're down there if they're lucky and </v>

568
00:28:46.921 --> 00:28:47.754
<v Speaker 2>they get back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the story of human </v>

569
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:52.500
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never learn something without having</v>

570
00:28:52.501 --> 00:28:53.334
<v Speaker 2>something small die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you learn something and </v>

571
00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:56.634
<v Speaker 2>something big dies and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put yourself back together and you </v>

572
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:03.060
<v Speaker 2>pick up the pieces and you emerge </v>
<v Speaker 2>unscathed,</v>

573
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:03.923
<v Speaker 2>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps transformed and you carry </v>

574
00:29:05.251 --> 00:29:05.490
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

575
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.323
<v Speaker 2>And so the human developmental story </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't an upward march in a linear </v>

576
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:12.390
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

577
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.900
<v Speaker 2>upon even slope it's perhaps upwards and</v>
<v Speaker 2>onwards.</v>

578
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:18.990
<v Speaker 2>But it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's punctuated by catastrophes.</v>

579
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Speaker 2>And of course you guys know that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

580
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times,</v>

581
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:24.263
<v Speaker 2>how many people in this room have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously unhappy at one point in their </v>

582
00:29:27.691 --> 00:29:30.990
<v Speaker 2>life for more than two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

583
00:29:30.991 --> 00:29:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Is there anyone who hasn't had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience breathing?</v>

584
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you not had that experience?</v>

585
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.761
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

586
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:40.080
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you raised your hand.</v>

587
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Has Anybody not had that experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

588
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe not you.</v>

589
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Well that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations.</v>

590
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:50.770
<v Speaker 2>That's really amazing.</v>

591
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

592
00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

593
00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:00.733
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

594
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.080
<v Speaker 2>so the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

595
00:30:03.081 --> 00:30:04.790
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's one way of looking at it.</v>

596
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:09.170
<v Speaker 2>That's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reality is that you're,</v>

597
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.190
<v Speaker 2>you're environment is punctuated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>descents.</v>

598
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Your pathways punctuated by descents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're asked sending,</v>

599
00:30:17.091 --> 00:30:17.924
<v Speaker 2>that's one place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're descending and at the </v>

600
00:30:20.811 --> 00:30:22.130
<v Speaker 2>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another place.</v>

601
00:30:22.131 --> 00:30:22.964
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this will help you with your </v>

602
00:30:24.171 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the,</v>

603
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.320
<v Speaker 2>the times when you descend is equivalent</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a voyage.</v>

604
00:30:30.321 --> 00:30:31.154
<v Speaker 2>To the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a voyage to the underworld </v>

605
00:30:33.021 --> 00:30:33.854
<v Speaker 2>means in mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bottom has fallen out and down you </v>

606
00:30:36.681 --> 00:30:38.390
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know this sort of thing,</v>

607
00:30:38.391 --> 00:30:41.090
<v Speaker 2>because look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I say we're all skating on thin ice,</v>

608
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.490
<v Speaker 2>like is there anybody here who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what that means?</v>

609
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does it mean?</v>

610
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:51.170
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice could the daily,</v>

611
00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ice can fall out in anytime and then</v>

612
00:30:54.951 --> 00:30:55.784
<v Speaker 2>what happens?</v>

613
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Down you go.</v>

614
00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's cold down there.</v>

615
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you don't get back up.</v>

616
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:03.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the sort of story that sort of </v>

617
00:31:04.521 --> 00:31:07.340
<v Speaker 2>sends a chill down your spine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it should,</v>

618
00:31:07.341 --> 00:31:08.174
<v Speaker 2>because that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that I already </v>

619
00:31:11.211 --> 00:31:14.900
<v Speaker 2>like about advanced personality theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it takes that into account.</v>

620
00:31:14.901 --> 00:31:15.291
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

621
00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:16.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's life.</v>

622
00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that we've established that,</v>

623
00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:20.383
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then it becomes something like </v>

624
00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:23.774
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so much how do you stop </v>

625
00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.020
<v Speaker 2>yourself from descending and ascending?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause good luck with that.</v>

626
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:33.290
<v Speaker 2>But since you're going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

627
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.333
<v Speaker 2>how do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the reason that I called </v>

628
00:31:36.681 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 2>this course personality and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformations is because one,</v>

629
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.160
<v Speaker 2>one thing that you can learn about </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself as who you are,</v>

630
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:44.270
<v Speaker 2>and that's really useful.</v>

631
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:48.170
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing that you can learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>about yourself is how it is that you can</v>

632
00:31:48.171 --> 00:31:49.004
<v Speaker 2>conduct yourself across time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means you're going to have to </v>

633
00:31:52.431 --> 00:31:55.160
<v Speaker 2>conduct yourself so that you can weather</v>
<v Speaker 2>storms.</v>

634
00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.340
<v Speaker 2>And some of those might be you make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake in the ice breaks,</v>

635
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.160
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of it is,</v>

636
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:00.994
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice breaks and it's no mistake at </v>

637
00:32:03.111 --> 00:32:04.970
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just how it is,</v>

638
00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.223
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're one of your parents </v>

639
00:32:07.101 --> 00:32:09.140
<v Speaker 2>develops Alzheimer's disease for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

640
00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.093
<v Speaker 2>well you can say that's your mistake </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not smart enough to do </v>

641
00:32:12.051 --> 00:32:13.370
<v Speaker 2>anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

642
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:18.140
<v Speaker 2>be a better clue in because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>the disease is going to continue.</v>

643
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.093
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really thinking about it as a personal </v>

644
00:32:21.111 --> 00:32:21.944
<v Speaker 2>fault seems inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a catastrophe that's </v>

645
00:32:24.711 --> 00:32:27.860
<v Speaker 2>associated with being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what life is,</v>

646
00:32:27.861 --> 00:32:28.100
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

647
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

648
00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:33.860
<v Speaker 2>in all of the major trends of religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking all around the world,</v>

649
00:32:33.861 --> 00:32:34.694
<v Speaker 2>and I talk about religious thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>because those are the deepest kinds of </v>

650
00:32:37.101 --> 00:32:38.870
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really what makes them,</v>

651
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.570
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always the same message.</v>

652
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.523
<v Speaker 2>Life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is because we </v>

653
00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:46.520
<v Speaker 2>skate on thin ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

654
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:47.241
<v Speaker 2>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

655
00:32:47.241 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 2>we should pick it up the damn ice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fair enough,</v>

656
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

657
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.163
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you should also prepare yourself to </v>

658
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:55.580
<v Speaker 2>swim so that when you fall in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't die.</v>

659
00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.860
<v Speaker 2>So now the job story has a hint or two </v>
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>

660
00:33:00.861 --> 00:33:01.694
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing that happens is job </v>

661
00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:05.870
<v Speaker 2>is in some sense called the action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

662
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.033
<v Speaker 2>because that's an old story because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a primarily Judeo Christian and </v>

663
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:12.680
<v Speaker 2>religious story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The call cause action takes the force of</v>

664
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:14.720
<v Speaker 2>a divine command.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

665
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Now you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

666
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.693
<v Speaker 2>there's such a thing exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a silly question in some ways </v>

667
00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:25.631
<v Speaker 2>because whether or not something exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>depends on what you mean by exist,</v>

668
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.103
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that can vary with your </v>

669
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.520
<v Speaker 2>philosophical presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also,</v>

670
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:32.683
<v Speaker 2>it also varies on why you're asking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question and where you're looking for </v>

671
00:33:36.021 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 2>the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

672
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:39.740
<v Speaker 2>here's an example.</v>

673
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that there are things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should do?</v>

674
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

675
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.700
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anyone here who doesn't believe</v>

676
00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:51.570
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or more importantly,</v>

677
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.990
<v Speaker 2>is there anyone here who doesn't act </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they believe it?</v>

678
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.680
<v Speaker 2>So you wake up in the morning and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

679
00:33:55.681 --> 00:33:58.320
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of things I should do or</v>

680
00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.810
<v Speaker 2>there's some things I should do next </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

681
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Aren't there some things I should do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my life?</v>

682
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a common thought.</v>

683
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Does anyone not think that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

684
00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:09.430
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not thinking that way,</v>

685
00:34:09.431 --> 00:34:11.410
<v Speaker 2>you end up pretty depressed because then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

686
00:34:11.411 --> 00:34:12.244
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing I should do with my </v>

687
00:34:12.671 --> 00:34:13.504
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not such a happy thought </v>

688
00:34:14.921 --> 00:34:15.754
<v Speaker 2>because life is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if there's nothing to do with </v>

689
00:34:17.201 --> 00:34:18.034
<v Speaker 2>this wall all year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're stuck with is a bunch of </v>

690
00:34:20.111 --> 00:34:22.690
<v Speaker 2>suffering and that doesn't seem like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good idea.</v>

691
00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you might say,</v>

692
00:34:24.221 --> 00:34:26.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly does should mean?</v>

693
00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:29.763
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that you have a moral </v>

694
00:34:30.341 --> 00:34:32.260
<v Speaker 2>obligation of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

695
00:34:32.261 --> 00:34:33.094
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decided that yourself and answer </v>

696
00:34:36.071 --> 00:34:37.240
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like no,</v>

697
00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:39.220
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't decided that you yourself,</v>

698
00:34:39.221 --> 00:34:40.054
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be at a complete psychopath if </v>

699
00:34:41.831 --> 00:34:44.080
<v Speaker 2>you'd decided that by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

700
00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're even the Vegas civilized,</v>

701
00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:52.140
<v Speaker 2>then you decide what it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do or what you should do manifest</v>

702
00:34:52.221 --> 00:34:53.054
<v Speaker 2>itself within you as a context of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue that you're continually having </v>

703
00:34:56.531 --> 00:34:59.200
<v Speaker 2>with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also with everyone around you.</v>

704
00:34:59.201 --> 00:35:01.330
<v Speaker 2>And not only only with everyone around </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

705
00:35:01.331 --> 00:35:04.130
<v Speaker 2>but with the entire kit history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mankind.</v>

706
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Because we're all historical creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

707
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.560
<v Speaker 2>what you think you should do is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>shaped by what your parents think.</v>

708
00:35:11.561 --> 00:35:13.840
<v Speaker 2>And there that was shaped by what their </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents thought,</v>

709
00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.030
<v Speaker 2>that was shaped by what their parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

710
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.863
<v Speaker 2>And so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back into the depths of history as far </v>

711
00:35:20.261 --> 00:35:23.860
<v Speaker 2>back as you can possibly imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both historically and biologically.</v>

712
00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:28.390
<v Speaker 2>So in some sense there is a call to </v>
<v Speaker 2>action within people now,</v>

713
00:35:28.391 --> 00:35:30.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any sort of quest story,</v>

714
00:35:30.431 --> 00:35:32.050
<v Speaker 2>like the Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

715
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.173
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the Lord of the rings for that </v>

716
00:35:34.421 --> 00:35:35.380
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

717
00:35:35.381 --> 00:35:38.280
<v Speaker 2>the story always starts with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a call to action,</v>

718
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some reason or another,</v>

719
00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:42.630
<v Speaker 2>the little hobbit character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way is you,</v>

720
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.483
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hobbits live in this little </v>

721
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:44.874
<v Speaker 2>protected place and they're not very big</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not very smart and they </v>

722
00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:49.560
<v Speaker 2>don't know about the wide world beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

723
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 2>where the great forces of good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>are at combat.</v>

724
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:56.490
<v Speaker 2>And one hobbit who's a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventurous than the rest gets called to</v>

725
00:35:56.491 --> 00:35:58.770
<v Speaker 2>act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets called upon to act.</v>

726
00:35:58.771 --> 00:36:00.270
<v Speaker 2>And in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the heartbeat stories,</v>

727
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:02.010
<v Speaker 2>it's usually the wizard who manages it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

728
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:02.843
<v Speaker 2>So it's a magical figure of some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's extraordinarily wise and </v>

729
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.653
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who might as well be gone for all </v>

730
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:10.440
<v Speaker 2>intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who says,</v>

731
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:11.274
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's time for you to go and become a </v>

732
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:13.530
<v Speaker 2>thief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

733
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.000
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens in the Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

734
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.230
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird thing because obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Frodo,</v>

735
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:20.483
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Photos,</v>

736
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.650
<v Speaker 2>the hobbit in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the hobbit.</v>

737
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:24.420
<v Speaker 2>And Bilbo is the hobbit and the Lord of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rings,</v>

738
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.373
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way around Bilbo is the hobbit in </v>

739
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 2>the hobbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine Bill.</v>

740
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:30.803
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so bill will gets called to action and </v>

741
00:36:33.301 --> 00:36:34.134
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna go find a dragon while the </v>

742
00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:39.330
<v Speaker 2>dragon is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That swallow joke,</v>

743
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.570
<v Speaker 2>it's the same story and the Jew and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon has a treasure,</v>

744
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.910
<v Speaker 2>which is a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's up with dragons,</v>

745
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:46.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they hoard?</v>

746
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Saint George Story.</v>

747
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very old story or goal.</v>

748
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.500
<v Speaker 2>And that's weird behavior for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory lizard.</v>

749
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.020
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you accept that without any problems.</v>

750
00:36:58.021 --> 00:36:58.854
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dragon lives underground and a big </v>

751
00:36:59.971 --> 00:37:02.820
<v Speaker 2>mountain that was excavated by doors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sits on the treasure.</v>

752
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.953
<v Speaker 2>It's like we go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have any problem with that </v>

753
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

754
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:08.280
<v Speaker 2>why fate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really,</v>

755
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.190
<v Speaker 2>you really believe that and answer as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

756
00:37:11.191 --> 00:37:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Well enough to read the damn book and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the,</v>

757
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.393
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people went and watched the </v>

758
00:37:15.391 --> 00:37:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Lord of the Rings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people?</v>

759
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.343
<v Speaker 2>And think about it worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much money did a Harry Potter </v>

760
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:25.110
<v Speaker 2>generate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

761
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:25.944
<v Speaker 2>I bet you a Harry Potter generated more </v>
<v Speaker 2>money then the remaining steel mills in </v>

762
00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:30.954
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you calculated across the amount of </v>

763
00:37:34.261 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 2>time since those stories emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

764
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.460
<v Speaker 2>So of course there's a lizard in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory lizard and Harry Potter too.</v>

765
00:37:41.461 --> 00:37:42.294
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing that skitters around </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath hogwarts and turns you to </v>

766
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:46.260
<v Speaker 2>stone with the glance of an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

767
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.530
<v Speaker 2>and does that Lizard Hoard Virgins?</v>

768
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

769
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Well what's the name of the woman that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the girl that he,</v>

770
00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:57.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidnaps Jenny.</v>

771
00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:58.663
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

772
00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.480
<v Speaker 2>What's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ginny from Virginia.</v>

773
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

774
00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.713
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's Harry's first love interest and </v>

775
00:38:09.111 --> 00:38:09.944
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he rescues her from the damn snake and </v>

776
00:38:11.811 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Speaker 2>he gets parallels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't paralyzed while he's doing it.</v>

777
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:15.620
<v Speaker 2>What rescues Harry.</v>

778
00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

779
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

780
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.770
<v Speaker 2>A Phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

781
00:38:21.771 --> 00:38:24.590
<v Speaker 2>So the bass of this cause bites Harry </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he's going to die.</v>

782
00:38:24.591 --> 00:38:26.570
<v Speaker 2>The Phoenix comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who owns the Phoenix?</v>

783
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Dumbledore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

784
00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does the Phoenix do?</v>

785
00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Cries and cries into Harry's wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

786
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 2>But what happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens to Harry?</v>

787
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:41.230
<v Speaker 2>He comes back to life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death and resurrection story.</v>

788
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:42.483
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that's willing to die and </v>
<v Speaker 2>resurrect is the thing that gets the </v>

789
00:38:45.821 --> 00:38:47.740
<v Speaker 2>virgin from the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

790
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.053
<v Speaker 2>does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you think it makes sense even </v>

791
00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:54.550
<v Speaker 2>though you don't really know why it </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense.</v>

792
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:55.384
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens to the Phoenix after it </v>

793
00:38:57.121 --> 00:38:57.954
<v Speaker 2>does that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burns itself up in a puff of flame and </v>

794
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:05.410
<v Speaker 2>is reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the story told twice.</v>

795
00:39:05.411 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 2>The thing that dies in his reporting is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that conquers the,</v>

796
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:14.030
<v Speaker 2>the serpentine and rescues the feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

797
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.520
<v Speaker 2>So it's not gold in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

798
00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:20.620
<v Speaker 2>It's the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always the same story.</v>

799
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.380
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you don't hear that story,</v>

800
00:39:23.381 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 2>like when your culture isn't providing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you with rich stories of that sort,</v>

801
00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 2>that are derived directly from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition.</v>

802
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.213
<v Speaker 2>Somebody like an unemployed welfare </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother in Britain has it pop up full </v>

803
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:35.344
<v Speaker 2>fledged in her brilliant imagination and</v>
<v Speaker 2>lays out seven books and makes herself </v>

804
00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 2>more money than the queen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

805
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:41.801
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

806
00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:43.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a cinderella story.</v>

807
00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a bloody amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all those books and all</v>

808
00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.490
<v Speaker 2>those kids learn to read because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>

809
00:39:48.491 --> 00:39:49.324
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all those movies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody goes and sees them and no one </v>

810
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:52.324
<v Speaker 2>notices that they don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell they're doing while they're doing </v>

811
00:39:54.341 --> 00:39:56.740
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it follows the same old story.</v>

812
00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.153
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got your individual that's </v>

813
00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:02.014
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero,</v>

814
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.000
<v Speaker 2>then you got the adversary to that.</v>

815
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.700
<v Speaker 2>That's your enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wherever that enemy might happen to me,</v>

816
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.310
<v Speaker 2>that's the forces that oppose oppose </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

817
00:40:09.311 --> 00:40:11.770
<v Speaker 2>but mostly psychological forces of one </v>
<v Speaker 2>form or another.</v>

818
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got the father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

819
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:14.973
<v Speaker 2>there's two kinds of fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of good fathers and bad </v>

820
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:21.640
<v Speaker 2>fathers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example.</v>

821
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lion king,</v>

822
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:29.080
<v Speaker 2>so the lion king as a father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

823
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:30.623
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Fossa and the Fossa has a brother </v>

824
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Speaker 2>who his brother scar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's up with scar?</v>

825
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:39.483
<v Speaker 2>Not a pleasant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly maybe because he's scarred </v>

826
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.240
<v Speaker 2>something's hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

827
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.343
<v Speaker 2>really he's kind of skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he came from the shallow end of </v>

828
00:40:47.291 --> 00:40:48.124
<v Speaker 2>the gene pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously something's happened to him </v>

829
00:40:49.871 --> 00:40:52.780
<v Speaker 2>because he has this scar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's arrogant and brilliant,</v>

830
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:57.340
<v Speaker 2>which is very common set of attributes </v>
<v Speaker 2>for negative father figures and he's out</v>

831
00:40:57.341 --> 00:40:59.350
<v Speaker 2>to do in the cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

832
00:40:59.351 --> 00:41:01.270
<v Speaker 2>So what does he represent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

833
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.673
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a way of thinking about it </v>

834
00:41:04.181 --> 00:41:05.050
<v Speaker 2>sociologically.</v>

835
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.330
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you hear very </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently,</v>

836
00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure many of you have heard this ad </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nauseum,</v>

837
00:41:09.461 --> 00:41:11.440
<v Speaker 2>is that there's such a thing as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy,</v>

838
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The patriarchy,</v>

839
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.551
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

840
00:41:13.551 --> 00:41:16.300
<v Speaker 2>the pet patriarchy is a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct.</v>

841
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:20.020
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that technically speaking,</v>

842
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.340
<v Speaker 2>you have a paternal figure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically represents,</v>

843
00:41:24.341 --> 00:41:25.174
<v Speaker 2>it could represent the father directly </v>
<v Speaker 2>or it can represent the structure of </v>

844
00:41:27.731 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 2>male power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just male power.</v>

845
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:31.930
<v Speaker 2>But what if for the time being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

846
00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.670
<v Speaker 2>we'll stick with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a positive aspect,</v>

847
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:35.683
<v Speaker 2>which is why you get to sit here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not being snowed on and freezing </v>

848
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:39.800
<v Speaker 2>to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the positive element.</v>

849
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:40.783
<v Speaker 2>And it has a negative element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the negative element is the </v>

850
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:46.340
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary tyranny that's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 2>any social organization.</v>

851
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:47.301
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

852
00:41:47.301 --> 00:41:48.134
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of the u of t like </v>

853
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.970
<v Speaker 2>your first year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you enjoy it?</v>

854
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.400
<v Speaker 2>How many people didn't enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

855
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:02.060
<v Speaker 2>How many people did enjoy it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

856
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:05.150
<v Speaker 2>So more by the looks of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of you and some of you are neutral,</v>

857
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:05.984
<v Speaker 2>you'd either enjoyed it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or didn't to join or you don't have the </v>

858
00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 2>mental energy to crank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

859
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most he didn't enjoy it.</v>

860
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.470
<v Speaker 2>What the hell are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

861
00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.790
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why bother?</v>

862
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:24.050
<v Speaker 2>So someone who didn't enjoy it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>answered me that maybe you really didn't</v>

863
00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here you are.</v>

864
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Why are you still here?</v>

865
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.830
<v Speaker 2>That's the sunk cost answered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you,</v>

866
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you waited for a bus for half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't showed up.</v>

867
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Did the right thing to do is wait for </v>
<v Speaker 2>another half an hour.</v>

868
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

869
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.353
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

870
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:42.203
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put it in the more medical over to </v>

871
00:42:44.221 --> 00:42:45.970
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I approached it from a different angle.</v>

872
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.680
<v Speaker 3>So basically I changed when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying.</v>

873
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd that work worked out?</v>

874
00:42:49.881 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it the second time?</v>

875
00:42:51.711 --> 00:42:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I did try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It worked out well.</v>

876
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.691
<v Speaker 2>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

877
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 2>So was that an unpleasant process?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you confused?</v>

878
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Did you come out the other end?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

879
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right on.</v>

880
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Good work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're more mature,</v>

881
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.560
<v Speaker 2>you know more than you did five years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

882
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.050
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it worth it?</v>

883
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.180
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

884
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

885
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:12.861
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

886
00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:13.461
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

887
00:43:13.461 --> 00:43:14.660
<v Speaker 2>you make a calculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

888
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:16.730
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with the University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto?</v>

889
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 60,000 students for a starter.</v>

890
00:43:19.971 --> 00:43:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Like what the Hell do you matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

891
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 2>really your numbered and it feels like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of the time.</v>

892
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.243
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a very impersonal </v>

893
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:31.460
<v Speaker 2>institution and you're sort of tossed </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

894
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:32.533
<v Speaker 2>So you're basically facing a giant of </v>
<v Speaker 2>some magnitude who's kind of blind and </v>

895
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:41.750
<v Speaker 2>who sort of archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is always what culture is,</v>

896
00:43:41.751 --> 00:43:41.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

897
00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Culture's always blind because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>product of yesterday and it's,</v>

898
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.290
<v Speaker 2>and it's archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not up to date.</v>

899
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.573
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you have that problem when you </v>

900
00:43:52.011 --> 00:43:52.844
<v Speaker 2>come to the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you stick with it though because </v>

901
00:43:54.471 --> 00:43:56.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got two faces.</v>

902
00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:01.270
<v Speaker 2>One face is sink or swim there guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other face is,</v>

903
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're careful than you and establish</v>

904
00:44:04.821 --> 00:44:06.740
<v Speaker 2>a relationship with this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution,</v>

905
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:08.503
<v Speaker 2>you can learn so much that you won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even be the same person when you come </v>

906
00:44:11.631 --> 00:44:12.464
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'll be able to think that'd be </v>

907
00:44:14.541 --> 00:44:15.470
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

908
00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.053
<v Speaker 2>if you learn to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't run into sharp things </v>

909
00:44:18.531 --> 00:44:19.364
<v Speaker 2>when you wander through life because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're smart enough to see where they </v>

910
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:22.190
<v Speaker 2>are and avoid them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

911
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:26.360
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you can think your way to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>target or maybe you can even think about</v>

912
00:44:26.361 --> 00:44:28.880
<v Speaker 2>a target that's worthwhile and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to attain it.</v>

913
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.713
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you learn to write and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can articulate your ideas and you </v>

914
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 2>can express them with some power and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can make,</v>

915
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be a positive force in the world</v>

916
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:38.460
<v Speaker 2>and you can be successful in all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ways.</v>

917
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:41.060
<v Speaker 2>And if you have to put up with being </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrannized by,</v>

918
00:44:41.061 --> 00:44:41.701
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

919
00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 2>half dad monster with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Alzheimer's disease,</v>

920
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.050
<v Speaker 2>that's blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's life.</v>

921
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:50.063
<v Speaker 2>And it could be a lot worse because at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least you're contending with something </v>

922
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:55.560
<v Speaker 2>that has a positive element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

923
00:44:55.561 --> 00:44:57.840
<v Speaker 2>in lots of societies if you're up </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the,</v>

924
00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.013
<v Speaker 2>the the blind giant of society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best that you can hope for is that </v>

925
00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 2>it isn't running around trying to stomp </v>
<v Speaker 2>on you all the time.</v>

926
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.910
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that's more the standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>human experience.</v>

927
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.250
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a patriarch and yes,</v>

928
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.590
<v Speaker 2>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's always been like that.</v>

929
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 2>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

930
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.133
<v Speaker 2>there's good guy embedded in that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing you want to have a </v>

931
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 2>relationship with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same old story.</v>

932
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:21.774
<v Speaker 2>It's always been like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always a wise king in a tyrant </v>

933
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.960
<v Speaker 2>and they're always fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes the wise king king wins,</v>

934
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.740
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the tyrant winds and then when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tire,</v>

935
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:35.750
<v Speaker 2>when it's up to the hero to defeat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyron and reestablish the rightful king.</v>

936
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:37.943
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually what you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do when you're in university because </v>

937
00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:41.664
<v Speaker 2>the rightful king in some sense is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>corpse that's embedded inside the </v>

938
00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:47.310
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your job is to reverify it,</v>

939
00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the living element of the </v>

940
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:52.110
<v Speaker 2>university and all the knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

941
00:45:52.111 --> 00:45:54.330
<v Speaker 2>It's just lying around and some of it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of date.</v>

942
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:55.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come in here and you,</v>

943
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:56.543
<v Speaker 2>you revive it so that society can </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue and so that you can benefit </v>

944
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 2>from the relationship.</v>

945
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

946
00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Farther the wise king and the tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then another,</v>

947
00:46:08.101 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 2>another level is the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Feminine is not women.</v>

948
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Women partake of the feminine and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine,</v>

949
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.090
<v Speaker 2>just like men partake of the feminine </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the masculine.</v>

950
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.840
<v Speaker 2>But the maternal element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feminine elements is nature.</v>

951
00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.293
<v Speaker 2>Positive nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing that the </v>

952
00:46:25.651 --> 00:46:26.850
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's love,</v>

953
00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:29.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's flowers and French landscapes and</v>

954
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasant days,</v>

955
00:46:31.261 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 2>picnic in the park and and beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunshine and fresh air and clean water.</v>

956
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.690
<v Speaker 2>But then there's another side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another side is,</v>

957
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.260
<v Speaker 2>do you know what the Guinea worm is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody know what a Guinea worm is?</v>

958
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you,</v>

959
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 2>although you're not going to be happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

960
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:51.630
<v Speaker 2>So a Guinea worm is this horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>parasite that burrows under the skin,</v>

961
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.700
<v Speaker 2>mostly of children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly in Africa,</v>

962
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.500
<v Speaker 2>and it's about two feet long.</v>

963
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.920
<v Speaker 2>So it makes these coils around their </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs and then it'll poke its little head</v>

964
00:46:58.921 --> 00:47:02.040
<v Speaker 2>out and then you can pull it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it tends to break.</v>

965
00:47:02.041 --> 00:47:03.750
<v Speaker 2>And if that happens then it gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>infected.</v>

966
00:47:03.751 --> 00:47:04.584
<v Speaker 2>It may be you die and so you can wrap it</v>
<v Speaker 2>around a pencil very slowly and pull it </v>

967
00:47:07.861 --> 00:47:09.660
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nature.</v>

968
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.393
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a doctor who's a Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor who wasn't reading very happy </v>

969
00:47:13.621 --> 00:47:14.454
<v Speaker 2>about those damn getting worms and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just about eradicated them and like </v>

970
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.230
<v Speaker 2>hooray for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

971
00:47:19.231 --> 00:47:20.850
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

972
00:47:20.851 --> 00:47:21.684
<v Speaker 2>especially when we're thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and mythological categories and we're </v>

973
00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:25.560
<v Speaker 2>talking about nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

974
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.533
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

975
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.740
<v Speaker 2>it's nature and all its beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 2>glory,</v>

976
00:47:28.741 --> 00:47:29.574
<v Speaker 2>but it's also all the things that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just as soon eat you in the most awful </v>

977
00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:34.780
<v Speaker 2>possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you need to know that too,</v>

978
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:35.614
<v Speaker 2>because if you think of nature as only </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial and it's positive </v>

979
00:47:38.681 --> 00:47:39.514
<v Speaker 2>archetypical element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's mother nature in all her </v>

980
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:42.724
<v Speaker 2>glory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you tend to denigrate the utility </v>

981
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 2>of the positive elements of culture.</v>

982
00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:47.653
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's culture that protects you from the </v>

983
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 2>horrible elements of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't even be able to think about</v>

984
00:47:52.781 --> 00:47:56.890
<v Speaker 2>nature is beautiful if you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>already so protected from it.</v>

985
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:58.083
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more protected from it than any </v>

986
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:04.180
<v Speaker 2>human beings ever have been anywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire history of life.</v>

987
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:08.200
<v Speaker 2>And so in this unbelievably protected </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

988
00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:09.034
<v Speaker 2>you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well we should go easy on nature </v>

989
00:48:10.301 --> 00:48:12.130
<v Speaker 2>because isn't it so beautiful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

990
00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:13.203
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

991
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.480
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not all beauty.</v>

992
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.630
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not because nature will </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually kill you.</v>

993
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's even if it doesn't go well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to kill you.</v>

994
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:25.930
<v Speaker 2>It will also make you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will also make everyone that you know</v>

995
00:48:25.931 --> 00:48:26.764
<v Speaker 2>sick and it will kill all of them too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not so such a bad thing to have </v>

996
00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:33.670
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of empathy for human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that we have to contend with that.</v>

997
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.710
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're destroying everything,</v>

998
00:48:35.711 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 2>which we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also returning the favor.</v>

999
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.230
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1000
00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:43.780
<v Speaker 2>so there's the sub strategy at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of things.</v>

1001
00:48:43.781 --> 00:48:46.540
<v Speaker 2>There's this terrible monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it hoards ghoul.</v>

1002
00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:48.430
<v Speaker 2>And so encountering it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating it,</v>

1003
00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:49.264
<v Speaker 2>challenging it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facing it can be unbelievably </v>

1004
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:53.463
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the symbol of the absolute </v>

1005
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:56.224
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you go when things fall </v>

1006
00:48:58.091 --> 00:48:59.950
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where you are.</v>

1007
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:00.963
<v Speaker 2>So where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're aware you don't know what things </v>

1008
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:04.930
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a place.</v>

1009
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:08.500
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are rules to act in that place.</v>

1010
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:12.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's so helpful because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1011
00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:16.570
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a place and you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do and that's that your die.</v>

1012
00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.990
<v Speaker 2>But if there's a pattern to what you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do in a circumstance like that,</v>

1013
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:23.470
<v Speaker 2>then in the land on your feet and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to contend,</v>

1014
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:24.453
<v Speaker 2>and maybe the trip down into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underworld is something you can </v>

1015
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 2>undertake on your own accord.</v>

1016
00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:28.893
<v Speaker 2>And you can come back with the treasurer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and steadying instead of ending up as </v>

1017
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.193
<v Speaker 2>dragon food or worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're conceptualizing </v>

1018
00:49:35.921 --> 00:49:37.840
<v Speaker 2>your relationship to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1019
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.090
<v Speaker 2>well let's say the society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1020
00:49:40.091 --> 00:49:40.661
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1021
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:43.210
<v Speaker 2>obviously you face a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you do.</v>

1022
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.313
<v Speaker 2>But that is all you face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you need to be grateful for what </v>

1023
00:49:46.151 --> 00:49:49.780
<v Speaker 2>you've been given by your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you actually have to understand what</v>

1024
00:49:49.781 --> 00:49:50.614
<v Speaker 2>that culture is because it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't rescue that part of </v>

1025
00:49:54.521 --> 00:49:55.354
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that part of the culture that </v>

1026
00:49:56.021 --> 00:49:56.854
<v Speaker 2>everything gets dead and stale and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical and everything goes </v>

1027
00:49:59.441 --> 00:50:02.170
<v Speaker 2>immediately to help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not a good thing.</v>

1028
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.050
<v Speaker 2>And then with regards to nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1029
00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:06.363
<v Speaker 2>you obviously have to appreciate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive element of nature and you have </v>

1030
00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:12.020
<v Speaker 2>to enter into a relationship with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't bloody well want to forget</v>

1031
00:50:12.021 --> 00:50:12.430
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1032
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Like things are out to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1033
00:50:15.941 --> 00:50:16.774
<v Speaker 2>you have to be intelligent and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ready and awake so that you can </v>

1034
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.553
<v Speaker 2>prevail against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to be grateful for what </v>

1035
00:50:22.841 --> 00:50:23.674
<v Speaker 2>you've been offered by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the tremendous efforts of all of </v>

1036
00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.790
<v Speaker 2>human culture across all of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's putting you in a position where you</v>

1037
00:50:30.791 --> 00:50:35.791
<v Speaker 2>are so unbelievably privileged and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many opportunities at your,</v>

1038
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:40.390
<v Speaker 2>at your disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1039
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:43.730
<v Speaker 2>so that's kind of the archetypal story </v>
<v Speaker 2>of human beings.</v>

1040
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.620
<v Speaker 2>We always face nature and it's always on</v>
<v Speaker 2>our pho aside.</v>

1041
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.463
<v Speaker 2>We always face our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always on our side and we always </v>

1042
00:50:51.471 --> 00:50:54.800
<v Speaker 2>have ourselves and those things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrayed against us internally,</v>

1043
00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:57.410
<v Speaker 2>externally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the,</v>

1044
00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.600
<v Speaker 2>you could say that's the existential </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1045
00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:00.434
<v Speaker 2>It's the world of drama and the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are really compelling to you as </v>

1046
00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:05.390
<v Speaker 2>means of communicating.</v>

1047
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Use those categories to provide you with</v>
<v Speaker 2>information because what,</v>

1048
00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.633
<v Speaker 2>what you're trying to figure out is if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the landscape that makes up your </v>

1049
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a phenomenological idea.</v>

1050
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.650
<v Speaker 2>How is it that you weave your way </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it?</v>

1051
00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.870
<v Speaker 2>While that's what we're going to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>

1052
00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we go through this class.</v>

1053
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the mythological background.</v>

1054
00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:26.683
<v Speaker 2>So there's the character or logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements that I just described and then </v>

1055
00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:32.900
<v Speaker 2>there's the punctuated movement forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1056
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:33.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that is that when </v>

1057
00:51:34.701 --> 00:51:35.534
<v Speaker 2>things fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you just fall apart </v>

1058
00:51:38.301 --> 00:51:41.360
<v Speaker 2>psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a psychological condition.</v>

1059
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's be trade you deeply,</v>

1060
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:48.680
<v Speaker 2>that might be because you're naive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unready and maybe that's a psychological</v>

1061
00:51:48.681 --> 00:51:50.510
<v Speaker 2>element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're just young and you know you</v>

1062
00:51:50.511 --> 00:51:51.344
<v Speaker 2>don't know better and you couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also the real fact of the </v>

1063
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:55.514
<v Speaker 2>problem that you have in fact been </v>
<v Speaker 2>betrayed and now you don't know what to </v>

1064
00:51:57.831 --> 00:52:00.560
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's reality in it as well as just</v>

1065
00:52:00.561 --> 00:52:01.550
<v Speaker 2>what psychological.</v>

1066
00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:03.143
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

1067
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:05.953
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways that you might construe </v>

1068
00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:13.310
<v Speaker 2>personality theories that have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a description of the way people are</v>

1069
00:52:13.311 --> 00:52:14.144
<v Speaker 2>and a description of how they might move</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards mental health is that there are </v>

1070
00:52:17.651 --> 00:52:18.484
<v Speaker 2>maps that tell you how to their maps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that landscape that tell you how to </v>

1071
00:52:22.761 --> 00:52:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Orient Yourself so that you can succeed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and even better.</v>

1072
00:52:26.571 --> 00:52:31.040
<v Speaker 2>And this is a Ph jetty and idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not only so that you can succeed,</v>

1073
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:35.160
<v Speaker 2>it's so that you can succeed in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your family succeed.</v>

1074
00:52:35.161 --> 00:52:35.994
<v Speaker 2>So that they can succeed in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>society succeeds so that everything </v>

1075
00:52:38.871 --> 00:52:42.530
<v Speaker 2>works better at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really success,</v>

1076
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.843
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's like you're winning a game </v>

1077
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:47.390
<v Speaker 2>that everyone wants to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1078
00:52:47.391 --> 00:52:48.224
<v Speaker 2>what a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to move forward and everyone </v>

1079
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:51.224
<v Speaker 2>else gets to enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While that's a good definition of </v>

1080
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:56.150
<v Speaker 2>success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an archetypal definition of success</v>

1081
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:58.490
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you succeed property,</v>

1082
00:52:58.491 --> 00:53:00.680
<v Speaker 2>then your success benefits everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1083
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 2>So hard to imagine that there could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything particularly wrong with that.</v>

1084
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.940
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1085
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:10.543
<v Speaker 2>that's the mythological element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I want to tell you a little bit </v>

1086
00:53:12.081 --> 00:53:13.340
<v Speaker 2>about the shamonic element.</v>

1087
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.023
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1088
00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.193
<v Speaker 2>the reason I want to talk to you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>shamanism is because of shamanism is a </v>

1089
00:53:20.841 --> 00:53:21.674
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very old phenomenon and the Shaman </v>

1090
00:53:23.041 --> 00:53:23.874
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like a phenomenon that involves </v>

1091
00:53:25.651 --> 00:53:29.280
<v Speaker 2>the dramatization of transformation </v>
<v Speaker 2>processes.</v>

1092
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:30.653
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one transformation process might be </v>

1093
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:35.603
<v Speaker 2>the initiation of young men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's more typical for young men to </v>

1094
00:53:39.451 --> 00:53:40.890
<v Speaker 2>be initiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then young women.</v>

1095
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:42.443
<v Speaker 2>And no one really knows why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except men seem to be able to go more </v>

1096
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:48.690
<v Speaker 2>spectacularly wrong than women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So well,</v>

1097
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.840
<v Speaker 2>so if you look at what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will talk about that later.</v>

1098
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:52.853
<v Speaker 2>But there's also competing theories that</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you don't have to initiate women </v>

1099
00:53:55.621 --> 00:53:56.454
<v Speaker 2>because nature does that all by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's not a </v>

1100
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:04.640
<v Speaker 2>particularly bad way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So women are going to be confronted with</v>

1101
00:54:06.061 --> 00:54:10.920
<v Speaker 2>the brute force of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but men can either do that or not do it.</v>

1102
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 2>And so there's in some sense an element </v>
<v Speaker 2>of choice.</v>

1103
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:16.680
<v Speaker 2>And so the initiation rituals take away </v>
<v Speaker 2>the element of choice.</v>

1104
00:54:16.681 --> 00:54:17.514
<v Speaker 2>And so on a typical initiation ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that young men usually </v>

1105
00:54:20.911 --> 00:54:24.810
<v Speaker 2>at the onset of puberty or taken away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from their familial dependence,</v>

1106
00:54:24.811 --> 00:54:28.050
<v Speaker 2>which really means their mothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they're put into some situation</v>

1107
00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:31.620
<v Speaker 2>and terrified three quarters to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now more or less,</v>

1108
00:54:31.621 --> 00:54:34.860
<v Speaker 2>they do that voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So perhaps here's an example,</v>

1109
00:54:34.861 --> 00:54:39.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're 13 so remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about your 13 think about that.</v>

1110
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:40.793
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're still afraid of the dark </v>

1111
00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:44.160
<v Speaker 2>when you're 13 even though they'll tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that you aren't.</v>

1112
00:54:44.161 --> 00:54:46.800
<v Speaker 2>But you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like if you were dropped naked in</v>

1113
00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:49.170
<v Speaker 2>the middle of a forest when you're 13 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's midnight,</v>

1114
00:54:49.171 --> 00:54:53.220
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be plenty frozen with </v>
<v Speaker 2>terror and a good thing too,</v>

1115
00:54:53.221 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 2>because you know it's dangerous out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1116
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>

1117
00:54:56.311 --> 00:54:57.750
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just a park,</v>

1118
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.950
<v Speaker 2>but you're still out there and it's dark</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're afraid.</v>

1119
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:01.561
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1120
00:55:01.561 --> 00:55:02.394
<v Speaker 2>what are you afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things you might come up </v>

1121
00:55:05.641 --> 00:55:08.010
<v Speaker 2>with as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid of what you're imagining.</v>

1122
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:10.320
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1123
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:11.183
<v Speaker 2>does that mean that you're afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your imagination or are you afraid of </v>

1124
00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:17.880
<v Speaker 2>the things your imagination represents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1125
00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 2>you kind of have to think if there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual objective danger there,</v>

1126
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:23.010
<v Speaker 2>then what you're afraid of is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

1127
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.353
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you guys ever see the Blair witch </v>

1128
00:55:26.431 --> 00:55:29.100
<v Speaker 2>project?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of you've seen that?</v>

1129
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.480
<v Speaker 2>How many of you haven't know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a pretty lousy example.</v>

1130
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a horror movie.</v>

1131
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Now there's kind of two kinds of horror </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

1132
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:41.820
<v Speaker 2>There's the splatter type horror movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think actually those expose you to</v>

1133
00:55:41.821 --> 00:55:46.530
<v Speaker 2>discuss and then there's the fear kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of horror movie.</v>

1134
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.720
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't need to have any Gore </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

1135
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.673
<v Speaker 2>It just makes you afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Blair witch project is a very </v>

1136
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:53.190
<v Speaker 2>good example of that because all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

1137
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.980
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens.</v>

1138
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.460
<v Speaker 2>But you think something terrible is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen every second.</v>

1139
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.593
<v Speaker 2>And the sense that something terrible is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen keeps climbing through </v>

1140
00:56:02.641 --> 00:56:03.474
<v Speaker 2>the whole movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what they do is put you in a </v>

1141
00:56:04.951 --> 00:56:08.550
<v Speaker 2>state of radical uncertainty and never </v>
<v Speaker 2>let you off.</v>

1142
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1143
00:56:09.901 --> 00:56:10.734
<v Speaker 2>so basically they're playing with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination and that can work very </v>

1144
00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:14.334
<v Speaker 2>effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's often a horror movies often </v>

1145
00:56:16.771 --> 00:56:17.604
<v Speaker 2>more effective if they don't show you </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's making those horrible noises off </v>

1146
00:56:20.751 --> 00:56:22.080
<v Speaker 2>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1147
00:56:22.081 --> 00:56:22.914
<v Speaker 2>because no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show you the probability that it can be </v>

1148
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:25.804
<v Speaker 2>as personally horrible as what are their</v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters you're dredging up out of your </v>

1149
00:56:29.051 --> 00:56:31.930
<v Speaker 2>imagination is very low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1150
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.010
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1151
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:35.080
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reasonable to be afraid of the dark</v>

1152
00:56:35.081 --> 00:56:37.180
<v Speaker 2>because throughout our biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

1153
00:56:37.181 --> 00:56:42.181
<v Speaker 2>lots of unfortunate people were devoured</v>
<v Speaker 2>by things in the dark or hurt very badly</v>

1154
00:56:42.371 --> 00:56:43.650
<v Speaker 2>by them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

1155
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.550
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're also daytime creatures,</v>

1156
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't like the dark very much.</v>

1157
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:49.773
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do to someone if you're </v>

1158
00:56:52.871 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 2>going to initiate them is maybe you take</v>
<v Speaker 2>them when they're 13 and you put them in</v>

1159
00:56:56.021 --> 00:57:00.160
<v Speaker 2>a really dark cave and caves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so dark man,</v>

1160
00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:02.980
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in a cave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't believe how dark it is.</v>

1161
00:57:02.981 --> 00:57:03.814
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1162
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.833
<v Speaker 2>you can't see anything in a cave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't know how big this space </v>

1163
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:08.943
<v Speaker 2>you're in is and you don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>small it is and you don't know whether </v>

1164
00:57:12.131 --> 00:57:15.380
<v Speaker 2>or not it's going to collapse or when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to stay on.</v>

1165
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 2>And you don't know how far you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>underground,</v>

1166
00:57:17.891 --> 00:57:20.320
<v Speaker 2>especially if the people who took you </v>
<v Speaker 2>there didn't,</v>

1167
00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.513
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked around in circles and didn't let </v>

1168
00:57:22.361 --> 00:57:23.194
<v Speaker 2>you know where you're going and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they leave and maybe they leave </v>

1169
00:57:26.141 --> 00:57:27.010
<v Speaker 2>for three days.</v>

1170
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And so you're sitting down there </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

1171
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:31.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you thinking exactly?</v>

1172
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:33.303
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking the most horrible </v>

1173
00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.390
<v Speaker 2>thoughts you could possibly imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1174
00:57:37.391 --> 00:57:40.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're never going to find me again.</v>

1175
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Some horrible snake thing that lives in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dark.</v>

1176
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 2>This is going to come and eat me slowly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because fast would be,</v>

1177
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:51.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>merciful and I'm,</v>

1178
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:54.520
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm also going to go completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of my mind so that even if something</v>

1179
00:57:54.521 --> 00:57:56.080
<v Speaker 2>doesn't eat me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come out of here.</v>

1180
00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:57.730
<v Speaker 2>It will be worse than being dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

1181
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.460
<v Speaker 2>And so partly what you're doing in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>

1182
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.830
<v Speaker 2>you're facing the demons of your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

1183
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:06.820
<v Speaker 2>And if you can stand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you grow up.</v>

1184
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's what an initiation ceremony </v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

1185
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what you'll find if you look at</v>

1186
00:58:13.031 --> 00:58:16.870
<v Speaker 2>clinical theories of psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same motif applies.</v>

1187
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:18.933
<v Speaker 2>If you want to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to find out what you're </v>

1188
00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:24.180
<v Speaker 2>avoiding and what you're afraid of and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe what you're disgusted by evil.</v>

1189
00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:25.683
<v Speaker 2>And you have to expose yourself to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily and you have to let that </v>

1190
00:58:30.041 --> 00:58:32.950
<v Speaker 2>change you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not a pleasant prospect.</v>

1191
00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not dancing through a field </v>
<v Speaker 2>of daisies,</v>

1192
00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With music play and it's not follow your</v>

1193
00:58:40.691 --> 00:58:42.280
<v Speaker 2>bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1194
00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:45.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not the natural unfolding of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive process.</v>

1195
00:58:45.491 --> 00:58:46.324
<v Speaker 2>It's not that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the voluntary confrontation with </v>

1196
00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:49.024
<v Speaker 2>the things that make up life's horrors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting about it is that </v>

1197
00:58:52.091 --> 00:58:52.924
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an idea there that lurks under </v>

1198
00:58:55.271 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 2>the surface architecturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is,</v>

1199
00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:00.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more to you than meets the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye,</v>

1200
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:02.890
<v Speaker 2>but it won't be released unless it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1201
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:06.730
<v Speaker 2>And so you're not going to even figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out what it is until you put yourself in</v>

1202
00:59:06.731 --> 00:59:08.860
<v Speaker 2>peril.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now part of that,</v>

1203
00:59:08.861 --> 00:59:11.110
<v Speaker 2>you might think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you're,</v>

1204
00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:13.240
<v Speaker 2>you're an introvert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're socially awkward,</v>

1205
00:59:13.241 --> 00:59:15.970
<v Speaker 2>you're hiding your audit so you feel a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of anxiety and depression.</v>

1206
00:59:15.971 --> 00:59:16.804
<v Speaker 2>You don't like going to parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's because the horrible pirate </v>

1207
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.833
<v Speaker 2>lives at parties and always glaring at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and judging you and telling you how </v>

1208
00:59:22.881 --> 00:59:23.714
<v Speaker 2>useless an insufficient you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you go there and you don't even </v>

1209
00:59:26.721 --> 00:59:29.810
<v Speaker 2>look at people because you know that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you did look at them,</v>

1210
00:59:29.811 --> 00:59:32.090
<v Speaker 2>you just see the face of the judgmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrant,</v>

1211
00:59:32.091 --> 00:59:32.924
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't if you actually looked at </v>

1212
00:59:34.641 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you won't because you avoid.</v>

1213
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:37.633
<v Speaker 2>And so you're going to go there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna put yourself in this </v>

1214
00:59:39.141 --> 00:59:39.974
<v Speaker 2>terrible situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're lucky and you're a bit of </v>

1215
00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:42.434
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to incorporate all </v>

1216
00:59:43.731 --> 00:59:44.564
<v Speaker 2>sorts of information from the external </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that will help you develop your </v>

1217
00:59:47.961 --> 00:59:50.270
<v Speaker 2>social skills and make you more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated.</v>

1218
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.493
<v Speaker 2>And even if that doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to learn that you can </v>

1219
00:59:52.761 --> 00:59:55.220
<v Speaker 2>tolerate your own fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

1220
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:56.054
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's better to not be afraid or to </v>

1221
00:59:59.151 --> 01:00:03.440
<v Speaker 2>know that you can handle being afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and obviously to not be afraid,</v>

1222
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:05.840
<v Speaker 2>but give that up cause that ain't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

1223
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:07.603
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next best thing and the realistic </v>

1224
01:00:09.651 --> 01:00:11.990
<v Speaker 2>thing is to know that you're the master </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your own fear.</v>

1225
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:13.933
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of what we're going to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about in relationship to classical </v>

1226
01:00:16.461 --> 01:00:20.450
<v Speaker 2>theories of personality is exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that the world isn't terrible,</v>

1227
01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.280
<v Speaker 2>he that the world is terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're a lot stronger than you think</v>

1228
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.540
<v Speaker 2>and the way you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1229
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:27.374
<v Speaker 2>And so part of that is the strength that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gathered is partly the information </v>

1230
01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 2>that you gathered when you go somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're not good at.</v>

1231
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:34.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you were establishing new skills like</v>

1232
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:35.714
<v Speaker 2>you have at university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's another part that's </v>

1233
01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:37.814
<v Speaker 2>interesting that's related to the little</v>
<v Speaker 2>video that I showed you at the </v>

1234
01:00:40.581 --> 01:00:41.180
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

1235
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.670
<v Speaker 2>DNA turns out to be very complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

1236
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:49.040
<v Speaker 2>And so if I put you in situation a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then DNA codes,</v>

1237
01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:49.874
<v Speaker 2>certain kinds of proteins that help make</v>
<v Speaker 2>up the way that your mind is in the way </v>

1238
01:00:52.581 --> 01:00:53.414
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I take you and I put you in </v>

1239
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.770
<v Speaker 2>another situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different genes turn on.</v>

1240
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:03.700
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a biological repository of potential use</v>

1241
01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:05.683
<v Speaker 2>lime and Patrick at the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution level of your molecular </v>

1242
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:10.604
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you push yourself and all </v>

1243
01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:16.100
<v Speaker 2>sorts of different directions and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>find different things to pursue and test</v>

1244
01:01:16.101 --> 01:01:16.934
<v Speaker 2>yourself against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to turn on parts of </v>

1245
01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:22.250
<v Speaker 2>yourself that aren't currently on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what you'd be like if you</v>

1246
01:01:22.251 --> 01:01:26.420
<v Speaker 2>turned yourself completely on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I could use a better metaphor.</v>

1247
01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:39.873
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1248
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.413
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a little bit more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Shavano routines because they're </v>

1249
01:01:50.341 --> 01:01:51.300
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1250
01:01:51.301 --> 01:01:55.710
<v Speaker 2>if there's a initiation archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are kind of just described to you,</v>

1251
01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:58.640
<v Speaker 2>which is you can do this for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell they're all your house,</v>

1252
01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:02.520
<v Speaker 2>then this is a good way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beats the alternative anyway.</v>

1253
01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:03.363
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like the definition of a good </v>

1254
01:02:05.011 --> 01:02:08.430
<v Speaker 2>way to live so mad and you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue something so you've got a goal.</v>

1255
01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.293
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to have a goal and you don't </v>

1256
01:02:10.501 --> 01:02:12.990
<v Speaker 2>want to hold on to that too tightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might be wrong.</v>

1257
01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:14.293
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've gotta be willing to let that go </v>

1258
01:02:15.211 --> 01:02:17.040
<v Speaker 2>and have a different goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need a goal.</v>

1259
01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:19.290
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're pursuing goal,</v>

1260
01:02:19.291 --> 01:02:21.810
<v Speaker 2>you're going to find out that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some obstacles in your path,</v>

1261
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.050
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe some of those obstacles are of</v>

1262
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 2>a frightening tight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the reason of a disgusting tight,</v>

1263
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:28.583
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to turn it into that kind </v>

1264
01:02:29.761 --> 01:02:30.570
<v Speaker 2>of person.</v>

1265
01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:31.403
<v Speaker 2>So those of you who are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialist utopia had left wingers might </v>

1266
01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:36.270
<v Speaker 2>think that way about business people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1267
01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:37.104
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend that you get over it </v>

1268
01:02:38.491 --> 01:02:41.210
<v Speaker 2>as rapidly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1269
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 2>you might think there's no way I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to act that way.</v>

1270
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:46.740
<v Speaker 2>So you sort of put it off limits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say it.</v>

1271
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you are afraid to do what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do next.</v>

1272
01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the rule.</v>

1273
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Don't avoid doing things because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>make you feel negative emotion.</v>

1274
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.850
<v Speaker 2>If you have to do those things in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pursue your balls,</v>

1275
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.190
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do exactly the opposite.</v>

1276
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.053
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're pursuing a goal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you find that you're afraid about </v>

1277
01:03:05.371 --> 01:03:08.400
<v Speaker 2>something and so you're avoiding it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you should think is,</v>

1278
01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Aha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1279
01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:12.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of something under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm avoiding it.</v>

1280
01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Dragon treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly there.</v>

1281
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:19.530
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's precisely right.</v>

1282
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:22.080
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're afraid of the thing,</v>

1283
01:03:22.081 --> 01:03:22.914
<v Speaker 2>then what that means is that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed enough to handle it and you </v>

1284
01:03:25.231 --> 01:03:26.064
<v Speaker 2>need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you should think about that as a </v>

1285
01:03:27.491 --> 01:03:29.340
<v Speaker 2>discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a positive discovery.</v>

1286
01:03:29.341 --> 01:03:33.660
<v Speaker 2>You found out where you have a weakness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're now able to address it.</v>

1287
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:34.561
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1288
01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:36.450
<v Speaker 2>if you're an introvert and you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Friday night,</v>

1289
01:03:36.451 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I could go to this party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1290
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I really don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you think,</v>

1291
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means I should go.</v>

1292
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly right because,</v>

1293
01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.053
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1294
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:53.160
<v Speaker 2>because you already know how to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you know how to do.</v>

1295
01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:55.043
<v Speaker 2>And it's the things that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do that bother you and oppress </v>

1296
01:03:57.421 --> 01:03:58.254
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course those things are going to </v>

1297
01:03:58.741 --> 01:04:01.140
<v Speaker 2>be difficult to learn about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need to learn about them because</v>

1298
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:03.540
<v Speaker 2>you need to get yourself all switched </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1299
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:04.403
<v Speaker 2>How's that switched on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then you'll be able to tolerate </v>

1300
01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:12.711
<v Speaker 2>the fact that life is fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering and so you don't do,</v>

1301
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.130
<v Speaker 2>world doesn't get safer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>US,</v>

1302
01:04:14.131 --> 01:04:15.120
<v Speaker 2>you've developed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1303
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.013
<v Speaker 2>quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just get more competent and that's </v>

1304
01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:18.984
<v Speaker 2>been her anyways because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceivable that you don't want safety </v>

1305
01:04:20.821 --> 01:04:23.670
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably want adventure.</v>

1306
01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 2>You probably want to be compelled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably want to be engaged.</v>

1307
01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want security,</v>

1308
01:04:29.191 --> 01:04:30.024
<v Speaker 2>you might as well be dead well because </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's happening then and that </v>

1309
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:37.010
<v Speaker 2>there's no danger to be alive is to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>contending with the,</v>

1310
01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:41.940
<v Speaker 2>with the world and you want to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basket that you can possibly be.</v>

1311
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:43.283
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly what we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn about as we go through the entire </v>

1312
01:04:45.871 --> 01:04:46.704
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But certainly the elements that have to </v>

1313
01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:48.684
<v Speaker 2>do with clinical psychology because all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them circulate around this </v>

1314
01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:52.854
<v Speaker 2>fundamental fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to because it's the </v>

1315
01:04:53.941 --> 01:04:54.774
<v Speaker 2>fundamental story of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we want to know what that </v>

1316
01:04:57.301 --> 01:05:01.230
<v Speaker 2>fundamental story is because you're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>human and you need to know the story,</v>

1317
01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:02.603
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can decide how you're going to act </v>

1318
01:05:03.871 --> 01:05:04.704
<v Speaker 2>it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least you need to know the damn </v>

1319
01:05:06.211 --> 01:05:07.890
<v Speaker 2>story first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1320
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:10.283
<v Speaker 2>we'll see you.</v>
