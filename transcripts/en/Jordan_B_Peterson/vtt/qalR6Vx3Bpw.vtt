1
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>So this is the last lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I thought I'd do is</v>

2
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I try to tell you what sense I've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the course of</v>

3
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>20 how long have I been thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

4
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:21.744
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years of thinking about the sorts of </v>

5
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>things that I've been teaching you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to</v>

6
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.603
<v Speaker 1>try to integrate the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about over the semester and tell </v>

7
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:34.194
<v Speaker 1>you what I think they add up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously it's very difficult to </v>

8
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:38.334
<v Speaker 1>make them add up to to one comprehensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because we talked a lot about a </v>

9
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>lot of different things and they weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily</v>

10
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>non contradictory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't bother me that much,</v>

11
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:52.974
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I like to think of theories as </v>

12
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:01.701
<v Speaker 1>tools rather than as final statements </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the nature of objective reality.</v>

13
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>And you can have tools of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>shapes and</v>

14
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.373
<v Speaker 1>just because they don't all fit together</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some kind of gigantic metta tool </v>

15
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that they're not useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece by piece.</v>

16
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I especially,</v>

17
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I think about the different personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories that we've discussed because as</v>

18
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:23.844
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of them has a valuable place in </v>

19
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand all the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to people.</v>

20
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Not only all the things that happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in their lives,</v>

21
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>but really also what life is and what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be.</v>

22
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.223
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to tell you how I've </v>

23
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>integrated this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.553
<v Speaker 1>I think the first thing that's worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about is what is it that we're </v>

25
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>thinking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that those are the,</v>

26
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of the two words that signify this </v>

27
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of greatest of philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteries,</v>

28
00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's the nature of being an,</v>

29
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.473
<v Speaker 1>and I liked the phenomenological </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach to that because for me being </v>

30
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.513
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the same sort of tack that </v>

31
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that being,</v>

32
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>is what you experience at certainly your</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

33
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.803
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what your primary </v>

34
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.553
<v Speaker 1>primarily unnecessarily concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that includes the subjective and </v>

35
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.124
<v Speaker 1>psychology has to take account of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of unique among the sciences </v>

36
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:31.884
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that psychology cannot ignore </v>

37
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>subjectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biology can ignore subjectivity and soak</v>

38
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>in physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well mostly,</v>

39
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.963
<v Speaker 1>but psychology stuck right in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the objective and the subjective and </v>

40
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>it has to take both into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's especially true when you also</v>

41
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:54.231
<v Speaker 1>consider that psychology is an applied </v>
<v Speaker 1>science or art depending on how you look</v>

42
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also has to deal with issues of,</v>

43
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.123
<v Speaker 1>because it has to deal with issues of </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimal being in suboptimal being or or </v>

44
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>suffering and health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

45
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be very comprehensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And roughly speaking,</v>

46
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:11.674
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you could think about being as</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is currently and becoming as how </v>

47
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.614
<v Speaker 1>that's going to transform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more than how it's going to </v>

48
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>transform to because it's also how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>should transform.</v>

49
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling with the fundamental questions</v>

50
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:28.324
<v Speaker 1>of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to wrestle with both of those </v>

51
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what it is that's</v>

52
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>here and now and where you are and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

53
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do about that.</v>

54
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>And hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

55
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>it seems like people are generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated to attempt to make it better.</v>

56
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes better.</v>

57
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:57.511
<v Speaker 1>And now not also means that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly into the domain of values.</v>

58
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.570
<v Speaker 1>And not only is there an impetus to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it better,</v>

59
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the fact that while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to make things better,</v>

60
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you're also fighting against entropy </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

61
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.183
<v Speaker 1>The tendency of complicated things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall apart or complex things to fall </v>

62
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it requires energy to make things</v>

63
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

64
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>It even requires energy just to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>things the way they are.</v>

65
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.763
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense life is an uphill </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle because you're pushing against </v>

66
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.333
<v Speaker 1>great forces that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that act in opposition to your </v>

67
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose in some sense,</v>

68
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>that's the fundamental basis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential thinking,</v>

69
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.090
<v Speaker 1>which is a form of thinking that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>also fond of because the existentialists</v>

70
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 1>make the claim that existence itself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem.</v>

71
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:51.124
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology is built right into the </v>

72
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.604
<v Speaker 1>nature of human existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because we're limited </v>

73
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>and we suffer because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the flip side of that as well,</v>

74
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.304
<v Speaker 1>we're limited and we're working against </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces that are in many ways greater </v>

75
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>than we are and that are pushing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite direction.</v>

76
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:10.174
<v Speaker 1>So life is being and becoming and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the problem of being and becoming </v>

77
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.153
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you're stuck with and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of useful to know what you're </v>

78
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.234
<v Speaker 1>stuck with I think because it stops you </v>
<v Speaker 1>from being isolated because everybody's </v>

79
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:24.370
<v Speaker 1>also stuck with that.</v>

80
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.653
<v Speaker 1>It also makes you understand that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a problem that doesn't necessarily </v>

81
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>mean there's something wrong with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that you're alive,</v>

82
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>then that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

83
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:36.340
<v Speaker 1>of course that can get so complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's unbearable.</v>

84
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 1>But the central like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>people think in some sense are people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are inclined to think that</v>

86
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>if life was operating optimally you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy or something like that.</v>

87
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:48.064
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's an unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope in some ways because it's life </v>

88
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:58.771
<v Speaker 1>itself is so complicated because of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>of its fundamental essence that the idea</v>

89
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>that you can exist in some optimized </v>
<v Speaker 1>state on a constant basis is,</v>

90
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

91
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>that's just not how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to,</v>

92
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>when you mature and when you become </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiser,</v>

93
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you have to take into account what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual limitations are and then you have</v>

94
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>to figure out a way that you can exist.</v>

95
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Not so much despite that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

96
00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:30.990
<v Speaker 1>taking that into account and it seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me that it's possible to do that.</v>

97
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.810
<v Speaker 1>And one idea is that you can hide from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

98
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea of positive illusions </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like that,</v>

99
00:06:36.781 --> 00:06:37.614
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to construct defenses against </v>

100
00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:40.764
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terror management theory posits that as </v>

101
00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:44.611
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

102
00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:46.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of ideas that life itself is so</v>

103
00:06:46.711 --> 00:06:48.930
<v Speaker 1>terrible that you have to build defenses</v>
<v Speaker 1>against it.</v>

104
00:06:48.931 --> 00:06:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And some of those defenses have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of positive illusions.</v>

105
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.310
<v Speaker 1>But I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people are tough.</v>

106
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.193
<v Speaker 1>They're a lot tougher than they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that people are capable </v>

107
00:07:00.961 --> 00:07:01.794
<v Speaker 1>of facing up to reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though reality as it's experienced </v>

108
00:07:06.751 --> 00:07:07.584
<v Speaker 1>is fundamentally tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tragic because people are </v>

109
00:07:10.261 --> 00:07:12.600
<v Speaker 1>limited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of the domain that you're</v>

110
00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:13.080
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

111
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.913
<v Speaker 1>And I think that like if psych for </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology to be something that's </v>

112
00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:20.640
<v Speaker 1>profound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't skirt those issues,</v>

113
00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:24.390
<v Speaker 1>it has to address them directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's difficult because they're not</v>

114
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.560
<v Speaker 1>merely objective problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also subjective problems.</v>

115
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.890
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't all that obvious how </v>
<v Speaker 1>science can deal with,</v>

116
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.443
<v Speaker 1>with subjective problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're not dealing with science in </v>

117
00:07:37.111 --> 00:07:37.944
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're dealing with human being in the </v>

118
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.163
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal logical sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at least that's how it looks to </v>

119
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:45.984
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

120
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.203
<v Speaker 1>I've found the sorts of things that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught you extremely useful in </v>

121
00:07:51.451 --> 00:07:52.284
<v Speaker 1>addressing some of these partially </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing at least some of these </v>

122
00:07:55.591 --> 00:08:00.591
<v Speaker 1>fundamental problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a couple of ways of looking at</v>

123
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 1>domains of knowledge in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those problems.</v>

124
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:05.414
<v Speaker 1>So the problem of being and becoming is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the problem of what is and what </v>

125
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:10.460
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Science,</v>

126
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.323
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me concentrates primarily on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a subset of what is unknown because </v>

127
00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's concerned with the structure of the</v>

128
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>world as it presents itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not to subjectivity precisely but to</v>

129
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:26.710
<v Speaker 1>the collective mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the rule with sciences,</v>

130
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>well if more than one person can detect </v>
<v Speaker 1>it at the same time,</v>

131
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.140
<v Speaker 1>then it might actually be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least it's real scientifically.</v>

132
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty useful tool.</v>

133
00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:39.374
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's partly useful because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps us differentiate our knowledge </v>

134
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 1>in a way that makes it more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>practically useful.</v>

135
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.173
<v Speaker 1>We need to know the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we can both experience and what </v>

136
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 1>only you can experience and what only I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can experience.</v>

137
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.413
<v Speaker 1>And and by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by continually continually clarifying </v>

138
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:57.264
<v Speaker 1>that what's happened is we've built a </v>
<v Speaker 1>much better and much more delineated </v>

139
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our shared experience.</v>

140
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's also allowed us to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of tools and technologies that</v>

141
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 1>have also that we've also chosen in most</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases to put,</v>

142
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>to work increasing our general quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life and wellbeing.</v>

143
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.203
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the science end of things has worked </v>

144
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:22.104
<v Speaker 1>pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become hyper developed over the </v>

145
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:26.110
<v Speaker 1>last 500 years and knots.</v>

146
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 1>That's good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's left some things in the lurch,</v>

147
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:30.294
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one we talked about when we </v>

148
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:34.400
<v Speaker 1>talked about Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche,</v>

149
00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:35.234
<v Speaker 1>and his idea of the death of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about one of the consequences </v>

150
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>of the rise of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of science has knowledge.</v>

151
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:43.494
<v Speaker 1>And because science can say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality it deals with is the shared ix </v>

152
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.943
<v Speaker 1>is the reality of shared experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it also tends to go farther than </v>

153
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:53.191
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

154
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 1>and to say that there is no other real </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

155
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 1>but what shared experience presents to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

156
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.240
<v Speaker 1>and that's where things get troublesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because first of all,</v>

157
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 1>from from a subjective perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't seem to be true.</v>

158
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

159
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.433
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious how you can understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the fact that </v>

160
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>you have your subjective experience and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

161
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 1>and the fact of the objective world.</v>

162
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.313
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to put those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things together and merely ignoring the </v>

163
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 1>subjective while that that causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

164
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:28.644
<v Speaker 1>Because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're primarily stuck with </v>

165
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's the primary problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

166
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.043
<v Speaker 1>how do you deal with your isolated </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual existence and what do you </v>

167
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 1>make of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Science in some senses,</v>

168
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 1>it can't answer those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it shouldn't.</v>

169
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.533
<v Speaker 1>That shouldn't necessarily lead us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conclusion that such and such </v>

170
00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 1>questions shouldn't be posed or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be answered.</v>

171
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:56.923
<v Speaker 1>I they do have to be answered because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still part of the domain of </v>

172
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:00.444
<v Speaker 1>problems that beset human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to me that for a </v>

173
00:11:04.891 --> 00:11:09.030
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive picture of experience or </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being,</v>

174
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:14.031
<v Speaker 1>you have to use two domains of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one is the scientific domain and the</v>

175
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:15.474
<v Speaker 1>other is fundamentally the moral domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the moral domain for me isn't I not </v>

176
00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:21.084
<v Speaker 1>really saying precisely that the moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain is the difference between right </v>

177
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:25.710
<v Speaker 1>and wrong.</v>

178
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.543
<v Speaker 1>Although I think that that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moral domain is actually a broader </v>

179
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 1>domain of questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

180
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how should yakked?</v>

181
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Because knowing what is is from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective does not give you</v>

182
00:11:38.761 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>a clear understanding of how you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress through life.</v>

183
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:43.554
<v Speaker 1>And because we're embodied creatures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we move and because we're </v>

184
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:51.090
<v Speaker 1>capable of transforming the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both with our consciousness and our,</v>

185
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 1>like with our consciousness and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication and our actions,</v>

186
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 1>there's no escaping the problem of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should act.</v>

187
00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.283
<v Speaker 1>And then it's an even more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem because it's not only how you </v>

188
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 1>should act because of your limitations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your skills,</v>

189
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:05.164
<v Speaker 1>but how you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should act given that there's all </v>

190
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:08.104
<v Speaker 1>these other creatures wandering around </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are asking the same questions and </v>

191
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:14.290
<v Speaker 1>trying to act just like you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other human beings.</v>

192
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the fact of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

193
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 1>the nonhuman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the living nonhuman world as well,</v>

194
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:22.210
<v Speaker 1>which is something that you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relationship with.</v>

195
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:23.044
<v Speaker 1>And you can't just ignore those </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions because they don't because </v>

196
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:31.000
<v Speaker 1>they're not easily answered by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms of empirical science.</v>

197
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:34.430
<v Speaker 1>It leaves people bereft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

198
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 1>when Nisha talked about the death of </v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

199
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:37.354
<v Speaker 1>I mean what he meant in some sense was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the claims of science are </v>

200
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:45.001
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently radical so that it's easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take them to mean that the um,</v>

201
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:47.623
<v Speaker 1>the sort of landscape of stories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute our archaic cultures are </v>

202
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 1>invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

203
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:58.683
<v Speaker 1>it's a complicated problem because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't at all clear to me that the </v>

204
00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:02.254
<v Speaker 1>landscape of stories that make up our </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural past are in fact scientific </v>

205
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:08.340
<v Speaker 1>descriptions and I don't think they ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

206
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.213
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that the manner in which </v>

207
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:12.304
<v Speaker 1>they described the world seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradict what we understand safe from </v>

208
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:16.354
<v Speaker 1>cosmology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it's basically irrelevant because </v>

209
00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 1>they're not dealing with the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem but,</v>

210
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 1>but you can see how it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has be been easy for people to become</v>

211
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:29.560
<v Speaker 1>philosophically confused because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not self evident that you meet need more</v>

212
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 1>than one kind of truth to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even self evident that there is</v>

213
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:36.070
<v Speaker 1>more than one kind of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

214
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.300
<v Speaker 1>But why we assumed that there would only</v>
<v Speaker 1>be one kind of truth is a mystery in and</v>

215
00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:41.050
<v Speaker 1>of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

216
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it's related somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

217
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.410
<v Speaker 1>to the push in humanity for a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>monotheism in or total a totality of one</v>

218
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:51.184
<v Speaker 1>theory governs all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe that's true in some ultimate </v>

219
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:55.624
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly isn't the case that </v>

220
00:13:56.951 --> 00:14:00.160
<v Speaker 1>we're at that point yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we might say,</v>

221
00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:00.994
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we need all the kinds of truth we </v>

222
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 1>can get our hands on and all the tools </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have in order to live properly.</v>

223
00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:10.660
<v Speaker 1>And we can sort out the fact that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them seem to coexist paradoxically.</v>

224
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.823
<v Speaker 1>Well we can just live with that for now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and accepted as a necessity that might </v>

225
00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:16.150
<v Speaker 1>become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

226
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:19.090
<v Speaker 1>the reason for which might become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear across time.</v>

227
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.793
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

228
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.900
<v Speaker 1>so it seems to me that for psychology to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a psychologist,</v>

229
00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:31.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to take both of these domains </v>
<v Speaker 1>very seriously.</v>

230
00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:36.230
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn everything you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what science has to tell you about</v>

231
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.780
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you're like and what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is like.</v>

232
00:14:38.781 --> 00:14:39.614
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to learn everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can about what history and culture </v>

233
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also shared the shared communication</v>

234
00:14:46.881 --> 00:14:51.881
<v Speaker 1>between people tells us about what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate ways are to ourselves and to</v>

235
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:53.864
<v Speaker 1>what ends we should be working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are all valid questions and </v>

236
00:14:57.111 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you ignore any of them,</v>

237
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.930
<v Speaker 1>you ignore them at your peril because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to know them in order to,</v>

238
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.423
<v Speaker 1>in order to minimize the degree to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to suffer unnecessarily or </v>

239
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:09.740
<v Speaker 1>that other people are going to suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily.</v>

240
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's not optional.</v>

241
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.150
<v Speaker 1>You see that this is sort of dichotomous</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

242
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.313
<v Speaker 1>The problem of this dichotomous truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows up in all sorts of binary </v>

243
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 1>oppositions in terms of forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

244
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's the,</v>

245
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.013
<v Speaker 1>well there's the objective reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which no one reading lives in because </v>

246
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a third person perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

247
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.013
<v Speaker 1>So it's a hypothetical kind of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but conceptualizing it seems to be very </v>

248
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:37.064
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the phenomenological </v>

249
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:38.804
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your experience is actually </v>

250
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 1>reality and that's what counts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those two things aren't the same.</v>

251
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of like the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between objective and subjective.</v>

252
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:48.524
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of like the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between scientific and moral and it's </v>

253
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:54.560
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialistic and mythological.</v>

254
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.873
<v Speaker 1>And so those are all dichotomies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical juxtapositions of forms of </v>

255
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>conception that seemed to be hitting at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

256
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.960
<v Speaker 1>this paradoxical relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and becoming.</v>

257
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.880
<v Speaker 1>So we considered both sides of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical,</v>

258
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.393
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual schemes as we walked through </v>

259
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:14.684
<v Speaker 1>the class material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read you this at the beginning of the </v>

260
00:16:17.841 --> 00:16:19.160
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from Einstein.</v>

261
00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:21.230
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to clarify what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing.</v>

262
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 1>When we practice science and Einstein </v>
<v Speaker 1>said by the aid of language,</v>

263
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:29.960
<v Speaker 1>different individuals can to some extent</v>
<v Speaker 1>compare their experiences.</v>

264
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.933
<v Speaker 1>Then it turns out that certain sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions of different individuals </v>

265
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:37.250
<v Speaker 1>correspond to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well for other sense perceptions,</v>

266
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 1>no such correspondence can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>

267
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.850
<v Speaker 1>We are accustomed to regard as real </v>
<v Speaker 1>those sense perceptions which are common</v>

268
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:48.140
<v Speaker 1>to different individuals and which </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore are in a measure impersonal.</v>

269
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.610
<v Speaker 1>The natural sciences and in particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most fundamental of them.</v>

270
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Physics deals with such sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>

271
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

272
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.560
<v Speaker 1>it's Einstein and obviously Einstein was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great thinker.</v>

273
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.753
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are things missing about this </v>

274
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.000
<v Speaker 1>description of what constitutes science.</v>

275
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.833
<v Speaker 1>Because the other thing that constitutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>science is a description of the </v>

276
00:17:08.301 --> 00:17:12.050
<v Speaker 1>procedures that led to the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentence perception,</v>

277
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.943
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about how a scientific paper </v>

278
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:16.940
<v Speaker 1>is written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only results,</v>

279
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:18.643
<v Speaker 1>it's method and results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the method is how I constituted my </v>

280
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:26.780
<v Speaker 1>body and time and space to produce these</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular sense perceptions.</v>

281
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.943
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of formalizing behavior and </v>

282
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:32.024
<v Speaker 1>then pairing it with the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and then communicating in a </v>

283
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:35.804
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that someone else could </v>

284
00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:37.244
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically duplicate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Einstein's pure focus on sense </v>

285
00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:45.920
<v Speaker 1>perception is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not complete.</v>

286
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.490
<v Speaker 1>You can't forget about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>systematization of procedures in science</v>

287
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:53.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's easy to forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apart from that it's,</v>

288
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty good summary.</v>

289
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.303
<v Speaker 1>And then Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes another tack at the whole </v>

290
00:17:58.801 --> 00:17:59.634
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is where the rubber hits the </v>

291
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:02.484
<v Speaker 1>road as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of how you constitute your </v>

292
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:07.440
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your individual being.</v>

293
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.950
<v Speaker 1>And Shakespeare says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a metaphor in many ways,</v>

294
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Speaker 1>this all the world's a stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the men and women,</v>

295
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:15.474
<v Speaker 1>merely players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their exits and their </v>

296
00:18:17.131 --> 00:18:21.000
<v Speaker 1>entrances and one man in his time plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>many parts.</v>

297
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.890
<v Speaker 1>And so from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Shakespearian pers perspective,</v>

298
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.210
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being is more like a play than it</v>

299
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

300
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.650
<v Speaker 1>like a collection of objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>

301
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.730
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is the play </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

302
00:18:38.731 --> 00:18:39.564
<v Speaker 1>like a shakespearian play becomes a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate representation of being than a </v>

303
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:48.370
<v Speaker 1>scientific description does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's because it plays out it because</v>

304
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.253
<v Speaker 1>it's because it accounts for behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>and because it plays out the </v>

305
00:18:52.561 --> 00:18:56.010
<v Speaker 1>consequences of behavior from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective perspective.</v>

306
00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:56.844
<v Speaker 1>Because a good play elicits the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>passions and emotions and motivations </v>

307
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:04.680
<v Speaker 1>that are subjectively experienced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually character your eyes,</v>

308
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:09.681
<v Speaker 1>your life as you live it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is the play a novel,</v>

309
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:13.890
<v Speaker 1>a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story is an abstract representation of</v>

310
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:14.724
<v Speaker 1>reality that's subject to just as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigor in terms of conception as a </v>

311
00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:24.540
<v Speaker 1>scientific description of a given thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also real,</v>

312
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by real,</v>

313
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.003
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we already found out what the </v>

314
00:19:30.301 --> 00:19:33.930
<v Speaker 1>scientists think of as real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's lots of arguments about that</v>

315
00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:35.040
<v Speaker 1>because I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

316
00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.493
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

317
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I would judge what you consider real by </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching how you behave,</v>

318
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 1>not by listening to what you say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the world.</v>

319
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's an existential perspective as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

320
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.663
<v Speaker 1>And so then I would note that dis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what all of you might say </v>

321
00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:57.210
<v Speaker 1>about what you believe about the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality,</v>

322
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.890
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly the case that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to act as if your own perceptions,</v>

323
00:20:01.891 --> 00:20:05.520
<v Speaker 1>you're your own subjectivity is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

324
00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:06.354
<v Speaker 1>if something hurts you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think all you want about how </v>

325
00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:10.104
<v Speaker 1>pain is not objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not going to get you out of </v>

326
00:20:12.871 --> 00:20:17.160
<v Speaker 1>the painful situation and you're still </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to configure your behavior so that</v>

327
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.323
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do everything you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>even in voluntarily so that you will </v>

328
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.553
<v Speaker 1>work to avoid that pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're stuck with acting as if </v>

329
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 1>your subjectivity is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that happens.</v>

330
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.520
<v Speaker 1>That happens at such a deep level that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it supersedes your consciousness,</v>

331
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

332
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.913
<v Speaker 1>if you put your arm on a burning stove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take your arm away from </v>

333
00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:38.994
<v Speaker 1>that before you even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reality of reality in some sense </v>

334
00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:44.274
<v Speaker 1>of your subjectivity is so deep that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even necessarily have a choice </v>

335
00:20:46.771 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

336
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.913
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

337
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:54.243
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've wondered for a long time is what </v>

338
00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 1>happens if you take this sort of idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously?</v>

339
00:20:58.661 --> 00:20:59.494
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you need the knowledge that is </v>

340
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:04.804
<v Speaker 1>constituted in stories because it tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>you how to behave and because you need </v>

341
00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:10.114
<v Speaker 1>to know how to behave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's actually one of the </v>

342
00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:12.484
<v Speaker 1>fundamental problems of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might even be the most fundamental </v>

343
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:18.580
<v Speaker 1>problem of life if you know from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective,</v>

344
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:21.760
<v Speaker 1>the most fundamental problem is what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>things made of?</v>

345
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.070
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they interrelate?</v>

346
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.323
<v Speaker 1>But just because that's a very well </v>
<v Speaker 1>stated problem and just because we've </v>

347
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:30.694
<v Speaker 1>been able to produce profound in </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated answers to it does not </v>

348
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 1>necessarily mean that that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that almost everyone faces.</v>

349
00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me it's especially the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case with people.</v>

350
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:41.530
<v Speaker 1>At your age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

351
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>

352
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Seems to me to be the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and soul.</v>

353
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:49.330
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

354
00:21:49.331 --> 00:21:50.164
<v Speaker 1>there's no real guidance for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just something you have to figure </v>

355
00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:54.700
<v Speaker 1>out for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>

356
00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:55.534
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of thing that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>question the utility of knowledge per </v>

357
00:21:58.631 --> 00:21:59.464
<v Speaker 1>se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a weak answer and I </v>

358
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.790
<v Speaker 1>also think it's a wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of,</v>

359
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.470
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

360
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.333
<v Speaker 1>there is no shortage of information </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to behave and there's no </v>

361
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:10.324
<v Speaker 1>shortage of information about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens if you break the rules of </v>

362
00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:15.604
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's arguments about what those </v>

363
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:18.424
<v Speaker 1>rules are and there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no doubt that they differ </v>

364
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:21.394
<v Speaker 1>contextually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just something can differ at one </v>

365
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:26.590
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis and be the same at </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

366
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Languages are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

367
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:32.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean we all speak a language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The languages are different,</v>

368
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.513
<v Speaker 1>but they're all languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they differ at one level of </v>

369
00:22:35.891 --> 00:22:37.660
<v Speaker 1>analysis and there are common had </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

370
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.823
<v Speaker 1>And how it act is like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think piaget is particularly </v>

371
00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:42.604
<v Speaker 1>useful for thinking about that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget is the thinker who I think has </v>

372
00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:48.334
<v Speaker 1>done the most work and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how it is that there might </v>

373
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:53.194
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

374
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

375
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.670
<v Speaker 1>A basis for what constitutes morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.500
<v Speaker 1>and Piaget starts with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the shakespearian conception,</v>

377
00:23:01.501 --> 00:23:05.490
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally he believes that how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act is the problem.</v>

378
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.383
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're embodied creatures and we're very </v>

379
00:23:07.591 --> 00:23:09.930
<v Speaker 1>mobile and we're very good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulating the world.</v>

380
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.033
<v Speaker 1>We're very good at communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so any psychology that doesn't take </v>

381
00:23:14.071 --> 00:23:17.850
<v Speaker 1>into account the nature of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiment is a very weak psychology.</v>

382
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.980
<v Speaker 1>And Piaget basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

383
00:23:19.981 --> 00:23:20.814
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come into the world with some </v>

384
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.780
<v Speaker 1>potential for auction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of minimal,</v>

385
00:23:24.781 --> 00:23:26.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's enough to get you going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

386
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.010
<v Speaker 1>It's enough to kick start you in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

387
00:23:29.011 --> 00:23:33.480
<v Speaker 1>And then as you organize your body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this neurologically sort of</v>

388
00:23:33.481 --> 00:23:35.520
<v Speaker 1>from the spine up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we discussed,</v>

389
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which you organize your,</v>

390
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.193
<v Speaker 1>your capability for action and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception is continually modified by </v>

391
00:23:43.621 --> 00:23:45.090
<v Speaker 1>your social interaction with other.</v>

392
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:46.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

393
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.313
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're socialized being is built right </v>

394
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>into your motor circuitry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

395
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a conception.</v>

396
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

397
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.003
<v Speaker 1>when you're breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it in a manner that </v>

398
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:03.680
<v Speaker 1>allows your mother to tolerate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so something,</v>

399
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 1>even something as simple as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the first ways that you use your lips</v>

400
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:08.534
<v Speaker 1>and your mouth and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way that you express your </v>

401
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:11.984
<v Speaker 1>emotions is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is immediately going to be modified by </v>

402
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:16.454
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of social interaction and </v>
<v Speaker 1>social interaction can't just proceed </v>

403
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:22.640
<v Speaker 1>any old way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

404
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:27.641
<v Speaker 1>So if we have a relationship and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes seriously nonreciprocal,</v>

405
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.400
<v Speaker 1>you're a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's nonreciprocal in your direction,</v>

406
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 1>you're a fool to stay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

407
00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:38.830
<v Speaker 1>there's something that's roughly like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the expectation of 50 50 and that's well</v>

408
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.620
<v Speaker 1>that's well established empirically </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

409
00:24:41.621 --> 00:24:42.454
<v Speaker 1>with experiments that wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't expect to turn out that </v>

410
00:24:45.741 --> 00:24:47.360
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the trading experiments.</v>

411
00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:49.010
<v Speaker 1>And I told you about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

412
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:51.560
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the deal is we'll play,</v>

413
00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the three of us will play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to,</v>

414
00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I have $100 and you can have as much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as you want,</v>

415
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but you have to give him some and he has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept your offer.</v>

416
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.980
<v Speaker 1>So I've got a hundred how much are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to give him?</v>

417
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.360
<v Speaker 1>30 would you take that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

418
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

419
00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:13.190
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

420
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.033
<v Speaker 1>what's been found everywhere is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people roughly center around 50 50 and </v>

421
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:24.980
<v Speaker 1>so even if the amounts are quite high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if the people to whom the money</v>

422
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:28.370
<v Speaker 1>is being offered are very poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

423
00:25:28.371 --> 00:25:31.640
<v Speaker 1>the poor the people are to whom the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money is being offered,</v>

424
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:35.330
<v Speaker 1>the more likely they are to tell you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to hell if you're not being fair.</v>

425
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.270
<v Speaker 1>And so that's and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they see and that's built in and you</v>

426
00:25:38.271 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 1>think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't take much more than that</v>

427
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 1>for morality as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a system to get going.</v>

428
00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.630
<v Speaker 1>So if the rough expectation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>reciprocity,</v>

429
00:25:47.631 --> 00:25:48.464
<v Speaker 1>where that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then deviations from that reciprocity </v>

430
00:25:52.281 --> 00:25:53.114
<v Speaker 1>are going to be punished very harshly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so right there you have the grounds </v>

431
00:25:57.831 --> 00:26:01.160
<v Speaker 1>for the emergence of a complex system of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human interactions.</v>

432
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.520
<v Speaker 1>That's by no means arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it might be,</v>

433
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:06.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>altered to some degree by the </v>

434
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.030
<v Speaker 1>particularities of the local </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

435
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.133
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But something can have a fundamental </v>

436
00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:18.920
<v Speaker 1>pattern and still be capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

437
00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:21.960
<v Speaker 1>a large number of variants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

438
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.083
<v Speaker 1>so what that essentially means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is exactly what piaget </v>

439
00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:29.330
<v Speaker 1>observed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when you put people together,</v>

440
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.960
<v Speaker 1>which you do because people can't live </v>
<v Speaker 1>by themselves,</v>

441
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:36.020
<v Speaker 1>were highly social creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a long period of dependence,</v>

442
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 1>we have to make our way and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear family unit,</v>

443
00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:40.484
<v Speaker 1>whatever it happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we have to adjust to the broader </v>

444
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.003
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to be acceptable to the broader </v>

445
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:46.584
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have to learn to maintain </v>

446
00:26:48.181 --> 00:26:51.270
<v Speaker 1>the broader group and to contributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute to it.</v>

447
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.583
<v Speaker 1>Because if we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of our experience will </v>

448
00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 1>suffer dramatically.</v>

449
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.653
<v Speaker 1>So you ended up outcast or punished or </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated or disappointed or alone or </v>

450
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:02.484
<v Speaker 1>all the things that happen if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least uphold a fair bit of your </v>

451
00:27:08.311 --> 00:27:09.144
<v Speaker 1>social responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means right away is </v>

452
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:12.804
<v Speaker 1>that the patterns that constitute </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate behavior are not just </v>

453
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what exactly they are.</v>

454
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Well that's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

455
00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:26.661
<v Speaker 1>it's just as complicated as Jane Goodall</v>
<v Speaker 1>going out into the habitat of the chimps</v>

456
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:28.614
<v Speaker 1>and watching them and trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out just exactly what those chimps are </v>

457
00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:33.900
<v Speaker 1>up to and we kind of know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to.</v>

458
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.123
<v Speaker 1>They organize themselves and dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies because almost every animal </v>

459
00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:38.844
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then along with that go certain </v>

460
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:41.574
<v Speaker 1>kinds of rules of interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except they're not rules because chimps </v>

461
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 1>don't have rules because chimps don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have abstract conception.</v>

462
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.930
<v Speaker 1>What they have is rituals of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shared expectations.</v>

463
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.340
<v Speaker 1>But that's the beginning of rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

464
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.173
<v Speaker 1>It's like Piaget says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well to put children together when </v>

465
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:03.120
<v Speaker 1>there's seven or eight and they play </v>
<v Speaker 1>marbles,</v>

466
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.640
<v Speaker 1>they can all play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you take them away from the group</v>

467
00:28:05.641 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 1>and you ask them what the rules are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really don't know.</v>

468
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.840
<v Speaker 1>And all that means is they can dance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can dance with other kids,</v>

469
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.853
<v Speaker 1>but they can't tell you how to dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean they don't know </v>

470
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:19.590
<v Speaker 1>how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like we're all like that,</v>

471
00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:21.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're living in these very,</v>

472
00:28:21.241 --> 00:28:22.074
<v Speaker 1>very complex hierarchical environments </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we inhabit multiple hierarchies </v>

473
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.313
<v Speaker 1>and they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated and row is wandering </v>

474
00:28:30.571 --> 00:28:31.404
<v Speaker 1>around trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what the hell is it that we're up </v>

475
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:34.434
<v Speaker 1>to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't exactly know which is why </v>

476
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:36.654
<v Speaker 1>we need the psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just because we don't know what </v>

477
00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:40.680
<v Speaker 1>we're up to doesn't mean we're not up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

478
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 1>And it also doesn't mean that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't something that we should be up to.</v>

479
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.183
<v Speaker 1>And I think the social interaction list </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea is even deeper than that because </v>

480
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.960
<v Speaker 1>almost all the time when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with people,</v>

481
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.640
<v Speaker 1>they're broadcasting their desire for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to be some sort of person,</v>

482
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.133
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might be kind of like the person </v>

483
00:29:02.191 --> 00:29:03.024
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their expectations are higher than </v>

484
00:29:05.161 --> 00:29:05.994
<v Speaker 1>that because they would rather in all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're seriously </v>

485
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:09.924
<v Speaker 1>involved with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would rather that you were a good </v>

486
00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:15.450
<v Speaker 1>sort of person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they demand from you.</v>

487
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:19.110
<v Speaker 1>They want you to listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to treat them properly.</v>

488
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Speaker 1>They want you to engage in reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade.</v>

489
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.340
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.173
<v Speaker 1>they want you to take care of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming they're not all resentful </v>

491
00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:28.500
<v Speaker 1>and full of hate and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

492
00:29:28.501 --> 00:29:32.040
<v Speaker 1>they're not just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be yourself there saying no,</v>

493
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:32.874
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

494
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Be what everyone needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what everyone is broadcasting</v>

495
00:29:37.711 --> 00:29:41.070
<v Speaker 1>to everyone else all the time is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be what I need be.</v>

496
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 1>I need be what I need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be what they need.</v>

497
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.520
<v Speaker 1>And so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

498
00:29:45.521 --> 00:29:46.354
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always being told the message </v>

499
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:48.394
<v Speaker 1>from people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they're just raising their </v>

500
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:50.194
<v Speaker 1>eyebrows at you are smiling or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>smiling or calling you on the phone or </v>

501
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 1>texting you or not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just being informed about who you</v>

502
00:29:58.421 --> 00:29:59.254
<v Speaker 1>should be all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason to assume that's </v>

503
00:30:02.141 --> 00:30:02.974
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given that we share a common biological </v>

504
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.490
<v Speaker 1>ground and we have the same emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

505
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 1>and we have the same motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

506
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.060
<v Speaker 1>So given that pattern that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground of commonality and expectation,</v>

507
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.260
<v Speaker 1>well why should we assume anything other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a pattern,</v>

508
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.620
<v Speaker 1>a pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emergence of agreement out of that.</v>

509
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.233
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

510
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.520
<v Speaker 1>so the moral relativists theory assumes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that morality is relative.</v>

511
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:36.683
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a naive theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that it's relative and </v>

512
00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:40.854
<v Speaker 1>non relative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means there are elements of it </v>

513
00:30:42.511 --> 00:30:46.890
<v Speaker 1>that are fixed and necessarily so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are other things that can</v>

514
00:30:46.891 --> 00:30:48.180
<v Speaker 1>vary without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

515
00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:50.880
<v Speaker 1>without a problem as long as people </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreed to it.</v>

516
00:30:50.881 --> 00:30:55.860
<v Speaker 1>But I think that societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is also a Piagetian notion,</v>

517
00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:56.963
<v Speaker 1>that societies that violate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle of reciprocity are not very </v>

518
00:31:01.261 --> 00:31:05.040
<v Speaker 1>stable because no one's pleased by those</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

519
00:31:05.041 --> 00:31:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Some people are slaves and some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are tyrants and you know,</v>

520
00:31:08.401 --> 00:31:10.530
<v Speaker 1>that'll work for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's unstable.</v>

521
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.780
<v Speaker 1>And even within a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

522
00:31:12.781 --> 00:31:14.780
<v Speaker 1>If your father is a complete bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrant,</v>

523
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:18.780
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to do is either be </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushed and useless or get the hell away</v>

524
00:31:18.781 --> 00:31:20.190
<v Speaker 1>from there as fast as you can.</v>

525
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not a stable solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

526
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.730
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonreciprocal relations at any level of,</v>

527
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.060
<v Speaker 1>of interaction are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not tenable.</v>

528
00:31:30.061 --> 00:31:32.160
<v Speaker 1>And they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be tenable,</v>

529
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you see people in psychotherapy,</v>

530
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.540
<v Speaker 1>especially if they tend to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable side,</v>

531
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:40.853
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you teach them is</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to speak more about their own needs </v>

532
00:31:46.261 --> 00:31:47.094
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that or their own desires of their </v>

533
00:31:48.511 --> 00:31:49.344
<v Speaker 1>own values so that the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll engage in a prop in a truly </v>

534
00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:55.650
<v Speaker 1>reciprocal relationship starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>

535
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.780
<v Speaker 1>They won't be taken advantage of so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

536
00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.093
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>precondition for their satisfactory </v>

537
00:32:02.881 --> 00:32:03.714
<v Speaker 1>embeddedness in a social context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfactory being something that you </v>

538
00:32:07.201 --> 00:32:10.950
<v Speaker 1>are doing and that you can maintain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>are willing to maintain.</v>

539
00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:11.784
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because a real relationship is a game </v>

540
00:32:13.741 --> 00:32:14.574
<v Speaker 1>you play over and over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not going to want to play </v>

541
00:32:17.551 --> 00:32:18.384
<v Speaker 1>with someone who doesn't play fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even little kids know that and they </v>

542
00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:24.790
<v Speaker 1>know it deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

543
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.630
<v Speaker 1>the moral relativism theory is a foolish</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

544
00:32:27.631 --> 00:32:28.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

545
00:32:28.611 --> 00:32:32.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's foolish and ill researched.</v>

546
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

547
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:37.933
<v Speaker 1>At the bottom of the being and becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is something else and this is </v>

548
00:32:40.971 --> 00:32:41.804
<v Speaker 1>something that they existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers and the young Ian's and </v>

549
00:32:45.741 --> 00:32:48.920
<v Speaker 1>most religious systems concentrate on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of what,</v>

550
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:51.940
<v Speaker 1>what's the core nature of being and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

551
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:52.783
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when systems have that sort of </v>

552
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:55.034
<v Speaker 1>discussing the coordinator of being one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the immediate objects of </v>

553
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 1>contemplation is the fact that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are limited,</v>

554
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of things we can't do.</v>

555
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.520
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there and you're not there.</v>

556
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:08.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're then that's thrown this from a </v>

557
00:33:10.011 --> 00:33:12.110
<v Speaker 1>fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a phenomenological perspective,</v>

558
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you're just stuck with what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

559
00:33:14.471 --> 00:33:16.490
<v Speaker 1>we are a certain height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have certain eye color,</v>

560
00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:19.040
<v Speaker 1>your certain amount of attractive or or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

561
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're verbally fluent,</v>

562
00:33:21.261 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 1>you're smart or you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're conscientious like,</v>

563
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:24.703
<v Speaker 1>and it's just sort of those are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cards that you've been dealt and really </v>

564
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:29.570
<v Speaker 1>is worth thinking about it that way.</v>

565
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Because who you are in some sense is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of a lot of processes,</v>

566
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.443
<v Speaker 1>genetic processes that are in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>random and you've been dealt in </v>

567
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:40.520
<v Speaker 1>particular hand and then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play it.</v>

568
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.833
<v Speaker 1>And that hand has limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people in some sense are there </v>

569
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.860
<v Speaker 1>offered opportunities by the nature of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their,</v>

570
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.950
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how they're constituted.</v>

571
00:33:51.951 --> 00:33:54.380
<v Speaker 1>But there's also a tragic element to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

572
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.780
<v Speaker 1>which is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you move in life,</v>

573
00:33:56.781 --> 00:33:59.900
<v Speaker 1>you bump up against limitations that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot transcend.</v>

574
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:03.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are the typical limitations.</v>

575
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 1>You bumped up against the demands of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social group,</v>

576
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:06.974
<v Speaker 1>which has a tyrannical element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bump up against nature itself </v>

577
00:34:09.951 --> 00:34:14.150
<v Speaker 1>because you're susceptible to illness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to degeneration and to,</v>

578
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.910
<v Speaker 1>and eventually to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so are the people around you.</v>

579
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:17.744
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this issue at the bottom of </v>

580
00:34:20.751 --> 00:34:22.760
<v Speaker 1>being that also presents you with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

581
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:23.623
<v Speaker 1>So life is problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to solve it and that's </v>

582
00:34:26.421 --> 00:34:27.254
<v Speaker 1>what you're stuck with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of the parameters of </v>

583
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:29.774
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think in in most mythological </v>

584
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:35.720
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to think of mythology,</v>

585
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.673
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and then mythology as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of conceptualization that are </v>

586
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:46.640
<v Speaker 1>examining the grammatical structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

587
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's common among sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

588
00:34:50.601 --> 00:34:51.171
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

589
00:34:51.171 --> 00:34:54.200
<v Speaker 1>what's common to the experience of sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

590
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you are is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

591
00:34:58.191 --> 00:35:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that the fact that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>has problems is another.</v>

592
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:03.103
<v Speaker 1>And then a third one is while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated at least to some degree to do </v>

593
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:09.770
<v Speaker 1>something about those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what makes people human.</v>

594
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:12.920
<v Speaker 1>And in many regards it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental that makes them human.</v>

595
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:17.110
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about that as tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness.</v>

596
00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.600
<v Speaker 1>It's self conscious because you know who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are and it's tragic because you also</v>

597
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:23.510
<v Speaker 1>know where your limitations are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fundamental.</v>

598
00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And that also sets up another set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>

599
00:35:26.181 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

600
00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:30.170
<v Speaker 1>is there something we can do about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we limit our vulnerability?</v>

601
00:35:30.171 --> 00:35:31.004
<v Speaker 1>Can we extend our scope of power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do we do that without causing </v>

602
00:35:34.671 --> 00:35:35.504
<v Speaker 1>more trouble than we're solving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with that kind of common problem at </v>

603
00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:42.354
<v Speaker 1>the basis of our being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also what enables us to </v>

604
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:44.634
<v Speaker 1>communicate because we understand each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other because we're in the same states </v>

605
00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:48.534
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can talk to someone about your </v>

606
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:50.994
<v Speaker 1>problems without having to explain what </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems are because you can't </v>

607
00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:56.334
<v Speaker 1>communicate with people unless there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some things you don't have to </v>

608
00:35:58.411 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 1>communicate about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It need a shared set of assumptions.</v>

609
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.090
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

610
00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:06.570
<v Speaker 1>that you have problems and now is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're looking for solutions.</v>

611
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Another is that may be communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that is helpful.</v>

612
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:10.883
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of those things have to be </v>

613
00:36:12.151 --> 00:36:15.330
<v Speaker 1>established before you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating because everyone's already</v>

614
00:36:15.331 --> 00:36:16.164
<v Speaker 1>got that.</v>

615
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Those presuppositions built right into </v>
<v Speaker 1>their understanding.</v>

616
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.223
<v Speaker 1>So I've modeled this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen this lots of times now and </v>

617
00:36:23.911 --> 00:36:24.744
<v Speaker 1>I've sort of modeled this like this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a cybernetic model in many ways </v>

618
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.573
<v Speaker 1>and it's based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I didn't know it when I </v>

619
00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:31.914
<v Speaker 1>developed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was based on the thinking of Norbert </v>

620
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.093
<v Speaker 1>Wiener who was an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence genius and it basically </v>

621
00:36:38.491 --> 00:36:43.260
<v Speaker 1>presumes that it's a modified version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It presumes that wherever you are,</v>

622
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:45.210
<v Speaker 1>you have some conception of where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

623
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:47.520
<v Speaker 1>That's your current understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

624
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.593
<v Speaker 1>It's flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because you're here doesn't mean </v>

625
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:53.460
<v Speaker 1>you understand everything about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

626
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully because you have low </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution conceptions,</v>

627
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.500
<v Speaker 1>you don't know anything about the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

628
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.200
<v Speaker 1>As long as they sit down and shut up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>act normally,</v>

629
00:37:01.201 --> 00:37:04.050
<v Speaker 1>that's no problem because you can easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore them,</v>

630
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.213
<v Speaker 1>but they're full of weird potential and </v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows when that's going to </v>

631
00:37:07.741 --> 00:37:08.670
<v Speaker 1>emerge from one of them.</v>

632
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.500
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm saying,</v>

633
00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:11.334
<v Speaker 1>you know where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a model of what you are but </v>

634
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:14.424
<v Speaker 1>it's shallow and potentially flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that you can get </v>

635
00:37:17.941 --> 00:37:19.560
<v Speaker 1>away with that is because there's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

636
00:37:19.561 --> 00:37:20.394
<v Speaker 1>there's this implicit agreement among </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us not to do anything that </v>

637
00:37:25.501 --> 00:37:26.334
<v Speaker 1>violates general social expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly how you can get </v>

638
00:37:29.851 --> 00:37:32.190
<v Speaker 1>away with the fact that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about anyone.</v>

639
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

640
00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:34.314
<v Speaker 1>there peculiar like rhinoceroses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ostriches and God only knows what </v>

641
00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:38.274
<v Speaker 1>they're up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully they're socialized enough </v>

642
00:37:40.951 --> 00:37:45.540
<v Speaker 1>so they don't show you how peculiar they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are when you're walking past them on the</v>

643
00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:46.980
<v Speaker 1>street in Po,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in public.</v>

644
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.620
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get away with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>shallow knowledge.</v>

645
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:50.903
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have some sense of where </v>

646
00:37:52.231 --> 00:37:56.940
<v Speaker 1>you're going and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's vague part of it.</v>

647
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be there whether you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it through or not.</v>

648
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.540
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we've discussed,</v>

649
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.530
<v Speaker 1>the biologists are pretty good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>informing us on this part is that,</v>

650
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the base of your cognitive,</v>

651
00:38:10.651 --> 00:38:12.210
<v Speaker 1>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational,</v>

652
00:38:12.211 --> 00:38:13.044
<v Speaker 1>perceptual structure that gives rise to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your being are the systems that are </v>

653
00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:21.900
<v Speaker 1>going to push you in some direction as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation systems or emotion system.</v>

654
00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:22.734
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't drink water long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much that's all you're going to </v>

655
00:38:25.471 --> 00:38:29.250
<v Speaker 1>be able to think about and value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

656
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:30.323
<v Speaker 1>see the world through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause when you see the world as a </v>

657
00:38:32.551 --> 00:38:35.500
<v Speaker 1>thirsty person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not seeing the world the same way</v>

658
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 1>that someone who has had plenty to drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees it.</v>

659
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also you have this,</v>

660
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.413
<v Speaker 1>this space that defines where you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this conception about where you're </v>

661
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 1>going and you think where you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>is better.</v>

662
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.193
<v Speaker 1>And you have a theory about how you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to transform the present into the </v>

663
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:55.840
<v Speaker 1>more desirable future.</v>

664
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.980
<v Speaker 1>But you can make an error at any level </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that conceptualization.</v>

665
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.890
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of a modification of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Gray's theory,</v>

666
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:03.724
<v Speaker 1>the cybernetic theorist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what they believed was that you </v>

667
00:39:07.271 --> 00:39:11.650
<v Speaker 1>see the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you expect certain things to happen when</v>

668
00:39:11.651 --> 00:39:16.180
<v Speaker 1>you act and now and then when you act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that expectation has violated.</v>

669
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.553
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have to reconfigure your</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior or your conception of the </v>

670
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:20.674
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not quite right because you </v>

671
00:39:22.541 --> 00:39:24.670
<v Speaker 1>don't see the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

672
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:30.360
<v Speaker 1>You perceive the world through a fog of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of preconceptions and in a manner that's</v>

673
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:33.603
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impaired because of your tremendous </v>

674
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:35.914
<v Speaker 1>cognitive limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that when you're </v>

675
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:43.690
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be wrong anywhere in that model.</v>

676
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.570
<v Speaker 1>You can be wrong because you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>

677
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 1>You can be wrong because you picked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong behaviors to manifest.</v>

678
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:51.543
<v Speaker 1>Or you can be wrong because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conception of where you're going is </v>

679
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:57.460
<v Speaker 1>flawed in that you're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy when you get there.</v>

680
00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.293
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it doesn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you see this most painfully </v>

681
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.370
<v Speaker 1>when you're in a relationship and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>be trade.</v>

682
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're in a relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're betrayed by someone,</v>

683
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.270
<v Speaker 1>then it's pretty damn clear that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know where you were.</v>

684
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.343
<v Speaker 1>Now it's also then clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you're going and </v>

685
00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:18.160
<v Speaker 1>also that you probably don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

686
00:40:18.161 --> 00:40:18.994
<v Speaker 1>So that's very painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's in human relationships in </v>

687
00:40:21.581 --> 00:40:22.414
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that you find out how fragile </v>

688
00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:29.260
<v Speaker 1>your conceptions of the present actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and that you're not dealing with the</v>

689
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:30.094
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with a very </v>

690
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:36.250
<v Speaker 1>oversimplified and presupposition based </v>
<v Speaker 1>conception of the world.</v>

691
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.070
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause maybe you think your partner loves</v>

692
00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:43.450
<v Speaker 1>you and is trustworthy and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think all people are trustworthy,</v>

693
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're naive and then you find </v>

694
00:40:45.371 --> 00:40:46.204
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if that's love you don't want any </v>

695
00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:51.040
<v Speaker 1>of it and they're not trustworthy.</v>

696
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.560
<v Speaker 1>And then then what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

697
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.940
<v Speaker 1>well you don't know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you're going.</v>

698
00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.950
<v Speaker 1>You probably don't know who you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

699
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.410
<v Speaker 1>You certainly don't know who the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person is.</v>

700
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.230
<v Speaker 1>And because you don't know who they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you are,</v>

701
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.400
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you don't know who anyone is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that puts you in a place too.</v>

702
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought for a substantial amount of time</v>

703
00:41:14.081 --> 00:41:17.140
<v Speaker 1>is that you can think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go back like this.</v>

704
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.590
<v Speaker 1>When you're thinking about the structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>

705
00:41:20.591 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 1>and one element of the structure is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the place.</v>

706
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Those are two serpents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

707
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I just found out about that recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

708
00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common mythological motif.</v>

709
00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 1>They represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Dow,</v>

710
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:34.420
<v Speaker 1>right from the Taoists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from from,</v>

711
00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:37.130
<v Speaker 1>from Taoism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and from the Dow is thinkers.</v>

712
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:41.840
<v Speaker 1>And Dow basically means something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>being or something like the way,</v>

713
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 1>which is like the path of life and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more a phenomenological than scientific.</v>

714
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:50.840
<v Speaker 1>What it's basically saying is that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience is composed of two domains,</v>

715
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:55.370
<v Speaker 1>always necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One domain is the orderly domain and the</v>

716
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 1>orderly domain is the place where when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you act,</v>

717
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:00.290
<v Speaker 1>what you expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>habits or,</v>

718
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:04.370
<v Speaker 1>or more precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the place where when you act,</v>

719
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.233
<v Speaker 1>what you want happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's orderly because you </v>

720
00:42:08.391 --> 00:42:13.340
<v Speaker 1>understand it well enough so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the snakes don't escape.</v>

721
00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:15.620
<v Speaker 1>When you walk forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

722
00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:16.790
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

723
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

724
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.080
<v Speaker 1>you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited.</v>

725
00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:21.914
<v Speaker 1>Preconceptions are sufficient so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they map onto the environment as it </v>

726
00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:27.230
<v Speaker 1>emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you act.</v>

727
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.680
<v Speaker 1>That's an orderly place and fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a bad place.</v>

728
00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:31.514
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like most of you want most of your </v>

729
00:42:34.011 --> 00:42:34.844
<v Speaker 1>experience to be that kind of place </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise it's just too </v>

730
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:38.060
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>

731
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:38.893
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with order is that you </v>

732
00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:42.974
<v Speaker 1>can have too much order and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the variability of your </v>

733
00:42:46.071 --> 00:42:48.590
<v Speaker 1>experience can be pushed out and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get bored.</v>

734
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:53.270
<v Speaker 1>So the answer isn't total order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've also talked about what happens</v>

735
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:55.910
<v Speaker 1>when the answer becomes total order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

736
00:42:55.911 --> 00:42:56.744
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's the totalitarian solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we kind of think that maybe it's </v>

737
00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:04.601
<v Speaker 1>grounded in not only in fear but also in</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed or maybe mostly in disgust.</v>

738
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.350
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

739
00:43:06.351 --> 00:43:11.030
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of the ordered low lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain seems to be the chaotic domain.</v>

740
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:16.280
<v Speaker 1>And the chaotic domain is where you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't know where you are.</v>

741
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a geographical place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it can be,</v>

742
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:22.850
<v Speaker 1>because you can get last say in the city</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're in chaos.</v>

743
00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:23.684
<v Speaker 1>But it's more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more often I think in an </v>

744
00:43:26.301 --> 00:43:27.770
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal place.</v>

745
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.843
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people encounter chaos most </v>

746
00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:31.064
<v Speaker 1>often and it's deep sense within their </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with other people go </v>

747
00:43:34.911 --> 00:43:35.744
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's when you're confronted </v>

748
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:41.660
<v Speaker 1>with all the things you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>

749
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:42.643
<v Speaker 1>it also happens to you a lot when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were interacting with complex </v>

750
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:49.040
<v Speaker 1>technological machinery and it fails on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because as soon as it fails,</v>

751
00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:51.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well at one second it's,</v>

752
00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.420
<v Speaker 1>it's your little gray box with keys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could push.</v>

753
00:43:53.421 --> 00:43:55.790
<v Speaker 1>And if the next second it's God only </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what,</v>

754
00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:59.990
<v Speaker 1>and you are certainly not capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking of dealing with that.</v>

755
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 1>So the Dow is say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

756
00:44:02.361 --> 00:44:04.700
<v Speaker 1>the world is made up of Yin and Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they,</v>

757
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.400
<v Speaker 1>that's the terms that they use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it.</v>

758
00:44:07.401 --> 00:44:09.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's often translated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

759
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Yang is masculine and Yin is feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean male and female.</v>

760
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.163
<v Speaker 1>It means something deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is human beings have a social </v>

761
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:22.190
<v Speaker 1>cognitive architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

762
00:44:22.191 --> 00:44:23.024
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're from from time in memorial where </v>

763
00:44:24.881 --> 00:44:25.714
<v Speaker 1>we're used to mapping the world as </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and feminine because most of </v>

764
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:30.794
<v Speaker 1>our interactions throughout our </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history have been social </v>

765
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 1>and interpersonal interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the primary reality.</v>

766
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.610
<v Speaker 1>And when we developed our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

767
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:42.600
<v Speaker 1>greater cognitive capacity and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to abstract,</v>

768
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:43.434
<v Speaker 1>we had to use the conceptual structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we'd already evolved in order to </v>

769
00:44:46.531 --> 00:44:47.364
<v Speaker 1>start mapping out the world abstractly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we seem to use masculine and </v>

770
00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:54.690
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like the primary binary</v>

771
00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:55.524
<v Speaker 1>opposition to represent things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily opposed at the deepest of </v>

772
00:44:59.821 --> 00:45:01.920
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's other reasons as well.</v>

773
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean chaos is the place from which new</v>
<v Speaker 1>things emerge.</v>

774
00:45:05.761 --> 00:45:08.790
<v Speaker 1>So if your computer crashes and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn to fix it,</v>

775
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:09.833
<v Speaker 1>then you've learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've extracted a whole bunch of </v>

776
00:45:11.701 --> 00:45:15.240
<v Speaker 1>information from what was otherwise just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a black box so to speak.</v>

777
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.240
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you more skillful and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes your understanding of the world,</v>

778
00:45:20.461 --> 00:45:23.550
<v Speaker 1>your detailed representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world more differentiated.</v>

779
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.420
<v Speaker 1>So chaos is the place that new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information comes out of.</v>

780
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly also why it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>

781
00:45:29.881 --> 00:45:33.780
<v Speaker 1>because the feminine is that from which </v>
<v Speaker 1>new things emerge.</v>

782
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And of course the orderly element is </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

783
00:45:37.831 --> 00:45:38.664
<v Speaker 1>at least in part because we tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceive of dominance hierarchies as </v>

784
00:45:41.641 --> 00:45:45.180
<v Speaker 1>something like a patriarchal structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they are something like that.</v>

785
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.570
<v Speaker 1>They're like that among human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also seem to be like that among</v>

786
00:45:48.571 --> 00:45:51.440
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although not so much with the barnacles.</v>

787
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.810
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's an interesting way of thinking</v>

788
00:45:54.811 --> 00:45:55.644
<v Speaker 1>about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the taoists would say those are </v>

789
00:45:57.511 --> 00:46:01.050
<v Speaker 1>universal elements of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where you are,</v>

790
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.660
<v Speaker 1>there's things you know and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't know.</v>

791
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.150
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the fundamental problem in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

792
00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:07.523
<v Speaker 1>How to deal with the things you know and</v>
<v Speaker 1>can predict and want and how to deal </v>

793
00:46:10.141 --> 00:46:13.140
<v Speaker 1>with the things that you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the Dallas would also say,</v>

794
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:15.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should walk the line between them.</v>

795
00:46:15.001 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the right place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>

796
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:18.151
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

797
00:46:18.151 --> 00:46:18.984
<v Speaker 1>very smart way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're only ever where you </v>

798
00:46:23.671 --> 00:46:27.360
<v Speaker 1>know what's going to happen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got two problems.</v>

799
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:28.403
<v Speaker 1>One is you're not learning anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of what you already know is </v>

800
00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:33.750
<v Speaker 1>already working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why bother changing it?</v>

801
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:39.350
<v Speaker 1>The second is worse because order tends </v>
<v Speaker 1>to deteriorate of its own accord,</v>

802
00:46:40.321 --> 00:46:41.154
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the world itself continues to </v>

803
00:46:42.361 --> 00:46:44.370
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just entropy will make a change.</v>

804
00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And so if all you do is stick yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the order,</v>

805
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 1>the order itself over time is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get less and less stable.</v>

806
00:46:51.271 --> 00:46:52.104
<v Speaker 1>And then at some point it's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be there at all and you'll fall right </v>

807
00:46:54.631 --> 00:46:55.470
<v Speaker 1>into chaos.</v>

808
00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:56.663
<v Speaker 1>So you can't just hide over where </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is predictable and where you </v>

809
00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:01.860
<v Speaker 1>get what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

810
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:04.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're in chaos all the time and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never know what's going on,</v>

811
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:05.903
<v Speaker 1>then you can't tolerate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically because the closer you </v>

812
00:47:09.781 --> 00:47:10.614
<v Speaker 1>are to serious chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more your body is preparing for the </v>

813
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:15.294
<v Speaker 1>worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because at the bottom of </v>

814
00:47:17.581 --> 00:47:20.070
<v Speaker 1>chaos is the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

815
00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 1>So you see in mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>

816
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:23.363
<v Speaker 1>chaos is the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in underworld there's hell and hell </v>

817
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:26.904
<v Speaker 1>is like the worst place in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you think about conceptions </v>

818
00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:32.080
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people say,</v>

819
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:33.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do those places exist?</v>

820
00:47:33.791 --> 00:47:34.624
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it depends on what you mean by </v>

821
00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:40.300
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the domain of chaos exist?</v>

822
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have been there as soon </v>

823
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.370
<v Speaker 1>as you know the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

824
00:47:45.371 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists.</v>

825
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.553
<v Speaker 1>I've been where chaos is Lourdes maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than I want to be and now and then </v>

826
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I've even been in that part of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's best described as hell.</v>

827
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.143
<v Speaker 1>So that's the sort of chaos that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>visit where everything you do makes it </v>

828
00:47:58.661 --> 00:48:00.130
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

829
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:00.964
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least some of you have been in that </v>

830
00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:05.830
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where things went wrong.</v>

831
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:06.843
<v Speaker 1>And then because of your own foolishness</v>
<v Speaker 1>or because of the malevolence of other </v>

832
00:48:09.371 --> 00:48:10.930
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

833
00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:12.483
<v Speaker 1>the situation develops so that it went </v>
<v Speaker 1>from bad to horrible with each success </v>

834
00:48:16.181 --> 00:48:18.970
<v Speaker 1>of decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a place that people can go.</v>

835
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.300
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very real place,</v>

836
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.810
<v Speaker 1>might be more real than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Dow is say,</v>

837
00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:28.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the chaos issue while you,</v>

838
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.790
<v Speaker 1>you just can't tolerate too much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

839
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:35.020
<v Speaker 1>What your body does when it doesn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on is basically prepare you</v>

840
00:48:35.021 --> 00:48:37.180
<v Speaker 1>for anything that might happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

841
00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:38.014
<v Speaker 1>and that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the generalized stress response </v>

842
00:48:39.791 --> 00:48:43.420
<v Speaker 1>and that's associated with massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>release of cortisol and that puts you on</v>

843
00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:46.210
<v Speaker 1>alert and that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're awake and ready,</v>

844
00:48:46.211 --> 00:48:48.910
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years of that,</v>

845
00:48:48.911 --> 00:48:49.744
<v Speaker 1>then you're old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body just cannot tolerate that </v>

846
00:48:52.841 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 1>level of energy expenditure on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant basis.</v>

847
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:59.710
<v Speaker 1>It wears you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you old fundamentally,</v>

848
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:04.040
<v Speaker 1>so bored or terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are sort of the,</v>

849
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:08.860
<v Speaker 1>the extremes of chaos in order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say if you're on the line down the</v>

850
00:49:08.861 --> 00:49:09.970
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then it's,</v>

851
00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you're secure enough so you're not</v>

852
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.990
<v Speaker 1>experiencing a level of negative emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's intolerable.</v>

853
00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:22.080
<v Speaker 1>A little apprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be a good thing.</v>

854
00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.273
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're preparing to meet </v>

855
00:49:24.181 --> 00:49:25.530
<v Speaker 1>someone that you're interested in.</v>

856
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:27.123
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

857
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:31.860
<v Speaker 1>is the apprehension a good part of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>or bad part?</v>

858
00:49:31.861 --> 00:49:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Like would you do without that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

859
00:49:33.961 --> 00:49:36.540
<v Speaker 1>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's like paralyzing you to the point</v>

860
00:49:36.541 --> 00:49:38.640
<v Speaker 1>where you can hardly even go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>with talking to them.</v>

861
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.780
<v Speaker 1>But if it's just part of expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of excitement,</v>

862
00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:44.183
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

863
00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:49.470
<v Speaker 1>when you're on that border between chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and order,</v>

864
00:49:49.471 --> 00:49:51.930
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be so orderly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're entirely comfortable.</v>

865
00:49:51.931 --> 00:49:54.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because you're asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then like,</v>

866
00:49:54.151 --> 00:49:57.180
<v Speaker 1>why the hell do you have to be awake if </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's going your way,</v>

867
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:58.583
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're driving home in your car </v>

868
00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:03.090
<v Speaker 1>and nothing is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of not even there.</v>

869
00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.073
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're thinking about things in </v>

870
00:50:04.921 --> 00:50:05.754
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're certainly not attending in </v>

871
00:50:07.051 --> 00:50:09.180
<v Speaker 1>any real deep sense to what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

872
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:11.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's because you don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

873
00:50:11.731 --> 00:50:14.040
<v Speaker 1>when you're a little apprehensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then your call,</v>

874
00:50:14.041 --> 00:50:15.270
<v Speaker 1>you're more conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

875
00:50:15.271 --> 00:50:16.104
<v Speaker 1>And then you're more engaged in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the positive emotions </v>

876
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:19.703
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is excitement and enthusiasm and </v>

877
00:50:22.411 --> 00:50:25.890
<v Speaker 1>curiosity and hope and all those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in some sense,</v>

878
00:50:25.891 --> 00:50:27.680
<v Speaker 1>all those things are worth living for.</v>

879
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.293
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that the taoists </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that you should walk the line </v>

880
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:32.324
<v Speaker 1>between chaos and order is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that place where the quality of your </v>

881
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 1>existence is high enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the problems that we discussed,</v>

882
00:50:40.581 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 1>the existential problems we discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>are no longer particularly relevant.</v>

883
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:47.150
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

884
00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:49.880
<v Speaker 1>well what's the meaning of life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I might say,</v>

885
00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:50.714
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really ask that question </v>

886
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:54.734
<v Speaker 1>linguistically cause there isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic answer just as the problem </v>

887
00:50:58.791 --> 00:51:00.680
<v Speaker 1>itself isn't linguistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

888
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Suffering is not the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suffering.</v>

889
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Suffering is something that you embody </v>
<v Speaker 1>and meaning is not the word,</v>

890
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:11.510
<v Speaker 1>meaning it's something that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

891
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.670
<v Speaker 1>And so the Dallas would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

892
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.250
<v Speaker 1>stand on the line between order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

893
00:51:16.251 --> 00:51:17.084
<v Speaker 1>You can tell when you're there because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're awake and alert and excited and </v>

894
00:51:20.091 --> 00:51:25.091
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic and deep into the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good place to be.</v>

895
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.300
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason that your nervous</v>
<v Speaker 1>system does that to you,</v>

896
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.313
<v Speaker 1>and this is an evolved issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that your brain wants you to be on </v>

897
00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:35.924
<v Speaker 1>the line between order and chaos because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where dynamic stability is best </v>

898
00:51:40.231 --> 00:51:41.120
<v Speaker 1>to tate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

899
00:51:41.121 --> 00:51:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Because your problem is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain yourself,</v>

900
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:45.853
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the problem is how do you maintain </v>

901
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:48.104
<v Speaker 1>yourself optimally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the problem is how do you </v>

902
00:51:50.211 --> 00:51:51.044
<v Speaker 1>maintain yourself optimally in a world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that continues to transform and answer </v>

903
00:51:55.491 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 1>to that isn't while you stand still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is you,</v>

904
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.193
<v Speaker 1>you transform yourself at the rate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps you in sync with the transforming </v>

905
00:52:05.991 --> 00:52:06.824
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since we're adapted to transforming </v>

906
00:52:10.281 --> 00:52:11.114
<v Speaker 1>environments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to assume that when </v>

907
00:52:13.641 --> 00:52:15.830
<v Speaker 1>you feel the best about what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

908
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:16.933
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to assume that that's </v>

909
00:52:18.861 --> 00:52:20.600
<v Speaker 1>not exactly where you should be.</v>

910
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:21.883
<v Speaker 1>Why else would you feel like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged and interested and not plagued </v>

911
00:52:26.391 --> 00:52:30.590
<v Speaker 1>by a surf bite of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential problems.</v>

912
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:31.783
<v Speaker 1>And so then meaning becomes something </v>
<v Speaker 1>you discover an attempt to inhabit </v>

913
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.980
<v Speaker 1>rather than some conceptual answer to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual problem.</v>

914
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:41.413
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the psychophysiological </v>

915
00:52:45.501 --> 00:52:48.860
<v Speaker 1>evidence for its validity is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

916
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:49.694
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about how the hypothalamus is </v>

917
00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:52.130
<v Speaker 1>constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

918
00:52:52.131 --> 00:52:53.810
<v Speaker 1>we know that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

919
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.673
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus is concerned with a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the basic things that you need to do </v>

920
00:52:57.921 --> 00:52:58.754
<v Speaker 1>to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's always throwing up these little </v>

921
00:53:00.141 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 1>motivated schemes through which you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to view the world,</v>

922
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:05.960
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to deal with those.</v>

923
00:53:05.961 --> 00:53:06.794
<v Speaker 1>But when you have dealt with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>it defaults to mild exploration and </v>

924
00:53:13.371 --> 00:53:14.204
<v Speaker 1>that's governed by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by pain and by fear and by disgust </v>

925
00:53:18.741 --> 00:53:22.040
<v Speaker 1>because you can't have your exploration </v>
<v Speaker 1>be entirely unbridled.</v>

926
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:27.490
<v Speaker 1>But the optimal state of existence looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something like,</v>

927
00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:29.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

928
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:34.930
<v Speaker 1>engaged interest with what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>without too much apprehension now,</v>

929
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.500
<v Speaker 1>not with the zero apprehension because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the apprehension also wakes you up a bit</v>

930
00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:43.190
<v Speaker 1>and that's the place where information </v>
<v Speaker 1>flow is maximized.</v>

931
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the place where you become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you currently are.</v>

932
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.713
<v Speaker 1>And that's the place where your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your description of the world becomes </v>

933
00:53:51.111 --> 00:53:53.660
<v Speaker 1>deeper and deeper than the one you </v>
<v Speaker 1>already have.</v>

934
00:53:53.661 --> 00:53:54.494
<v Speaker 1>So that's the place where you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have your cake and eat it too </v>

935
00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:57.883
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently secure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also engaged in a game that ensures </v>

936
00:54:00.891 --> 00:54:03.380
<v Speaker 1>that that security maintains itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>

937
00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:05.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

938
00:54:05.871 --> 00:54:06.704
<v Speaker 1>if your life is composed of order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos in a sense and an that's part of </v>

939
00:54:10.731 --> 00:54:14.150
<v Speaker 1>your fundamental existential problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to deal with chaos,</v>

940
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.850
<v Speaker 1>how to deal with too much order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>

941
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.400
<v Speaker 1>your nervous system already sets you up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that now.</v>

942
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:21.234
<v Speaker 1>And that's associated with some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper ideas that have been put forward </v>

943
00:54:24.421 --> 00:54:25.254
<v Speaker 1>by people like young and then to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lesser degree by people like Rogers and </v>

944
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.333
<v Speaker 1>Maslow who believed in something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>human potential or human self </v>

945
00:54:32.431 --> 00:54:33.264
<v Speaker 1>actualization and unions idea was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper idea that matt was that when </v>

946
00:54:39.421 --> 00:54:44.421
<v Speaker 1>you're operating on the border between </v>
<v Speaker 1>order and chaos and you're interested in</v>

947
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:47.160
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where,</v>

948
00:54:47.161 --> 00:54:50.580
<v Speaker 1>that's when you're where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you're there,</v>

949
00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:52.620
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're captivated by it.</v>

950
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:56.070
<v Speaker 1>You would then say if you try to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

951
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:56.933
<v Speaker 1>which means you follow that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will take you to all the places that </v>

952
00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:02.820
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll take you to all the places in your</v>

953
00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:05.220
<v Speaker 1>past that you haven't made complete use </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

954
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:06.383
<v Speaker 1>and it'll take you to all those places </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're avoiding in the future and </v>

955
00:55:08.851 --> 00:55:09.684
<v Speaker 1>the present.</v>

956
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:10.613
<v Speaker 1>That's what that mechanism is for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it will do that is </v>

957
00:55:13.471 --> 00:55:14.304
<v Speaker 1>because with all those experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had in the past that you've </v>

958
00:55:17.491 --> 00:55:20.550
<v Speaker 1>avoided or you haven't made thorough use</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

959
00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:24.450
<v Speaker 1>there's still sort of latent world left </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

960
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:25.763
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this with people in their </v>

961
00:55:28.021 --> 00:55:28.854
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like say say a woman is going out </v>

962
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:31.494
<v Speaker 1>with an abusive guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She finally dropped some and it's like </v>

963
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:35.310
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next relationship.</v>

964
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's another abusive guy.</v>

965
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And then she drops him and then the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship it's like,</v>

966
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:43.590
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's another abusive guy.</v>

967
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.260
<v Speaker 1>And Freud called that the repetition </v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsion.</v>

968
00:55:46.261 --> 00:55:48.150
<v Speaker 1>But you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

969
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:54.140
<v Speaker 1>what is missing in her world view that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it such that when she acts,</v>

970
00:55:55.701 --> 00:55:58.080
<v Speaker 1>she keeps running into the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle.</v>

971
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like her map isn't correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>

972
00:56:01.531 --> 00:56:02.364
<v Speaker 1>well if she went back to the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and really dug around in </v>

973
00:56:05.671 --> 00:56:06.504
<v Speaker 1>the carcass so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she might find out what the hell she's </v>

974
00:56:10.111 --> 00:56:10.830
<v Speaker 1>missing.</v>

975
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 1>One thing might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

976
00:56:12.481 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 1>when exactly do you say no and how do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say it?</v>

977
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:18.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because abuse for example usually starts</v>

978
00:56:18.271 --> 00:56:19.104
<v Speaker 1>out like it rarely starts out that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person is calm and then you end up </v>

979
00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:23.643
<v Speaker 1>pounded flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the person who's prone to </v>

980
00:56:26.651 --> 00:56:27.484
<v Speaker 1>abuse as disagreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll push you and then what </v>

981
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:31.804
<v Speaker 1>happens next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how you respond and if you </v>

982
00:56:34.121 --> 00:56:38.200
<v Speaker 1>step back and you step back and you step</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and you keep doing that,</v>

983
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.273
<v Speaker 1>the probability that the aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person can't control the aggression </v>

984
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they're not well socialized unless</v>

985
00:56:44.561 --> 00:56:46.370
<v Speaker 1>you put a limit on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

986
00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:47.453
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to chase you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get bigger and bigger as </v>

987
00:56:49.271 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you step backwards and like very many </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are like that in life.</v>

988
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:53.913
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you have to make enough use of </v>

989
00:56:56.921 --> 00:56:57.754
<v Speaker 1>what's around you of what you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>explored to repair yourself in some </v>

990
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:02.824
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or to flesh yourself out so that you're </v>

991
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:08.500
<v Speaker 1>capable of saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to happen in a way that</v>

992
00:57:08.501 --> 00:57:11.920
<v Speaker 1>actually increases the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen.</v>

993
00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm certainly not saying that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

994
00:57:13.961 --> 00:57:14.794
<v Speaker 1>everybody's in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an abusive relationship deserves to </v>

995
00:57:17.321 --> 00:57:18.154
<v Speaker 1>be in what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very specific set of circumstances </v>

996
00:57:21.101 --> 00:57:25.630
<v Speaker 1>where the same damn thing happens over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over because then you have to ask,</v>

997
00:57:25.631 --> 00:57:26.464
<v Speaker 1>well is this random or is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>something going on that increases the </v>

998
00:57:31.391 --> 00:57:33.070
<v Speaker 1>probability of that outcome.</v>

999
00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.053
<v Speaker 1>Now he owns ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are very strange ideas cause they </v>

1000
00:57:37.951 --> 00:57:41.610
<v Speaker 1>take you deep into mythology and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can look back at that a little.</v>

1001
00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:42.563
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:55.460
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea,</v>

1003
00:57:55.461 --> 00:57:56.294
<v Speaker 1>well you've got this little framework </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to look at the world </v>

1004
00:57:58.011 --> 00:57:58.844
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tells you approximately where you </v>

1005
00:58:00.321 --> 00:58:01.550
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately,</v>

1006
00:58:01.551 --> 00:58:04.790
<v Speaker 1>where you need to go and approximately </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should do to get there.</v>

1007
00:58:04.791 --> 00:58:06.830
<v Speaker 1>But it can be wrong in any level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

1008
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:07.851
<v Speaker 1>So then you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1009
00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:10.580
<v Speaker 1>what produces those little worlds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what answers?</v>

1010
00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:13.400
<v Speaker 1>One answer is basic biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity,</v>

1011
00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:17.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the basic motivational systems,</v>

1012
00:58:17.271 --> 00:58:18.104
<v Speaker 1>emotional systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lines are blurry partly to keep you </v>

1013
00:58:21.201 --> 00:58:22.160
<v Speaker 1>on track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1014
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:23.870
<v Speaker 1>You're hungry when your blood sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>falls,</v>

1015
00:58:23.871 --> 00:58:27.500
<v Speaker 1>you're thirsty when you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're not sufficiently hydrated.</v>

1016
00:58:27.501 --> 00:58:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you're sleepy when you've gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>without sleep for too long,</v>

1017
00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.030
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

1018
00:58:32.031 --> 00:58:32.864
<v Speaker 1>And there that those things have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems for so long that in some sense </v>

1019
00:58:36.291 --> 00:58:38.150
<v Speaker 1>you have machinery that takes care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1020
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

1021
00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:42.403
<v Speaker 1>that's model there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started roughly broke the fundamental </v>

1022
00:58:45.291 --> 00:58:46.124
<v Speaker 1>motivations into those that keep you </v>
<v Speaker 1>going and those that help you propagate </v>

1023
00:58:49.521 --> 00:58:50.354
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the two Darwinian problems </v>

1024
00:58:53.931 --> 00:58:56.660
<v Speaker 1>that you have to solve in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you might think,</v>

1025
00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:58.213
<v Speaker 1>this seems to me to be how you can start</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about how the traits might be </v>

1026
00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:06.740
<v Speaker 1>organized into this narrative scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the traits seemed to me,</v>

1027
00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:10.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a hundred now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's 30</v>

1028
00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:13.443
<v Speaker 1>motivational states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them are pure motivational </v>

1029
00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:16.384
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe in some of them are just </v>

1030
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:18.003
<v Speaker 1>combinations of motivational states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're like the basic elements of </v>

1031
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.720
<v Speaker 1>motivation and then maybe they clump </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in five different ways.</v>

1032
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:30.410
<v Speaker 1>And out of that we get the five traits </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the five traits are like,</v>

1033
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:34.880
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of like the preconditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your particular story.</v>

1034
00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.013
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a conscientious person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the world is a little less orderly </v>

1035
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:41.360
<v Speaker 1>and little less well put together then </v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be.</v>

1036
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And your story is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the person who goes in there and fix</v>

1037
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:47.600
<v Speaker 1>that up and makes it orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1038
00:59:47.601 --> 00:59:50.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're an extroverted person then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1039
00:59:50.211 --> 00:59:51.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1040
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:56.180
<v Speaker 1>there's all that social territory out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to occupy and exploit and,</v>

1041
00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:57.253
<v Speaker 1>and I'm the sort of person that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really going to do that because that's </v>

1042
00:59:59.301 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 1>where your interests lie.</v>

1043
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.390
<v Speaker 1>And if you're an open person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1044
01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:03.403
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all these weird things that I </v>

1045
01:00:04.971 --> 01:00:07.760
<v Speaker 1>can do and think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the world for you.</v>

1046
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:08.833
<v Speaker 1>And those are all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of those as a set of five </v>

1047
01:00:12.831 --> 01:00:17.831
<v Speaker 1>stories in some sense that have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable probability of success.</v>

1048
01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:19.813
<v Speaker 1>So there are five modes of being and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're composed of these more </v>

1049
01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>fragmented fundamental motivations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1050
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:26.924
<v Speaker 1>It's so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of where you can start to </v>

1051
01:00:28.731 --> 01:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>see the concordance between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative theories of the clinicians and</v>

1052
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:33.044
<v Speaker 1>the trait theories of the empiricists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there has been work done on this </v>

1053
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know,</v>

1054
01:00:36.561 --> 01:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1055
01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:40.423
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob Hersch did some of this work that </v>

1056
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:47.650
<v Speaker 1>your trade temperament does influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>the words that you use to describe your,</v>

1057
01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.533
<v Speaker 1>your spontaneous self narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I say write about your past and </v>

1058
01:00:54.621 --> 01:00:55.454
<v Speaker 1>then I analyze your word use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make an educated guess about </v>

1059
01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:59.054
<v Speaker 1>whether you're extroverted or </v>
<v Speaker 1>introverted or conscientious or open or </v>

1060
01:01:01.761 --> 01:01:02.594
<v Speaker 1>agreeable.</v>

1061
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Dan Mcadams has showed that,</v>

1062
01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:06.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how the big five clump into </v>

1063
01:01:08.421 --> 01:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>plasticity and stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1064
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:11.563
<v Speaker 1>the plastic people produce more </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory narratives and the stable </v>

1065
01:01:15.621 --> 01:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>people produce narratives that are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with,</v>

1066
01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>security in order.</v>

1067
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.013
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there hasn't been a lot of work done </v>

1068
01:01:23.151 --> 01:01:25.010
<v Speaker 1>at the interface between traits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives,</v>

1069
01:01:25.011 --> 01:01:25.844
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sort of pushing the limits of </v>

1070
01:01:27.441 --> 01:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>knowledge here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1071
01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:29.443
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's the direction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the integration will likely take </v>

1072
01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:33.560
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1073
01:01:33.561 --> 01:01:37.220
<v Speaker 1>And then we talked a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how emotion might work too.</v>

1074
01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:38.300
<v Speaker 1>And so we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1075
01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:39.373
<v Speaker 1>you're in this little motivated state so</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tells you something about where you </v>

1076
01:01:42.861 --> 01:01:43.694
<v Speaker 1>are and what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it gives you some hints about where </v>

1077
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:46.873
<v Speaker 1>you might go with that and a disinhibit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the relevant behaviors that would be </v>

1078
01:01:50.901 --> 01:01:53.750
<v Speaker 1>associated with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including perceptual behaviors.</v>

1079
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>And then you walk forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what happens?</v>

1080
01:01:57.770 --> 01:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Well two things roughly can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things you want,</v>

1081
01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:02.443
<v Speaker 1>which indicates a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're moving towards the goal and </v>

1082
01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:06.530
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your plan is good,</v>

1083
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.393
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It indicates both and that that's </v>

1084
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:10.820
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1085
01:02:10.821 --> 01:02:11.654
<v Speaker 1>That's incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's dopaminergic be mediated and you </v>

1086
01:02:15.021 --> 01:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>like that as long as it's not too </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense.</v>

1087
01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>And then the next that can happen is</v>

1088
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1089
01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be divided into two,</v>

1090
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>there are things you don't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1091
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:29.993
<v Speaker 1>And some of those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's just an obstacle in your </v>

1092
01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>way and with a minor deviation in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trajectory,</v>

1093
01:02:36.331 --> 01:02:37.164
<v Speaker 1>you can walk around it and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other is something you completely don't </v>

1094
01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>understand how it was and it just knocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom out of your stupid plant.</v>

1095
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>And then it also might knock the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of all sorts of other plans as well,</v>

1096
01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:50.514
<v Speaker 1>depending on how unexpected it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me to be where the </v>

1097
01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>transition from order to chaos occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>

1098
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.193
<v Speaker 1>we use a relationship example again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go home to invite your girlfriend </v>

1099
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:08.730
<v Speaker 1>out to have dinner and you find out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's in bed with someone else.</v>

1100
01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:09.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1101
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.290
<v Speaker 1>dinner's off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1102
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.400
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1103
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:16.260
<v Speaker 1>But that's not all that's off.</v>

1104
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think,</v>

1105
01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:18.654
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a lot of things all of a </v>

1106
01:03:20.101 --> 01:03:23.310
<v Speaker 1>sudden that are off because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>much bigger catastrophe.</v>

1107
01:03:23.311 --> 01:03:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Then if she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1108
01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.134
<v Speaker 1>I already made dinner and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're a little irritated because </v>

1109
01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:29.910
<v Speaker 1>you can't take her out now and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1110
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.650
<v Speaker 1>and you have to eat something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1111
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not such a catastrophe.</v>

1112
01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:34.763
<v Speaker 1>But it's not easy to figure out exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>why those catastrophes differ because </v>

1113
01:03:40.831 --> 01:03:43.620
<v Speaker 1>they're both unexpected things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have to think,</v>

1114
01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:44.454
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them disrupt seems to disrupt a </v>

1115
01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>lot more than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to think,</v>

1116
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupt what?</v>

1117
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.550
<v Speaker 1>And then that's why I talked to you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this is because I,</v>

1118
01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:56.453
<v Speaker 1>and this is p a jetty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense I think this is the </v>

1119
01:03:58.561 --> 01:04:01.410
<v Speaker 1>way to understand why you get upset when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get upset.</v>

1120
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:02.071
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1121
01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:03.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1122
01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:06.930
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to take your girlfriend out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for dinner and you know how to do that.</v>

1123
01:04:06.931 --> 01:04:09.390
<v Speaker 1>You'd go into the elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take the elevator down,</v>

1124
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:10.740
<v Speaker 1>you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay,</v>

1125
01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:11.603
<v Speaker 1>you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's behaviorally plotted out quite </v>

1126
01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:13.644
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a bunch of behaviors at </v>

1127
01:04:15.241 --> 01:04:16.470
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the,</v>

1128
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1129
01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.253
<v Speaker 1>the label go out for dinner and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little thing down at the bottom and it </v>

1130
01:04:22.351 --> 01:04:23.184
<v Speaker 1>gets disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're sort of upset in </v>

1131
01:04:24.571 --> 01:04:29.571
<v Speaker 1>proportion to that little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory that's been bent a stray.</v>

1132
01:04:30.061 --> 01:04:34.320
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if you're not too emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>unstable or neurotic,</v>

1133
01:04:34.321 --> 01:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a pretty seamless transition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1134
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're say emotionally stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and extroverted,</v>

1135
01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:41.910
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh good,</v>

1136
01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:43.140
<v Speaker 1>something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1137
01:04:43.141 --> 01:04:43.974
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and both of those responses are </v>

1138
01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1139
01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:50.580
<v Speaker 1>but when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1140
01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>your partner is in bed with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

1141
01:04:52.261 --> 01:04:53.094
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of more like at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is well your say your conception </v>

1142
01:04:59.071 --> 01:05:01.110
<v Speaker 1>of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of your life for the overall</v>

1143
01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:02.430
<v Speaker 1>quality of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethan.</v>

1144
01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And when something major happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1145
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:06.683
<v Speaker 1>it blows apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially blows apart your entire </v>

1146
01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:13.530
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly your conceptual structure.</v>

1147
01:05:13.531 --> 01:05:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1148
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>what the hell did you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how stupid could you possibly be?</v>

1149
01:05:18.431 --> 01:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>And that tells you exactly how stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be.</v>

1150
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>But then you start to wonder about why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened to you.</v>

1151
01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And partly that's because you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least that's what you think.</v>

1152
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:28.503
<v Speaker 1>But then it's also because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe there's a whole bunch of </v>

1153
01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>skills that you don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1154
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were a better person,</v>

1155
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>if you were more interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you went,</v>

1156
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.620
<v Speaker 1>you know more places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were more caring,</v>

1157
01:05:38.621 --> 01:05:41.680
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't quite as selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were more conscientious,</v>

1158
01:05:41.681 --> 01:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then you start to think,</v>

1159
01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I lack?</v>

1160
01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not only what have I missed </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived,</v>

1161
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:51.400
<v Speaker 1>it's what do I lack?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you get hit at a high level,</v>

1162
01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:52.323
<v Speaker 1>like your partner be tracy you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're infinitely stupid and </v>

1163
01:05:55.061 --> 01:05:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you're infinitely worthless and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

1164
01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:02.410
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're in chaos and well </v>
<v Speaker 1>what then do you do?</v>

1165
01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:03.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best answer to that is you avoid it </v>

1166
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:07.143
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take the steps along the way that </v>

1167
01:06:08.981 --> 01:06:11.890
<v Speaker 1>decrease the probability that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever going to end up there.</v>

1168
01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.053
<v Speaker 1>And that's</v>

1169
01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.380
<v Speaker 1>in some sense that's what that means.</v>

1170
01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:23.880
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at this conceptualization,</v>

1171
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:25.583
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of see you're moving from </v>
<v Speaker 1>point a to point b and then the </v>

1172
01:06:30.001 --> 01:06:33.150
<v Speaker 1>unpredicted outcome is like a hole in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your plan.</v>

1173
01:06:33.151 --> 01:06:36.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not supposed to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you had a good plan,</v>

1174
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.900
<v Speaker 1>something you didn't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened wouldn't have happened.</v>

1175
01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.093
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like a hole in your plan and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you fall through the hole and you </v>

1176
01:06:43.831 --> 01:06:47.820
<v Speaker 1>find out how big the hole is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's a hole that just ate that</v>

1177
01:06:47.821 --> 01:06:48.930
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so who cares?</v>

1178
01:06:48.931 --> 01:06:49.764
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's the kind of hold it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps growing until all of you falls </v>

1179
01:06:53.671 --> 01:06:55.230
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1180
01:06:55.231 --> 01:06:56.064
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1181
01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.380
<v Speaker 1>how do you deal with that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility?</v>

1182
01:06:59.381 --> 01:07:00.214
<v Speaker 1>Especially given that you have limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and so that's what this means </v>

1183
01:07:06.461 --> 01:07:09.790
<v Speaker 1>and this is the same thing basically as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the taoists representation.</v>

1184
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Because the dow representation Dow also </v>
<v Speaker 1>means meaning,</v>

1185
01:07:13.361 --> 01:07:14.194
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so being on that line between chaos </v>

1186
01:07:15.641 --> 01:07:19.960
<v Speaker 1>and order is meaningful and the taoists </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that you should be where things</v>

1187
01:07:19.961 --> 01:07:22.840
<v Speaker 1>are meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the right place to be.</v>

1188
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.040
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1189
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:25.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a good place to be if you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

1190
01:07:25.931 --> 01:07:27.730
<v Speaker 1>about you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own experiences.</v>

1191
01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:30.850
<v Speaker 1>When you're doing something meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you don't even think about it,</v>

1192
01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.570
<v Speaker 1>it's just this is a good place to be and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can notice it.</v>

1193
01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can notice it and continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it more.</v>

1194
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:38.374
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the existentialists </v>
<v Speaker 1>would call striving for an authentic </v>

1195
01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:42.244
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you can think about that </v>

1196
01:07:43.721 --> 01:07:45.370
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's philosophy.</v>

1197
01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:45.881
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1198
01:07:45.881 --> 01:07:46.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1199
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:47.554
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1200
01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:48.940
<v Speaker 1>don't be thinking that.</v>

1201
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.393
<v Speaker 1>It's advice about how to structure your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life so that it's quality is sufficient </v>

1202
01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:57.670
<v Speaker 1>so that you don't become resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of hate.</v>

1203
01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not casual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1204
01:08:00.251 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 1>here's some philosophical ideas to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1205
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got a take this seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't,</v>

1206
01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:07.863
<v Speaker 1>not only do you not have a good time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just aren't paying any </v>

1207
01:08:11.531 --> 01:08:12.364
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll also turn into the sort of </v>

1208
01:08:13.961 --> 01:08:14.794
<v Speaker 1>person who's highly motivated to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that no one else ever has a good </v>

1209
01:08:17.391 --> 01:08:18.224
<v Speaker 1>time as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you go from just kind of being </v>

1210
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:24.830
<v Speaker 1>useless and miserable on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that becomes sufficient,</v>

1211
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful and meaningless and painful,</v>

1212
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:28.813
<v Speaker 1>then you're undoubtedly going to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to dream about taking it out on all the </v>

1213
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:36.500
<v Speaker 1>other people whose fault it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're unfulfilled and miserable.</v>

1214
01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:37.663
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't stay in that meaningful </v>

1215
01:08:40.101 --> 01:08:40.934
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1216
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.700
<v Speaker 1>So to speak so that your life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable to you.</v>

1217
01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.400
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that you're the only one</v>
<v Speaker 1>who will suffer.</v>

1218
01:08:46.650 --> 01:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>It's you're just the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

1219
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Now with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a great,</v>

1220
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:53.080
<v Speaker 1>this is a great image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really old.</v>

1221
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:56.060
<v Speaker 1>You know the oldest story we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called the Enuma elish.</v>

1222
01:08:56.061 --> 01:08:56.894
<v Speaker 1>I told you a little bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sumerian creation myth is the myth </v>

1223
01:08:59.571 --> 01:09:00.404
<v Speaker 1>about a hero basically going out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquer some vaguely reptilian dragon </v>

1224
01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:10.280
<v Speaker 1>ish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos beast.</v>

1225
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:13.550
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>

1226
01:09:13.551 --> 01:09:14.384
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really the story of humanity </v>

1227
01:09:16.161 --> 01:09:20.360
<v Speaker 1>there and the story of humanity is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look on the,</v>

1228
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.560
<v Speaker 1>on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1229
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:25.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole that your plans,</v>

1230
01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:29.720
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole that you fall into when</v>
<v Speaker 1>your plans don't work.</v>

1231
01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:33.530
<v Speaker 1>So that hole is always there and at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the hole is something terrible</v>

1232
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:34.910
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the dragon is.</v>

1233
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:37.790
<v Speaker 1>And then the little castle at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>

1234
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:39.620
<v Speaker 1>well that's order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you live.</v>

1235
01:09:39.621 --> 01:09:40.454
<v Speaker 1>And this thing that crawls out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole to face you is always threatening </v>

1236
01:09:44.271 --> 01:09:47.360
<v Speaker 1>order and answer is well then what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do about it.</v>

1237
01:09:47.361 --> 01:09:49.850
<v Speaker 1>And one answer is man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get those walls up,</v>

1238
01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:53.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>800 stories tall and 500 feet thick.</v>

1239
01:09:53.091 --> 01:09:53.924
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you can't get out of a castle </v>

1240
01:09:55.581 --> 01:09:58.610
<v Speaker 1>that's that thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's not so good.</v>

1241
01:09:59.000 --> 01:09:59.833
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is just to throw </v>

1242
01:10:00.681 --> 01:10:01.514
<v Speaker 1>your hands up in despair and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what the hell is the use of having </v>

1243
01:10:04.011 --> 01:10:06.770
<v Speaker 1>a castle anyways if there's just going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be dragons around it.</v>

1244
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.173
<v Speaker 1>And then the other one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe we should take care of it </v>

1245
01:10:10.401 --> 01:10:14.030
<v Speaker 1>when it's relatively small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1246
01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:15.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in a relationship,</v>

1247
01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:19.100
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want it to fall down a pet,</v>

1248
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.670
<v Speaker 1>then you have to notice when the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragons are popping up.</v>

1249
01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.753
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are things that disturb your </v>

1250
01:10:25.551 --> 01:10:27.800
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium that produced some negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

1251
01:10:27.801 --> 01:10:31.040
<v Speaker 1>But that also sort of call out to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't acceptable.</v>

1252
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I should do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the most important ones to not avoid</v>

1253
01:10:34.851 --> 01:10:38.900
<v Speaker 1>are the ones that call out to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't good.</v>

1254
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I should do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what to do and I could do it.</v>

1255
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:45.343
<v Speaker 1>And if you step back from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then all that'll happen is those </v>

1256
01:10:47.901 --> 01:10:48.734
<v Speaker 1>things will multiply and multiply and </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiply and multiply until they're so </v>

1257
01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:56.390
<v Speaker 1>big that you're no match for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

1258
01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.610
<v Speaker 1>You'll trip over it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall down that hole.</v>

1259
01:10:58.611 --> 01:11:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a bad outcome.</v>

1260
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:03.403
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of the moral obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say that the existentialists lay on </v>

1261
01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:10.220
<v Speaker 1>people in the unions as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like wake up,</v>

1262
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.530
<v Speaker 1>pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1263
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:13.364
<v Speaker 1>if things going the way that you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to then do what you can as fast as </v>

1264
01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:20.880
<v Speaker 1>you can to stay something about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it,</v>

1265
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 1>fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>

1266
01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Do the things you can to repair the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things around you that are producing low</v>

1267
01:11:26.731 --> 01:11:29.400
<v Speaker 1>quality experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens?</v>

1268
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get tougher,</v>

1269
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:33.503
<v Speaker 1>and the reason you get tougher is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're engaged in all these </v>

1270
01:11:35.251 --> 01:11:36.084
<v Speaker 1>little micro battles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the more you engage in those micro </v>

1271
01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>battles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better you get at battling.</v>

1272
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>And so then you become someone who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say no when you have to say no,</v>

1273
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.630
<v Speaker 1>and that's a really useful thing to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to say.</v>

1274
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Then also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you're doing is that,</v>

1275
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.693
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything around you is trying to turn </v>

1276
01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:57.810
<v Speaker 1>into chaos and the chaos is popping up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just like,</v>

1277
01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:01.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like whackable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that foolish arcade game parks,</v>

1278
01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.410
<v Speaker 1>the little weasel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you hit it with the stick.</v>

1279
01:12:04.411 --> 01:12:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1280
01:12:05.311 --> 01:12:08.670
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little problems pop up.</v>

1281
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Fix them as soon as they pop up because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can't grow.</v>

1282
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they still will,</v>

1283
01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:16.434
<v Speaker 1>but at least you'll have the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that they won't grow </v>

1284
01:12:18.961 --> 01:12:20.010
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily.</v>

1285
01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.003
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1286
01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.790
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I've derived from what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've</v>

1287
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.550
<v Speaker 1>taught to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

1288
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

1289
01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.030
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental problems of life are </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential.</v>

1290
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:37.223
<v Speaker 1>It's what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The solutions to those problems are not </v>

1291
01:12:41.251 --> 01:12:45.030
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wisdom traditions of mankind and the</v>

1292
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:49.470
<v Speaker 1>profound psychological theories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've collected over the last 200 years.</v>

1293
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.540
<v Speaker 1>They converge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1294
01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:52.374
<v Speaker 1>one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they say is get your </v>

1295
01:12:53.581 --> 01:12:54.414
<v Speaker 1>story straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And other thing they say is if you're </v>

1296
01:12:57.721 --> 01:13:01.650
<v Speaker 1>avoiding something that you need to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to get to where you're going,</v>

1297
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.730
<v Speaker 1>quit avoiding it because the avoidance </v>
<v Speaker 1>will cause you trouble.</v>

1298
01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:06.564
<v Speaker 1>It'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll weaken you and it'll make the </v>

1299
01:13:07.771 --> 01:13:10.580
<v Speaker 1>world into a more terrible place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

1300
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:14.340
<v Speaker 1>the broader sociological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological studies,</v>

1301
01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:16.820
<v Speaker 1>like the ones that were done by people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like soldier Hanson,</v>

1302
01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:17.693
<v Speaker 1>who as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't generally utilized in a </v>

1303
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:22.950
<v Speaker 1>personality class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's sort of like a metta,</v>

1304
01:13:22.951 --> 01:13:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Viktor Frankl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viktor Frankl,</v>

1305
01:13:24.631 --> 01:13:26.290
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1306
01:13:26.291 --> 01:13:27.360
<v Speaker 1>a soldier and instant lays out.</v>

1307
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Another problem with all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1308
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:32.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do this,</v>

1309
01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:36.300
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get your story straight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't stop avoiding,</v>

1310
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.100
<v Speaker 1>well then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1311
01:13:38.101 --> 01:13:38.934
<v Speaker 1>what's the consequence in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences while you're a miserable </v>

1312
01:13:41.281 --> 01:13:42.114
<v Speaker 1>thing with a very low quality life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're just going to be tortured </v>

1313
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:49.410
<v Speaker 1>by existence and it's perfectly capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of torturing you beyond your endurance.</v>

1314
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:53.430
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of sucks for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the next step beyond that is why you</v>

1315
01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:54.264
<v Speaker 1>become the sort of person who isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really all that positively predisposed </v>

1316
01:13:57.301 --> 01:14:00.810
<v Speaker 1>to existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you're that sort of person than</v>

1317
01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:01.644
<v Speaker 1>anybody who comes along to offer you the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to live inside something </v>

1318
01:14:04.861 --> 01:14:08.130
<v Speaker 1>rigid and hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who comes near,</v>

1319
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:12.640
<v Speaker 1>you're going to jump on that partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're afraid and they offer you</v>

1320
01:14:12.641 --> 01:14:13.474
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly because you're resentful and </v>

1321
01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:16.540
<v Speaker 1>bitter and full of hatred.</v>

1322
01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.373
<v Speaker 1>And so you're just waiting for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody opportunity to take that out on </v>

1323
01:14:20.351 --> 01:14:21.184
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you can act morally and </v>

1324
01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:24.790
<v Speaker 1>superior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1325
01:14:24.791 --> 01:14:26.230
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1326
01:14:26.231 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1327
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:29.530
<v Speaker 1>that's basically what Hitler offered the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans.</v>

1328
01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:32.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically what Stalin offered</v>
<v Speaker 1>the communists.</v>

1329
01:14:32.891 --> 01:14:33.724
<v Speaker 1>It was an inversion of the order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anybody who is pathologically </v>

1330
01:14:36.521 --> 01:14:40.780
<v Speaker 1>resentful had the opportunity to be just</v>
<v Speaker 1>as murderous as they wanted to be.</v>

1331
01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:43.300
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1332
01:14:43.301 --> 01:14:48.070
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century put towards this a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole variety of problems.</v>

1333
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:50.050
<v Speaker 1>One problem was the problem of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1334
01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:50.913
<v Speaker 1>Nicha sort of announced that at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 19th century and then the 20th </v>

1335
01:14:54.221 --> 01:14:55.420
<v Speaker 1>century was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1336
01:14:55.421 --> 01:14:56.254
<v Speaker 1>what do we do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it was nihilistic and lot </v>

1337
01:14:58.691 --> 01:14:59.524
<v Speaker 1>of it was totalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And both of those seem to be not so </v>

1338
01:15:02.171 --> 01:15:03.280
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1339
01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:04.270
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for me,</v>

1340
01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:06.940
<v Speaker 1>especially in the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denialism hasn't ended.</v>

1341
01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:10.060
<v Speaker 1>It's still infested most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities.</v>

1342
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:15.750
<v Speaker 1>But the nihilism in the totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not the only opportunities.</v>

1343
01:15:16.361 --> 01:15:19.360
<v Speaker 1>They're not the only options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1344
01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:20.194
<v Speaker 1>it is possible for people to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to their lives in such a way </v>

1345
01:15:23.891 --> 01:15:27.190
<v Speaker 1>that they straightened out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you straighten out,</v>

1346
01:15:27.191 --> 01:15:30.610
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd get tough and you get useful.</v>

1347
01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.640
<v Speaker 1>And if you're tough and useful than life</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't so horrible,</v>

1348
01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:35.050
<v Speaker 1>or if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it is,</v>

1349
01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:36.640
<v Speaker 1>you can hack it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1350
01:15:36.641 --> 01:15:39.300
<v Speaker 1>because make in life not horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

1351
01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:44.320
<v Speaker 1>You'll have limited success with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but making yourself tough enough so that</v>

1352
01:15:44.321 --> 01:15:47.230
<v Speaker 1>won't corrupt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a possibility.</v>

1353
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.050
<v Speaker 1>And then the upside to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1354
01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:52.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be a totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

1355
01:15:52.901 --> 01:15:53.734
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be nihilistic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be like a primary </v>

1356
01:15:55.901 --> 01:15:59.110
<v Speaker 1>danger to the structure of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>unit around you.</v>

1357
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.990
<v Speaker 1>And who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's even better than that.</v>

1358
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:04.690
<v Speaker 1>You'll be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be good.</v>

1359
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.360
<v Speaker 1>You be good for your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be good.</v>

1360
01:16:07.361 --> 01:16:10.330
<v Speaker 1>You'd be good for your community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>

1361
01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:13.360
<v Speaker 1>That's an equivalent rated state from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] perspective,</v>

1362
01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:15.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're living so it works for you.</v>

1363
01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:18.100
<v Speaker 1>It works for your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>works for your community.</v>

1364
01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.070
<v Speaker 1>God only knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it even works for the planet.</v>

1365
01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:22.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the hope.</v>

1366
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good thing to aim at.</v>

1367
01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:30.480
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing to think about in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that regard is life is hard enough.</v>

1368
01:16:31.151 --> 01:16:35.680
<v Speaker 1>So you need an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need an adventure to justify it.</v>

1369
01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Like it has to be worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1370
01:16:37.901 --> 01:16:41.290
<v Speaker 1>and one adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one real adventure is see if you can get</v>

1371
01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:43.660
<v Speaker 1>your act together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hard.</v>

1372
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.673
<v Speaker 1>And it's an adventure and it's partly an</v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure because if you make that your </v>

1373
01:16:47.381 --> 01:16:49.000
<v Speaker 1>primary goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1374
01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.500
<v Speaker 1>do not avoid things to tell the truth to</v>
<v Speaker 1>aim at the highest value,</v>

1375
01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.530
<v Speaker 1>things start to happen to you.</v>

1376
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:59.110
<v Speaker 1>They're not things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulating the world to get.</v>

1377
01:16:59.111 --> 01:17:02.710
<v Speaker 1>There just doors that start to open and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

1378
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:06.160
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how many doors will open </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you if you do that.</v>

1379
01:17:06.161 --> 01:17:08.770
<v Speaker 1>And that makes things extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1380
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:11.330
<v Speaker 1>And once things are extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

1381
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:15.860
<v Speaker 1>the fact that life has its limitations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it's full of suffering,</v>

1382
01:17:15.861 --> 01:17:16.401
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1383
01:17:16.401 --> 01:17:18.740
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things considered,</v>

1384
01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not such a bad bargain one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to close,</v>

1385
01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:27.320
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might ask yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if you're in a situation,</v>

1386
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:33.550
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a situation where</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life isn't of a sufficient quality,</v>

1387
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.943
<v Speaker 1>then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you doing absolutely everything you </v>

1388
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:43.010
<v Speaker 1>can to fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

1389
01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:43.844
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not draw any final conclusions </v>

1390
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:50.000
<v Speaker 1>about the utility of existence and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>value until we're sure we've got our act</v>

1391
01:17:50.001 --> 01:17:53.540
<v Speaker 1>together and are seeing things straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's worth pursuing.</v>

1392
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:55.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what you should be learning in </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

1393
01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:57.620
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's the,</v>

1394
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:58.663
<v Speaker 1>that's the proper path of a citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the proper path of someone who's </v>

1395
01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:06.230
<v Speaker 1>attempting to put the world's straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the best thing you can do.</v>

1396
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:09.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's not only because it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because</v>

1397
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:14.450
<v Speaker 1>it's because what's right is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's best for you.</v>

1398
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I've learned from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff I've been teaching you.</v>

1399
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>

1400
01:18:19.930 --> 01:18:24.930
