1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like everything is in order.</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with,</v>

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Jordan Peterson and um,</v>

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot of you probably know of him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been making quite the bus.</v>

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi Jordan.</v>

6
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for joining me on this chat.</v>

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm really excited to talk to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>to get to the topics at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing today?</v>

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.743
<v Speaker 1>I know you told me that there were some </v>
<v Speaker 1>very specific things that you'd like to </v>

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>kind of talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>talk with me about today because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have much time.</v>

14
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I just want to kind of jump right into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.493
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to talk a bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and their view on </v>

17
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>did you want to just,</v>

19
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I'd be trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously this discussion about pronouns</v>

20
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:03.714
<v Speaker 2>is attracting a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and it's attracted a </v>

21
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:07.674
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of tension for complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons that it's not an obvious wise </v>

22
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.753
<v Speaker 2>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would focus on it for such a </v>

23
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 2>long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been about 40 days now,</v>

24
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.433
<v Speaker 2>but 130 print articles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say maybe upwards of 3 </v>

25
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 2>million people have been watching the </v>
<v Speaker 2>goings on online.</v>

26
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.693
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we haven't even counted the number </v>

27
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 2>of youtube videos and that sort of thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be generated as a consequence</v>

28
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:31.014
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the two demonstrations at the </v>

29
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.510
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto and the exchange </v>
<v Speaker 2>of letters,</v>

30
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been absurdly,</v>

31
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.013
<v Speaker 2>absurdly controversial and that means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's something going on that </v>

32
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 2>people really haven't put their finger </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

33
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be thinking about it at multiple</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of analysis.</v>

34
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:48.024
<v Speaker 2>And there's one very deep level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis that I don't think anyone has </v>

35
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 2>addressed.</v>

36
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 2>And I would think about it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a cognitive level of analysis.</v>

37
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 2>And it has to do with the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>categorization itself.</v>

38
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.063
<v Speaker 2>So I remember a long while back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read a paper on why human beings have </v>

39
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:04.554
<v Speaker 2>two hemispheres,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right hemisphere and the left </v>

40
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

41
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 2>the left hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is very roughly speaking,</v>

42
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 2>the left slash linguistic hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempts to impose predictable structure</v>

43
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 2>on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simplifying it.</v>

44
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly an ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplification.</v>

45
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:22.584
<v Speaker 2>It's more like a practical </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplification because the world is so </v>

46
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 2>complex that unless you chunk it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories,</v>

47
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.793
<v Speaker 2>it overwhelms you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to chunk it into </v>

48
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:31.464
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those categories aren't exactly </v>

49
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:38.421
<v Speaker 2>descriptions of things or objects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more like tools for operating in</v>

50
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:39.834
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the right hemisphere keeps </v>

51
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:42.804
<v Speaker 2>track of anomalies and exceptions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tries to build those slowly into the </v>

52
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 2>category system so that it doesn't blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>the category system.</v>

53
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 2>And so there was an example of this that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that researcher named Goldberg offered.</v>

54
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:55.104
<v Speaker 2>He had trained a neural network to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize images of fish and the same </v>

55
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 2>neural network to recognize images of </v>
<v Speaker 2>birds.</v>

56
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.633
<v Speaker 2>But when he showed it a penguin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it blew the category structure so </v>

57
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 2>that all fish became birds and all birds</v>
<v Speaker 2>became fish.</v>

58
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.033
<v Speaker 2>Now the postmodernists like Derrida </v>
<v Speaker 2>claimed that category structures were </v>

59
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 2>primarily tools of power and oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

60
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 2>which to me is an absurd claim because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not their primary use,</v>

61
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.243
<v Speaker 2>even though that may be one of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences and one of their own </v>

62
00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 2>occasionally uses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he became very,</v>

63
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:30.244
<v Speaker 2>very concerned about who the category </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems marginalized and what the </v>

64
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that was for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that got tangled in,</v>

65
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense,</v>

66
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:40.234
<v Speaker 2>into the Marxist identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>routine because the Marxist identity </v>

67
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:44.944
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people picked up the idea of the </v>

68
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:47.884
<v Speaker 2>excluded and marginalized and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>transform them into the equivalent of </v>

69
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Marx's oppressed working class and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to agitate for them.</v>

70
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 2>And the Democrats in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

71
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 2>transformed their focus from working </v>
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>

72
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>concern say to identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerns.</v>

74
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.810
<v Speaker 2>And there's been some notion that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was part of the resurgence of Marxism as</v>

75
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a new ideological doctrine.</v>

76
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really fundamental problem.</v>

77
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 2>The pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pro categories exclude.</v>

78
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 2>But then if you include the excluded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the category,</v>

79
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:24.364
<v Speaker 2>you blow the category structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is partly why the right wing </v>

80
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

81
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 2>were so opposed to the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexual marriage.</v>

82
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

83
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 2>What's happening very rapidly is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the binary category has been,</v>

84
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call,</v>

85
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violated.</v>

86
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.534
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get an explosion of chaotic </v>

87
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:47.794
<v Speaker 2>identities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's gone from say two to the </v>

88
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>proposed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose three,</v>

89
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:52.984
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would have been what the </v>

90
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.124
<v Speaker 2>formulators of the legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're hoping for to say 31 in </v>

91
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 2>New York and 70 online.</v>

92
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this additional </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosion which is,</v>

93
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 2>which has being promoted by people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who aren't really concerned so much with</v>

94
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:07.474
<v Speaker 2>the categories of gender identity but </v>
<v Speaker 2>with other categories like human versus </v>

95
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:12.214
<v Speaker 2>non human identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those are the people that have </v>

96
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 2>been come known as other kids or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>trans abled,</v>

97
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:18.671
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are,</v>

98
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 2>who are claiming but on the same logical</v>
<v Speaker 2>gout grounds.</v>

99
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.743
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on the same logical grounds is </v>

100
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 2>they're claiming a non categorical </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity that transcends the human.</v>

101
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:30.950
<v Speaker 2>And if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's only subjective,</v>

102
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.733
<v Speaker 2>then there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you already agree with the first </v>

103
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:35.854
<v Speaker 2>step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way of logically agreeing </v>

104
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 2>with the second step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a really interesting example</v>

105
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:41.164
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of how say binary categories maintain </v>

106
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:45.304
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you violate them to include </v>

107
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 2>those who are excluded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you produce is and up swelling of,</v>

108
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of unmanageable chaos,</v>

109
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be the state where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things I wanted to you is,</v>

110
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 2>I think this is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is happening on two fronts.</v>

111
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.534
<v Speaker 2>It's happened with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the requests of gay people to be </v>

112
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 2>included in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

113
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

114
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.963
<v Speaker 2>in marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now now what's happened as a </v>

115
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 2>consequence of the request of </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgendered people to be included in,</v>

116
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.903
<v Speaker 2>although flipping the gender category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is especially true with the </v>

117
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 2>non-gender non so-called nonbinary </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender types.</v>

118
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 2>And so I just wondered what you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about all that.</v>

119
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much.</v>

120
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've been thinking about this a lot.</v>

121
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not an insider in the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses the same words,</v>

122
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:37.260
<v Speaker 1>but very much along the same lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

123
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.313
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting that you talk </v>

124
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:41.384
<v Speaker 1>about categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One could look at it also as not just </v>

125
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:46.000
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the violation or the changing of it,</v>

126
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

127
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.133
<v Speaker 1>the definition of a category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the creation of entirely new </v>

128
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

129
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>not just male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>

130
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:57.330
<v Speaker 1>but now in tiny new category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

131
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 1>which not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

132
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.103
<v Speaker 1>threatens male and female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it threatens the dichotomy as you </v>

133
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the binary.</v>

134
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

135
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>I find it interesting because I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally I don't,</v>

136
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't see how there is any third </v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda because</v>

137
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

138
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.390
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing more than male and </v>
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>

139
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

140
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>where does this come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing more than male,</v>

141
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:24.674
<v Speaker 1>female and male.</v>

142
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.650
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

143
00:07:28.651 --> 00:07:29.484
<v Speaker 2>Well that's exactly the problem of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>category is that once you're outside </v>

144
00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 2>that then your anywhere as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>

145
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.873
<v Speaker 1>and if you can create an identity out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>math thing based out of nothing in </v>

146
00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:41.314
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're basically claiming the </v>

147
00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:44.890
<v Speaker 1>status of a Danny Guide and</v>

148
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.200
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

149
00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:51.100
<v Speaker 2>the other kids are consciously claiming </v>
<v Speaker 2>the status of Demi gods because they,</v>

150
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.173
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they proclaim that they are such </v>

151
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:57.400
<v Speaker 2>creatures as Alps or ferris or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or orcs or whatever,</v>

152
00:07:57.401 --> 00:08:01.300
<v Speaker 2>whatever their imagination conscious up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know that that's the other thing</v>

153
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:02.380
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that in the,</v>

154
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.603
<v Speaker 2>in bill see 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually an assault on the </v>

155
00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:06.424
<v Speaker 2>concept of reality because identity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically unmoored from its </v>

156
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:12.400
<v Speaker 2>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some straight.</v>

157
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.293
<v Speaker 2>And so that means it's unmoored from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective and as soon as it's on board </v>

158
00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:19.960
<v Speaker 2>from the objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's subjective.</v>

159
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:23.830
<v Speaker 2>And in principle can be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean in,</v>

160
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.713
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so with the classically transgendered </v>

161
00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:28.534
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I presume that you would fit into </v>

162
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:30.724
<v Speaker 2>that category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument isn't so much about the </v>

163
00:08:32.801 --> 00:08:33.634
<v Speaker 2>category of gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The argument is about which category </v>

164
00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:36.994
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That what that seems to do is </v>

165
00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:44.230
<v Speaker 2>immediately opened the door or has </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened the door to,</v>

166
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I would say a philosophical assault on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the concept of gender itself.</v>

167
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.640
<v Speaker 2>With that culminated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

168
00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 2>in Dr Nicholas maps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

169
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:54.843
<v Speaker 2>claim on TV Ospi agenda when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>debating me that there were no </v>

170
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:58.044
<v Speaker 2>biological differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women and that that's what the science </v>

171
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 2>over the last four decades has claimed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkable,</v>

172
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 2>remarkable claims.</v>

173
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.103
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not correct that there is such a </v>

174
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 1>thing as biological sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a historian of medicine.</v>

175
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I can unpack that for you at great </v>
<v Speaker 1>length if you want.</v>

176
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>But in the interest of time I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a very popular misconceptions.</v>

177
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 1>So essentially when in my transgender </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies classes,</v>

178
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.323
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing is looking at actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>research and identifying ways that </v>

179
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:28.703
<v Speaker 1>current social issues related to trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>people or things that are associated </v>

180
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:32.694
<v Speaker 1>with trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as free speech arguments and </v>

181
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 1>claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

182
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.540
<v Speaker 1>how that connects to the way that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are thinking.</v>

183
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 1>And the way that research has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>framed,</v>

184
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 1>the history is there were some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other pronouns</v>

185
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.793
<v Speaker 2>and then the dissolution of identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this unbelievable chaos that that </v>

186
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:51.320
<v Speaker 2>even appears to transcend that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the dimensions of,</v>

187
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.530
<v Speaker 2>of species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an article today from,</v>

188
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.460
<v Speaker 2>from a viewer in England who sent me the</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcripts,</v>

189
00:09:58.461 --> 00:10:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was of the German </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophers talk,</v>

190
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.640
<v Speaker 2>who claimed that our recognition of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological sex of animals is nothing but</v>

191
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.130
<v Speaker 2>an artificial imposition of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary ideological construct,</v>

192
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.850
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd claim if you,</v>

193
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:17.743
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you decided that the underlying </v>

194
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:20.714
<v Speaker 2>biology was irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why I think the evolutionary </v>

195
00:10:22.971 --> 00:10:26.210
<v Speaker 2>biologists are next in the sights of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors.</v>

196
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.273
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is a degree to which even </v>

197
00:10:30.461 --> 00:10:31.860
<v Speaker 1>a traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

198
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.110
<v Speaker 1>transgender be pulled do still maybe not</v>
<v Speaker 1>assault,</v>

199
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.270
<v Speaker 1>but certainly threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

201
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the category of male and female.</v>

202
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

203
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.753
<v Speaker 1>I tried to argue for why I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we need to consider a definition of </v>

204
00:10:47.141 --> 00:10:48.970
<v Speaker 1>woman that maybe include someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

205
00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:51.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't demand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just argue for it.</v>

206
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's the other thing that I,</v>

207
00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:56.620
<v Speaker 1>the other matter that you seem to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about more,</v>

208
00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:57.603
<v Speaker 1>which is the inclusion of a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories such as non binary and what </v>

209
00:11:01.901 --> 00:11:03.230
<v Speaker 1>that means to the mat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

210
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.840
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think including a trans woman into</v>

211
00:11:07.841 --> 00:11:09.730
<v Speaker 1>the category of woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.090
<v Speaker 1>maybe not equally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but similarly,</v>

213
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened,</v>

214
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.213
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

215
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.980
<v Speaker 1>the definition of gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

216
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.130
<v Speaker 1>in a similar way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not assault.</v>

217
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

218
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 2>it definitely destabilizes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

219
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.800
<v Speaker 2>and the question is what exactly should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be done about that?</v>

220
00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:26.634
<v Speaker 2>Because you know there's been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>claimable say western philosopher since </v>

221
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:31.853
<v Speaker 2>I really think since the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the philosophical tradition that the </v>

222
00:11:34.891 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Speaker 2>basis of civilization itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the structural basis is,</v>

223
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.883
<v Speaker 2>is roughly speaking the nuclear family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And another thing I think that's come </v>

224
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:45.660
<v Speaker 2>under assault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is certainly something that was</v>

225
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:48.600
<v Speaker 2>picked up by the cross to Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalists early,</v>

226
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 2>was that the dissolution of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories,</v>

227
00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 2>structures also to destabilize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear family.</v>

228
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.583
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with that is we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly know what the consequences of </v>

229
00:11:59.111 --> 00:11:59.944
<v Speaker 2>that will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do know the scientific literature is </v>

230
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:03.520
<v Speaker 2>quite clear on this as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

231
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:04.354
<v Speaker 2>children who are raised in intact </v>
<v Speaker 2>families with two biological parents do </v>

232
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:09.274
<v Speaker 2>far better on every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or pretty much everything that's </v>

233
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:12.034
<v Speaker 2>measured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now of course the problem with </v>

234
00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:15.374
<v Speaker 2>the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see this reflected in say </v>

235
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Kathleen wins new legislation on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called the old families are</v>

236
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:21.340
<v Speaker 2>equal.</v>

237
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.173
<v Speaker 2>That's the bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if any arrangement whatsoever </v>

238
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:25.834
<v Speaker 2>between people can be family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's no such thing as family </v>

239
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:31.510
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if there's no such thing as family,</v>

240
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 2>well then we don't know what will </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

241
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.293
<v Speaker 2>And the problem too is that it seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me that it's in the interest of people </v>

242
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:42.451
<v Speaker 2>who are non,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do not fit easily into categories to</v>

243
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 2>not destabilize the main culture too </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly.</v>

244
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.743
<v Speaker 2>And there's a reason for that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>main culture right now is actually </v>

245
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:50.464
<v Speaker 2>pretty tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you'd be stabilized at culture </v>

246
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

247
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.000
<v Speaker 2>it will become rapidly intolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the first thing that happens is</v>

248
00:12:58.001 --> 00:12:58.834
<v Speaker 2>those who are identifiably different are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first targets of an intolerant </v>

249
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems to me that it's incumbent on</v>

250
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 2>the lbgt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera community.</v>

251
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.283
<v Speaker 2>If they want to request inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they also have to figure out how </v>

252
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:13.174
<v Speaker 2>that can be done in a way that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>destabilize the entire category </v>

253
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:18.580
<v Speaker 2>structure because it it risks doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

254
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Speaker 2>So now you had some arguments about why </v>
<v Speaker 2>the category of woman should be expanded</v>

255
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:27.310
<v Speaker 2>to include people like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously you're doing everything in</v>

256
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:28.144
<v Speaker 2>your power to present yourself to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world in a manner that makes you easily </v>

257
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 2>categorizable.</v>

258
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.793
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I don't necessarily even </v>

259
00:13:38.161 --> 00:13:39.660
<v Speaker 1>think of it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

260
00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

261
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.233
<v Speaker 1>I want to be seen as woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to do all these things to </v>

262
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:45.870
<v Speaker 1>be viewed as woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

263
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I do all these things because I am a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

264
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.403
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do all these things just because it </v>

265
00:13:50.521 --> 00:13:53.610
<v Speaker 1>comes naturally to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the end product happens to be,</v>

266
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:54.803
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a subject that in people's minds is </v>

267
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.090
<v Speaker 1>easily register a ball.</v>

268
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.853
<v Speaker 2>Well that's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's an act of politeness </v>

269
00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:07.160
<v Speaker 2>on your part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

270
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.083
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things people concluded </v>

271
00:14:09.441 --> 00:14:14.441
<v Speaker 2>when I first made my videos is that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't use he or she to to,</v>

272
00:14:14.721 --> 00:14:16.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refer to,</v>

273
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I'll say someone like yourself who wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be referred to as she.</v>

274
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.330
<v Speaker 2>And my attitude about that was never </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

275
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.343
<v Speaker 2>But having thought through it further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also realized that my natural </v>

276
00:14:27.291 --> 00:14:31.670
<v Speaker 2>behavioral proclivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that most people is to refer</v>

277
00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:32.504
<v Speaker 2>to someone by the protein chro pronoun </v>
<v Speaker 2>that addresses their appearance because </v>

278
00:14:38.151 --> 00:14:38.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

279
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.480
<v Speaker 2>it's a pronoun use is actually rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>casual,</v>

280
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do it unthinkingly in automatically.</v>

281
00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.223
<v Speaker 2>And you address a person in keeping with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the manner in which they manifest </v>

282
00:14:49.551 --> 00:14:50.130
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

283
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.770
<v Speaker 2>and you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying that that's also a,</v>

284
00:14:52.771 --> 00:14:56.810
<v Speaker 2>or maybe even primarily a manifestation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an inner drive,</v>

285
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.033
<v Speaker 2>but obviously the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the manner in which that inner drive is </v>

286
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.590
<v Speaker 2>manifest itself is also socially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of a social negotiation.</v>

287
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably my argument for choosing</v>

288
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:11.820
<v Speaker 2>a definition of women that includes me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

289
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.530
<v Speaker 2>because for the sake of communication it</v>
<v Speaker 2>just seems,</v>

290
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.753
<v Speaker 2>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Language is what we use to communicate </v>

291
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:21.650
<v Speaker 2>with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to corrupt it.</v>

292
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.573
<v Speaker 2>The better we communicate the real world</v>
<v Speaker 2>to on and not that the Beta we use </v>

293
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:26.414
<v Speaker 2>language and I think there would </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually be more confusion if people </v>

294
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:30.164
<v Speaker 2>refer to me as he on sa and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of your cases that is actually </v>

295
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Speaker 2>no way of addressing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't produce some confusion.</v>

296
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:45.790
<v Speaker 2>And so using she is the simplest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is less confused.</v>

297
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

298
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.740
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

299
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.013
<v Speaker 2>So what would you say if I said you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could make a case that your mere </v>

300
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:55.340
<v Speaker 2>existence is a threat to categorical </v>
<v Speaker 2>order?</v>

301
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.610
<v Speaker 2>And so I could say that your duty as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence,</v>

302
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.180
<v Speaker 2>despite the potential violation of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own sense of self,</v>

303
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.010
<v Speaker 2>would be to what?</v>

304
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.323
<v Speaker 2>To deny your own inner impulses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conform because not doing so I </v>

305
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.490
<v Speaker 2>understand that that comes at a personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>cost.</v>

306
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not trying to minimize that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cost.</v>

307
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Speaker 2>And I'm also not saying that you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>do this,</v>

308
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.710
<v Speaker 2>but I think you can make a case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

309
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:22.544
<v Speaker 2>it's like the social obligation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who doesn't fit into a </v>

310
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:26.594
<v Speaker 2>fundamental category too tricky one man </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fit in regardless because it's so </v>

311
00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 2>threatening not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

312
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could make the same case </v>
<v Speaker 2>about artists.</v>

313
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

314
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.943
<v Speaker 2>You could make the same case about </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone but doesn't fit in and often </v>

315
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:40.334
<v Speaker 2>people who don't fit in our necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very tricky thing to think </v>

316
00:16:43.071 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

317
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to come back to the argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a usefulness of language,</v>

318
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:49.663
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how useful is the definition of </v>

319
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:52.790
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

320
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:55.270
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using a definition of lemon,</v>

321
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.640
<v Speaker 2>someone who was on with xx chromosomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

322
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 2>and you now can give birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

323
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.053
<v Speaker 2>all of those things that's very useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it describes the vast majority </v>

324
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.320
<v Speaker 2>of cases that you will find in real </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

325
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:13.900
<v Speaker 2>And it facilitates certain kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions.</v>

326
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.753
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't see that it's necessarily </v>

327
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:20.720
<v Speaker 2>conflicting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two can set it in a given situation.</v>

328
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:21.554
<v Speaker 2>We saw him and he was not born </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically female to consider the use </v>

329
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:30.011
<v Speaker 2>of a different definition of women if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Camina communicatively useful.</v>

330
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.873
<v Speaker 2>And that way we don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to threaten categories </v>

331
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:37.070
<v Speaker 2>because we were still committed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

332
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

333
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.073
<v Speaker 2>so let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me ask you some questions about </v>

334
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:41.084
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's assume that your point is well </v>

335
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:43.694
<v Speaker 2>taken then I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're born a man and you wish to be </v>

336
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:49.364
<v Speaker 2>treated as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the minimal obligations that </v>

337
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Speaker 2>you have to undertake in order to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>granted that,</v>

338
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 2>let's say privilege?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

339
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.190
<v Speaker 2>because the way this is framed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

340
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.113
<v Speaker 2>the way it's been framed and discussions</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me so far is that it's a matter of </v>

341
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:07.950
<v Speaker 2>respect to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's pronouns.</v>

342
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:08.783
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's nonsense because when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see people on the street and I </v>

343
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:14.160
<v Speaker 2>referred to them as he or she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has nothing to do with respect.</v>

344
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.323
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the most casual of </v>

345
00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:20.160
<v Speaker 2>communication in camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

346
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.153
<v Speaker 2>so I don't buy the respect thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say you're making a case that </v>

347
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.570
<v Speaker 2>the most straight forward thing is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>include you or,</v>

348
00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:29.940
<v Speaker 2>or people that are in the same position </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you.</v>

349
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think your obligations </v>
<v Speaker 2>are?</v>

350
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Your responsibilities are to the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>compact,</v>

351
00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:39.810
<v Speaker 2>but say in order to be given that I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to saint privilege,</v>

352
00:18:39.811 --> 00:18:41.380
<v Speaker 2>it's something like that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

353
00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Privilege is fine with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

354
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.023
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering that my answer to that </v>

355
00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:48.544
<v Speaker 1>question would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be regarded as the gender that you </v>

356
00:18:52.811 --> 00:18:57.250
<v Speaker 1>identify eyes common sensically within </v>
<v Speaker 1>your culture.</v>

357
00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's your obligation.</v>

358
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>

359
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:02.683
<v Speaker 2>Well that seems to be at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable because at least then you </v>

360
00:19:05.391 --> 00:19:06.224
<v Speaker 2>don't make it any more awkward for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to interact with you than it has </v>

361
00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:12.650
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to an artist the other day</v>

362
00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:15.670
<v Speaker 2>named Jonathan Patio and we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the issue of,</v>

363
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.330
<v Speaker 2>of non categorical identity and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking to me about um,</v>

364
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.640
<v Speaker 2>mythological stories of the welcoming of</v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers.</v>

365
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:23.683
<v Speaker 2>There's a very strong tradition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospitality in most cultures and if a </v>

366
00:19:26.181 --> 00:19:28.490
<v Speaker 2>stranger shows up here to welcome them </v>
<v Speaker 2>into your house,</v>

367
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:29.563
<v Speaker 2>but they're supposed to behave when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in your house so they're not </v>

368
00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:34.130
<v Speaker 2>supposed to steal all your vaccine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

369
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.130
<v Speaker 2>And rape your women and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

370
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's an obligation on both sides.</v>

371
00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

372
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:42.463
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what Gavin McInnes said about </v>

373
00:19:44.091 --> 00:19:46.350
<v Speaker 1>trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who transitioned from male to female.</v>

374
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.203
<v Speaker 1>You said that you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go to Japan and </v>

375
00:19:48.351 --> 00:19:51.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go live in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you need to like speak their language</v>

376
00:19:51.571 --> 00:19:54.260
<v Speaker 1>to communicate with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adopt our costumes,</v>

377
00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:55.094
<v Speaker 1>take your shoes off when you enter the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enter the house were referred by their </v>

378
00:19:58.491 --> 00:19:59.900
<v Speaker 1>last name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things.</v>

379
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:00.763
<v Speaker 1>That's just what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a stranger does if they </v>

380
00:20:03.501 --> 00:20:05.570
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be considered a stranger </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

381
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

382
00:20:07.171 --> 00:20:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

383
00:20:08.191 --> 00:20:09.001
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

384
00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 2>so it seems to me that there needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a discussion about responsibilities.</v>

385
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:13.993
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the excluded other wants to be </v>

386
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:16.524
<v Speaker 2>included.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way to be included isn't to blow </v>

387
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 2>apart the category structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to make faculty behaves nicely when</v>

388
00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:25.410
<v Speaker 2>you're welcomed into the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

389
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've got a more,</v>

390
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.110
<v Speaker 2>a more vicious question to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say this is a rough one man.</v>

391
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Like caught like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

392
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:35.860
<v Speaker 1>the majority of his live stream of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then a transphobic,</v>

393
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.720
<v Speaker 1>transphobic by probably every trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of trans people.</v>

394
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.450
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is</v>

395
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.320
<v Speaker 2>such good comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

396
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 2>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now here's another problem.</v>

397
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:48.904
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking through the last couple of </v>

398
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:52.203
<v Speaker 2>weeks is the idea of discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 2>because discrimination and judgment and </v>

399
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:55.474
<v Speaker 2>categorization aren't that easy to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart and you have to be discriminating </v>

400
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.210
<v Speaker 2>or you'll do anything all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to mcallen?</v>

401
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Speaker 2>But you have to exclude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

402
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.733
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic about seeing the sexual </v>

403
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 2>behavior among human beings is it's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>exclusionary.</v>

404
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.480
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

405
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 2>among chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the females are promiscuous meters.</v>

406
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Now the dominant males have more </v>
<v Speaker 2>offspring,</v>

407
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:22.564
<v Speaker 2>but that's because they chase the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordinate males away from the females </v>

408
00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 2>when they're in estrous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're in heat,</v>

409
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Speaker 2>the females that are in heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll meet with any male.</v>

410
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 2>The dominant males chase away the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordinate males,</v>

411
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:34.930
<v Speaker 2>so they get more offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it has nothing to do with female,</v>

412
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 2>let's say preference.</v>

413
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Human beings are very strange in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard,</v>

414
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:41.410
<v Speaker 2>and this is maybe why we're so different</v>
<v Speaker 2>from chimpanzees,</v>

415
00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:42.244
<v Speaker 2>even though we share a common ancestor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the big differences is that </v>

416
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.160
<v Speaker 2>human females are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very choosy sexually.</v>

417
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Speaker 2>And so this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

418
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.330
<v Speaker 2>you have twice as many female ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 2>as mail APP ancestors.</v>

419
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 2>And it's a hard thing to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptually,</v>

420
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:01.540
<v Speaker 2>but basically it means that on average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

421
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you'd get that outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If on average,</v>

422
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:07.330
<v Speaker 2>every female produced two offspring and </v>
<v Speaker 2>every male only produced one.</v>

423
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.943
<v Speaker 2>Now that would mean some males produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>far more than one and some produced </v>

424
00:22:11.481 --> 00:22:12.314
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's differential sexual success </v>

425
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:15.813
<v Speaker 2>in males and females in human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because of female sexual </v>

426
00:22:18.851 --> 00:22:19.684
<v Speaker 2>selectivities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what females choose before </v>

427
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.610
<v Speaker 2>they choose men who are across or above </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

428
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 2>In dominance hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to choose for health.</v>

429
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.163
<v Speaker 2>They tend to choose for appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tend to choose for productivity </v>

430
00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 2>that's manifested often in status and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

431
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:37.144
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minority of males are found very </v>

432
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:42.460
<v Speaker 2>sexually attractive and the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 2>males not.</v>

433
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.323
<v Speaker 2>So my point is is that one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental rights that say feminists </v>

434
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.390
<v Speaker 2>want to retain is the right to absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual choice in their partners.</v>

435
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.613
<v Speaker 2>But they don't understand that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on exactly the forms of </v>

436
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 2>discrimination that they're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguing against.</v>

437
00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:58.983
<v Speaker 2>So because you generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people sleep with someone up their own </v>

438
00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:02.044
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sleep with someone of their own </v>

439
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:07.120
<v Speaker 2>religion roughly the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They generally go after healthy people.</v>

440
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.580
<v Speaker 2>They generally go after attractive </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

441
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:10.923
<v Speaker 2>And so every single dimension of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination that you can possibly </v>

442
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:14.344
<v Speaker 2>imagine governs sexual choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you completely eradicate the </v>

443
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:18.934
<v Speaker 2>justification for discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I would also say is the same </v>

444
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 2>justification for freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>association,</v>

445
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 2>you also blow out the element of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

446
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.260
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question I wanted to ask you is,</v>

447
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:30.243
<v Speaker 2>considering you as a potential sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner is going to be distressing to </v>

448
00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:37.250
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that acceptable?</v>

449
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

450
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

451
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:43.413
<v Speaker 2>I'm an anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not something people </v>

452
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.943
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with.</v>

453
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I was born a different way</v>

454
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:50.600
<v Speaker 1>than I am now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they are attracted to me,</v>

455
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.823
<v Speaker 1>it makes my dating life a bit harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I'm a huge proponent of </v>

456
00:23:57.051 --> 00:23:57.884
<v Speaker 1>discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's 100% within people's </v>

457
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

458
00:24:01.851 --> 00:24:02.684
<v Speaker 1>I would never call us on transphobic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want to seek with me </v>

459
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.890
<v Speaker 1>because I was born one way and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>their preference as their prerogative.</v>

460
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 1>It's 100% people's right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate.</v>

461
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:16.810
<v Speaker 2>So do you think that there's any ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you saw to this through a lot,</v>

462
00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:17.644
<v Speaker 2>like the part of the problem here is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that distinguishing that from forbidden </v>

463
00:24:21.191 --> 00:24:24.280
<v Speaker 2>forms of discrimination is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult conceptually.</v>

464
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not obvious why it's okay to </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminate against someone sexually.</v>

465
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.433
<v Speaker 2>This happened in brave new world in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Huxley's novel where any form of sexual </v>

466
00:24:32.861 --> 00:24:35.230
<v Speaker 2>discrimination was regarded as socially </v>
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate,</v>

467
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.320
<v Speaker 2>such that if someone asks you to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex with them,</v>

468
00:24:38.321 --> 00:24:40.570
<v Speaker 2>it was your moral obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only to do it,</v>

469
00:24:40.571 --> 00:24:43.780
<v Speaker 2>but to be happy about the basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis was,</v>

470
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.140
<v Speaker 2>or the basic slogan was everyone belongs</v>
<v Speaker 2>to everyone else.</v>

471
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the final limit of the absence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination.</v>

472
00:24:50.231 --> 00:24:52.630
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why do you think that discrimination</v>

473
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.280
<v Speaker 2>of that sword is okay?</v>

474
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I believe in equality and lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination,</v>

475
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.930
<v Speaker 1>equal treatment under the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is kind of where it ends for me.</v>

476
00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Very much free market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my thinking,</v>

477
00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:04.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

478
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.673
<v Speaker 2>well the free market example's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting one because maybe the </v>

479
00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:08.464
<v Speaker 2>reasons and that it's okay for other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to discriminate is because we </v>

480
00:25:11.471 --> 00:25:14.910
<v Speaker 2>want to retain the right for ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>to discriminate because mate,</v>

481
00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's something like you're willing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have people reject you as a potential</v>

482
00:25:18.821 --> 00:25:19.654
<v Speaker 2>sexual partner as long as you're also </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed the privilege to reject other </v>

483
00:25:24.761 --> 00:25:25.730
<v Speaker 2>people as opposed to it.</v>

484
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that type things on both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

485
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:29.613
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole transgender people in </v>

486
00:25:30.861 --> 00:25:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Washington's thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believed when that was going on.</v>

487
00:25:34.431 --> 00:25:35.264
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of died down now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I believe when that was going on </v>

488
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.710
<v Speaker 1>that's the state shouldn't be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

489
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.000
<v Speaker 1>trans people aren't allowed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

490
00:25:43.001 --> 00:25:45.130
<v Speaker 1>in the washroom of their choosing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't I,</v>

491
00:25:45.131 --> 00:25:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's up to the business owners to make</v>

492
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:50.470
<v Speaker 1>that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a,</v>

493
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.830
<v Speaker 1>a business down the road of restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't let me,</v>

494
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the washroom,</v>

495
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.430
<v Speaker 1>the female washroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so be it.</v>

496
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go to a different restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I'm so,</v>

497
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm very free market thinking and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

498
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.620
<v Speaker 1>I think discrimination is something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to,</v>

499
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 1>the right to discriminate is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be protected at all costs.</v>

500
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.830
<v Speaker 2>It certainly seems to have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected to some degree.</v>

501
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:13.763
<v Speaker 2>I think the sexual choice conundrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were horrors on both sides </v>

502
00:26:17.121 --> 00:26:17.900
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

503
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.580
<v Speaker 2>The first horror is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

504
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:23.090
<v Speaker 2>if you obliterate sexual discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to allow yourself to,</v>

505
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:23.983
<v Speaker 2>to be the sexual target of whoever when </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever that seems like pretty bad </v>

506
00:26:27.261 --> 00:26:28.094
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's certainly not one that I think </v>

507
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.703
<v Speaker 2>particularly women would rapidly accept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's such an assault individuals </v>

508
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.800
<v Speaker 2>agency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

509
00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:37.634
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the ultimate assault on an </v>

510
00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:39.074
<v Speaker 2>individual's agency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is is to maintain that </v>

511
00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:42.584
<v Speaker 2>right to choice is to also maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to discriminate and then putting </v>

512
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:50.850
<v Speaker 2>the boundaries on what you're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminate against is very,</v>

513
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:51.684
<v Speaker 2>very tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think we've gone far too far in </v>

514
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.970
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the antidiscrimination direction.</v>

515
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.833
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult for people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses now to aggregate themselves in </v>

516
00:27:01.131 --> 00:27:04.440
<v Speaker 2>gender uniform groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not sure that's a good idea.</v>

517
00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:05.274
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that men should be </v>

518
00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:08.940
<v Speaker 2>allowed to hang around with men if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to and that women should be allowed</v>

519
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:13.440
<v Speaker 2>to hang around with women when they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to and that actually that right might be</v>

520
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:17.100
<v Speaker 2>necessary for the proper development of </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity and femininity.</v>

521
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.803
<v Speaker 2>What one final thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is another horrible thing that no </v>

522
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:22.170
<v Speaker 2>one ever talks about.</v>

523
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.343
<v Speaker 2>The data suggests that men who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexual have a very large number of </v>

524
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.203
<v Speaker 2>sexual partners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that makes sense to me because men </v>

525
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.690
<v Speaker 2>tend not to say no to sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities.</v>

526
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.410
<v Speaker 2>And so my man with man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like no one says no.</v>

527
00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:43.590
<v Speaker 2>So there's lots of sexual activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

528
00:27:43.591 --> 00:27:44.424
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things I'm curious about </v>
<v Speaker 2>is if marriage is expanded on any other </v>

529
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:51.444
<v Speaker 2>grounds merely than the legal grounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think aren't sufficient to even </v>

530
00:27:53.971 --> 00:27:56.070
<v Speaker 2>maintain marriage as an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an institution,</v>

531
00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:01.340
<v Speaker 2>if marriage is expanded to include same </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex couples,</v>

532
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:02.363
<v Speaker 2>say what are the obligations of the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex couples once they're actually </v>

533
00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:08.880
<v Speaker 2>married?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So does that mean that that,</v>

534
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.493
<v Speaker 2>and I know the literature on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the suggestion is that most male </v>

535
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:15.360
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals who get married don't give </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

536
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:17.760
<v Speaker 2>They're promiscuous ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

537
00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:20.430
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that if you don't give up</v>
<v Speaker 2>your permissionless ways,</v>

538
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 2>then you're actually not playing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game of marriage.</v>

539
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.383
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions about responsibility that I </v>

540
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.820
<v Speaker 2>don't think has been had in public land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be part of the game,</v>

541
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.030
<v Speaker 2>then in principle you also have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow the rules.</v>

542
00:28:37.031 --> 00:28:39.550
<v Speaker 2>So that doesn't mean everyone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>heterosexual who's managed.</v>

543
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.920
<v Speaker 1>You absolutely obliterate the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental building blocks of a society</v>

544
00:28:44.921 --> 00:28:47.530
<v Speaker 1>and a culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when,</v>

545
00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

546
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.170
<v Speaker 1>when you violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important categories like marriage,</v>

547
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.111
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

548
00:28:54.111 --> 00:28:56.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what the fundamentals,</v>

549
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.610
<v Speaker 2>we don't really understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals.</v>

550
00:28:58.611 --> 00:29:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have need philosophical claims.</v>

551
00:29:01.581 --> 00:29:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I would say gender identity is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental.</v>

552
00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.053
<v Speaker 2>Children learn that very early and </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage is a fundamental and the </v>

553
00:29:07.761 --> 00:29:10.310
<v Speaker 2>nuclear family is a fundamental and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

554
00:29:10.311 --> 00:29:11.144
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no idea how many of those </v>

555
00:29:12.141 --> 00:29:12.974
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals can be challenged before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole bloody thing shakes and falls </v>

556
00:29:15.741 --> 00:29:16.574
<v Speaker 2>down and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you wanted to shake and fall </v>

557
00:29:18.651 --> 00:29:20.120
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

558
00:29:20.121 --> 00:29:21.200
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was good.</v>

559
00:29:21.201 --> 00:29:23.390
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we're going to do this again</v>

560
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:24.623
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone please check the link below to </v>

561
00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:28.720
<v Speaker 1>register for the right to offend </v>
<v Speaker 1>conference.</v>

562
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

564
00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:32.904
<v Speaker 1>we'll be talking about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>topics surrounding a political </v>

565
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 1>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech and so on.</v>

566
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:39.653
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to have this live stream </v>

567
00:29:40.651 --> 00:29:41.484
<v Speaker 1>because a Dr. Peterson wasn't able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be able to make it in person </v>

568
00:29:45.181 --> 00:29:46.014
<v Speaker 1>for that conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just wanted to use this time to </v>

569
00:29:47.851 --> 00:29:49.770
<v Speaker 1>promote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much,</v>

<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
