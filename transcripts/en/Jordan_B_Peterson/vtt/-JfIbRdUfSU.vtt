00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
<v Speaker 1>It's graduation is highly significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>for young people because it is a death </v>

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:06.030
<v Speaker 1>and a renewal at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.173
<v Speaker 1>it's a good way of learning too about </v>
<v Speaker 1>life because you see when you graduate </v>

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.783
<v Speaker 1>at simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have attained the pinnacle of </v>

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>

6
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>it instantly transforms you into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginner at the next stage of your life.</v>

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>When people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to be when they grow up</v>

8
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:25.914
<v Speaker 1>in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually mean what career you're </v>

9
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.013
<v Speaker 1>going to pick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not the way the question </v>

10
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:30.324
<v Speaker 1>should be asked or conceptualize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should really think about what sort </v>

11
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>of character you want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say you should surround yourself</v>

12
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:38.874
<v Speaker 1>with people who are aiming up at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who want the best for what's best in </v>

13
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:42.024
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want people that will excuse </v>

14
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:49.971
<v Speaker 1>your pathologies and make weight for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your weakness and lead you down the path</v>

15
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.114
<v Speaker 1>of perdition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to take care of </v>

16
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to take care of your family.</v>

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>You're going to take care of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

18
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to grow up and be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible,</v>

19
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>forthright and honest person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best way through life.</v>

20
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>There could be a lot more to you than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>highly probable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should act as if there is,</v>

22
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>and then you should go out there and try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

23
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>if not great things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least honest,</v>

24
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>

25
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>engaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and positive things.</v>

26
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what you should be aiming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing in that except good.</v>

27
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.113
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
