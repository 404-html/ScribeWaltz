1
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk a little bit about,</v>

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could call them the</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying structures of perception.</v>

3
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I picked this image.</v>

4
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a very old image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an image that that portrays.</v>

6
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being cast up on the beach by whale.</v>

7
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:34.521
<v Speaker 1>It's Jonah Biblical figure and in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the story of Jonah.</v>

8
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Jonah was owed on a rough ocean storm</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had been commanded by God to do</v>

9
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:46.011
<v Speaker 1>something which he was ignoring and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the storm was sufficiently rough so that</v>

10
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>he got cast overboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was eaten by this giant.</v>

11
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>This is a whale as far as the medieval</v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval people were concerned.</v>

12
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously not what we would think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of as a whale,</v>

13
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know much about whales</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

14
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:04.131
<v Speaker 1>He was swallowed up by a whale and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>cast back up on shore a number of days</v>

15
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a death and rebirth story.</v>

16
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I use it as an image is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

17
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>it represents something of psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>import that you're all familiar with,</v>

18
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>but that you might not know that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with.</v>

19
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Symbols are often like that.</v>

20
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Assemble often stands for something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>but that you don't know that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things that you know</v>

22
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everything is like that.</v>

23
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>In fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's rather obvious if you think</v>

24
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>about it because if you are transparent</v>
<v Speaker 1>to yourself and you knew everything,</v>

25
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have to study anything</v>

26
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>about psychology because you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that yourself completely.</v>

27
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And we understand ourselves poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we have to study ourselves as</v>

28
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>individuals and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:53.971
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

30
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>as phenomena in the world as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as other people and that edit and</v>

31
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>there's mammals in this animals and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>living things and as political actors</v>

32
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to get some minor notion of what's</v>

33
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>actually going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means in part is that</v>

34
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>you're more complicated than you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

35
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>And when you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say psychoanalytic thinkers talking</v>

36
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>about ideas like the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious is actually a</v>

37
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 1>representation in some ways of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's far more to you than you</v>

38
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.604
<v Speaker 1>know about.</v>

39
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>And that what that means also is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different kinds of</v>

40
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we certainly know that to be the</v>

41
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are different kinds of memory,</v>

42
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of your procedural knowledge is</v>

43
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your procedural knowledge is what</v>

44
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>allows you to do things like ride a bike</v>
<v Speaker 1>or walk for that matter,</v>

45
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>because you don't really know how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>

46
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>You haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a controlled fall.</v>

47
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>So you lean forward and then you use</v>
<v Speaker 1>your legs to stop you from falling on</v>

48
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:49.670
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

49
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

50
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>it's encoded in your architecture rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than something and it's apprehensible to</v>

51
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>your conscious understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there are lots of,</v>

52
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of phenomena that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedural in the unconscious.</v>

53
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>And then there was sort of borderline</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that you have some idea about</v>

54
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>that you can represent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still don't completely</v>

55
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:11.164
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

56
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>So what sorts of representations tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be more into just stick?</v>

57
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>And those are the sorts of things maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pop up in your fantasies and your</v>

58
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are also this sorts of</v>

59
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>unconscious sources of knowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow you to understand,</v>

60
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex work works of literature or art</v>

61
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>that draw their meaning from multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>sources,</v>

62
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>simultaneous seely and attempt to inform</v>
<v Speaker 1>you on a deep level about how things are</v>

63
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>connected and how they're different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this particular image is a journey</v>

64
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>to the underworld image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very,</v>

65
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>very old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journey to the underworld.</v>

66
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe the oldest myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the oldest mythological</v>

67
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>ideas or one of the oldest archetipal</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

68
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>And the underworld is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a difficult,</v>

69
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a difficult phenomenon to grasp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you can certainly encountered</v>

70
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.380
<v Speaker 1>the concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in movies.</v>

71
00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>So for most of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have seen all the Harry</v>

72
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Potter movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.821
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

74
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in the second movie,</v>

75
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's the second movie where</v>
<v Speaker 1>pottery counters of basilisk underneath</v>

76
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>hogwarts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

77
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>The second one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that story is a journey to the</v>

79
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:22.891
<v Speaker 1>underworld story and the architectural</v>
<v Speaker 1>setup of the kind of the of the movie.</v>

80
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>By architectural setup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the relationship of Hogwarts,</v>

81
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>the castle to the underground structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a symbolic representation of the</v>

82
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>representation of consciousness embedded</v>
<v Speaker 1>in culture.</v>

83
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be partnered as</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and bedded in the realm of</v>

84
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>magical knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

85
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>It's outside of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

86
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.470
<v Speaker 1>that's represented by the castle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:47.304
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a representation of knowledge cast</v>

89
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 1>in stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a form of memory to cast</v>

90
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>something in stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so potter and his friends are being</v>

91
00:04:56.351 --> 00:05:00.330
<v Speaker 1>enculturated in this enclosed</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment in the safe enclosed</v>

92
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>environments like a university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the university,</v>

93
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>more on the other side of the campus</v>
<v Speaker 1>then on this side for,</v>

94
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>for various reasons.</v>

95
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Now underneath the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the well in the background,</v>

96
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Potter series,</v>

97
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a battle between good and evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

98
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's also an extremely old</v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural idea.</v>

99
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's an idea that's probably as</v>
<v Speaker 1>old as human beings.</v>

100
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very strange creatures and they're</v>

101
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 1>capable of very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 1>what would you call profound acts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>deception.</v>

103
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that separates</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings from most other animals is</v>

104
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>our capacity to use deception and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with our imaginativeness,</v>

105
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we can imagine a variety of</v>

106
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>alternative potential realities and move</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards them.</v>

107
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>That opens the door for us to deceive</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and others because we can</v>

108
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:50.311
<v Speaker 1>replace our accurate vision of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so far as it's accurate with whatever</v>

109
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>vision and representation we wish to</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose.</v>

110
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you find in childhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

111
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the smarter child,</v>

112
00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>the earlier they learn to lie and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an offshoot of the ability to use</v>

113
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:06.010
<v Speaker 1>fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the idea of good versus evil part</v>

114
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>comes out of that to some degree because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with people,</v>

115
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>you're always dealing with phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can trick you in some way.</v>

116
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>They can represent reality as other than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

117
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 1>and that that's a tremendous problem for</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings because it makes other</v>

118
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>people extremely difficult to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

119
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're honest and straight forward,</v>

120
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>then you're easy to figure out because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be figured out.</v>

121
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I can just take you at your word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you'll tell me something and</v>

122
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 1>it'll be relatively straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be able to understand it and then</v>

123
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>you'll go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

124
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to know anything about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

125
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do things according to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say you'll do,</v>

126
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>then Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottomless pit of incomprehensibility</v>

127
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 1>and God only knows what you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be up to.</v>

128
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an architectural problem for</v>

129
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem of having to deal</v>

130
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>with the late deceptive capacity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

131
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>And of course the for ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's all going on in the background</v>

132
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>and the Potter series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But underneath the castle,</v>

133
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

134
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 1>remember what's under the castle in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

135
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 1>in the second film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

136
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a vassilis,</v>

137
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.061
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:12.960
<v Speaker 1>And what happens when you look at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>LISC,</v>

139
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>

140
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 1>what might that mean if you're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it intelligently,</v>

141
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:22.730
<v Speaker 1>say w what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What phenomena might that,</v>

142
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 1>that represent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens to prey animals when they</v>

143
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>encounter of creditor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they freeze.</v>

144
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.201
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's a representation of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are certain classes of</v>

146
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that will freeze you on site</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you freeze because there are parts</v>

147
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>of your brain that respond to phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the external world as if you are</v>

148
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:44.270
<v Speaker 1>praying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

149
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>well per first you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and second from an evolutionary</v>

150
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're your ancestry going back say tens</v>

151
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 1>of millions of years is an ancestry that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was composed of predessessors that we're</v>

152
00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 1>continually preyed upon.</v>

153
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.380
<v Speaker 1>And we have entire systems in our brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>that react to the class of potentially</v>

154
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 1>predatory events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for human beings,</v>

155
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:15.260
<v Speaker 1>that system has differentiated</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitively so that many of the things</v>

156
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 1>that we would experience as predatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>threats in the modern world don't come</v>

157
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:23.800
<v Speaker 1>in the shape of say crocodiles and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears and you know,</v>

158
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.460
<v Speaker 1>giant cats and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sorts of things that would</v>

159
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>necessarily pray on you in the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are analogous in that</v>

160
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.150
<v Speaker 1>the outcome is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be preyed upon by many things</v>

161
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.940
<v Speaker 1>you can be preyed upon by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>a corrupt corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's perfectly reasonable to</v>

163
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:45.611
<v Speaker 1>symbolize the actions of a corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation as a form of predation.</v>

164
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.260
<v Speaker 1>And also to categorize that even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply as a reflection of the underlying</v>

165
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the fact that people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>deceive each other.</v>

166
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Those sorts of get deep very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

167
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.460
<v Speaker 1>But there they're active and living</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations in the,</v>

168
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 1>they still represent something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>profoundly true,</v>

169
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.460
<v Speaker 1>which is not so much what things are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of themselves,</v>

170
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>which is what science does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what things are in relationship to</v>

171
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more like what things mean and</v>

172
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>things generally have a motivational or</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional meaning.</v>

173
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And that meaning is generally quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly tied to the necessity that you</v>

174
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 1>have to survive and to thrive and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 1>to find someone to be with and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduce in all the Darwinian things</v>

176
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 1>that you're supposed to be up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these more archaic</v>

177
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there meaningful categories,</v>

178
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 1>their categories of meeting that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an,</v>

179
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly reasonable way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it,</v>

180
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.960
<v Speaker 1>knowing the partner situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is related to this image.</v>

181
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.450
<v Speaker 1>The one that's up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that everything that's</v>

182
00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 1>stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>rests on something that's unstable and</v>

183
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:52.554
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

184
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's underneath in the potter</v>
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>

185
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually in the series,</v>

186
00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 1>but particularly in the second episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the second episode,</v>

187
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:08.331
<v Speaker 1>is that partner has to go down the neat</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to encounter something that's</v>

188
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>terrifying and deadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

189
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 1>that's actually preying on his friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the community.</v>

190
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very much like,</v>

191
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.770
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hobbit having to go off and,</v>

192
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.950
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

193
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steel treasure from,</v>

194
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>from smog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the dragon's name is,</v>

195
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.490
<v Speaker 1>and except that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the potter sequence,</v>

196
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the basilisk,</v>

197
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.960
<v Speaker 1>they're equivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing as this,</v>

198
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

199
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:36.210
<v Speaker 1>in the hall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Dragon Court's goal.</v>

200
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in the potter representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does the basilisk guard,</v>

201
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.380
<v Speaker 1>what's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has it captured?</v>

202
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.740
<v Speaker 1>It's the little redheaded girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

203
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.041
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

204
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very old story.</v>

205
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no partners kind of in love with her</v>

206
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

207
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.110
<v Speaker 1>they're young and sort of platonic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

208
00:10:58.111 --> 00:11:00.270
<v Speaker 1>you can see the relationship sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>burgeoning.</v>

209
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 1>And now he has to confront this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terrifying,</v>

210
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:08.070
<v Speaker 1>that exists underneath everything in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to free this original finger from</v>

211
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 1>the clutches of something terrible in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reptilian.</v>

212
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting story.</v>

213
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:17.040
<v Speaker 1>That and what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole variety of things.</v>

214
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.140
<v Speaker 1>And what it means to some degree is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

215
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a male human being can't really become</v>

216
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:27.220
<v Speaker 1>mature until he confronts the terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that lie underneath the civilized</v>

217
00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:29.730
<v Speaker 1>veneer of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that means,</v>

218
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing it means is that</v>

219
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.440
<v Speaker 1>it's the capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the capacity of the male in that</v>

220
00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:41.190
<v Speaker 1>situation to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes him attractive enough to wake</v>

221
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:43.770
<v Speaker 1>up to females that he might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with.</v>

222
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's like a sleeping beauty motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

223
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.160
<v Speaker 1>it has evolutionary echoes because much</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what we've battled with for the last</v>

224
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 1>60 million years say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think you can trace the</v>

225
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:59.040
<v Speaker 1>development of our cognitive structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite straightforwardly,</v>

226
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 1>back 60 billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been an endless battle between</v>

227
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 1>human beings and predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many of those predators were</v>

228
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:07.090
<v Speaker 1>reptilian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

229
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the result of a very,</v>

230
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:12.130
<v Speaker 1>very long battle between mammals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reptiles.</v>

231
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:17.131
<v Speaker 1>And in our case particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it appears that part of the reason we</v>

232
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 1>evolved our tool using the past to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't great capacity for vision was</v>

233
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 1>because our ancestors were continually</v>
<v Speaker 1>preyed upon by predatory snakes when</v>

234
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 1>they lived in trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a long time ago.</v>

235
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And so he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's symbolic representations are</v>

236
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably archaic and they're kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>as archaic as the underlying biological</v>

237
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:38.740
<v Speaker 1>systems in your brain that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that provide you with motivation and</v>

238
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

239
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.460
<v Speaker 1>And those are extremely old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You share those with while you share</v>

240
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 1>those with any animal that you have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope whatsoever of understanding at all.</v>

241
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 1>And that even means lizards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

242
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.730
<v Speaker 1>my daughter had these lizards that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>

243
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

244
00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 1>there in the desert kind of lizard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make a good initial pet,</v>

245
00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:59.950
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very funny little creatures</v>

246
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 1>cause they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 1>they're very lizard light being that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're lizards and they have points a</v>

248
00:13:04.631 --> 00:13:07.990
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you put them in water,</v>

249
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:09.850
<v Speaker 1>they puff themselves up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite fun.</v>

250
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 1>And then they zoom around in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>

251
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>they like to stack on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>

252
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:17.680
<v Speaker 1>very social and they're friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not exactly something that</v>

253
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 1>you'd expect from a lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

254
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.940
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is that even something that's</v>

255
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.830
<v Speaker 1>distant as that from you and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary hierarchy shares enough</v>

256
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:31.180
<v Speaker 1>commonality of biological structure with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you so that you can understand a fair</v>

257
00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:32.350
<v Speaker 1>bit of it's motivation.</v>

258
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 1>So for sample it's pretty easy to tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>when one of those lizards,</v>

259
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 1>even though they're basically friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's angry cause it'll puff up his and</v>

260
00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 1>you know right away you don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a discussion with the rest of your</v>

261
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 1>family to figure out that that's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry lizard.</v>

262
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And see it maps onto your body</v>

263
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:49.930
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

264
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.870
<v Speaker 1>the same thing applies to snakes even</v>
<v Speaker 1>applies to insects.</v>

265
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Lots of insects have developed the kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of warning behavior that will</v>

266
00:13:56.441 --> 00:14:01.441
<v Speaker 1>immediately signal to you that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>about to be bitten or it's usually been</v>

267
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:02.494
<v Speaker 1>with insects.</v>

268
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is all to say that there are</v>

269
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:12.310
<v Speaker 1>levels of understanding that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath say your,</v>

270
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your normative,</v>

271
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.730
<v Speaker 1>mundane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>day to day comprehension that informed</v>

272
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.150
<v Speaker 1>everything that you do with deep levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning.</v>

273
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.170
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the activities that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue that you might regard as</v>

274
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually draw on those representations</v>

275
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:32.620
<v Speaker 1>and you find them entertaining because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually deeply meaningful.</v>

276
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Now the idea that a man can be swallowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>or human being because there are myths</v>

277
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:41.290
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible] where the protagonist</v>
<v Speaker 1>is clearly female,</v>

278
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 1>where they the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an underground journey and then</v>

279
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 1>a reemergence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

280
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's the journey to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>

281
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the journey that Terry partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>undertakes continually,</v>

282
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the far series,</v>

283
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 1>the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking different forms,</v>

284
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>

285
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.680
<v Speaker 1>as the series progressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

286
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 1>now that's also with death and rebirth</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

287
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

288
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.150
<v Speaker 1>that's a very old and profound idea and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually one of the most</v>

289
00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:09.950
<v Speaker 1>profound ideas that human beings have.</v>

290
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will spend time in your life</v>

291
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:17.930
<v Speaker 1>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>

292
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:18.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

293
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means what the potter movie,</v>

294
00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:24.110
<v Speaker 1>the second part of movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was trying to represent it,</v>

295
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:27.110
<v Speaker 1>which is that there will be times in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind where you are faced with</v>

296
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:29.420
<v Speaker 1>things that will terrify you into</v>
<v Speaker 1>paralysis.</v>

297
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.320
<v Speaker 1>And that will take you underneath your</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal set of assumptions.</v>

298
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Because when your normal set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions are functioning,</v>

299
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't end up facing something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying enough to,</v>

300
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.050
<v Speaker 1>to freeze you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When your normal set of assumptions that</v>

301
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 1>are working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world stays happily predictable</v>

302
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:48.230
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the time that's where you</v>

303
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the normal world that's blown</v>

304
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:52.640
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever something that you're</v>

305
00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 1>attempting to do fails in a dramatic or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less dramatic way,</v>

306
00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.310
<v Speaker 1>the more dramatic the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deeper you go into the underworld</v>

307
00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:05.540
<v Speaker 1>and the underworld is in some sense the</v>
<v Speaker 1>substructures of your preset positions.</v>

308
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this already because I don't</v>

309
00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:12.260
<v Speaker 1>suppose there's a single person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize and spent some time in the</v>

310
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:13.280
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

311
00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:16.970
<v Speaker 1>because this is what happens when</v>
<v Speaker 1>something terrible happens to you.</v>

312
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrible.</v>

313
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of classic categories of</v>

314
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.460
<v Speaker 1>events that send you to the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of someone you love,</v>

316
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.360
<v Speaker 1>a serious illness of some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either for you or for someone you love.</v>

317
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of a dream of some sort,</v>

318
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:34.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got some goals that you think</v>

319
00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 1>is really important and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out for one reason or another</v>

320
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 1>that there's just no way you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to pursue it.</v>

321
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 1>A betrayal that's a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

322
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.070
<v Speaker 1>that's a really rough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that'll send you for,</v>

323
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>that'll throw you for a loop for sure.</v>

324
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.380
<v Speaker 1>So they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all elements of the part of the</v>

325
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:55.460
<v Speaker 1>world that you can't control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in some sense always remains beyond</v>

326
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:58.460
<v Speaker 1>your control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has in some sense a predatory</v>

327
00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 1>relationship too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it could devour you at least</v>

328
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:04.460
<v Speaker 1>metaphysically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when that happens,</v>

329
00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:07.250
<v Speaker 1>you go somewhere and the place that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go is very dangerous.</v>

330
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:09.740
<v Speaker 1>It's underneath everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you come back out and if you</v>

331
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:11.990
<v Speaker 1>come back out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that you've</v>

332
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:16.310
<v Speaker 1>reconstructed your erroneous</v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition so that you can function</v>

333
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:17.960
<v Speaker 1>once again in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

334
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't.</v>

335
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>So people who have post traumatic stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

336
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:23.930
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go into the underworld and just</v>

337
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:25.490
<v Speaker 1>stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

338
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:27.490
<v Speaker 1>and if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're chronically depressed or if he</v>

339
00:17:27.491 --> 00:17:30.050
<v Speaker 1>can't get over your grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you're in a state of continual</v>

340
00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:33.470
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and upset or if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic for that matter,</v>

341
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you exist essentially in an underworld</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain because you can't master the</v>

342
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 1>perceptual apparatus that culturally</v>
<v Speaker 1>informed perceptual apparatus that would</v>

343
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:48.320
<v Speaker 1>help you orient yourself in the world so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the things that you want to have</v>

344
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 1>happen and that you need to have happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happened.</v>

345
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's what that picture means.</v>

346
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.310
<v Speaker 1>It also means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

347
00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:03.311
<v Speaker 1>that you know people have the capacity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to die and be reborn at different levels</v>

348
00:18:03.591 --> 00:18:04.670
<v Speaker 1>of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

349
00:18:04.671 --> 00:18:09.060
<v Speaker 1>there are minor disappointments that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter when you have to drop some</v>

350
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.610
<v Speaker 1>precept position that you have and let</v>
<v Speaker 1>it die and then put a new one in its</v>

351
00:18:13.611 --> 00:18:16.430
<v Speaker 1>place and that's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's nowhere near as painful.</v>

352
00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:19.760
<v Speaker 1>It's holding onto the things when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't work because then you just end up</v>

353
00:18:19.761 --> 00:18:24.470
<v Speaker 1>wandering around just sort of clouded</v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of dad presuppositions and</v>

354
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.000
<v Speaker 1>nothing that you ever want will happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>under that circumstance because you're,</v>

355
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.460
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're armed with tools that don't fit</v>

356
00:18:31.461 --> 00:18:34.010
<v Speaker 1>the world and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you tried to apply them,</v>

357
00:18:34.011 --> 00:18:37.910
<v Speaker 1>the world won't do what you want them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and then that's endlessly anxiety</v>

358
00:18:37.911 --> 00:18:41.030
<v Speaker 1>provoking and frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of</v>

359
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.790
<v Speaker 1>pain is as part of the price that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid in some ways for being updatable</v>

360
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the world transforms around you</v>

361
00:18:49.851 --> 00:18:52.580
<v Speaker 1>and as a consequence you have to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to transform with it.</v>

362
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it runs ahead of you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get left behind that,</v>

363
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to people to some degree.</v>

364
00:18:57.381 --> 00:18:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says the age,</v>

365
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.150
<v Speaker 1>that's actually one of the evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations for why people got,</v>

366
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.210
<v Speaker 1>cause it's a mystery right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were elements of you,</v>

367
00:19:05.211 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 1>they're rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to just sounds that</v>

368
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:10.551
<v Speaker 1>give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give,</v>

369
00:19:10.551 --> 00:19:12.740
<v Speaker 1>rise to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are immortal there?</v>

370
00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the DNA that produced,</v>

371
00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:17.090
<v Speaker 1>he was at least three and a half billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

372
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.820
<v Speaker 1>It might be older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So structures getting entertained</v>

373
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.390
<v Speaker 1>themselves over unbelievably vast</v>
<v Speaker 1>expanses of time.</v>

374
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.930
<v Speaker 1>So it's not self evident why human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have to die like we do and we die</v>

375
00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:32.420
<v Speaker 1>at about after you're done being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandparent is kind of when you're,</v>

376
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.350
<v Speaker 1>when you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hypothesis is is that at that</v>

377
00:19:36.351 --> 00:19:38.990
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense it's too costly to keep</v>

378
00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:42.170
<v Speaker 1>you updated and you have to be replaced</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a younger version of twitter.</v>

379
00:19:42.171 --> 00:19:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat your grandchildren or whatever.</v>

380
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've sort of exhausted your</v>

381
00:19:46.221 --> 00:19:50.300
<v Speaker 1>plasticity and flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job that it's cheaper just to</v>

382
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:53.120
<v Speaker 1>replace you then to update.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

383
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.900
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a drag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

384
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.213
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

385
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.090
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the funny question for you.</v>

386
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.680
<v Speaker 1>This is the question that scientists are</v>
<v Speaker 1>always devoted towards answering.</v>

387
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 1>What's the world made up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

388
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 1>that's a complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

389
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.660
<v Speaker 1>the simple answer is that it's made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of matter</v>

390
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 1>and that matter is made out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that theory was the room originally</v>

391
00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:45.120
<v Speaker 1>formulated by Democritus Kabaka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This didn't exactly say that the world</v>

392
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 1>was made up us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said the world was of atoms.</v>

393
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 1>And space and that actually happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter because the way that atoms are</v>

394
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 1>arranged in space gives rise to another</v>
<v Speaker 1>property which has information.</v>

395
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.630
<v Speaker 1>And so if you haven't Adams in space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have information and you can</v>

396
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:04.420
<v Speaker 1>think of the world is being made of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information just as easily as you can</v>

397
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:07.030
<v Speaker 1>think of it as being made of matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

398
00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:09.630
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know I'm not alone in this cycle</v>

399
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.050
<v Speaker 1>emphasis that it's actually more useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>to conceive of the ground of reality as</v>

400
00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 1>being something like information rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than being something like matter.</v>

401
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.130
<v Speaker 1>But we don't have to discuss that at</v>
<v Speaker 1>lake at the moment.</v>

402
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.590
<v Speaker 1>What we'll say instead is that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way of looking at the world is the</v>

403
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:29.950
<v Speaker 1>materialistic perspective and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>materialistic perspective is a very</v>

404
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 1>powerful perspective and it's basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominant for about since the time of</v>

405
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:35.660
<v Speaker 1>gale Galileo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

406
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 1>that's about when that prospective got</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly going.</v>

407
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.470
<v Speaker 1>And for many reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacon,</v>

408
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.830
<v Speaker 1>descartes as well were major players in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the establishment of the materialistic</v>

409
00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:48.520
<v Speaker 1>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it came about because in many ways,</v>

410
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:52.150
<v Speaker 1>because people were suffering from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to understand objective</v>

411
00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

412
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still suffer from that because there</v>

413
00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Speaker 1>are all sorts of diseases we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do with and we age and you know,</v>

414
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.570
<v Speaker 1>things don't work out exactly like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to.</v>

415
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And so we pay a big price for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance.</v>

416
00:22:03.431 --> 00:22:05.430
<v Speaker 1>And so we're motivated to overcome it.</v>

417
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:10.370
<v Speaker 1>And one way we have overcome it was by</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing materialistic philosophy and</v>

418
00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:15.100
<v Speaker 1>not materialistic philosophy enabled us</v>
<v Speaker 1>to specify the structure of certain</v>

419
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:18.130
<v Speaker 1>elements of the world and then to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>to predict and control it at least to</v>

420
00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:19.600
<v Speaker 1>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

421
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.040
<v Speaker 1>you learn to predict and control</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and sometimes you generate</v>

422
00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:26.500
<v Speaker 1>more monsters doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's problematic.</v>

423
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:29.530
<v Speaker 1>But all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a lot better to live now</v>

424
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:34.540
<v Speaker 1>that until live three or 400 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So or maybe even 30 years ago for that</v>

425
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:37.750
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like the whole materialistic</v>

426
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:42.040
<v Speaker 1>thing is be doing a lot of good for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there it also has some serious</v>

427
00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:46.840
<v Speaker 1>problems and the problems have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with another fundamental problem that</v>

428
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:51.430
<v Speaker 1>human beings have to solve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you should do about what</v>

429
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.360
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because human beings are dynamic and</v>

430
00:22:55.361 --> 00:22:56.350
<v Speaker 1>active creatures.</v>

431
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.200
<v Speaker 1>And so we do not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not mere machines of</v>

432
00:22:59.201 --> 00:23:02.200
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't just care what the world is.</v>

433
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.600
<v Speaker 1>We care what you should do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

434
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we care for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

435
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.640
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental reason if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it from a scientific</v>

436
00:23:09.641 --> 00:23:11.410
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is essentially Darwinian.</v>

437
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine the conflict between the</v>

438
00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:21.451
<v Speaker 1>moral worldview and the materialistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview as a battle in some sense</v>

439
00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:25.960
<v Speaker 1>between Newton and Darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Newton was the,</v>

440
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.020
<v Speaker 1>was the author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental author of the idea that</v>

441
00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:32.800
<v Speaker 1>the world was made out of material and</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and operated like a machine,</v>

442
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a pretty powerful perspective.</v>

443
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.130
<v Speaker 1>That perspective came about during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time of clocks.</v>

444
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 1>And when Europeans in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're starting to build things that</v>

445
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.510
<v Speaker 1>would function in a very predictable</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner once they were set in motion.</v>

446
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:52.540
<v Speaker 1>So Newton in some sense was influenced</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that at an assumed that the entire</v>

447
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.630
<v Speaker 1>cosmos could be understood as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deterministic machine.</v>

448
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

449
00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Speaker 1>that it would be ultimately predictable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and controllable.</v>

450
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.920
<v Speaker 1>And in a famous statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think this was new,</v>

451
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.710
<v Speaker 1>and although I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've been descartes</v>

452
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that if you knew the</v>

453
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:15.491
<v Speaker 1>position of every subatomic or Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every odd atomic particle in existence,</v>

454
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:18.200
<v Speaker 1>if you knew the position and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum of those particles,</v>

455
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.750
<v Speaker 1>that you could then predict the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome of the future.</v>

456
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.200
<v Speaker 1>It was strictly deterministic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing that stopped you from</v>

457
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 1>being able to describe everything in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of machinery was your ignorance.</v>

458
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.650
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing at the bottom of the</v>

459
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:31.700
<v Speaker 1>cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

460
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 1>that was fundamentally unknowable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

461
00:24:33.921 --> 00:24:37.280
<v Speaker 1>that turned out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really discovered to be wrong</v>

462
00:24:37.281 --> 00:24:38.120
<v Speaker 1>until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

463
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.250
<v Speaker 1>the first couple of decades of the 20th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

464
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.810
<v Speaker 1>But it definitely turned out to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

465
00:24:41.811 --> 00:24:46.490
<v Speaker 1>We now know that in under no conceivable</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions could we gather enough</v>

466
00:24:46.491 --> 00:24:51.050
<v Speaker 1>information to predict the outcome of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what appears to be a relatively</v>

467
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:54.350
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable costco's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are levels of resolution that</v>

468
00:24:54.351 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 1>remained relatively constant and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can manipulate.</v>

469
00:24:56.871 --> 00:25:00.140
<v Speaker 1>But our hope for total knowledgist is</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

470
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.890
<v Speaker 1>And that was mostly your consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of quantum mechanics.</v>

471
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And the quantum theories have never</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed an experimental tests.</v>

472
00:25:07.621 --> 00:25:10.250
<v Speaker 1>They're the most powerful theories that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have ever designed.</v>

473
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:13.520
<v Speaker 1>So in some ways they seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're probably not final,</v>

474
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.140
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty final,</v>

475
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.513
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

476
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:18.590
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

477
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

478
00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:21.400
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's sort of the materialist stand</v>

479
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.810
<v Speaker 1>if things now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now there's a Darwinian and the face.</v>

480
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:28.310
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you about</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of these things is because part of</v>

481
00:25:28.311 --> 00:25:31.490
<v Speaker 1>what we need to solve in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress properly with this course,</v>

482
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.870
<v Speaker 1>we need to solve the problem of exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes truth.</v>

483
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that I might say is that</v>

484
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.750
<v Speaker 1>truth in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not something is true is a</v>

485
00:25:41.751 --> 00:25:46.310
<v Speaker 1>question that's sort of like whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a tool that you have does the job</v>

486
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Speaker 1>that it has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much a question about the</v>

487
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:53.930
<v Speaker 1>ultimate nature of reality because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get a truth that completely</v>

488
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.330
<v Speaker 1>informs you about the ultimate teacher</v>
<v Speaker 1>in reality.</v>

489
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.490
<v Speaker 1>So you're sort of stuck with partial</v>
<v Speaker 1>truths.</v>

490
00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

491
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:04.931
<v Speaker 1>how do you tell a useful partial truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a non useful partial truth or maybe</v>

492
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.460
<v Speaker 1>a partial truth from a lie or from</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction?</v>

493
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one way you can progress towards</v>

494
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:15.080
<v Speaker 1>that is to start thinking about things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of their tool like</v>

495
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.250
<v Speaker 1>capability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a pragmatic approach.</v>

496
00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:21.170
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Intel esophageal perspective,</v>

497
00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:24.160
<v Speaker 1>the pragmatists who were very influenced</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Charles dark,</v>

498
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to the conclusion at the beginning</v>

499
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:31.901
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That truth was bounded by claims of</v>

500
00:26:32.481 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 1>practicality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're trying to determine whether</v>

501
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:39.440
<v Speaker 1>a statement is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the implicit question that goes along</v>

502
00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:43.320
<v Speaker 1>with that is true in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what end.</v>

503
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the question then is sort of like,</v>

504
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.100
<v Speaker 1>is your tool that you're using to</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the world or to act on it good</v>

505
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 1>enough to do what you're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it?</v>

506
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And then if it's good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're playing just true enough.</v>

507
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Now this is tightly tied to Darwinian</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and the pragmatists recognize</v>

508
00:27:01.241 --> 00:27:03.700
<v Speaker 1>this right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The private just for American group,</v>

509
00:27:03.701 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 1>as philosophers who worked on the east</v>
<v Speaker 1>coast,</v>

510
00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:08.010
<v Speaker 1>particularly in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were,</v>

511
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.000
<v Speaker 1>they immediately took Darwinian</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian hypothesis to their,</v>

512
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.650
<v Speaker 1>to their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their heart,</v>

513
00:27:13.651 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

514
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Because the Darwinian hypothesis is also</v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic.</v>

515
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:22.080
<v Speaker 1>That Darwinian hypothesis says whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is,</v>

516
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.130
<v Speaker 1>is and also becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's something,</v>

517
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:29.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that's changing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it changes in a way that's actually</v>

518
00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:31.890
<v Speaker 1>not predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's technically,</v>

519
00:27:31.891 --> 00:27:34.740
<v Speaker 1>it's not predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the stock market in that way.</v>

520
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.040
<v Speaker 1>There are periods of time over which you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make predictions,</v>

521
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:40.160
<v Speaker 1>but if you wait long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you think you're going to</v>

522
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 1>end up wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially given what knowledge is for a</v>

523
00:27:43.501 --> 00:27:46.170
<v Speaker 1>human being because your knowledge is</v>
<v Speaker 1>bounded that you know.</v>

524
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.680
<v Speaker 1>And so the way the Darwinian process</v>
<v Speaker 1>souls,</v>

525
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:54.681
<v Speaker 1>that is by death essentially things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't good enough to solve the problem</v>

526
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:59.130
<v Speaker 1>that currently presents the presents</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself to them either die or failed to</v>

527
00:27:59.131 --> 00:28:04.131
<v Speaker 1>reproduce and to the degree that</v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms can come up with truth claims</v>

528
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.120
<v Speaker 1>that are sufficient than they live long</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to reproduce and then the next</v>

529
00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:13.350
<v Speaker 1>generation faces the same problem and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always the way it is is that</v>

530
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.490
<v Speaker 1>truth chases a reality that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally unpredictable and it's</v>

531
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:18.660
<v Speaker 1>transforming constantly.</v>

532
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason,</v>

533
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.730
<v Speaker 1>the reason I want to tell you that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said the important thing to understand</v>

534
00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:28.620
<v Speaker 1>because I'm going to make a claim here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the ways of looking at the world</v>

535
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:32.850
<v Speaker 1>that are more mythological than material</v>
<v Speaker 1>are also real ways of looking at the</v>

536
00:28:32.851 --> 00:28:35.820
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not what people generally think</v>

537
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:37.930
<v Speaker 1>because you think about fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not real.</v>

538
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Underneath fiction isn't mythology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious claims and that sort of thing.</v>

539
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:45.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the domain of fiction in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology and we don't think about that</v>

540
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 1>as real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's because we think about what's</v>

541
00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:51.510
<v Speaker 1>real from a Newtonian perspective and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not from a Darwinian perspective,</v>

542
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.920
<v Speaker 1>from a Darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also a claim that nature may,</v>

543
00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:01.030
<v Speaker 1>you said truth serves the life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what Darwin would say is you can't</v>

544
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 1>define truth in any other way than that</v>
<v Speaker 1>which serves life.</v>

545
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.070
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get past that.</v>

546
00:29:08.071 --> 00:29:13.020
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a truth past that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth as far as a bounded living</v>

547
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:15.510
<v Speaker 1>organism is concerned and that certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs us,</v>

548
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.780
<v Speaker 1>is the body of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual and embodied that best</v>

549
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.260
<v Speaker 1>enables survival in the face of</v>
<v Speaker 1>continual transformation.</v>

550
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing under it.</v>

551
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you know that,</v>

552
00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:34.650
<v Speaker 1>then what happens is that it turns out</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the things that mean things to you</v>

553
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 1>are also real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

554
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.060
<v Speaker 1>science is a funny business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

555
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Because what science attempted to do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for good and for</v>

556
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.160
<v Speaker 1>very useful reasons was to strip</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything subjective and subjectively</v>

557
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:50.160
<v Speaker 1>meaningful off the picture of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

558
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be objective.</v>

559
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.630
<v Speaker 1>And part of the way you do that is by</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning to suppress your own</v>

560
00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:58.540
<v Speaker 1>subjectivity in the search for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective truth.</v>

561
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.920
<v Speaker 1>But also you do that by relying on other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's observations.</v>

562
00:30:01.921 --> 00:30:05.530
<v Speaker 1>So we kind of make a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the deal is if I see it and can</v>

563
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:08.290
<v Speaker 1>describe it and you see it and can</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe it,</v>

564
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.350
<v Speaker 1>and then a bunch of other people do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing and we come to the same</v>

565
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:13.780
<v Speaker 1>conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to treat that as real.</v>

566
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's useful because it,</v>

567
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:22.690
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to specify things precisely</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to put them in the appropriate</v>

568
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:24.250
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a sense,</v>

569
00:30:24.251 --> 00:30:28.090
<v Speaker 1>that's what science does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it continually strives to</v>

570
00:30:28.091 --> 00:30:31.350
<v Speaker 1>differentiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate things and put them in</v>

571
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 1>identifiable categories.</v>

572
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.880
<v Speaker 1>And that means that increasingly we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to use what we categorize as</v>

573
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:38.740
<v Speaker 1>knowledge to help us confront the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

574
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

575
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great process,</v>

576
00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.790
<v Speaker 1>brilliant process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's even more remarkable because</v>

577
00:30:45.791 --> 00:30:48.550
<v Speaker 1>relatively stupid people could do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a,</v>

578
00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.380
<v Speaker 1>it's algorithmic based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

579
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 1>the science is a method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so once you know the method,</v>

580
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.320
<v Speaker 1>you don't even have to be that smart to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make progress.</v>

581
00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:59.950
<v Speaker 1>You could just grind away at something</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the method and sooner or later</v>

582
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.700
<v Speaker 1>you'll produce new information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

583
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

584
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.640
<v Speaker 1>that's a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

585
00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:08.641
<v Speaker 1>it's like a science is like a factory</v>
<v Speaker 1>that produces knowledge so well,</v>

586
00:31:09.191 --> 00:31:10.990
<v Speaker 1>so that's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

587
00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.500
<v Speaker 1>what's not so wonderful about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably is that it's,</v>

588
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:21.700
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war are our concept of what constitutes</v>

589
00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:24.550
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's never really solved as far as I</v>

590
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:26.680
<v Speaker 1>can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this conflict between the Newtonian</v>

591
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 1>perspective on what's real at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian perspective,</v>

592
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:30.154
<v Speaker 1>on what's real.</v>

593
00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.630
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell Darren and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's new,</v>

594
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 1>and that's true if you're a biologist</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure,</v>

595
00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:40.930
<v Speaker 1>because there isn't anything that's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>true that sits underneath biology,</v>

596
00:31:40.931 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 1>didn't a theory of natural selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly a philosophical claim.</v>

597
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.490
<v Speaker 1>And the claim is because you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent all of the external reality</v>

598
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 1>with ultimate accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fail in everything</v>

599
00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:58.630
<v Speaker 1>that's bounded or even everything that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as complex as the thing that's</v>

600
00:31:58.631 --> 00:32:01.180
<v Speaker 1>trying to be represented is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>

601
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 1>So how do you deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you deal with that?</v>

602
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 1>You generate variations and it somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be somewhat random because you</v>

603
00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:12.370
<v Speaker 1>don't know what's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You generate random variations and then</v>

604
00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:17.610
<v Speaker 1>hopefully one of those variations will</v>
<v Speaker 1>work in relationship to whatever is</v>

605
00:32:17.861 --> 00:32:21.100
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's also a kind of truth,</v>

606
00:32:21.101 --> 00:32:23.020
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes and embodied truth claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

607
00:32:23.021 --> 00:32:27.130
<v Speaker 1>You carry the fundamental truth of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence in the shape of your</v>

608
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:32.250
<v Speaker 1>physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in on earlier claims a philosophical</v>

609
00:32:32.711 --> 00:32:35.020
<v Speaker 1>truth where most of the disembodied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

610
00:32:35.021 --> 00:32:39.620
<v Speaker 1>there was some implicit idea that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness or the soul was more real</v>

611
00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 1>than the block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

612
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to think about that in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways because it opens the door to the</v>

613
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 1>idea of things like in mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't seem to be very</v>

614
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.333
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

615
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.830
<v Speaker 1>It's hard not to associate that with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

616
00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:57.910
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So category systems</v>

617
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.330
<v Speaker 2>w</v>

618
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.640
<v Speaker 1>when you encounter something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightens you,</v>

619
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:10.080
<v Speaker 1>your body categorizes it and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>categorizes it as something that</v>

620
00:33:10.081 --> 00:33:15.081
<v Speaker 1>presents a danger or threat to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And danger is the probability that</v>

621
00:33:16.441 --> 00:33:19.950
<v Speaker 1>something will damage you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it'll be too loud or too hot or too</v>

622
00:33:19.951 --> 00:33:22.250
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll damage your sensory systems or</v>

623
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.670
<v Speaker 1>directly pose a threat to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological or psychological</v>

624
00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:29.280
<v Speaker 1>integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your design,</v>

625
00:33:29.281 --> 00:33:31.770
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect yourself against that,</v>

626
00:33:31.771 --> 00:33:34.410
<v Speaker 1>you feel pain for that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead of paying,</v>

627
00:33:34.411 --> 00:33:36.840
<v Speaker 1>you also feel anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which alerts you to the fact that you</v>

628
00:33:36.841 --> 00:33:40.440
<v Speaker 1>might feel pain and should do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that you should freeze or you</v>

629
00:33:40.441 --> 00:33:42.690
<v Speaker 1>should run away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

630
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.770
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that,</v>

631
00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.210
<v Speaker 1>what emerges from that is the beginnings</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a natural category system.</v>

632
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:49.590
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

633
00:33:49.591 --> 00:33:53.310
<v Speaker 1>here's one useful category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the category of all things that</v>

634
00:33:53.311 --> 00:33:55.620
<v Speaker 1>you should freeze at or run away from.</v>

635
00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's a deep category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a biologically predicated category.</v>

636
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.040
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a category that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

637
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the meaning is what you should</v>

638
00:34:03.781 --> 00:34:06.420
<v Speaker 1>do when something like that shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

639
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.760
<v Speaker 1>the meaning isn't stripped out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>category at all.</v>

640
00:34:08.761 --> 00:34:12.060
<v Speaker 1>It's actually fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it turns out that a lot of our</v>

641
00:34:12.061 --> 00:34:14.890
<v Speaker 1>perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people think about the way they</v>

642
00:34:14.891 --> 00:34:17.670
<v Speaker 1>perceived the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think well out there a bunch of</v>

643
00:34:17.671 --> 00:34:21.270
<v Speaker 1>objects and you look at them and once</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at them,</v>

644
00:34:21.271 --> 00:34:24.990
<v Speaker 1>you see them and once you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you figure out what they are and then</v>

645
00:34:24.991 --> 00:34:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you evaluate what you should do and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress on that basis.</v>

646
00:34:28.711 --> 00:34:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so object perception,</v>

647
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.880
<v Speaker 1>cognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

648
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.370
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the problem with that is it's</v>

649
00:34:35.371 --> 00:34:38.520
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first reason it's wrong is</v>

650
00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:41.930
<v Speaker 1>because things don't exist out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world as self.</v>

651
00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Evidently separable entities hardly</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything can be segregated</v>

652
00:34:46.681 --> 00:34:51.000
<v Speaker 1>into smaller entities and every entity</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be aggregated together with larger</v>

653
00:34:51.001 --> 00:34:51.510
<v Speaker 1>entities.</v>

654
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.760
<v Speaker 1>And so the boundary that defines</v>
<v Speaker 1>something as a self evident,</v>

655
00:34:54.761 --> 00:34:59.761
<v Speaker 1>the entity is not by no means clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the way that your body deals</v>

656
00:35:00.091 --> 00:35:05.091
<v Speaker 1>with that is by categorizing things with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to their immediate impact for</v>

657
00:35:06.241 --> 00:35:09.060
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you look at something,</v>

658
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.410
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you're looking at this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

659
00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.290
<v Speaker 1>well that's a bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might ask,</v>

660
00:35:16.291 --> 00:35:19.170
<v Speaker 1>well what is your brain doing when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at that?</v>

661
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.790
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is it's molding your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>to prepare to pick that thing up.</v>

662
00:35:23.791 --> 00:35:26.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's how it understands it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your eyes,</v>

663
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I received a pattern that's constant</v>
<v Speaker 1>across some duration.</v>

664
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not made of smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's made of something that lasts.</v>

665
00:35:35.271 --> 00:35:38.760
<v Speaker 1>So there's a pattern here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bottle pattern that lasts across time.</v>

666
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.870
<v Speaker 1>You have some sense of what it is having</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacted with these sorts of things</v>

667
00:35:42.871 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also its shape obviously indicates</v>

668
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:49.920
<v Speaker 1>that it's a grippable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that when you</v>

669
00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:52.440
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes activate your motor cortex</v>

670
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:54.570
<v Speaker 1>directly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even before you see the object,</v>

671
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:57.270
<v Speaker 1>like before you form an image of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your imagination,</v>

672
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:00.060
<v Speaker 1>your retina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pattern when you rent.</v>

673
00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 1>And that activates your grit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right handed or left handed,</v>

674
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.760
<v Speaker 1>whichever hand you happened to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of what you're seeing when you</v>

675
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:13.761
<v Speaker 1>see that bottle is what you would do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it if you were interacting with it.</v>

676
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.390
<v Speaker 1>So you see the manner in which you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with us.</v>

677
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's the case for virtually</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you see.</v>

678
00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:21.840
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at a chair,</v>

679
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:25.080
<v Speaker 1>your body prepares to sit in the chair</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe to stand on the chair if</v>

680
00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:29.070
<v Speaker 1>you're going to change a light pole or</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know when you look at your computer,</v>

681
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.140
<v Speaker 1>you see the keyboard because that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

682
00:36:31.141 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 1>You move your fingers up and down on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your perception is tightly tied</v>

683
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.690
<v Speaker 1>to the implication of objects for action</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

684
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not real.</v>

685
00:36:42.001 --> 00:36:45.000
<v Speaker 1>That's not the reality of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality of it is the objective</v>

686
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:46.770
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as I said already,</v>

687
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:51.930
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you define reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take a Newtonian Newtonian tap on it</v>

688
00:36:51.931 --> 00:36:55.500
<v Speaker 1>or our Darwinian attack and from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian perspective,</v>

689
00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.820
<v Speaker 1>the implication of something for</v>
<v Speaker 1>auctions actually its primary meaning,</v>

690
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.900
<v Speaker 1>which is don't stand around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplate a tiger.</v>

691
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to eat you because the fact</v>

692
00:37:06.361 --> 00:37:09.210
<v Speaker 1>that it's trying to eat you is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>important than the fact that it's a</v>

693
00:37:09.211 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 1>tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't figure that out quick,</v>

694
00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:14.970
<v Speaker 1>then you're not around anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so much for your claims to truth,</v>

695
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.950
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just gone.</v>

696
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:18.480
<v Speaker 1>That's an error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

697
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.870
<v Speaker 1>And whatever was in you that enabled you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make that error is not going to be</v>

698
00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:25.170
<v Speaker 1>transmitted to the next generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least hopefully not.</v>

699
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.540
<v Speaker 1>So there's a domain of categorization</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to do with the meaning of</v>

700
00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:36.624
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

701
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:41.130
<v Speaker 1>most of what the psychologists have</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with who are clinical</v>

702
00:37:41.131 --> 00:37:44.010
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does actually the domain of</v>

703
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.220
<v Speaker 1>categorization that has to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of things.</v>

704
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually because as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're concerned in your life as a,</v>

705
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:56.160
<v Speaker 1>as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live inside a network of meanings of</v>

706
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:56.994
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

707
00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:00.030
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at your mother,</v>

708
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 1>you're not looking at her at her as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>object and then attributing all sorts of</v>

709
00:38:04.711 --> 00:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>meanings to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the meaning of your mother right</v>

710
00:38:08.251 --> 00:38:10.320
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that meaning is multidimensional.</v>

711
00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:14.160
<v Speaker 1>It has a very long history and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>affects you directly on a physiological</v>

712
00:38:14.161 --> 00:38:18.210
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you hate her and so the sight</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your mother makes your heart race and</v>

713
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:21.900
<v Speaker 1>your and your brain produce cortisol</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she's categorized as</v>

714
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:27.110
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable and chronic threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a standard story in situation.</v>

715
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:33.390
<v Speaker 1>No one would laugh if there wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that was true.</v>

716
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Those are Friday and slips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

717
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:41.080
<v Speaker 1>when you discuss something like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people laugh,</v>

718
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.060
<v Speaker 1>then that's an admission on their part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an deeply unconscious admission on</v>

719
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:50.170
<v Speaker 1>their part that there is truth to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement and it's also a truth that is</v>

720
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:53.020
<v Speaker 1>somewhat painful to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can tell that.</v>

721
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.960
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that when you're listening</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Comedians,</v>

722
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.460
<v Speaker 1>they do that all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

723
00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:01.090
<v Speaker 1>They tell you something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely brutally evident that no one</v>

724
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 1>will admit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone laughs and that is a</v>

725
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Freudian slip technically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Freud often listened to the</v>

726
00:39:06.881 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things that would make his</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients laugh or make an audience that</v>

727
00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:14.680
<v Speaker 1>he was speaking too loud because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would give him some insights into what</v>

728
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:16.210
<v Speaker 1>they were repressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

729
00:39:16.211 --> 00:39:18.010
<v Speaker 1>and what they would allow to come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

730
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.990
<v Speaker 1>So when jokes are often about things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are taboo,</v>

731
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to make a joke about something</v>

732
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:25.340
<v Speaker 1>that isn't taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

733
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've kind of made it a classification</v>

734
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 1>structure of these two different ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things.</v>

735
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:34.690
<v Speaker 1>There's the meaning centered way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things and the meaning is</v>

736
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:37.780
<v Speaker 1>then the implication of the thing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>action on your part.</v>

737
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's a more materialistic centered</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

738
00:39:40.451 --> 00:39:44.200
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like the world as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists if you weren't here,</v>

739
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

740
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.640
<v Speaker 1>that's this fundamental hypothesis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sciences that we're,</v>

741
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.450
<v Speaker 1>there's something around that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and look the way it does.</v>

742
00:39:52.451 --> 00:39:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Look now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if none of you were around,</v>

743
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible that that's true.</v>

744
00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:02.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's also possible that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>

745
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:07.720
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most possible is the fact that it's</v>

746
00:40:07.721 --> 00:40:11.590
<v Speaker 1>true in a way that we really don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand because the existence of</v>

747
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:13.420
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we perceive them as clearly</v>

748
00:40:13.421 --> 00:40:15.700
<v Speaker 1>dependent on our existence as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceiver.</v>

749
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.080
<v Speaker 1>And so what the nature of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be if there was no one around at</v>

750
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:21.880
<v Speaker 1>all perceive it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was no such thing as</v>

751
00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.120
<v Speaker 1>consciousnesses effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a completely unsolved problem.</v>

752
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:29.050
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it would be like a field of</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum potential or something like</v>

753
00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:29.920
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

754
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't even possible to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what that means.</v>

755
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:39.340
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>now having established that,</v>

756
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.060
<v Speaker 1>having established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you another example before we</v>

757
00:40:43.061 --> 00:40:44.410
<v Speaker 1>move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

758
00:40:44.411 --> 00:40:47.890
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you interact with objects</v>

759
00:40:47.891 --> 00:40:49.900
<v Speaker 1>around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not really interacting with</v>

760
00:40:49.901 --> 00:40:51.640
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like you're interacting with</v>

761
00:40:51.641 --> 00:40:53.860
<v Speaker 1>tools because you're a primary concern</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

762
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

763
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:59.080
<v Speaker 1>what's the world in relationship to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I have to avoid?</v>

764
00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to get to where I'm going</v>

765
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.760
<v Speaker 1>and what can I use to further my</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuits?</v>

766
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And so you're like that deeply.</v>

767
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 1>That's why human beings are tool using</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures,</v>

768
00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:10.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have hands and they manipulate the</v>

769
00:41:10.481 --> 00:41:14.350
<v Speaker 1>world and those hands are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're built into our cognitive</v>

770
00:41:14.351 --> 00:41:17.230
<v Speaker 1>architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not like our brain is separate</v>

771
00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:18.670
<v Speaker 1>from our hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

772
00:41:18.671 --> 00:41:19.690
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

773
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.270
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very opposite to that.</v>

774
00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.420
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't have the brains we have if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have the hands we have.</v>

775
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.230
<v Speaker 1>That's why things like is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Octopi are very intelligent.</v>

776
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.260
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're invertebrates,</v>

777
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.350
<v Speaker 1>they only live a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can't learn that much.</v>

778
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:37.560
<v Speaker 1>But they're extraordinarily intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because they're tactical</v>

779
00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:38.890
<v Speaker 1>within the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they are technical,</v>

780
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.550
<v Speaker 1>they can grab things and manipulate them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you know,</v>

781
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.530
<v Speaker 1>they've developed an intelligence that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable to us because we have</v>

782
00:41:45.531 --> 00:41:47.990
<v Speaker 1>little tentacles on the ends of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and you know,</v>

783
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.280
<v Speaker 1>we're using them to fiddling around with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world at the time.</v>

784
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.520
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

785
00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:58.030
<v Speaker 1>there's the perceptual</v>

786
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.900
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that we know about already,</v>

787
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:06.170
<v Speaker 1>that when you look at something and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>track the way that you're interacting</v>

788
00:42:06.171 --> 00:42:08.210
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that one of the first things</v>

789
00:42:08.211 --> 00:42:13.211
<v Speaker 1>that happen happens is the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the perceived object and your</v>

790
00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:15.980
<v Speaker 1>body is established very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

791
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to map the object onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body so you know what the hell to</v>

792
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orient yourself so that you're safe and</v>

793
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

794
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:29.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jj Gibson Gibson who was uh,</v>

795
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology psychologist.</v>

796
00:42:34.071 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 1>The perception you operated in the late</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies people thought his theories</v>

797
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 1>were</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't behavioral,</v>

798
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:41.750
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were going to have a different</v>

799
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:46.970
<v Speaker 1>classification or category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Gibson also made the first sort of</v>

800
00:42:46.971 --> 00:42:49.610
<v Speaker 1>claim that what you saw in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>where things like tools,</v>

801
00:42:49.611 --> 00:42:52.370
<v Speaker 1>he called them affordances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

802
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.880
<v Speaker 1>when you approach what you would call</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an objective perspective,</v>

803
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:58.280
<v Speaker 1>a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gibson would say,</v>

804
00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:59.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a cliff.</v>

805
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:03.560
<v Speaker 1>You see a falling off place and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might need from cliff.</v>

806
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 1>But you see falling off place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about it,</v>

807
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.930
<v Speaker 1>again from a Darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you see falling off place.</v>

808
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:15.890
<v Speaker 1>That's why you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might shrink from a precipice is</v>

809
00:43:15.891 --> 00:43:19.820
<v Speaker 1>your whole being perceives that as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place that would instantly make you</v>

810
00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:23.030
<v Speaker 1>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a secondary derivation from</v>

811
00:43:23.031 --> 00:43:25.940
<v Speaker 1>your analysis of a set of objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>

812
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 1>It's that primary perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has to be because you better move</v>

813
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:30.860
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're to New York cliff,</v>

814
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any time to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing occurs when maybe you're</v>

815
00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:35.900
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

816
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.620
<v Speaker 1>potentially struck by a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have circuits in your brain that</v>

817
00:43:39.621 --> 00:43:43.490
<v Speaker 1>will see that snake and make you jump</v>
<v Speaker 1>way before you know it's a snake.</v>

818
00:43:43.491 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Because sick around standing around</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the image of snake to</v>

819
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:50.720
<v Speaker 1>forming your consciousness means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be bitten five to six times</v>

820
00:43:50.721 --> 00:43:55.640
<v Speaker 1>already because you're just going fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to see and then move you see move</v>

821
00:43:55.641 --> 00:43:58.820
<v Speaker 1>and then proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what keeps you safe.</v>

822
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.120
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what you've perceived in the</v>

823
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:04.490
<v Speaker 1>world or the meetings that you've mapped</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto your body.</v>

824
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.673
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

825
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:14.670
<v Speaker 1>so then you can think what human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done in response to this bifurcated</v>

826
00:44:15.161 --> 00:44:20.161
<v Speaker 1>way of perceiving reality is we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed two different systems of</v>

827
00:44:20.231 --> 00:44:23.740
<v Speaker 1>classification to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for most of human history,</v>

828
00:44:23.741 --> 00:44:27.850
<v Speaker 1>we only had one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the one we had was basically that</v>

829
00:44:27.851 --> 00:44:30.460
<v Speaker 1>meaningful system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the scientific system,</v>

830
00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't get around to figuring that</v>

831
00:44:32.251 --> 00:44:34.430
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the ancient Greeks and the Romans,</v>

832
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.050
<v Speaker 1>the Greeks in particular who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably intelligent,</v>

833
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.090
<v Speaker 1>really never gotten around to pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

834
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if certainly the Romans didn't,</v>

835
00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:46.450
<v Speaker 1>there was no science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science only evolved in Europe and only</v>

836
00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the late 1500 it's very strange and it's</v>

837
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:53.220
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd been elaborating out this</v>

838
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:55.980
<v Speaker 1>materialistic viewpoint for only about</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 years.</v>

839
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:58.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other viewpoint,</v>

840
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:03.620
<v Speaker 1>that's the natural habitat of humanity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the viewpoint that's made up</v>

841
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:07.650
<v Speaker 1>of all the stories that people have told</v>
<v Speaker 1>about themselves in the world since the</v>

842
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:09.120
<v Speaker 1>dawn of human consciousness.</v>

843
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the knowledge forms,</v>

844
00:45:12.721 --> 00:45:15.870
<v Speaker 1>the stories that actually constitute the</v>
<v Speaker 1>base of culture.</v>

845
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Because culture is not so much about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the world is and how to perceive it</v>

846
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.030
<v Speaker 1>as it is about how you should act in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the world.</v>

847
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 1>And so when you read fiction and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk to each other endlessly about</v>

848
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:32.130
<v Speaker 1>what your friends are up to and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>their friends are up to and what they're</v>

849
00:45:32.131 --> 00:45:35.730
<v Speaker 1>doing on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you go to movies and you watch</v>

850
00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:40.731
<v Speaker 1>actors act out roles and you know when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do everything you do to examine</v>

851
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 1>other people around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're betting yourself in this</v>

852
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:49.220
<v Speaker 1>ancient culture that's there to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you should operate yourself in the</v>

853
00:45:50.431 --> 00:45:52.020
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should do,</v>

854
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.320
<v Speaker 1>because that's a primary question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to know what to do.</v>

855
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Human beings need to know what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't know what to do,</v>

856
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.730
<v Speaker 1>well that's a very unpleasant emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

857
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because it indicates</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not willing adapt it to your</v>

858
00:46:06.091 --> 00:46:07.680
<v Speaker 1>current circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

859
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:10.800
<v Speaker 1>if you just stand around long enough not</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing what to do,</v>

860
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:16.170
<v Speaker 1>you'll age and you'll die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an effective way of dealing</v>

861
00:46:16.171 --> 00:46:18.090
<v Speaker 1>with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be oriented towards</v>

862
00:46:18.091 --> 00:46:21.690
<v Speaker 1>something and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job with culture in part is to tell</v>

863
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:26.691
<v Speaker 1>you to what you should be oriented and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the rubber hits the road</v>

864
00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:30.960
<v Speaker 1>with regards to psychology because</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in its clinical variants and</v>

865
00:46:30.961 --> 00:46:35.720
<v Speaker 1>personality theory has to be an element</v>
<v Speaker 1>of clinical clip.</v>

866
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Personality theory has to be a sub</v>
<v Speaker 1>element of clinical theory.</v>

867
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.280
<v Speaker 1>What psychology has to contend with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned in the first lecture,</v>

868
00:46:44.281 --> 00:46:48.240
<v Speaker 1>is not only what you are but what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be and the reason for that is</v>

869
00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:50.430
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about a human being,</v>

870
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.640
<v Speaker 1>you can't separate out the bare facts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that present you about the person from</v>

871
00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:56.604
<v Speaker 1>the ideal.</v>

872
00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:59.310
<v Speaker 1>We do this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's mental health?</v>

873
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:01.021
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

874
00:47:01.021 --> 00:47:02.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the absence of mental illness.</v>

875
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really if someone tells you that you</v>

876
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 1>should just stop the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all they'd done is</v>

877
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.140
<v Speaker 1>solve one problem with an equally large</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

878
00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:15.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no progress there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

879
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a kind of a smart Alec he thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

880
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of means going into a lot of</v>

881
00:47:21.091 --> 00:47:22.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your stupid question,</v>

882
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.750
<v Speaker 1>mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to understand what mental</v>

883
00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 1>health is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's very difficult to get,</v>

884
00:47:30.131 --> 00:47:34.120
<v Speaker 1>people did find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to watch how they act when</v>

885
00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:37.510
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about such things as</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health because then you can</v>

886
00:47:37.511 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 1>derive some sense of what they actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand about it,</v>

887
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:43.590
<v Speaker 1>our presume about it instead of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just say about,</v>

888
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:47.410
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at how society's use the</v>

889
00:47:47.411 --> 00:47:51.150
<v Speaker 1>idea of mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they partly do use it normatively and if</v>

890
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 1>it's used normatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then describing it as the absence of</v>

891
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:56.670
<v Speaker 1>mental illness actually works.</v>

892
00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Say well you're healthy to the degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're normal.</v>

893
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:04.680
<v Speaker 1>And so extremes outside of normality</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to border on pathology.</v>

894
00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 1>But there's obvious limitations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with that approach,</v>

895
00:48:09.431 --> 00:48:12.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't think the average</v>

896
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:15.640
<v Speaker 1>person is the best looking person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd assume that attractiveness is,</v>

897
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:19.990
<v Speaker 1>it's an ideal towards which we might all</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least aspire.</v>

898
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:23.770
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out there's deep biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that because most of the</v>

899
00:48:23.771 --> 00:48:28.060
<v Speaker 1>things that men and women find</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive about each other are they</v>

900
00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:30.220
<v Speaker 1>find you attractive for deep biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>

901
00:48:30.221 --> 00:48:32.950
<v Speaker 1>like symmetry for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an indication of sort of</v>

902
00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:35.710
<v Speaker 1>optimal biological development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

903
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.890
<v Speaker 1>for men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for women looking at men that's shoulder</v>

904
00:48:38.891 --> 00:48:41.530
<v Speaker 1>to waist ratio and for what men looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at women,</v>

905
00:48:41.531 --> 00:48:45.400
<v Speaker 1>it's w waist to hip ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should be about 0.68,</v>

906
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:47.560
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty damned precise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

907
00:48:47.561 --> 00:48:49.150
<v Speaker 1>men are always computing that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

908
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:50.170
<v Speaker 1>when they're looking around.</v>

909
00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

910
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:54.700
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

911
00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 1>you can't talk about what constitutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>health by merely making a normative</v>

912
00:49:00.641 --> 00:49:02.770
<v Speaker 1>claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also have to take into account</v>

913
00:49:02.771 --> 00:49:06.910
<v Speaker 1>something like deviation from an ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a weird thing because of</v>

914
00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 1>course the ideal doesn't really exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's what makes it ideal.</v>

915
00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:14.200
<v Speaker 1>But you can't get away from that problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to do anything serious</v>

916
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:17.260
<v Speaker 1>about psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because implicit in the idea,</v>

917
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 1>not only of mental health but of health</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself is the,</v>

918
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:25.240
<v Speaker 1>is the question what constitutes an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal human being?</v>

919
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:26.470
<v Speaker 1>And he might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

920
00:49:26.471 --> 00:49:28.270
<v Speaker 1>that's not so relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

921
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:33.271
<v Speaker 1>why would that be relevant to pursue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say as well as people were</v>

922
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:37.530
<v Speaker 1>not only ever engaged to this scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit,</v>

923
00:49:37.531 --> 00:49:39.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're engaged in the business of living</v>

924
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 1>and we might be scientists sort of as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>subset of that,</v>

925
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:46.060
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I would also say that if we're</v>

926
00:49:46.061 --> 00:49:48.820
<v Speaker 1>dealing in the realm of health and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health were not being scientists</v>

927
00:49:48.821 --> 00:49:50.350
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're being,</v>

928
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:54.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like philosophical engineers</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what we're doing is we're</v>

929
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 1>attempting to take our knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however it's being gathered,</v>

930
00:49:56.921 --> 00:49:59.890
<v Speaker 1>including scientifically and to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>things better,</v>

931
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:00.820
<v Speaker 1>not worse.</v>

932
00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.530
<v Speaker 1>And when you're trying to make things</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

933
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.070
<v Speaker 1>you're not being a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a scientist is trying to do is to</v>

934
00:50:06.071 --> 00:50:10.030
<v Speaker 1>describe what things are as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's transformed into like</v>

935
00:50:10.031 --> 00:50:11.890
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say it's more,</v>

936
00:50:11.891 --> 00:50:12.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

937
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.120
<v Speaker 1>it is still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a variation of applied.</v>

938
00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like applied philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different domain.</v>

939
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:24.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's not right to just skip</v>
<v Speaker 1>over that and pretend that what we're</v>

940
00:50:24.821 --> 00:50:27.810
<v Speaker 1>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say an a personality class is something</v>

941
00:50:27.811 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 1>we can only be studied scientifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not,</v>

942
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can study people's conceptions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what constitutes ideal</v>

943
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.700
<v Speaker 1>scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're still faced with the problem</v>

944
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:39.950
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of what is the ideal</v>

945
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.090
<v Speaker 1>lingers underneath all the phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're trying to understand and</v>

946
00:50:44.091 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 1>explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So beauty,</v>

947
00:50:45.561 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence,</v>

948
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:50.000
<v Speaker 1>we tend to assume that more is better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

949
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:52.730
<v Speaker 1>We don't think the average is the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>place to stop.</v>

950
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

951
00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of you people,</v>

952
00:50:55.071 --> 00:50:57.500
<v Speaker 1>there's not a single person in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect,</v>

953
00:50:57.501 --> 00:51:02.501
<v Speaker 1>who has an average Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably minimally at the 85th</v>

954
00:51:02.661 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 1>percentile and most of you are at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>95th percentile.</v>

955
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:08.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember I told you last summit,</v>

956
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.270
<v Speaker 1>last class that scientists are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

957
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.910
<v Speaker 1>albino elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very rare.</v>

958
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:17.540
<v Speaker 1>And you guys are like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not normal human beings.</v>

959
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:20.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

960
00:51:20.421 --> 00:51:23.180
<v Speaker 1>and as you progress up the ladder of</v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

961
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:27.890
<v Speaker 1>you'll be in increasing contact with</v>
<v Speaker 1>stranger and stranger variance of</v>

962
00:51:27.891 --> 00:51:32.880
<v Speaker 1>humanity because the successful people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are smart and highly conscientious</v>

963
00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:36.290
<v Speaker 1>say are smart and highly creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a tiny minority of the human</v>

964
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:38.420
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's unfortunate.</v>

965
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Seriously unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

966
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:44.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the beneficiaries of the lottery</v>

967
00:51:44.121 --> 00:51:47.780
<v Speaker 1>that determined in part here genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genetic structure of your</v>

968
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:52.460
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I suspect I've done some testing of u</v>

969
00:51:52.461 --> 00:51:57.461
<v Speaker 1>of t students and the average comes out</v>
<v Speaker 1>at around 126 to 130 that's two standard</v>

970
00:51:58.281 --> 00:52:00.440
<v Speaker 1>deviations above the mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

971
00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:02.370
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably actually higher than that</v>

972
00:52:02.371 --> 00:52:05.390
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of you have English as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second language and so that tends to</v>

973
00:52:05.391 --> 00:52:06.710
<v Speaker 1>suppress your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

974
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your performance on Iq tests if they're</v>

975
00:52:09.591 --> 00:52:11.090
<v Speaker 1>assessing verbal knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

976
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:14.750
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

977
00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:22.500
<v Speaker 2>let's</v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

978
00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:33.330
<v Speaker 1>So part of what I'm going to talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>today about is the sorts of things that</v>

979
00:52:33.331 --> 00:52:38.331
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young would called archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And archetype is a ill defined term.</v>

980
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:42.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why it's very difficult to</v>

981
00:52:42.541 --> 00:52:46.530
<v Speaker 1>understand you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also very difficult to transform</v>

982
00:52:46.531 --> 00:52:50.940
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of things that he had to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>into very precise scientific</v>

983
00:52:50.941 --> 00:52:53.640
<v Speaker 1>formulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

984
00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:56.853
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

985
00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:01.850
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't change the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extraordinarily useful from the</v>

986
00:53:01.851 --> 00:53:05.990
<v Speaker 1>perspective of general understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just useful thing to pursue.</v>

987
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:10.220
<v Speaker 1>And also from the perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical utility to understand</v>

988
00:53:10.221 --> 00:53:12.260
<v Speaker 1>something about these archetypical</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

989
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.900
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their grit.</v>

990
00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you can set,</v>

991
00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.480
<v Speaker 1>this is a brilliant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying and psychoanalysts are</v>

992
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:23.180
<v Speaker 1>terrifying people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's Beth not,</v>

993
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Freud dug around in this</v>

994
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 1>pathology of the family and families can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be great,</v>

995
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:32.400
<v Speaker 1>but if you want real pathology of</v>
<v Speaker 1>families,</v>

996
00:53:32.401 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 1>a good place to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because of pathological family is so</v>

997
00:53:35.731 --> 00:53:39.060
<v Speaker 1>pathological that it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually what Freud was</v>

998
00:53:39.061 --> 00:53:40.630
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

999
00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:41.221
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1000
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:44.220
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for normal sort of healthy</v>

1001
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:47.370
<v Speaker 1>people to appreciate that because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're normal and healthy and your</v>

1002
00:53:47.371 --> 00:53:48.330
<v Speaker 1>family's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1003
00:53:48.331 --> 00:53:51.000
<v Speaker 1>not half bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have all those Freud,</v>

1004
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:51.834
<v Speaker 1>he had problems.</v>

1005
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 1>But if you do have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all you have.</v>

1006
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.940
<v Speaker 1>You never get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trapped in there like that,</v>

1007
00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:02.090
<v Speaker 1>like a fly in a spider's Web that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying spiders with common symbol</v>

1008
00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:06.090
<v Speaker 1>representation of the classic Freudian</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

1009
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:07.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1010
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to show you this picture</v>

1011
00:54:11.431 --> 00:54:15.510
<v Speaker 1>because I want to talk to you about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>category system that will be useful in</v>

1012
00:54:15.511 --> 00:54:19.110
<v Speaker 1>understanding what we're going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through during this course.</v>

1013
00:54:19.111 --> 00:54:22.950
<v Speaker 1>So what I would like to do with all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you is to start from the bottom of</v>

1014
00:54:22.951 --> 00:54:24.590
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we were doing today when</v>

1015
00:54:24.591 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about definitions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

1016
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Speaker 1>So I asked you to consider for a moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's two ways of looking at</v>

1017
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:33.390
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is your objective sort of Newtonian</v>

1018
00:54:33.391 --> 00:54:34.920
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is outdated.</v>

1019
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:37.980
<v Speaker 1>We still hold it because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>practically useful.</v>

1020
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.050
<v Speaker 1>And the other is the Darwinian</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1021
00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:44.130
<v Speaker 1>which is the world is meaningful in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to you and those meetings</v>

1022
00:54:44.131 --> 00:54:46.860
<v Speaker 1>are real and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so far as they have a bearing on</v>

1023
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:49.110
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you actually survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1024
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.310
<v Speaker 1>and then you make the claim that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't anything more real fan,</v>

1025
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.220
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you survive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get under that.</v>

1026
00:54:56.221 --> 00:54:58.470
<v Speaker 1>That's where you start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1027
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.380
<v Speaker 1>so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say for example,</v>

1028
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:07.790
<v Speaker 1>if the pursuit of the Newtonian theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality culminated in the extinction</v>

1029
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:12.060
<v Speaker 1>of human beings saying because our</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological power got so great,</v>

1030
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:16.800
<v Speaker 1>that would be perfect evidence for its</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of truth because there are things</v>

1031
00:55:16.801 --> 00:55:19.350
<v Speaker 1>that just wasn't taking into account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1032
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Because something that's true should</v>
<v Speaker 1>take things into account.</v>

1033
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:25.950
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that you take into</v>
<v Speaker 1>account is that we're living things that</v>

1034
00:55:25.951 --> 00:55:28.330
<v Speaker 1>we can only exist under a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1035
00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:32.100
<v Speaker 1>within certain parameters and that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>also oriented towards an ideal.</v>

1036
00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:34.500
<v Speaker 1>And if your theory doesn't take that</v>
<v Speaker 1>into account,</v>

1037
00:55:34.501 --> 00:55:38.400
<v Speaker 1>well maybe not only is it into plate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be pathologically and,</v>

1038
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:40.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and genocidally.</v>

1039
00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:44.190
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a representation from ancient</v>

1040
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1041
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the representations mean.</v>

1042
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:54.230
<v Speaker 1>So this first one here is horace and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person here is a service.</v>

1043
00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:03.260
<v Speaker 1>And that person there is isis and Osiris</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the god of tradition.</v>

1044
00:56:04.651 --> 00:56:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's why he sorta standing there</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that pillar.</v>

1045
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:11.760
<v Speaker 1>And so the Egyptians thought of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

1046
00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.210
<v Speaker 1>there's one other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's seth and seth is a bad guy.</v>

1047
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:19.290
<v Speaker 1>So Seth is the evil villain that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>always whispering in the king's ear.</v>

1048
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:23.410
<v Speaker 1>You see that story repeated in all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different forms.</v>

1049
00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:26.530
<v Speaker 1>So seth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a negative figure and he's not</v>

1050
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:29.140
<v Speaker 1>included in these particular image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll,</v>

1051
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seth is also,</v>

1052
00:56:31.271 --> 00:56:33.180
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh cirruses brethren.</v>

1053
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:35.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because the Egyptians had</v>

1054
00:56:35.861 --> 00:56:38.890
<v Speaker 1>figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is like 3000 years be seen,</v>

1055
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:42.400
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians had already figured out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you put a state together,</v>

1056
00:56:42.401 --> 00:56:46.990
<v Speaker 1>so the state would be represented by</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocirus and ocirus is sort of like the</v>

1057
00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:52.060
<v Speaker 1>abstraction of the patriarchal force</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stands behind the tradition.</v>

1058
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 1>So if you imagine that a tradition has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of behaving,</v>

1059
00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:59.890
<v Speaker 1>if that's what it tradition is to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that you share a tradition,</v>

1060
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 1>you're all manifesting the same pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Egyptians would say that pattern</v>

1061
00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:06.700
<v Speaker 1>that you're imitating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a day.</v>

1062
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:08.210
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

1063
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:11.440
<v Speaker 1>they didn't think of it that way because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't think the way we think.</v>

1064
00:57:11.441 --> 00:57:15.610
<v Speaker 1>But for all intensive purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomena that they described as a</v>

1065
00:57:15.611 --> 00:57:20.611
<v Speaker 1>god was the pattern that everyone was</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously re imitating.</v>

1066
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to unconsciously imitate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same pattern or you can't get along,</v>

1067
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1068
00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:28.270
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1069
00:57:28.271 --> 00:57:32.740
<v Speaker 1>in our society for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a body of laws and most of it's</v>

1070
00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:37.741
<v Speaker 1>derived from English common law and</v>
<v Speaker 1>English common law emerge as a</v>

1071
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:42.751
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity to solve disputes between</v>

1072
00:57:44.141 --> 00:57:47.530
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that all hell didn't break loose.</v>

1073
00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:52.531
<v Speaker 1>So English common law was produced when</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person took another person to court</v>

1074
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:55.060
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a serious problem.</v>

1075
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:58.240
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to organize our</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior in the same space.</v>

1076
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.140
<v Speaker 1>You have to make a ruling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the judge would assess the</v>

1077
00:58:02.141 --> 00:58:06.280
<v Speaker 1>situation and state who had the right to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what.</v>

1078
00:58:06.281 --> 00:58:10.270
<v Speaker 1>And then that became part of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in so far as you are law abiding</v>

1079
00:58:10.271 --> 00:58:14.290
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you abide by the body of law,</v>

1080
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:19.450
<v Speaker 1>you actually manifest the body of law</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your behavior.</v>

1081
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:24.520
<v Speaker 1>And to the degree that you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people like you to agree that you</v>

1082
00:58:24.521 --> 00:58:25.480
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

1083
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:28.900
<v Speaker 1>You're either poorly trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly socialized,</v>

1084
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:30.760
<v Speaker 1>antisocial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1085
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.210
<v Speaker 1>or downright dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case other people,</v>

1086
00:58:34.211 --> 00:58:37.000
<v Speaker 1>we'll put you somewhere where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>have less harm than you might be.</v>

1087
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 1>So like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a mimicker.</v>

1088
00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And what you mimic is the central</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern of cultural behavior that has</v>

1089
00:58:48.911 --> 00:58:52.270
<v Speaker 1>evolved over who knows how long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

1090
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.230
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so far as some of its associated say</v>

1091
00:58:56.231 --> 00:58:57.220
<v Speaker 1>with dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

1092
00:58:57.221 --> 00:58:58.840
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is unbelievably old.</v>

1093
00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:01.810
<v Speaker 1>That's so serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so serious.</v>

1094
00:59:01.811 --> 00:59:03.670
<v Speaker 1>That's God the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

1095
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the category of culture.</v>

1096
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Now the Egyptians also knew that culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not only necessarily a good thing as</v>

1097
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:14.590
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course all of you know because no</v>

1098
00:59:14.591 --> 00:59:18.220
<v Speaker 1>doubt sometimes you note that you're the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficiary of your culture,</v>

1099
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.640
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also feel you're like crushed and</v>

1100
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:27.050
<v Speaker 1>mistreated and mold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And pantone was shaped by the culture</v>

1101
00:59:27.051 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 1>because the culture says you better act</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else expects you to.</v>

1102
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:35.420
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not exactly like everybody</v>

1103
00:59:35.421 --> 00:59:37.550
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you couldn't get mangled and crunched</v>

1104
00:59:37.551 --> 00:59:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male formed as you're socialized,</v>

1105
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:44.750
<v Speaker 1>even though you also learn to speak and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn to read and you learn all</v>

1106
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 1>those things that culture can provide</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1107
00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:50.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians knew even 3000 years ago</v>

1108
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:54.350
<v Speaker 1>that although culture was necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an element of existence that</v>

1109
00:59:54.351 --> 00:59:57.740
<v Speaker 1>human beings were always in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's why it's a permanent</v>

1110
00:59:57.741 --> 01:00:00.380
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no non cultural people.</v>

1111
01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:03.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't be a human being without a</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1112
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not possible.</v>

1113
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're evolving.</v>

1114
01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our physiological form presumes that</v>

1115
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:15.260
<v Speaker 1>we're going to emerge into the world in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a culture and that will inform us as we</v>

1116
01:00:15.261 --> 01:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have such a long</v>

1117
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:19.040
<v Speaker 1>developmental period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1118
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.050
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're born unformed.</v>

1119
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.780
<v Speaker 1>And the only reason that works is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

1120
01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>the lack of formed has been consistently</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested in an environment that would</v>

1121
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:31.844
<v Speaker 1>form it.</v>

1122
01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.330
<v Speaker 1>So culture isn't just culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the environment that we had habit,</v>

1123
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>because culture has been around for so</v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

1124
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you one example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a big part of every culture is Darwin</v>

1125
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>attire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1126
01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>And a dominance hierarchy says who has</v>
<v Speaker 1>what access to what at what given time.</v>

1127
01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.060
<v Speaker 1>It pretty much every creature is in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant charge.</v>

1128
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Chickens earning dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the pecking order,</v>

1129
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Members of wolves packs are in</v>

1130
01:00:57.831 --> 01:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archi span.</v>

1131
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Member of members of chimpanzee troops</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in governance.</v>

1132
01:01:01.481 --> 01:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Hardy's songbirds are in dominance tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1133
01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.580
<v Speaker 1>here's what Satan in this frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all pretty,</v>

1134
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not little little birds sitting out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there saying,</v>

1135
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm healthy and loud and if you come</v>
<v Speaker 1>over here,</v>

1136
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll check into debt because this is my</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

1137
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:22.880
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the songbirds distribute</v>

1138
01:01:22.881 --> 01:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>themselves around the neighborhood by</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>

1139
01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:29.870
<v Speaker 1>And the more dominant birds get vendor</v>
<v Speaker 1>nastic spaces and better means they</v>

1140
01:01:29.871 --> 01:01:32.000
<v Speaker 1>don't get rained on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least not as much.</v>

1141
01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>They did their nest don't get blown out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trees.</v>

1142
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:38.780
<v Speaker 1>There's not so many cats around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're close to a good food source.</v>

1143
01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>And so that makes them attractive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential meaning partners.</v>

1144
01:01:42.861 --> 01:01:46.070
<v Speaker 1>But it also increases the probability</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their chicks will survive.</v>

1145
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's,</v>

1146
01:01:48.231 --> 01:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>here's the nasty bit of truth that goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with that.</v>

1147
01:01:50.631 --> 01:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>So let's say there's a bunch of birds in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood and some kind of bird</v>

1148
01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:57.500
<v Speaker 1>flu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's specific to birds kind of wafting</v>

1149
01:01:57.501 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>through and it's killing murders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1150
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>the birds died from the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dormant attire.</v>

1151
01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Chiappe and the reason for that is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom birds are all stressed out</v>

1152
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>because their life is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they're stressed,</v>

1153
01:02:08.121 --> 01:02:10.460
<v Speaker 1>they're immune system gets suppressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1154
01:02:10.461 --> 01:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>they're all frazzled from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1155
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:14.990
<v Speaker 1>being chased by cats and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they die.</v>

1156
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>And so the talkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same thing happens in human</v>

1157
01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:19.064
<v Speaker 1>populations.</v>

1158
01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>When I'm playing sweeps through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people die from the bottom of the</v>

1159
01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so dominance hierarchies mattered.</v>

1160
01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>And so birds have them in lizards have</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1161
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And fish have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in a school of fish,</v>

1162
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>the dominant fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the fish bowl up,</v>

1163
01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>they do that to make it hard for</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators to eat them.</v>

1164
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>The big dominant Fisher in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ball,</v>

1165
01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>the little sucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless Fisher on the outside.</v>

1166
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's what gets eaten up when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators come along.</v>

1167
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know the dominance hierarchy</v>

1168
01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>stretch back a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know for example,</v>

1169
01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:52.220
<v Speaker 1>that lobsters live in Darwin and sorry</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1170
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I told you a little bit about that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are about 300 million years old.</v>

1171
01:02:56.490 --> 01:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>existing in siding cultural structure</v>

1172
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.150
<v Speaker 1>because the culture is predicated on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

1173
01:03:03.151 --> 01:03:03.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1174
01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:05.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to use,</v>

1175
01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a politically correct term that's been</v>

1176
01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:11.580
<v Speaker 1>around for 300 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to think about it as a permanent</v>

1177
01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:16.581
<v Speaker 1>constituent element of reality is</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely useful because again,</v>

1178
01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:19.320
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another question for you.</v>

1179
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't buy the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning argument with regards to</v>

1180
01:03:23.581 --> 01:03:26.190
<v Speaker 1>categorization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another way you can look at it.</v>

1181
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 1>You might say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's most real?</v>

1182
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:32.400
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough one because you know,</v>

1183
01:03:32.401 --> 01:03:35.160
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind of accept gradations of real</v>

1184
01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:38.730
<v Speaker 1>like rock seemed pretty real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trees seem pretty real.</v>

1185
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment is that real?</v>

1186
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:43.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a harder one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1187
01:03:43.941 --> 01:03:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's an abstraction about numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they real?</v>

1188
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:50.430
<v Speaker 1>You can certainly do real things with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1189
01:03:50.431 --> 01:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Once you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you get numbers,</v>

1190
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.930
<v Speaker 1>especially zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems not to exist at all,</v>

1191
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you get zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of magical things you</v>

1192
01:03:57.691 --> 01:03:58.524
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>

1193
01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.940
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is,</v>

1194
01:03:59.941 --> 01:04:02.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not all that obvious to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes real.</v>

1195
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:04.200
<v Speaker 1>But here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a hitch.</v>

1196
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.180
<v Speaker 1>The longer something has been around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more real it is.</v>

1197
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies have been around</v>

1198
01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>longer than trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>

1199
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.930
<v Speaker 1>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really real.</v>

1200
01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And you live in one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only do you live in one,</v>

1201
01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.430
<v Speaker 1>you're really motivated to get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of that well in order to create one</v>

1202
01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:29.250
<v Speaker 1>that you can be at the top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because human beings are sneaky thing.</v>

1203
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Because if we're not doing so well in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy,</v>

1204
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>we might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1205
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:33.990
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this dominance hierarchy,</v>

1206
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.020
<v Speaker 1>we'll just make a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what creativity is.</v>

1207
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:39.720
<v Speaker 1>So if you're really creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make your own dog and it's</v>

1208
01:04:39.721 --> 01:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sit right at the top of it.</v>

1209
01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how it's worked out very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well for human beings.</v>

1210
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:45.600
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

1211
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:49.650
<v Speaker 1>one of the fundamental traits of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings is openness and openness is</v>

1212
01:04:49.651 --> 01:04:54.651
<v Speaker 1>actually a trade that basically assesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which you're capable of</v>

1213
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.420
<v Speaker 1>playing around with the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could come up with your own</v>

1214
01:04:57.421 --> 01:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>dominance heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you do if you're</v>

1215
01:04:59.431 --> 01:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>creative because you make a new set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

1216
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what a creative person does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very sneaky.</v>

1217
01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's very important to be near the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the dominance hierarchy because</v>

1218
01:05:08.611 --> 01:05:10.440
<v Speaker 1>it means you live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

1219
01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:13.770
<v Speaker 1>You live without so much stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also good.</v>

1220
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>And your probability of successfully</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproducing or say of having many mating</v>

1221
01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>opportunities goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the case of men,</v>

1222
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an ed.</v>

1223
01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like an exponential improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you ever wonder why men are so</v>

1224
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the reason it's because the loser</v>

1225
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>men get nothing.</v>

1226
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly how it works.</v>

1227
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>And the winter man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get everything and there's actually</v>

1228
01:05:37.631 --> 01:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>a law that goes behind that and economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

1229
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:42.010
<v Speaker 1>you can look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the pareto distribution.</v>

1230
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.730
<v Speaker 1>You look up the prieto distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the law that describes the income</v>

1231
01:05:45.731 --> 01:05:48.310
<v Speaker 1>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't tell you something important</v>

1232
01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>about how the world works and Prieto</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

1233
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>which is almost everyone gets nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost no one gets everything.</v>

1234
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:59.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a frito distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It covers the production of everything</v>

1235
01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>that's created money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inventions are like music,</v>

1236
01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:04.480
<v Speaker 1>paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>

1237
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.720
<v Speaker 1>If people creatively produce it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly anyone does all of it and almost</v>

1238
01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:13.030
<v Speaker 1>everyone does none of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really winner take all</v>

1239
01:06:13.031 --> 01:06:14.560
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his heart,</v>

1240
01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:17.470
<v Speaker 1>he you set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really as a reflection of that fact,</v>

1241
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:21.640
<v Speaker 1>we also know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to hammer the point home is that if</v>

1242
01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:25.150
<v Speaker 1>you make dominance hierarchy steep like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a steep one is hard to climb.</v>

1243
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>top and bottom,</v>

1244
01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:31.900
<v Speaker 1>the steeper the dominance hierarchy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any given geographical locale,</v>

1245
01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:36.130
<v Speaker 1>the higher the murder rate among men</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they start to kill each other.</v>

1246
01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.160
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they started to kill each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other's because that's a good way of</v>

1247
01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 1>attaining dominance if you haven't gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other routes.</v>

1248
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 1>income inequality and the</v>

1249
01:06:45.821 --> 01:06:49.660
<v Speaker 1>destabilization of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an extraordinarily powerful</v>

1250
01:06:49.661 --> 01:06:50.980
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1251
01:06:50.981 --> 01:06:54.220
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can describe the steepness of a</v>

1252
01:06:54.221 --> 01:06:57.970
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy using a statistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Gini Coefficient and the</v>

1253
01:06:57.971 --> 01:07:01.000
<v Speaker 1>correlation between the Gini Coefficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the male homicide rates in North</v>

1254
01:07:01.001 --> 01:07:04.450
<v Speaker 1>America is about 0.8 0.8 is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1255
01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:06.100
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to figure anything else</v>

1256
01:07:06.101 --> 01:07:08.110
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why it happens.</v>

1257
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.840
<v Speaker 1>It just covers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never see it.</v>

1258
01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:14.980
<v Speaker 1>You never see an explanation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete in psychology.</v>

1259
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like the most powerful effect ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered.</v>

1260
01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.970
<v Speaker 1>So dominance artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person,</v>

1261
01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:23.440
<v Speaker 1>he's painted the Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Harvey.</v>

1262
01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.410
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about him as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who created it.</v>

1263
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.920
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can sort of think of him as the</v>

1264
01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:32.140
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1265
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:35.080
<v Speaker 1>and he's a symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of looking at it</v>

1266
01:07:35.081 --> 01:07:36.570
<v Speaker 1>because this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1267
01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:38.620
<v Speaker 1>this king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a k annual serious,</v>

1268
01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:41.590
<v Speaker 1>he's also a god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also the Egyptian Pharaoh because</v>

1269
01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:46.360
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians presumed that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>feral was ocirus and he had to take on</v>

1270
01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:48.460
<v Speaker 1>the being of those serious when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>became cake,</v>

1271
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:50.740
<v Speaker 1>when it was coronated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you're not a person</v>

1272
01:07:50.741 --> 01:07:52.810
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the embodiment of the state.</v>

1273
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.500
<v Speaker 1>And that happens to people when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they turned into the president of</v>

1274
01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1275
01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.640
<v Speaker 1>they're not whoever they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hardly them at all.</v>

1276
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:03.550
<v Speaker 1>They're now is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that's at the top</v>

1277
01:08:03.551 --> 01:08:04.384
<v Speaker 1>of the dominant term.</v>

1278
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And it's the thing that represents</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1279
01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Now the Egyptians knew that it could go</v>
<v Speaker 1>stray to become tyrannical in religion.</v>

1280
01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:15.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's why Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious had an evil brothers sad.</v>

1281
01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:16.490
<v Speaker 1>But we won't talk about him for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

1282
01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Now he's the upper world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is isis.</v>

1283
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Isis is his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Isis is queen of the underworld.</v>

1284
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>And she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason she's feminine as far as,</v>

1285
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>as far as we can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because from a symbolic perspective,</v>

1286
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:37.160
<v Speaker 1>femininity represents more of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility rather than actuality.</v>

1287
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:40.730
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>defining characteristic of the feminine</v>

1288
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:43.340
<v Speaker 1>is the capacity to bring forth new</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>

1289
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're gonna use the feminine</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a symbolic representation,</v>

1290
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:51.860
<v Speaker 1>you're going to use it to represent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain from which new forms come emerge,</v>

1291
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 1>the domain from which new forms emerge</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of the domain of the</v>

1292
01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:59.720
<v Speaker 1>unknown or the domain of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's mother nature and Isis</v>

1293
01:08:59.721 --> 01:09:02.300
<v Speaker 1>is mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's also queen of the underworld</v>

1294
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:05.150
<v Speaker 1>and she had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isis had an immense following in the</v>

1295
01:09:05.151 --> 01:09:07.520
<v Speaker 1>ancient world and variance of Isis.</v>

1296
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.700
<v Speaker 1>They like her as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a goddess of worship.</v>

1297
01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her span of existence was thousands and</v>

1298
01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.401
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1299
01:09:16.401 --> 01:09:21.350
<v Speaker 1>even a lot of the attention that's paid</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards married Catholicism is a</v>

1300
01:09:21.351 --> 01:09:24.110
<v Speaker 1>variation of the generation that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>shown the isis,</v>

1301
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:27.800
<v Speaker 1>that stuff often on top of her head</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1302
01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:30.230
<v Speaker 1>That's usually a very intense with</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

1303
01:09:30.231 --> 01:09:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Moon warhol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in this particular situation,</v>

1304
01:09:32.811 --> 01:09:34.540
<v Speaker 1>that's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are actually accountable.</v>

1305
01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cirrus and Isis and they are teams,</v>

1306
01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:45.830
<v Speaker 1>so their wedding together order and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

1307
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Speaker 1>they're wedded together and ordered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's culture and chaos.</v>

1308
01:09:49.401 --> 01:09:52.160
<v Speaker 1>That's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two most fundamental</v>

1309
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:55.550
<v Speaker 1>constituent elements of the world from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mythological or symbolic</v>

1310
01:09:55.551 --> 01:09:58.580
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is there's always</v>

1311
01:09:58.581 --> 01:10:01.340
<v Speaker 1>been cultured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least always discoursed.</v>

1312
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Any of us need to bother with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always been an interpretive</v>

1313
01:10:04.761 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 1>framework through which conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures viewed the world.</v>

1314
01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.390
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be without having a structure.</v>

1315
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And that structure is inculcated inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in a lot of it's culturally</v>

1316
01:10:15.801 --> 01:10:17.600
<v Speaker 1>transmitted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't all of a lot of it.</v>

1317
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:21.050
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a precondition for existence that</v>

1318
01:10:21.051 --> 01:10:24.350
<v Speaker 1>you're a structured thing and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure is ordered.</v>

1319
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And then the other element of existence</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there are things that are</v>

1320
01:10:28.401 --> 01:10:31.430
<v Speaker 1>outside of that order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All ways that you can't cope with</v>

1321
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.020
<v Speaker 1>because you're a finite thing and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is a finite and founded thing.</v>

1322
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:41.170
<v Speaker 1>And outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's mystery and there's mystery.</v>

1323
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Like an outside is a funny place because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not outside in the,</v>

1324
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.290
<v Speaker 1>in the way that you think about being</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of building.</v>

1325
01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Although it is that in so far as it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold and dangerous out there.</v>

1326
01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.380
<v Speaker 1>But there's outsides everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1327
01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:55.370
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1328
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:57.830
<v Speaker 1>if you know someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're in a relationship with them</v>

1329
01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.760
<v Speaker 1>and you know you're kinda comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and then one day you're having</v>

1330
01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:04.430
<v Speaker 1>a conversation with them and they tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you something shocking.</v>

1331
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in an intimate relationship with</v>

1332
01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:10.460
<v Speaker 1>them and they tell you that maybe it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day they tell you that they are</v>

1333
01:11:10.461 --> 01:11:14.520
<v Speaker 1>having an affair or maybe that they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>five that they're still going on.</v>

1334
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden one second you</v>

1335
01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:22.770
<v Speaker 1>were inside a close and isolated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable cultural space.</v>

1336
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:26.610
<v Speaker 1>And the next second you're outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because no matter where you</v>

1337
01:11:26.611 --> 01:11:28.970
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries of your known Joanie</v>

1338
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
<v Speaker 1>extends so far and the fact that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>very limited in what you apprehend can</v>

1339
01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>be made manifest to you at any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of your presuppositions can fail,</v>

1340
01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:41.850
<v Speaker 1>especially in relationship to other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people or yourself.</v>

1341
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:44.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're all of a sudden</v>

1342
01:11:44.311 --> 01:11:47.460
<v Speaker 1>informed by a longterm partner that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been having an affair,</v>

1343
01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:50.010
<v Speaker 1>like that certainly says something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1344
01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.710
<v Speaker 1>But it's certainly also says something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>

1345
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:55.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like how dumb can you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1346
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:59.970
<v Speaker 1>How did you not notice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you so naive and you might think</v>

1347
01:11:59.971 --> 01:12:03.000
<v Speaker 1>it's cruel to blame the victim and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt it is,</v>

1348
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:06.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's irrelevant in this case because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're going to think in any</v>

1349
01:12:06.211 --> 01:12:07.470
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1350
01:12:07.471 --> 01:12:09.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're wandering around thinking</v>

1351
01:12:09.001 --> 01:12:12.720
<v Speaker 1>you're a reasonably perceptive and well</v>
<v Speaker 1>adapted creature and all of a sudden</v>

1352
01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:14.250
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone pulls the rug out from</v>

1353
01:12:14.251 --> 01:12:17.130
<v Speaker 1>underneath you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you might doubt them and</v>

1354
01:12:17.131 --> 01:12:19.830
<v Speaker 1>certainly you will and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships for a long time,</v>

1355
01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:24.030
<v Speaker 1>but you could also be sure you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to doubt yourself and your past,</v>

1356
01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:27.870
<v Speaker 1>which is weird because you think it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>already done with and your presence and</v>

1357
01:12:27.871 --> 01:12:29.850
<v Speaker 1>your future's like all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

1358
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:32.580
<v Speaker 1>you're not in culture anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poof,</v>

1359
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you're in the underworld</v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

1360
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Chaos now ordered chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

1361
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:41.800
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

1362
01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.840
<v Speaker 1>That's Yin and Yang as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can unite to produce some third</v>

1363
01:12:45.841 --> 01:12:49.770
<v Speaker 1>thing and that's often the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be the sun as in the thing that</v>

1364
01:12:49.771 --> 01:12:52.770
<v Speaker 1>shines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also in terms of the biological son,</v>

1365
01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:56.430
<v Speaker 1>there are complicated reasons that those</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things are interrelated.</v>

1366
01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.360
<v Speaker 1>This is horace and he's the offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child of Isis and Osiris.</v>

1367
01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:06.080
<v Speaker 1>And I won't tell you the entire story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>

1368
01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a couple of things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>chorus that are worth knowing.</v>

1369
01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:13.880
<v Speaker 1>You've all seen the Egyptian I right</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1370
01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:17.040
<v Speaker 1>with the way the eyebrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's seen that.</v>

1371
01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:19.380
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird cause it's really old</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you all know it.</v>

1372
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Hey that's for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the Egyptian Idi was</v>

1373
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.480
<v Speaker 1>really open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an element of what horse is.</v>

1374
01:13:27.481 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Horace is in fact open eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So horace you could think of as the god</v>

1375
01:13:32.311 --> 01:13:33.144
<v Speaker 1>of attention.</v>

1376
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:35.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not to go out of intellect is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1377
01:13:35.941 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 1>is a very important difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horace is the god of attention.</v>

1378
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:42.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's also why is this</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1379
01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:45.140
<v Speaker 1>You see he's got the head of a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not any old brewery.</v>

1380
01:13:45.141 --> 01:13:47.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason the Egyptians put the</v>

1381
01:13:47.851 --> 01:13:51.600
<v Speaker 1>head of a Falcon on choruses because</v>
<v Speaker 1>falcons can really see,</v>

1382
01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:55.440
<v Speaker 1>they're like super observant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they fly above everything so they can</v>

1383
01:13:55.441 --> 01:13:57.870
<v Speaker 1>see everywhere there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>above everything there,</v>

1384
01:13:57.871 --> 01:14:00.720
<v Speaker 1>even above the dominance hierarchies</v>
<v Speaker 1>there way up there in the sky.</v>

1385
01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And from that position in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can see everything and that makes</v>

1386
01:14:05.881 --> 01:14:10.881
<v Speaker 1>them powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Egyptian on the was that the</v>

1387
01:14:11.231 --> 01:14:16.231
<v Speaker 1>proper downloads between order and chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>made you alert with your eyes open.</v>

1388
01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:19.590
<v Speaker 1>And that was what made you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

1389
01:14:19.591 --> 01:14:21.970
<v Speaker 1>That was an element of human divinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

1390
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:23.890
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the deepest expression of your</v>

1391
01:14:23.891 --> 01:14:25.960
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the way of thinking about that.</v>

1392
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.940
<v Speaker 1>So what happens to you if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere where everything is entirely</v>

1393
01:14:30.941 --> 01:14:31.990
<v Speaker 1>predictable and comfortable?</v>

1394
01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:34.613
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

1395
01:14:35.730 --> 01:14:37.020
<v Speaker 1>You get lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get bored.</v>

1396
01:14:37.021 --> 01:14:39.210
<v Speaker 1>What else happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1397
01:14:39.211 --> 01:14:40.800
<v Speaker 1>you certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to pay attention,</v>

1398
01:14:40.801 --> 01:14:42.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when you released,</v>

1399
01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.990
<v Speaker 1>stopped paying attention?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Fall Asleep,</v>

1400
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:48.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know you're fighting the</v>

1401
01:14:48.031 --> 01:14:49.920
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just have a nice meal.</v>

1402
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:52.950
<v Speaker 1>You know that like nothing's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come rampaging through your front door.</v>

1403
01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:55.380
<v Speaker 1>And so what the hell do you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>awake for?</v>

1404
01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Oof Asleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now that's good.</v>

1405
01:14:58.941 --> 01:15:00.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you don't have to sleep,</v>

1406
01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:02.910
<v Speaker 1>but as a lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhat limiting.</v>

1407
01:15:02.911 --> 01:15:05.880
<v Speaker 1>So if you're just sitting around hyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable all the time,</v>

1408
01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:09.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like you get all Doley and useless</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not helpful.</v>

1409
01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the sort of couch potato thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1410
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:13.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful because if anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>does come along,</v>

1411
01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.560
<v Speaker 1>you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And plus you're nothing like you could</v>

1412
01:15:16.561 --> 01:15:18.690
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think,</v>

1413
01:15:18.691 --> 01:15:22.500
<v Speaker 1>well the more ordered the better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which is exactly what fascists think</v>

1414
01:15:22.501 --> 01:15:25.290
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with too much order is</v>

1415
01:15:25.291 --> 01:15:28.140
<v Speaker 1>that there's no utility and you even</v>
<v Speaker 1>being there cause everything's perfect</v>

1416
01:15:28.141 --> 01:15:30.300
<v Speaker 1>and it's already done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might as well just be asleep.</v>

1417
01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:34.140
<v Speaker 1>There's no need for consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to have a little chaos</v>

1418
01:15:34.141 --> 01:15:36.060
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask,</v>

1419
01:15:36.061 --> 01:15:38.400
<v Speaker 1>well how much chaos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that answer would be,</v>

1420
01:15:38.670 --> 01:15:42.450
<v Speaker 1>well how about not enough to paralyze</v>
<v Speaker 1>you because that's too much.</v>

1421
01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Then you're just praying and you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be awake.</v>

1422
01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:46.763
<v Speaker 1>But it's like</v>

1423
01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:48.843
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

1424
01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:53.520
<v Speaker 1>terror is a form of consciousness I</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose.</v>

1425
01:15:53.521 --> 01:15:56.760
<v Speaker 1>But we might as well not presume that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the optimal form.</v>

1426
01:15:56.761 --> 01:16:00.270
<v Speaker 1>It's also rather self limiting because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're terrified long enough,</v>

1427
01:16:00.450 --> 01:16:04.350
<v Speaker 1>you'll just die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not an optimal state.</v>

1428
01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:06.840
<v Speaker 1>It's also one you'll strive generally to</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid.</v>

1429
01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:07.741
<v Speaker 1>So let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1430
01:16:07.741 --> 01:16:11.400
<v Speaker 1>how much chaos should you have around</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of what's unpredictable should</v>

1431
01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you have around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we could say just enough to make you</v>

1432
01:16:14.431 --> 01:16:16.830
<v Speaker 1>optimally awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1433
01:16:16.831 --> 01:16:20.160
<v Speaker 1>So you should be pushing yourself hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough at each point.</v>

1434
01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:22.890
<v Speaker 1>You want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have one foot in order.</v>

1435
01:16:23.130 --> 01:16:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're secure and stable and you have</v>

1436
01:16:25.381 --> 01:16:28.440
<v Speaker 1>one foot in chaos so that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly sure what's going to happen</v>

1437
01:16:28.441 --> 01:16:31.830
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that you're pushed to transform and</v>

1438
01:16:31.831 --> 01:16:35.520
<v Speaker 1>change and grow and develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell when you're there</v>

1439
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:38.130
<v Speaker 1>because then you're alert and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention.</v>

1440
01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.710
<v Speaker 1>And so at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians would say,</v>

1441
01:16:40.711 --> 01:16:43.860
<v Speaker 1>well then you're optimally embodied</v>
<v Speaker 1>horace,</v>

1442
01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:48.750
<v Speaker 1>who's the third element of experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One ordered to pay off,</v>

1443
01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:51.950
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that mediates between order of</v>

1444
01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.150
<v Speaker 1>males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're doing that optimally,</v>

1445
01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:55.950
<v Speaker 1>then you know the end of the Yang</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol.</v>

1446
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I think I've got it here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

1447
01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1448
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Those are two circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1449
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:13.910
<v Speaker 1>for black surface that's paid on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's an interesting symbol because</v>

1450
01:17:13.911 --> 01:17:15.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a white circle in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1451
01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that things might be</v>

1452
01:17:17.871 --> 01:17:19.910
<v Speaker 1>pretty gloomy and dark because it's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic.</v>

1453
01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:22.370
<v Speaker 1>But at any point order can arise out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1454
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:24.980
<v Speaker 1>And you know how that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you go through a terrible</v>

1455
01:17:24.981 --> 01:17:28.190
<v Speaker 1>period of transformation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's instead get shaky and like</v>

1456
01:17:28.191 --> 01:17:30.770
<v Speaker 1>it passes him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're even better off than you</v>

1457
01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:34.790
<v Speaker 1>were before and maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at least sometimes it happens.</v>

1458
01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And then the white circle and had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>black guy.</v>

1459
01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:38.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1460
01:17:38.451 --> 01:17:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just when you think you're safe,</v>

1461
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:42.800
<v Speaker 1>the rug gets pulled out from underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1462
01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:45.890
<v Speaker 1>So there's a dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what the Dallas believe and what</v>

1463
01:17:45.891 --> 01:17:50.240
<v Speaker 1>they state explicitly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is a dynamic between chaos and</v>

1464
01:17:50.241 --> 01:17:50.780
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

1465
01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:54.250
<v Speaker 1>The world of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world that human beings existed.</v>

1466
01:17:54.251 --> 01:17:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a dynamic between chaos and order</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the function of a human being is to</v>

1467
01:17:59.121 --> 01:18:02.690
<v Speaker 1>juggle those and keep the ballots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell when you're doing now</v>

1468
01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.630
<v Speaker 1>because you're awake and you were paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

1469
01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And not only are you healthy in who and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are,</v>

1470
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.260
<v Speaker 1>but you're moving towards something</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1471
01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:15.890
<v Speaker 1>And when that happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're possessed by a deep</v>

1472
01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:20.120
<v Speaker 1>intimation of meaning because meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>signifies something.</v>

1473
01:18:20.121 --> 01:18:25.010
<v Speaker 1>And what it signifies is that you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right place at the right time.</v>

1474
01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 1>And so you can learn to stay there by</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the balance of chaos</v>

1475
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:33.020
<v Speaker 1>and order in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the better you get at staying there,</v>

1476
01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:36.560
<v Speaker 1>this is the kickoff for from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian perspective.</v>

1477
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:41.770
<v Speaker 1>The better you get at staying there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more in permian impermeable you are</v>

1478
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:46.010
<v Speaker 1>to chaos and order because you can learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>to handle it.</v>

1479
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.660
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1480
01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.900
<v Speaker 1>life presents you with a challenge with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to its ultimate significance,</v>

1481
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:54.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

1482
01:18:54.801 --> 01:18:57.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the use of human striving in the</v>

1483
01:18:57.261 --> 01:18:59.630
<v Speaker 1>face of everything that's terrible in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

1484
01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:04.840
<v Speaker 1>including our own vulnerability as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to eliminate that,</v>

1485
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:10.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible that if you balance</v>
<v Speaker 1>things properly that you can learn to</v>

1486
01:19:10.191 --> 01:19:13.070
<v Speaker 1>live with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you can even learn to</v>

1487
01:19:13.071 --> 01:19:16.520
<v Speaker 1>understand that those two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dynamism between those two things,</v>

1488
01:19:16.521 --> 01:19:19.520
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a precondition for va and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that without it,</v>

1489
01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:24.510
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be any big because part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you is limited to part of you isn't.</v>

1490
01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.020
<v Speaker 1>If that wasn't the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be you.</v>

1491
01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.590
<v Speaker 1>So the question arises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an existential question.</v>

1492
01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:35.210
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with that set of facts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it looks like your nervous system,</v>

1493
01:19:35.211 --> 01:19:36.950
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has already set up to answer that.</v>

1494
01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put yourself in a situation where you're</v>

1495
01:19:40.491 --> 01:19:42.890
<v Speaker 1>paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you pay enough attention,</v>

1496
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you're right in the place that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be,</v>

1497
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:49.370
<v Speaker 1>that will be at least sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it be more than that.</v>

1498
01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll say it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible preconditions of existence are</v>

1499
01:19:53.811 --> 01:19:56.750
<v Speaker 1>justified by the manner in which it</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself.</v>

1500
01:19:57.670 --> 01:19:59.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's a definition of mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

1501
01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:04.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's implicit in all the clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories that we're going to investigate</v>

1502
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:07.310
<v Speaker 1>trump the duration of the course.</v>

1503
01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
