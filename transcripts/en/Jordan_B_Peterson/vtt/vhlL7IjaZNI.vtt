<v Speaker 1>So I'm here tonight talking to Howard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bloom,</v>

2
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.200
<v Speaker 1>who's a fascinating person and an author</v>
<v Speaker 1>of many books and a polymath of sorts </v>

3
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.720
<v Speaker 1>and we've known each other by electronic</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication for quite a long time.</v>

4
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:31.690
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something exceeding a decade,</v>

5
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.270
<v Speaker 1>but we've never met either in person or </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronically by video until now.</v>

6
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>And I'm Howard is definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's a singular sort of person and </v>

7
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 1>he has a very broad range of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>as broad as anyone I've ever encountered</v>

8
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:51.751
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm going to do first is </v>

9
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.151
<v Speaker 1>turn this over to him so that he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you a little bit about himself and </v>

10
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:57.181
<v Speaker 1>about what he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to talk about his </v>

11
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:00.391
<v Speaker 1>newest book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called how I accidentally </v>

17
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.230

<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

18
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 2>maybe 15 years that we've known each </v>

<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

26
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are buying it because it feels </v>

27
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 2>like it was written yesterday for </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow and people call it their Bible.</v>

28
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:47.911

<v Speaker 2>A radical revision of capitalism.</v>

36
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 2>I preferred its original title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was reinventing capitalist,</v>

37
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 2>importing soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the machine.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and Economic Forum and told them there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a book that I particularly resonate </v>

46
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:41.881
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the genius of the beast and it </v>

<v Speaker 2>contains the future of Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he proceeded to read passages from </v>

48
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.881
<v Speaker 2>that book and Dr a Dot p Dot j Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11th president of India said that that </v>

49
00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 2>book is a visionary creation and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that the sheikh runs do</v>

50
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:54.350
<v Speaker 2>by his former minister of development.</v>

<v Speaker 2>in this world,</v>

53
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done lots and lots of other things.</v>

54
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:11.671
<v Speaker 2>Just a few months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I co founded and shared the Asian space </v>

55
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:16.651
<v Speaker 2>technology summit with a large groups of</v>
<v Speaker 2>representatives from China,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you've ever seen in your life.</v>

59

<v Speaker 2>and I should not forget,</v>

60
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 2>once upon a time I found it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew nothing about popular culture.</v>

61
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 2>I found that the biggest pr firm in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music industry,</v>

62
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 2>I use my scientific tools since it's my </v>
<v Speaker 2>background is science,</v>

63
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 2>my life science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my bones,</v>

64
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 2>and my flesh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our science.</v>

65
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.440
<v Speaker 2>And it became the most successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>theater on the firm and the record </v>

66
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

<v Speaker 2>prince,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob Marley,</v>

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 2>grandmaster flash and the furious five.</v>

74
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Little things like that can't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>only too crazy biography you'd think </v>

75
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to think that someone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>making that up if you didn't know it was</v>

76
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:09.271
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you also accidentally started </v>

77
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:09.271
<v Speaker 2>the sixties apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 2>And it was reading that book about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week ago and thought,</v>

79
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 2>what did you think of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

80
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:14.910
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

81
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:15.840
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

82
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I also thought it was remarkable that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you managed to have a foreword by or I </v>

83
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a former and I don't think it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>commentary by Timothy leary.</v>

84
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

85
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.460
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you how that came about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There I was a.</v>

86
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 2>well it was about 1981 and I started to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to my science.</v>

87
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was running low successful pr from the</v>

88
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 2>music industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

89
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 2>We were still on the ess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

90
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:44.191
<v Speaker 2>We were establishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking unknowns like prince and </v>

91
00:04:44.191 --> 00:04:47.011
<v Speaker 2>establishing them as major stars or Joan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jett who've been turned down by 23 </v>

92
00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 2>record companies and we made her double </v>
<v Speaker 2>platinum in a year and a half.</v>

93
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I finally got a little time for you </v>

94
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.680
<v Speaker 2>to go back to my science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

95
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

96
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.810
<v Speaker 2>I was taking a bunch of journalists out </v>
<v Speaker 2>to long island to see reo speedwagon.</v>

97
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And a bunch of them said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bloom.</v>

98
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 2>All these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep talking about us.</v>

99
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 2>You need to write a book and one of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>will talk me under his wing and actually</v>

100
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 2>mentored me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Timothy White,</v>

101
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 2>who wrote for the Associated Press and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling stone.</v>

102
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I started working on a book in 1984,</v>

103
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>about 1988.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had gotten up and running and written.</v>

104
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:25.741
<v Speaker 2>The first chapter is on a vacation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I came down for two things </v>

105
00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

106
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 2>I really needed to get out of publicity </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the music industry.</v>

107
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:34.201
<v Speaker 2>I have satisfied all of my intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions because there were a set of </v>

108
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 2>questions I was answering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>answering what are the mass exhilaration</v>

109
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 2>for the mass exodus sees the mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions that are the forces of history,</v>

110
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 2>that power historical change.</v>

111
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.410
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see that in miniature with the </v>

112
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Beatles or with Michael Jackson or </v>
<v Speaker 2>prince.</v>

113
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.010
<v Speaker 2>So I gotten this far as I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean youtube would approach me to </v>

114
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 2>represent them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't interested.</v>

115
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm Mick Jagger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had sent an emissary talk about </v>

116
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.950
<v Speaker 2>representing him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't interested.</v>

117
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.960
<v Speaker 2>I'd been through all of this already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you a couple of questions </v>

118
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.960
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

119
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first question would be,</v>

120
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

121
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.510
<v Speaker 2>what is it that you had done that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared you for that and how and how </v>

122
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 2>did you manage it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess that's two questions,</v>

123
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 2>but also what did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you learn from all of that?</v>

124
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.850
<v Speaker 2>These are very great questions to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare me for this Martin Gardner from </v>

125
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 2>the time I was 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading two books a day,</v>

126
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my teachers say to me because I was </v>

127
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 2>reading a book under the desk at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>times and never,</v>

128
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.820
<v Speaker 2>ever paid attention to them and many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these science books and I read the </v>

129
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.661
<v Speaker 2>scientific American from cover to cover </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Martin Gardner who is a </v>

130
00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 2>mathematician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a column called Mathematical Games.</v>

131
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 2>And I learned what I know from </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematical games.</v>

132
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:50.380
<v Speaker 2>It taught me certain techniques I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to bring in.</v>

133
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 2>So the record industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a hell of a stretch.</v>

134
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean singular story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how.</v>

135
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so elaborate on that.</v>

136
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it taught is how to look for </v>

137
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.621
<v Speaker 2>correlations and more than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematical techniques for finding </v>

138
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:10.691
<v Speaker 2>correlations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gave you a gut feel of what a </v>

139
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:13.871
<v Speaker 2>correlation looks like so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to go off to a world of </v>

140
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 2>mathematics that was so arcane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had no relationship to reality.</v>

141
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 2>You could take the search for </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlations into the real world.</v>

142
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to music as obsessively from </v>

143
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.981
<v Speaker 2>the time I was about 10 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my uncle and I used to stand next to a </v>

144
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:34.151
<v Speaker 2>huge old burl would radio that was as </v>
<v Speaker 2>tall as I was at the time and it had a </v>

145
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 2>giant speaker in Jordan in those days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 inch speakers.</v>

146
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Nobody to receive wellborn speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it had one.</v>

147
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.210
<v Speaker 2>And we've listened to the classical </v>
<v Speaker 2>music station in Canada because we were </v>

148
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.511
<v Speaker 2>in buffalo on the border and we would </v>
<v Speaker 2>compete to see who can identify a piece </v>

149
00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:55.241
<v Speaker 2>of music by its first four notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While often we can both identify the </v>

150
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 2>piece of music by first note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

151
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 2>it was all classical music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was rough,</v>

152
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Montereau,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bartow,</v>

153
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Beethoven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stravinsky.</v>

154
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm Mozart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

155
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 2>So I can't really say that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly prepared because I was hated by</v>

156
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 2>the other kids my age in Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>

157
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 2>and my parents didn't have any time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

158
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.710
<v Speaker 2>So I was an outcast and the the crowd of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that shut me out,</v>

159
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.100
<v Speaker 2>listen to popular music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So popular music.</v>

160
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 2>What started is with Elvis Presley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was around before Elvis Presley and</v>

161
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 2>then moved on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was alien music for me and I wasn't</v>

162
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 2>the least bit interested in it and.</v>

163
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
<v Speaker 2>But in the 1970 [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>late 19 sixties and early 19 seventies,</v>

164
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I knew I had fellowships at for Grad </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>

165
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm in what is now called neuroscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that point,</v>

166
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.450
<v Speaker 2>it was a do it yourself proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to have to take courses in </v>

167
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 2>the med school at Columbia and flipped </v>
<v Speaker 2>them together with courses in psychology</v>

168
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.860
<v Speaker 2>at Columbia and make my own neuroscience</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there were no neuroscience </v>

169
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.440
<v Speaker 2>courses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had four fellowships to do this </v>

170
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 2>and I realized that Grad school would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>Auschwitz for the mind.</v>

171
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was fascinated by these </v>

172
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.341
<v Speaker 2>ecstatic mass passions that young people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that boost people out of themselves,</v>

173
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 2>but lift them into something much bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>than themselves,</v>

174
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.200
<v Speaker 2>a deep need that every human has to feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point a part of something much </v>

175
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.371
<v Speaker 2>bigger than his or herself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are the mass passions that </v>

176
00:09:22.371 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 2>create historical change.</v>

177
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>They are the forces of history and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to get to study mass passions.</v>

178
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I was not going to get to make contact </v>
<v Speaker 2>with mass fashions.</v>

179
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.080
<v Speaker 2>If I went onto win academic career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be spending the rest of my life </v>

180
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.370
<v Speaker 2>giving paper and Pencil tests to 22 </v>
<v Speaker 2>college students in exchange for a </v>

181
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 2>psychology credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

182
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:46.371
<v Speaker 2>exactly how much ecstatic experience are</v>
<v Speaker 2>you going to see in a classroom of that </v>

183
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 2>sort with type paper and pencil tests?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

184
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.680
<v Speaker 2>The entire phenomena I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand would not be there anywhere </v>

185
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.611
<v Speaker 2>in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I took advantage of the fact that I </v>

186
00:09:58.611 --> 00:10:01.461
<v Speaker 2>had basically been kidnapped and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>junior year by the poet in residence at </v>

187
00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Nyu who had said he'd said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look low when everybody will hear us out</v>

188
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 2>of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Close the door.</v>

189
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:09.570
<v Speaker 2>I know I need to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Jordan,</v>

190
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 2>that means a balling out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

191
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 2>So I waited until everybody left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shut the door.</v>

192
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:19.491
<v Speaker 2>I sat down in the your about to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>balled out chair and the poet and </v>

193
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:20.180
<v Speaker 2>residents said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

194
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 2>last year I asked you to be on the staff</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Literary magazine.</v>

195
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.090
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even show up this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are the literary magazine.</v>

196
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have a faculty advisor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The minute you walk out that door,</v>

197
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:35.601
<v Speaker 2>your it now walk out that door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I walked out the door looking </v>

198
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:38.010
<v Speaker 2>totally baffled because I hated literary</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazines.</v>

199
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.140
<v Speaker 2>They were the most boring things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would ever seen.</v>

200
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.410
<v Speaker 2>You could have a group of Vikings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of whom had drunk a quart of Ale,</v>

201
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bond funking up against the wall and </v>

202
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.721
<v Speaker 2>bonking each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you put a literary magazine and </v>

203
00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:54.930
<v Speaker 2>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Pale blue cover and the mist chosen</v>

204
00:10:54.931 --> 00:10:59.931
<v Speaker 2>type would make either put everybody to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep instantly what would drive them </v>

205
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:00.660
<v Speaker 2>out of the room.</v>

206
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 2>So I looked very confused in a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked up to me and said,</v>

207
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:06.540
<v Speaker 2>you look troubled about something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I help you?</v>

208
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I take you down for a cup of </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee?</v>

209
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:14.211
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what a cup of coffee once </v>
<v Speaker 2>I had grown up with lab rats and and </v>

210
00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:15.840
<v Speaker 2>hamsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not with human beings,</v>

211
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.140
<v Speaker 2>but I followed him obediently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now listers.</v>

212
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.540
<v Speaker 2>And when we sat down at the coffee shop </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I ordered water and he ordered </v>

213
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:23.540
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

214
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.320
<v Speaker 2>if you could do anything you want with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this magazine,</v>

215
00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:29.110
<v Speaker 2>what would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said a picture book so that,</v>

216
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:31.860
<v Speaker 2>that Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned that question,</v>

217
00:11:31.861 --> 00:11:36.861
<v Speaker 2>that question is a very valuable tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I turned it into experimental and </v>

218
00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:40.080
<v Speaker 2>graphics magazine and it was a wild hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a wild hit,</v>

219
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:43.200
<v Speaker 2>not just on campus where they doubled </v>
<v Speaker 2>our budget for the second issue.</v>

220
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 2>It was a wild hit in the art directorial</v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

221
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.800
<v Speaker 2>I think you covered that in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in how I started accidentally started </v>

222
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.220
<v Speaker 2>the 66.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

223
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.210
<v Speaker 2>So what that allowed me to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

224
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 2>is when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my wife was putting pressure on me,</v>

225
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.910
<v Speaker 2>she had had a previous husband who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming she was tired of having student</v>

226
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:06.560
<v Speaker 2>husbands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She made it clear and it kind of sort of</v>

227
00:12:06.561 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 2>voucher a way that if I went off to Grad</v>
<v Speaker 2>School at Columbia,</v>

228
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:15.180
<v Speaker 2>I could kiss her goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a nice idea after three years of </v>

229
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 2>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with all these pressures on me,</v>

230
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:21.481
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I threw my lot in with the artists that </v>

231
00:12:21.481 --> 00:12:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I had assembled for this magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

232
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>we formed an art studio and the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>year we are in $75 a piece,</v>

233
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just enough to get you food and</v>

234
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 2>possibly a little bit of shelter in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York City.</v>

235
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.360
<v Speaker 2>But eventually I made the cover of art </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction magazine.</v>

236
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I invented a new animation technique for</v>
<v Speaker 2>NBC TV and most important by studio did </v>

237
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:49.051
<v Speaker 2>all of the graphics for ABC Seven FM </v>
<v Speaker 2>stations at a time when there was a </v>

238
00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:53.821
<v Speaker 2>revolution taking place in radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this brand new form of radio </v>

239
00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:56.320
<v Speaker 2>called rock radio or album radio or </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive radio.</v>

240
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And with ditch witch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just rocky,</v>

241
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:03.301
<v Speaker 2>so it actually play what they want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was there because ABC seven FM </v>

242
00:13:03.301 --> 00:13:08.281
<v Speaker 2>stations all converted to this new </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive format and they used me,</v>

243
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:13.411
<v Speaker 2>I my art studio to get that across to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids all over the ice.</v>

244
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:19.050
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will respond to all that once I got </v>

245
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.221
<v Speaker 2>to thank you for that because I listened</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Lee Memorial and FM stations a lot </v>

246
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot.</v>

247
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:25.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean lots of people did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know you were.</v>

248
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 2>You had a hand in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was very good thing.</v>

249
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Well I thank you for the thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a hand in that and they abc asked </v>

250
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:38.581
<v Speaker 2>me to form an advertising agency to </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle all of their advertising and </v>

251
00:13:38.581 --> 00:13:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get involved in time </v>

252
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:43.320
<v Speaker 2>buying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just too dry for me.</v>

253
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 2>But because I was walking into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did one other thing.</v>

254
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 2>There was a new magazine with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard kids.</v>

255
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 2>It was a monthly version of the annual </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard Lampoon.</v>

256
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.890
<v Speaker 2>It was called the National Lampoon and </v>
<v Speaker 2>my art studio art directed the first </v>

257
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.170
<v Speaker 2>seven issues that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was ABC pgl roof.</v>

258
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 2>His start there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

259
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

260
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:09.211
<v Speaker 2>And I acted in a Michael O'donoghue </v>
<v Speaker 2>script that we did for the Evergreen </v>

261
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Review,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

262
00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:13.030
<v Speaker 2>which was leading a Bohemian publication</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the time.</v>

263
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:15.430
<v Speaker 2>It's art director was one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who had called me,</v>

264
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:20.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after we saw the Washington Square </v>

265
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.161
<v Speaker 2>review,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the student literary and Graphics </v>

266
00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:23.161
<v Speaker 2>magazine that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've been putting together,</v>

267
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.500
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the promotion person at ABC was </v>

268
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.261
<v Speaker 2>extremely kind to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every time I walked in I'd hear </v>

269
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Carole King or James Taylor who were the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest people in rock music at the time</v>

270
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.680
<v Speaker 2>on the speakers on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she would do things like,</v>

271
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was just clue me in.</v>

272
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:44.020
<v Speaker 2>She was bringing me into the rock and </v>
<v Speaker 2>roll world one day,</v>

273
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:45.250
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

274
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:50.251
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have a live performance </v>

275
00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>to studio b by a penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm</v>

276
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.600
<v Speaker 1>wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering,</v>

277
00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:55.430
<v Speaker 1>I give you two tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took her two tickets.</v>

278
00:14:55.431 --> 00:15:00.431
<v Speaker 1>I went down to my art studio on Fourth </v>
<v Speaker 1>Street and second avenue in the East </v>

279
00:15:00.431 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Speaker 1>village and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my leading artists was just a brilliant,</v>

280
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:08.230
<v Speaker 1>brilliant a cartoonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I invited him to come to this event </v>

281
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.350
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to the event.</v>

282
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.560
<v Speaker 1>The Piano's took to the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My artists sat next to me and from the </v>

283
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 1>minute the pianist played his first </v>
<v Speaker 1>cord,</v>

284
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.860
<v Speaker 1>my artists was on his feet going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

285
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 1>you have the yahoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And totally embarrassing me.</v>

286
00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:27.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to crawl under the seat and </v>

287
00:15:27.581 --> 00:15:29.981
<v Speaker 1>become absolutely invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pianist on stage was out in the </v>

288
00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:34.721
<v Speaker 1>genre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I failed to get was that my artist </v>

289
00:15:34.721 --> 00:15:38.740
<v Speaker 1>was giving Elton John the energy he </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to do the very kind of expanded </v>

290
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.960
<v Speaker 1>performance that takes you out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and makes you feel part of </v>

291
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:43.960
<v Speaker 1>something bigger than yourself.</v>

292
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.020
<v Speaker 1>That I was trapped trying to track down </v>
<v Speaker 1>using things like William James,</v>

293
00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 1>the varieties of religious experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and taking advantage of my,</v>

294
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.100
<v Speaker 1>my special vantage point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

295
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think,</v>

296
00:15:57.651 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

297
00:15:58.341 --> 00:15:59.440
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's cars,</v>

298
00:15:59.441 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of a contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative that runs through that story,</v>

299
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:03.460
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.390
<v Speaker 1>when you're a kid you were sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated,</v>

301
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:08.150
<v Speaker 1>you were booking more scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented,</v>

302
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.450
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you obviously had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

303
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.680
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

304
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:17.681
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a feel for ecstatic experience and like </v>

305
00:16:17.681 --> 00:16:21.100
<v Speaker 1>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that a consequence of your </v>

306
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.021
<v Speaker 1>participation in the counterculture in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sixties or was that something that </v>

307
00:16:23.021 --> 00:16:26.440
<v Speaker 1>emerged even before that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something that emerged probably </v>

308
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.621
<v Speaker 1>between the age of 10 and 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably came from the fact that I </v>

309
00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 1>was suffering serious social </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation.</v>

310
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one friend at a time and that's </v>

311
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.011
<v Speaker 1>about as much as I had and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an indispensable figure when it </v>

312
00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:41.000
<v Speaker 1>came time to beat somebody up because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the target.</v>

313
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how.</v>

314
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:48.101
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting too because that </v>

315
00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:48.101
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

316
00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:51.140
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious how you get from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>position to being interested in ecstatic</v>

317
00:16:51.141 --> 00:16:52.960
<v Speaker 1>experiences per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>

318
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.970
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the connection there with your </v>

319
00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:57.970
<v Speaker 1>rather like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

320
00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Isolated childhood experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>

321
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean you said it had something partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with music,</v>

322
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:07.300
<v Speaker 1>which makes perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect sense to me because music is </v>

323
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:07.300
<v Speaker 1>almost a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

324
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.250
<v Speaker 1>It's an unerring gateway into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecstatic experience,</v>

325
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for,</v>

326
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:16.060
<v Speaker 1>for very complex reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to talk to you about that a </v>

327
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:16.060
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

328
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:21.910
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious why someone who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>more scientifically oriented say would </v>

329
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.200
<v Speaker 1>also make that leap over to the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystical end of things.</v>

330
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.150
<v Speaker 1>And then of course pursue it through pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

331
00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:28.980
<v Speaker 1>So you laid out your surprising </v>
<v Speaker 1>involvement,</v>

332
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:34.020
<v Speaker 1>literary magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your transformation of that into what </v>

333
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.670
<v Speaker 1>was essentially a visual art </v>
<v Speaker 1>publication,</v>

334
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.030
<v Speaker 1>your entry into the world of radio and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then into rock.</v>

335
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lose that thread because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also leads to your pr firm,</v>

336
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:46.350
<v Speaker 1>and I presume we're getting to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what deconditioned or anything that </v>

337
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.450
<v Speaker 1>you can put your finger on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you associated there also with like </v>

338
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 1>being physically bullied and being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>social outcast,</v>

339
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 1>but why did that give you the hunger for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that experience,</v>

340
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 1>for that ecstatic?</v>

341
00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember back to the days of the 19 </v>

342
00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 2>sixties in the 19 seventies when sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>deprivation was a new discovery and then</v>

343
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:05.810
<v Speaker 2>back in the 19 nineties and early two </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands,</v>

344
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Jaak Panksepp took that a step further </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in his studies of rapid behavior,</v>

345
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 2>he discovered that if he deprived a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of child Rhett's,</v>

346
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:16.200
<v Speaker 2>little rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby rats,</v>

347
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 2>if he deprives them of the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play and didn't give them access to each</v>

348
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:26.121
<v Speaker 2>other as peers until they become adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They suffered play deprivation and they </v>

349
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:32.301
<v Speaker 2>spent just as much time playing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other as adults as they would have </v>

350
00:18:32.301 --> 00:18:36.250
<v Speaker 2>spent playing with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have they been allowed to as children?</v>

351
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to make a quick lateral move </v>

352
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:41.500
<v Speaker 1>there and we'll get back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

353
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.920
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these strange,</v>

354
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:47.950
<v Speaker 1>modern manifestations of identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy or that's what it looks to me </v>

355
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.450
<v Speaker 1>like these people who are playing out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they call them,</v>

356
00:18:51.451 --> 00:18:56.451
<v Speaker 1>other kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and playing with their identities and a </v>

357
00:18:56.451 --> 00:18:57.780
<v Speaker 1>really fantasy based way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I wonder if part of that isn't</v>

358
00:18:57.781 --> 00:19:00.210
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of play deprivation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>

359
00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds.</v>

360
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.820
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a distinct possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But remember,</v>

361
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Herman has said that there are somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep dark in the mind.</v>

362
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.140
<v Speaker 2>There is a closet with 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>hidden personalities.</v>

363
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.980
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I discovered were</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get out of chronological order,</v>

364
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.220
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that I discovered </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first became full time involved </v>

365
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.520
<v Speaker 2>with rock and roll was the story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alice Cooper.</v>

366
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.850
<v Speaker 2>And the story of Alice Cooper reveal </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about the question that you </v>

367
00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.211
<v Speaker 2>just raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alice Cooper was a little bit like me </v>

368
00:19:31.211 --> 00:19:34.100
<v Speaker 2>when he was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His mom used to dress up in a suit every</v>

369
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.520
<v Speaker 2>day and he was a gawky thin with a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>nose.</v>

370
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was walking in with a huge nose.</v>

371
00:19:40.251 --> 00:19:42.170
<v Speaker 2>I can identify and never wore suits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

372
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.620
<v Speaker 2>And he was always a teacher's pet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the result was the other kids hated him </v>

373
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.720
<v Speaker 2>and he was kicked around and beaten and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and excluded the way that I'd been </v>

374
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.630
<v Speaker 2>kicked around and beaten and excluded.</v>

375
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Then one day a neighbor was at in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>kitchen who was into a weegee board and </v>

376
00:19:59.541 --> 00:20:02.000
<v Speaker 2>making contact with spirits through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wigi board.</v>

377
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

378
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit allegedly contacted her and said,</v>

379
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I am the ghost of a witch who was burned</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the stake in the 16th century and,</v>

380
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:20.810
<v Speaker 2>or 17th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you pointing to Alice,</v>

381
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm pointing to his saying was runs for </v>
<v Speaker 2>an ea at the time,</v>

382
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.260
<v Speaker 2>pointing to Vince.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are my moderate reincarnation.</v>

383
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.320
<v Speaker 2>And My name is Alice Cooper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

384
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Vince for an ea one onstage and </v>

385
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.101
<v Speaker 2>address with Mascara at a high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>talent night for the very first time </v>

386
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:43.470
<v Speaker 2>playing his own music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chopping up baby dolls with an ax,</v>

387
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.570
<v Speaker 2>which is the more real person Vince for </v>
<v Speaker 2>an EA,</v>

388
00:20:47.571 --> 00:20:52.571
<v Speaker 2>the shy little kid dressed up in a suit </v>
<v Speaker 2>who gave apples to his teacher or Alice </v>

389
00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Cooper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person on stage who comes to life </v>

390
00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.981
<v Speaker 2>with an ecstatic identity that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>them a surfer on the back of those mass </v>

391
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:04.271
<v Speaker 2>passions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those mass exhilaration that make the </v>

392
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:04.271
<v Speaker 2>forces of history.</v>

393
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Well Alice of the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both real people and they're </v>

394
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Speaker 2>both inside events for an ea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the one that's in there that has the</v>

395
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:13.730
<v Speaker 2>greatest passionate intensity is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alice Cooper.</v>

396
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Not the Vince for an ai and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll.</v>

397
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:20.650
<v Speaker 2>He had been picked on and none of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids in his school had liked him.</v>

398
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.320
<v Speaker 2>The minute he finished his first </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance,</v>

399
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.160
<v Speaker 2>all the football guys who used to beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>the crap out of him,</v>

400
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:31.580
<v Speaker 2>surge down to the foot of the stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>volunteer to be parts of his band and </v>

401
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.240
<v Speaker 2>when he was super famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of those guys were still mainstays </v>

402
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.150
<v Speaker 2>of his band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We carry many selves round inside of us </v>

403
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.861
<v Speaker 2>and my job in pr was to find people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>deserved to be iconic and then to </v>

404
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:49.180
<v Speaker 2>explain to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

405
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I will not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think that I as your publicist,</v>

406
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to crash in an artificial mask</v>
<v Speaker 2>and image and through that make you a </v>

407
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:57.760
<v Speaker 2>star.</v>

408
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get you an appointment with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my best competitor immediately.</v>

409
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 2>You'll be with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

410
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.990
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to work with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to understand something.</v>

411
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:11.110
<v Speaker 2>The music you make as a human soul that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from the very soul of you and what</v>

412
00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:16.131
<v Speaker 2>happens to you when you go out on stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>and feel as if yourself leaves you and </v>

413
00:22:16.131 --> 00:22:20.631
<v Speaker 2>you are danced like a puppet or like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>puppet on a string like a marionette on </v>

414
00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:22.420
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The force that moves you,</v>

415
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:27.421
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the gods inside of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is your soul and what you're </v>

416
00:22:27.421 --> 00:22:28.480
<v Speaker 2>experiencing with that audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a soul exchange.</v>

417
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.990
<v Speaker 2>If you're willing to put up with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that music is not about marketing,</v>

418
00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 2>music is not about product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Music is not about downloads,</v>

419
00:22:35.471 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 2>music is about the human soul that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>will work with you</v>

420
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.580
<v Speaker 1>and quite the statement for a Zionist </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheists chew.</v>

421
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is whole and not manner that,</v>

422
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:52.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to Alice Cooper a lot when I </v>

423
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.760
<v Speaker 1>was a kid and still now especially that </v>
<v Speaker 1>record a welcome to my nightmare,</v>

424
00:22:53.761 --> 00:22:55.980
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an absolute classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

425
00:22:55.981 --> 00:22:57.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of pop songs on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

426
00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:03.110
<v Speaker 1>which I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean record companies did that a fair </v>

427
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.110
<v Speaker 1>bit on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

428
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.610
<v Speaker 1>on concept albums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

429
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:09.690
<v Speaker 1>they'd throw a pop hit on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a concept album it's brilliant </v>

430
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.581
<v Speaker 1>and it's really well arranged and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really not horrifying exactly because </v>

431
00:23:16.501 --> 00:23:19.620
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's unbelievably dramatic.</v>

432
00:23:19.621 --> 00:23:24.621
<v Speaker 1>I would say theatrical in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the best way and I really think it's </v>

433
00:23:24.621 --> 00:23:25.710
<v Speaker 1>a work of genius that welcome to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>

434
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:28.170
<v Speaker 1>So and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea that,</v>

435
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:33.290
<v Speaker 1>that that was Alice Cooper's background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I did hear that he was the </v>

436
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:33.420
<v Speaker 1>child of a minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that also correct?</v>

437
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

438
00:23:34.071 --> 00:23:36.500
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father was in the aerospace industry</v>

439
00:23:36.501 --> 00:23:38.030
<v Speaker 2>in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

440
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.970
<v Speaker 2>big aerospace territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

441
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:46.210
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of kids who were turned on to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alice Cooper and were turned on by </v>

442
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.200
<v Speaker 2>shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bands like that were the children of a </v>

443
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.130
<v Speaker 2>ministers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the children of deeply religious people.</v>

444
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.690
<v Speaker 2>The religious right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bringing out the other side of things.</v>

445
00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.750
<v Speaker 2>He did things right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's obviously the precursor of people </v>

446
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:03.740
<v Speaker 2>like Marilyn Manson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

447
00:24:03.741 --> 00:24:06.170
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Marilyn Manson was to sort of cheap,</v>

448
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.540
<v Speaker 2>even though Marilyn Manson was kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to be good.</v>

449
00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:13.541
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marilyn Manson was a kind of cheap a </v>

450
00:24:13.541 --> 00:24:16.690
<v Speaker 2>takeoff on Alice Cooper didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>staying power that Alice seems to have </v>

451
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:17.870
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that I.</v>

452
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.170
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are going to be my client,</v>

453
00:24:21.171 --> 00:24:26.171
<v Speaker 2>as you just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't just tell your audience or </v>

454
00:24:26.171 --> 00:24:26.420
<v Speaker 2>assault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you owe your audience your life.</v>

455
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan had told me 20 years to </v>

456
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.750
<v Speaker 2>articulate what I meant by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

457
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:36.100
<v Speaker 2>and it's simply that if you deserve to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a superstar,</v>

458
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.950
<v Speaker 2>then you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will become an iconic figure.</v>

459
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:45.220
<v Speaker 2>And 12 year old kids will paste posters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his view on their bedroom walls and you </v>

460
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:46.970
<v Speaker 2>will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:50.540
<v Speaker 2>the concept of the Trellis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You grow a tomato plant on a trellis.</v>

462
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be the Trellis on which people </v>

463
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.690
<v Speaker 2>row you will be the role model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your life is one of the most </v>

464
00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:03.221
<v Speaker 2>important things that you have to offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wasn't just after the superficial </v>

465
00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 2>life I was after I was after this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you sit down,</v>

466
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 2>have an afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say 2:00</v>

467
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:12.800
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon with a blank computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen or a blank piece of paper and you</v>

468
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:15.950
<v Speaker 2>need to write a lyric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel as if you could.</v>

469
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.590
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how you've ever written a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lyric in your life.</v>

470
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.220
<v Speaker 2>You certainly know you can't write </v>
<v Speaker 2>another one again and by 4:00</v>

471
00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:26.900
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon on a good day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lyric in front of you by 4:00</v>

472
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:30.380
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really rare day.</v>

473
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.620
<v Speaker 2>That lyric is so perfect in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it feels like it wrote itself </v>

474
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.680
<v Speaker 2>through you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go onstage,</v>

475
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 2>if you see the doc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pupils of the audience dilating,</v>

476
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 2>if you see their faces melting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing individual characteristics.</v>

477
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:50.170
<v Speaker 2>If you see their energy fusing into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective energy rather than just </v>

478
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.990
<v Speaker 2>individual energies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if that collective force reaches a a</v>

479
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:59.060
<v Speaker 2>pseudopod out to you and hooks into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something inside of you that's bigger </v>

480
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.221
<v Speaker 2>than yourself and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll feel like an empty pipe and </v>

481
00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:06.341
<v Speaker 2>something inside you is transmographers </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this energy and flooding it back </v>

482
00:26:06.341 --> 00:26:09.290
<v Speaker 2>down to the audience and reverberate </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tory circuit and you have an out of body</v>

483
00:26:09.291 --> 00:26:14.291
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Watch yourself from the ceiling as </v>

484
00:26:14.291 --> 00:26:14.390
<v Speaker 2>your dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That self inside of you,</v>

485
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:19.391
<v Speaker 2>the dances you onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is your fucking Goddamn soul and </v>

486
00:26:19.391 --> 00:26:23.480
<v Speaker 2>that's my my and tend to find and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I intend to introduce you to.</v>

487
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you are about to become an icon </v>

488
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.740
<v Speaker 2>and if you become an icon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a force that takes </v>

489
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.850
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands or even tens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of kids who feel lost in the </v>

490
00:26:37.191 --> 00:26:42.191
<v Speaker 2>world who don't dare express their </v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings because there are no except </v>

491
00:26:42.191 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>socially acceptable words for their and </v>
<v Speaker 2>who</v>

492
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 1>feel crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated and alone,</v>

493
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.950
<v Speaker 1>and you by revealing what's deep inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you will validate what's deep inside </v>

494
00:26:52.051 --> 00:26:57.051
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you had the other made the </v>

495
00:26:57.051 --> 00:26:59.871
<v Speaker 1>other shoe drop for me then because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you're talking about that at least </v>

496
00:26:59.871 --> 00:27:04.221
<v Speaker 1>in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about that ecstatic </v>

497
00:27:04.221 --> 00:27:06.471
<v Speaker 1>experience as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the necessary counter position to </v>

498
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 1>isolation and abandonment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loneliness and all of those things,</v>

499
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:10.980
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a very,</v>

500
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:14.450
<v Speaker 1>a very reasonable way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

501
00:27:14.451 --> 00:27:19.451
<v Speaker 1>It's like meaning as the antidote to </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation and tragedy and malevolence </v>

502
00:27:19.531 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 1>for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And music is no.</v>

503
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I've thought deeply about music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

504
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to figure out why it has what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it represents and why it has the effects</v>

505
00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:31.380
<v Speaker 1>that it has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

506
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:33.880
<v Speaker 1>and this is a neuroscientific view of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some degree,</v>

507
00:27:33.881 --> 00:27:37.470
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it's better to think</v>

508
00:27:37.471 --> 00:27:42.471
<v Speaker 1>about the world as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as something that consists of patterns </v>

509
00:27:42.471 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 1>rather than as something that consists </v>
<v Speaker 1>of objects.</v>

510
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.040
<v Speaker 1>So an object would actually be a pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sustains itself across time.</v>

511
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not all that very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good insight.</v>

512
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I get applause for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

513
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

514
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:54.000
<v Speaker 1>so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

515
00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:59.290
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can even think about the way the </v>

516
00:27:59.290 --> 00:27:59.290
<v Speaker 1>visual system works this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

517
00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to think that there's a world </v>

518
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:03.630
<v Speaker 1>out there and then there's an image of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that world projected onto our retina and</v>

519
00:28:03.631 --> 00:28:07.770
<v Speaker 1>then the images is reconstructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in our visual cortex.</v>

520
00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

521
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.400
<v Speaker 1>then we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can become conscious of that image </v>

522
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 1>and planner actions and in consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

523
00:28:14.491 --> 00:28:19.491
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way it works is that there are </v>

524
00:28:19.491 --> 00:28:23.451
<v Speaker 1>patterns in the world and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns are shifted into patterns of </v>

525
00:28:23.451 --> 00:28:26.010
<v Speaker 1>light of illumination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those are shifted into patterns</v>

526
00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:27.660
<v Speaker 1>of neural activity on the retina.</v>

527
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.960
<v Speaker 1>And then those are shifted into patterns</v>
<v Speaker 1>of neural conductance,</v>

528
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.590
<v Speaker 1>the optical nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then patterns in the visual Cortex,</v>

529
00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 1>and then those are expressed as patterns</v>
<v Speaker 1>of movement.</v>

530
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.740
<v Speaker 1>So it's all the transformations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns and the meeting of a visual </v>

531
00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.030
<v Speaker 1>perception is the pattern of action that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives rise to,</v>

532
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.520
<v Speaker 1>which is why you need a body meant to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to perceive.</v>

533
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:52.850
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason that music speaks</v>
<v Speaker 1>so deeply to us of fundamental meaning </v>

534
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.710
<v Speaker 1>is because it's actually the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative art form.</v>

535
00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:00.100
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people think about it in some </v>

536
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:00.100
<v Speaker 1>senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the least representative art form.</v>

537
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's right at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it represents the reality that </v>

538
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.431
<v Speaker 1>exists in a profound sense beyond what </v>
<v Speaker 1>our senses revealed to us moment to </v>

539
00:29:07.431 --> 00:29:12.411
<v Speaker 1>moment and so it puts people then when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're moving to the music and we were </v>

540
00:29:12.411 --> 00:29:13.800
<v Speaker 1>all moving to the music or when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing,</v>

541
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:18.801
<v Speaker 1>let's say with someone else and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're as pairs and you're all </v>

542
00:29:18.801 --> 00:29:18.801
<v Speaker 1>dancing together.</v>

543
00:29:18.801 --> 00:29:21.900
<v Speaker 1>It's that the patterns of the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

544
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:27.110
<v Speaker 1>manifesting themselves as the patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the music manifesting themselves as </v>

545
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.760
<v Speaker 1>the patterns of your body and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>syncopation with everyone else.</v>

546
00:29:29.761 --> 00:29:34.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's also a symbolic representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a harmonious and ideal society.</v>

547
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.750
<v Speaker 1>And there it is something that's beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

548
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interest.</v>

549
00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:39.650
<v Speaker 1>So I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

550
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.830
<v Speaker 1>so partly what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I understand you,</v>

551
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:46.831
<v Speaker 1>is that for you there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ecstatic collective experience that </v>

552
00:29:46.831 --> 00:29:50.820
<v Speaker 1>was associated with music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example in pop music perhaps was you</v>

553
00:29:50.821 --> 00:29:54.210
<v Speaker 1>could see it out very clearly as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidote to painful isolation.</v>

554
00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.080
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>

555
00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.170
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that struck me as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

556
00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.700
<v Speaker 1>as struck me as near miraculous about </v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

557
00:29:59.701 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 1>especially in a rather nihilistic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheistic society,</v>

558
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:07.470
<v Speaker 1>is that it really does fill the void </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was left by the death of God.</v>

559
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationally critique music.</v>

560
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it speaks to you.</v>

561
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:16.180
<v Speaker 1>It speaks of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no matter what you say about it,</v>

562
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.240
<v Speaker 1>no matter how cynical you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot put a crow bar underneath </v>

563
00:30:21.511 --> 00:30:23.130
<v Speaker 1>that and lifted up and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

564
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.830
<v Speaker 1>and toss it aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And music was so,</v>

565
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:33.110
<v Speaker 1>such a powerful cultural force in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties and the seventies and </v>

566
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.110
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

567
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.120
<v Speaker 2>powerful force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the other,</v>

568
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 2>the other element is very important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this music is the voice of a subculture.</v>

569
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:44.490
<v Speaker 2>So when you tell 100 million kids who </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed utterly isolated and alone that </v>

570
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:48.721
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that their experiences have not been </v>

571
00:30:48.721 --> 00:30:48.721
<v Speaker 2>reflected in the experience of any other</v>
<v Speaker 2>person on earth,</v>

572
00:30:48.721 --> 00:30:50.530
<v Speaker 2>that in fact they are not alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Layer a movement.</v>

573
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give a subculture,</v>

574
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:55.600
<v Speaker 2>a voice and you can see that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

575
00:30:55.601 --> 00:30:57.850
<v Speaker 2>when I finally got into working with </v>
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>

576
00:30:57.851 --> 00:31:01.300
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things I did was work </v>
<v Speaker 2>with country and western music.</v>

577
00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Now Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

578
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I worked with a company called dot </v>
<v Speaker 2>records.</v>

579
00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I was hired by a Gulf of western to </v>
<v Speaker 2>found a public artist relations </v>

580
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.500
<v Speaker 2>departments where there 14 record </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

581
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.660
<v Speaker 2>And one of those companies was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>records and dot records was number three</v>

582
00:31:15.661 --> 00:31:20.661
<v Speaker 2>on the country charts and that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>with third place company and he wanted </v>

583
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.540
<v Speaker 2>to be number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

584
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.520
<v Speaker 2>in country and western music now when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a child when I was about three and a</v>

585
00:31:26.521 --> 00:31:31.521
<v Speaker 2>half years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I woke up on a Sunday before anybody </v>

586
00:31:31.521 --> 00:31:31.920
<v Speaker 2>else in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so had woken up,</v>

587
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.350
<v Speaker 2>went out to the front room where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was sunlight,</v>

588
00:31:34.351 --> 00:31:39.351
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't get to see as often as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like and turned on the radio and </v>

589
00:31:39.351 --> 00:31:40.970
<v Speaker 2>because it was 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning or something like that,</v>

590
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:44.750
<v Speaker 2>what I got were from reports and country</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Western music.</v>

591
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.450
<v Speaker 2>This was in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

592
00:31:47.451 --> 00:31:50.570
<v Speaker 2>46 or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 1947.</v>

593
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:56.110
<v Speaker 2>And I immediately knew that that music </v>
<v Speaker 2>was alien to me and I knew that it was </v>

594
00:31:57.521 --> 00:32:02.521
<v Speaker 2>the music of another subculture would </v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily be kind to the </v>

595
00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:05.320
<v Speaker 2>subculture from which I came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I never liked country music.</v>

596
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:10.340
<v Speaker 2>But in the 19 seventies when I got this </v>
<v Speaker 2>position with Gulf and western,</v>

597
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:15.670
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I crusaded for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardest was country and western music </v>

598
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.840
<v Speaker 2>because I felt that these people had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to express their identity.</v>

599
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I felt they had a right to get beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ghetto of the Bible belt,</v>

600
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.470
<v Speaker 2>which is where they were kept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And where are they were suppressed.</v>

601
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.800
<v Speaker 2>It was an era of subculture is finding </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and expressing their right to</v>

602
00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:32.710
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started with</v>

603
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.880
<v Speaker 1>music really does seem to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>binding capacity,</v>

604
00:32:35.881 --> 00:32:40.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's also something </v>

605
00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:43.370
<v Speaker 1>neurological that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because tell me what you think about </v>

606
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:47.381
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is in accordance with your </v>

607
00:32:47.381 --> 00:32:48.911
<v Speaker 1>observations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that the music that </v>

608
00:32:48.911 --> 00:32:50.990
<v Speaker 1>people listen to as their catalyzing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their adult identity,</v>

609
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:55.580
<v Speaker 1>say between the ages of about 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 to 20,</v>

610
00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

611
00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real intense,</v>

612
00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

613
00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.880
<v Speaker 1>period of neural pruning that occurs at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of adolescence.</v>

614
00:33:02.881 --> 00:33:06.540
<v Speaker 1>So you get an endless amount of neural </v>
<v Speaker 1>neural pruning after,</v>

615
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you're born in the early stages of</v>

616
00:33:09.061 --> 00:33:14.061
<v Speaker 1>infancy because you have a lot of neural</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections and then a lot of them you </v>

617
00:33:14.061 --> 00:33:17.721
<v Speaker 1>kind of tie into your childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell twice as many neurons as you will </v>

618
00:33:17.721 --> 00:33:18.250
<v Speaker 1>actually need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

619
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

620
00:33:19.141 --> 00:33:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

621
00:33:20.281 --> 00:33:25.281
<v Speaker 1>you're a massive possibility and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you dye into your actuality and then </v>

622
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:25.820
<v Speaker 1>that happens again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It laid out lessons,</v>

623
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:30.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is also in schizophrenia develops </v>

624
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.830
<v Speaker 1>because that process seems to go wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some people,</v>

625
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.570
<v Speaker 1>but as you're dying into that adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

626
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that seems to catalyze</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the music of your culture at </v>

627
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.920
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that also seems to unite you in some</v>

628
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:45.630
<v Speaker 1>way underneath rational thought with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people of your generation,</v>

629
00:33:45.631 --> 00:33:48.420
<v Speaker 1>let's say with the people you'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperate with and compete with.</v>

630
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.760
<v Speaker 1>And so there's something really deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that too.</v>

631
00:33:50.761 --> 00:33:52.340
<v Speaker 1>That's not well understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

632
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.360
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I.</v>

633
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know what you think about</v>

634
00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.400
<v Speaker 2>the second element of that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a brilliant observation.</v>

635
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.730
<v Speaker 2>And the second element of that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your late teens,</v>

636
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.220
<v Speaker 2>your prefrontal cortex gets wired up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

637
00:34:06.221 --> 00:34:08.540
<v Speaker 2>what's the prefrontal cortex?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pro.</v>

638
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:13.570
<v Speaker 2>We talk about it as the center of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Administration in the brain executive </v>

639
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.460
<v Speaker 2>functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's primary job is making you human.</v>

640
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:21.510
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would think that means encouraging </v>

641
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.510
<v Speaker 2>certain things like creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

642
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:26.220
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the job of the prefrontal cortex and </v>

643
00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:26.990
<v Speaker 2>making you human is two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

644
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Press things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

645
00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.840
<v Speaker 2>it's too damp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things down.</v>

646
00:34:30.841 --> 00:34:35.841
<v Speaker 2>It's to inhibit things and you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning which things to inhibit after </v>

647
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:38.860
<v Speaker 2>you become utterly grafted into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>subculture.</v>

648
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:44.170
<v Speaker 2>And what is one of the elements that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>grafted you when to your subculture </v>

649
00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:47.860
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what Freud would call the Super </v>

650
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Ego is formed to a certain extent based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on your subculture or connections that </v>

651
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you've developed as a team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

652
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.890
<v Speaker 2>music helps identify that subculture of </v>
<v Speaker 2>which you feel apart.</v>

653
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

654
00:34:58.611 --> 00:34:59.060
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

655
00:34:59.061 --> 00:35:04.061
<v Speaker 1>so partly what's happening there is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because music is poetic and also it's </v>

656
00:35:04.061 --> 00:35:08.320
<v Speaker 1>poetic and emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it also constitutes the,</v>

657
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:13.380
<v Speaker 1>the pre irrational substrate from which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the values of that subculture emerge.</v>

658
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:18.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the mythological </v>

659
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:18.590
<v Speaker 1>substructure of the values of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

660
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.620
<v Speaker 1>And you can make absolute sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

661
00:35:19.621 --> 00:35:21.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that expressed in the lyrics</v>

662
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.290
<v Speaker 1>in particular where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which lay out a system of values in some</v>

663
00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:27.510
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like hip hop</v>

664
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:31.170
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well roughly 95 percent of the lyrics in</v>

665
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:34.320
<v Speaker 2>pop culture or about mating mating </v>
<v Speaker 2>rituals.</v>

666
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:38.910
<v Speaker 2>There were about courtship rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you as a person who is white,</v>

667
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:43.560
<v Speaker 2>the meeting has been upgraded by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best and now includes.</v>

668
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God knows what it was trying to tell us.</v>

669
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.340
<v Speaker 2>So at any rate</v>

670
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.460
<v Speaker 2>you have just emerged from childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

671
00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.490
<v Speaker 2>your hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your sexual hormones so began to act.</v>

672
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Girls as young as 11 can become pregnant</v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

673
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:04.720
<v Speaker 2>And you were obsessed with finding your </v>
<v Speaker 2>place in the world and finding a mate </v>

674
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.960
<v Speaker 2>and courtship rituals mean okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an awful lot to you.</v>

675
00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:12.050
<v Speaker 2>They're about to what they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you were about to embark on for the</v>

676
00:36:12.051 --> 00:36:15.080
<v Speaker 2>next 10 years of your life at least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

677
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.360
<v Speaker 2>and so this obsession with courtship </v>
<v Speaker 2>rituals with mating and dating and </v>

678
00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.230
<v Speaker 2>breaking up and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be trail.</v>

679
00:36:22.231 --> 00:36:25.680
<v Speaker 2>And all of that kind of stuff makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes absolute sense.</v>

680
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

681
00:36:26.961 --> 00:36:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is music frame style too,</v>

682
00:36:28.881 --> 00:36:33.881
<v Speaker 1>because it gives you something that's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>common with your potential mate and it </v>

683
00:36:33.881 --> 00:36:37.160
<v Speaker 1>also gives you a set of rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say stereotyped activities,</v>

684
00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:42.161
<v Speaker 1>but at least predictable activities that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are associated with courtship and made </v>

685
00:36:42.161 --> 00:36:45.521
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be going to concerts and </v>

686
00:36:45.521 --> 00:36:47.090
<v Speaker 1>going to movies which are heavily </v>
<v Speaker 1>musically influenced and dancing and and</v>

687
00:36:47.091 --> 00:36:51.530
<v Speaker 1>even discussing your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shared immersement in whatever that</v>

688
00:36:51.531 --> 00:36:53.350
<v Speaker 1>subculture happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

689
00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:59.610
<v Speaker 2>My guess is that at some point music </v>
<v Speaker 2>provokes oxytocin because oxytocin is </v>

690
00:36:59.841 --> 00:37:04.841
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate bonding hormone and music </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a bath in the sense of human </v>

691
00:37:05.361 --> 00:37:10.361
<v Speaker 2>belonging in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even if you're alone and you're </v>

692
00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:11.930
<v Speaker 2>listening to Pandora or spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all by yourself,</v>

693
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.280
<v Speaker 2>it beans you social bread and meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the in the nervous system,</v>

694
00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:23.361
<v Speaker 2>the central nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything boils down to inhibition or </v>

695
00:37:23.361 --> 00:37:27.461
<v Speaker 2>excitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a hormone of excitation and </v>

696
00:37:27.461 --> 00:37:31.031
<v Speaker 2>it's glutamate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a hormone of inhibition and </v>

697
00:37:31.031 --> 00:37:33.520
<v Speaker 2>that's the Gabba and oxytocin feeds down</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the Gaba system.</v>

698
00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

699
00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.230
<v Speaker 2>The system that keeps you calm down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically it gives you a sense of peace.</v>

700
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now music itself,</v>

701
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first musical.</v>

702
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.780
<v Speaker 2>First I have to give you an experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I had that allowed me to see into </v>

703
00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.930
<v Speaker 2>all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had already been fascinated by the </v>

704
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.710
<v Speaker 2>gods inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I concluded the age of 12,</v>

705
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:57.711
<v Speaker 2>that I was an atheist and if there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>no bounds and they have an above us and </v>

706
00:37:57.711 --> 00:37:57.990
<v Speaker 2>know God's in the ground beneath us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where were the gods,</v>

707
00:37:57.991 --> 00:37:59.400
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents were trying to drive,</v>

708
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:04.500
<v Speaker 2>dragged me an atheist off the high </v>
<v Speaker 2>holiday services and they were so intent</v>

709
00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:09.501
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was literally holding onto the </v>

710
00:38:09.501 --> 00:38:11.861
<v Speaker 2>doorframe of their blue fraser or by now</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgotten car and they were shredding my</v>

711
00:38:13.481 --> 00:38:18.481
<v Speaker 2>socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were practically tearing my shoes </v>

712
00:38:18.481 --> 00:38:18.481
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were doing everything they could to</v>

713
00:38:18.481 --> 00:38:19.270
<v Speaker 2>get me up to the temple.</v>

714
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.630
<v Speaker 2>And so I realized in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the gods are not above,</v>

715
00:38:22.631 --> 00:38:24.180
<v Speaker 2>if the gods are not below,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are they?</v>

716
00:38:24.181 --> 00:38:26.500
<v Speaker 2>They're inside my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're inside my parents,</v>

717
00:38:26.501 --> 00:38:28.300
<v Speaker 2>they're inside of me there inside of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us.</v>

718
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:33.660
<v Speaker 2>So my task at a basically the age of 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>to 13 became use your scientific to find</v>

719
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.310
<v Speaker 2>the gods inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

720
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Well you also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

721
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:44.551
<v Speaker 2>you elaborated on that part of the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>that also made you a tune to those </v>

722
00:38:44.551 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 2>ecstatic experiences because the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've just laid out,</v>

723
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:50.970
<v Speaker 2>or I suppose we laid out together to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree is that perhaps it was that </v>

724
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:56.160
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you were isolated as a kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>made you even more sensitive to the </v>

725
00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.151
<v Speaker 2>collective belonging element of music </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you were so starved for it and </v>

726
00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:06.080
<v Speaker 2>then they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of the gods within that you </v>

727
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:06.080
<v Speaker 2>just laid out.</v>

728
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.660
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me to be very much akin to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you described as either your tactic</v>

729
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:14.251
<v Speaker 2>or your philosophy with regards to pr </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the rock personalities because what </v>

730
00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:18.211
<v Speaker 2>you said you were doing was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make them reveal some of these </v>

731
00:39:18.211 --> 00:39:20.410
<v Speaker 2>archetypal figures within and that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

732
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.480
<v Speaker 2>And that you were actually trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>foster that.</v>

733
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Which meant in some sense you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing pr at all.</v>

734
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:30.270
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell you'd call </v>

735
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.270
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it secular shamanism was a name I</v>

736
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:32.500
<v Speaker 2>was never comfortable with because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so unscientific,</v>

737
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:37.950
<v Speaker 2>but that was the closest I can come to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's like dowsing for the human </v>

738
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.950
<v Speaker 2>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would it be?</v>

739
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:40.260
<v Speaker 2>Any good name for a PR company?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A second.</v>

740
00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

741
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.120
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

742
00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:48.121
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a very useful way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it because obviously one </v>

743
00:39:48.121 --> 00:39:51.970
<v Speaker 2>of the hold overs from the shamanic </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions is obviously music.</v>

744
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

745
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.910
<v Speaker 2>that's just a continuation of the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition thing.</v>

746
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:02.400
<v Speaker 2>There was one very important thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had happened to me when I was 16 years </v>

747
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:02.400
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I was listening,</v>

748
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.560
<v Speaker 2>popular kid in my school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they voted me for two years in a row,</v>

749
00:40:05.561 --> 00:40:07.360
<v Speaker 2>the chairman of the programming </v>
<v Speaker 2>committee,</v>

750
00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:12.361
<v Speaker 2>which means I ran student assemblies </v>
<v Speaker 2>five days a week and I program to a </v>

751
00:40:12.361 --> 00:40:12.820
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

752
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:17.850
<v Speaker 2>so I was the emcee for these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one day that you manage that and </v>

753
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:20.300
<v Speaker 2>similar be unpopular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

754
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.630
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my school had very,</v>

755
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:23.740
<v Speaker 2>very minimally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stole.</v>

756
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:28.750
<v Speaker 2>This school was founded by an Acolyte of</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Dewey and he was behind the scenes </v>

757
00:40:28.841 --> 00:40:31.440
<v Speaker 2>are actually setting the school up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

758
00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools have their popularity positions,</v>

759
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:35.590
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice president,</v>

760
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.760
<v Speaker 2>secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treasurer,</v>

761
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.700
<v Speaker 2>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my school was clever enough to start</v>

762
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 2>putting functional committees together.</v>

763
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:47.580
<v Speaker 2>In your very first days at school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your very first days of your a freshman </v>

764
00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:52.411
<v Speaker 2>year now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have kids vote for president </v>

765
00:40:52.511 --> 00:40:57.511
<v Speaker 2>and vice president road for the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular kid in the school as the </v>

766
00:40:57.511 --> 00:41:00.661
<v Speaker 2>precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second most popular kid as vice </v>

767
00:41:00.661 --> 00:41:03.061
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most popular girl as secretary and </v>

768
00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:04.360
<v Speaker 2>the most popular Jewish treasurer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just the way it goes.</v>

769
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never aligned for any of those </v>

770
00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:10.320
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no popularity whatsoever.</v>

771
00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.970
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my classmates actually fired with</v>

772
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:17.500
<v Speaker 2>remarkable accuracy from only 23 d way a</v>
<v Speaker 2>soccer ball directly into my face.</v>

773
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:22.590
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a lot of force distance of 20 </v>

774
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:22.970
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

775
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.900
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions,</v>

776
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:28.390
<v Speaker 2>like how do we run these school </v>
<v Speaker 2>assemblies?</v>

777
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.890
<v Speaker 2>The popular kids don't have a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you bring them into a room,</v>

778
00:41:32.891 --> 00:41:34.610
<v Speaker 2>if there arbitrarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

779
00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:39.611
<v Speaker 2>assigned to a committee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will all piss on their a little </v>

780
00:41:39.611 --> 00:41:41.810
<v Speaker 2>piece of territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll all stake out a position of some</v>

781
00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:46.700
<v Speaker 2>kind just to establish their status in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the room and after 15 minutes.</v>

782
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.700
<v Speaker 2>So this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've all said their piece and it </v>

783
00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:51.890
<v Speaker 2>comes time to actually do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're clueless,</v>

784
00:41:51.891 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 2>they're silent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what to do.</v>

785
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:59.140
<v Speaker 2>And if there is an unpopular geek like </v>
<v Speaker 2>me who at that 20 minute mark all of a </v>

786
00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:03.911
<v Speaker 2>sudden has an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will glom around you even if they </v>

787
00:42:03.911 --> 00:42:04.260
<v Speaker 2>don't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

788
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.590
<v Speaker 2>So competence can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

789
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.620
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can step in where we're popularity </v>

790
00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:11.620
<v Speaker 2>cannot go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

791
00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a very well put phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

792
00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:17.741
<v Speaker 2>so there I was the head of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>programming committee and one of the </v>

793
00:42:17.741 --> 00:42:19.250
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the juniors came to me and said,</v>

794
00:42:19.251 --> 00:42:21.260
<v Speaker 2>we're doing a dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

795
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're setting up a dance and could you </v>

796
00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.051
<v Speaker 2>advertise it for us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't realize just how absurd </v>

797
00:42:29.051 --> 00:42:32.231
<v Speaker 2>that statement was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's a dance or a party of any </v>

798
00:42:32.231 --> 00:42:32.231
<v Speaker 2>kind in buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>

799
00:42:32.231 --> 00:42:37.061
<v Speaker 2>One of the first things you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize about it is I am not just </v>

800
00:42:37.061 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 2>disinvited.</v>

801
00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:42.780
<v Speaker 2>I haven't decided to stay as far away as</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanly possible and yet they want me to</v>

802
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:45.770
<v Speaker 2>advertise this dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Jordan,</v>

803
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.020
<v Speaker 2>I can't dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

804
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't do a box step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do a Fox trot,</v>

805
00:42:49.821 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I can't do a waltz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do any of those things,</v>

806
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:57.490
<v Speaker 2>but I went onstage and put some music on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the turntable and danced and I saw the </v>

807
00:42:57.981 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 2>pupils dilating of the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred 50 people who hated me and</v>

808
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:04.880
<v Speaker 2>hated me for two and a half years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point,</v>

809
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.700
<v Speaker 2>their pupils were dilating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their faces were melting.</v>

810
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:12.970
<v Speaker 2>I felt that pseudopod of energy coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me and through me as if I were a </v>

811
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:18.191
<v Speaker 2>pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt it going up to something inside </v>

812
00:43:18.191 --> 00:43:19.460
<v Speaker 2>of me more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had level that utterly transmogrified</v>

813
00:43:19.461 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 2>it and I felt the energy being sent </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

814
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Every mood that I was making an I had an</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of body experience.</v>

815
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.940
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was on the ceiling.</v>

816
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:34.180
<v Speaker 2>I've watched all of this from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ceiling and apparently it looked like a </v>

817
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:39.161
<v Speaker 2>loony toon drawn on Lsd as if Chuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones had been doing Tom and Jerry after</v>

818
00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:44.090
<v Speaker 2>taking a very big hit of acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the strangest,</v>

819
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:47.120
<v Speaker 2>weirdest things you've ever seen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was all over.</v>

820
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.360
<v Speaker 2>So that was my ecstatic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it was all over,</v>

821
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.540
<v Speaker 2>the audience did something that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>never done in my days at that school,</v>

822
00:43:53.541 --> 00:43:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I would never do again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So long as I was there,</v>

823
00:43:55.910 --> 00:44:00.910
<v Speaker 2>it surged to the foot of the stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>as if it had practiced this act all its </v>

824
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:02.180
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it picked me up off the stage.</v>

825
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:07.360
<v Speaker 2>It put me on his shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it carried me out of the auditorium and </v>

826
00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.790
<v Speaker 2>it carried me up the pathway to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>building above where we had our classes.</v>

827
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.920
<v Speaker 2>So that was my introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

828
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:14.980
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

829
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:16.850
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

830
00:44:16.851 --> 00:44:21.851
<v Speaker 2>And this is three years after I'd gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>off after the ecstatic experience,</v>

831
00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:23.660
<v Speaker 2>knowing that it was something vital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

832
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:25.970
<v Speaker 2>I'd heard at the age of 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years earlier,</v>

833
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I had heard that there was a book called</v>
<v Speaker 2>the varieties of the religious </v>

834
00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:31.210
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in those days we,</v>

835
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.290
<v Speaker 2>no Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

836
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:36.840
<v Speaker 2>we had local bookstores and local </v>
<v Speaker 2>bookstores in Buffalo.</v>

837
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a break,</v>

838
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
<v Speaker 2>but I finally found a copy of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Buffalo Bookstore and it </v>

839
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.361
<v Speaker 2>felt as if William James had been laying</v>
<v Speaker 2>out a series of examples of the ecstatic</v>

840
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:49.660
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

841
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.800
<v Speaker 2>with all of its delusions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hallucinations and all the rest on a </v>

842
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.390
<v Speaker 2>laboratory bench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then saying to me,</v>

843
00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:58.710
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're coming along.</v>

844
00:44:58.711 --> 00:45:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Seventy years later you're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific tools that I did not have.</v>

845
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.510
<v Speaker 2>This is your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was my job,</v>

846
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:11.511
<v Speaker 2>not just because William James was </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving it to me because something deep </v>

847
00:45:11.511 --> 00:45:12.210
<v Speaker 2>inside of me was crying out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>

848
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:17.450
<v Speaker 2>And it probably was that the privilege </v>
<v Speaker 2>of social disconnection,</v>

849
00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:22.940
<v Speaker 2>the privilege of social deprivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that privilege made me </v>

850
00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:27.141
<v Speaker 2>sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's always made me sensitive to </v>

851
00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:27.141
<v Speaker 2>group behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

852
00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:30.060
<v Speaker 2>So when I was in Moscow in 2005 </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecturing,</v>

853
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:32.760
<v Speaker 2>a group of quantum physicists from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world,</v>

854
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm why everything they know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum physics does wrong.</v>

855
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.700
<v Speaker 2>It's because there is no such thing as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an isolated particle.</v>

856
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Every particle is part of our herd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mob,</v>

857
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.550
<v Speaker 2>a group of some kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

858
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:48.090
<v Speaker 2>the quantum physicists based on the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you,</v>

859
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.320
<v Speaker 2>when you treat a Photon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a single photon in a certain way,</v>

860
00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 2>when you split it into here's how it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to behave.</v>

861
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:59.250
<v Speaker 2>But if it's being measured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to happen.</v>

862
00:45:59.251 --> 00:46:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

863
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.160
<v Speaker 2>We're constantly taking each other's </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure.</v>

864
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Photons are constantly taking each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other's measure because they move in </v>

865
00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:07.400
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowds and herds.</v>

866
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.290
<v Speaker 2>That's why a beam of sunshine comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>through your window,</v>

867
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:12.840
<v Speaker 2>not a photon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sunshine.</v>

868
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:18.530
<v Speaker 2>And when I finished the speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sure they were going to throw me </v>

869
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.410
<v Speaker 2>out of the conference because these are </v>
<v Speaker 2>all people committed deeply to quantum </v>

870
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:25.971
<v Speaker 2>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And instead they sat there beaming like </v>

871
00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:27.540
<v Speaker 2>a proud uncles and I could not figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out why.</v>

872
00:46:27.541 --> 00:46:30.990
<v Speaker 2>And three years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my collaborator in quantum physics,</v>

873
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:32.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the university,</v>

874
00:46:32.641 --> 00:46:37.641
<v Speaker 2>at the mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the Russian Academy of Sciences in </v>

875
00:46:37.641 --> 00:46:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Moscow Sanity Mail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

876
00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Dr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use your club who ran that conference </v>

877
00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.310
<v Speaker 2>and gave you such a hard time about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit card,</v>

878
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.670
<v Speaker 2>has just published a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a new approach to quantum physics.</v>

879
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:51.420
<v Speaker 2>It's called constructive physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to get it immediately.</v>

880
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:56.660
<v Speaker 2>So I downloaded it from org.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to it that afternoon on my </v>

881
00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:01.520
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half walk through the park on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my way to the cafe where I do all my </v>

882
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.220
<v Speaker 2>work and I got all excited.</v>

883
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Every social concept that means every </v>
<v Speaker 2>concept that I had given in this talk </v>

884
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:12.630
<v Speaker 2>was in this book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Jordan,</v>

885
00:47:12.631 --> 00:47:17.631
<v Speaker 2>I've had the privilege of proceedings </v>
<v Speaker 2>through life with this enormous </v>

886
00:47:17.631 --> 00:47:18.600
<v Speaker 2>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social deprivation.</v>

887
00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm still going to chase you back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the story about the PR company,</v>

888
00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:27.600
<v Speaker 2>but I have another question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

889
00:47:27.601 --> 00:47:32.601
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are detailing out the kind of </v>

890
00:47:32.601 --> 00:47:34.870
<v Speaker 2>childhood that in principle could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>left you bitter and resentful.</v>

891
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 2>So why didn't it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't that happen to you?</v>

892
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of my father,</v>

893
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:43.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother was a deep pessimists.</v>

894
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:48.240
<v Speaker 2>My father was a profound optimist and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>must've had my father's genes </v>

895
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:53.761
<v Speaker 2>predominating over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got them both optimism and </v>

896
00:47:53.761 --> 00:47:57.481
<v Speaker 2>pessimism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm grateful for everything that's </v>

897
00:47:57.481 --> 00:47:58.000
<v Speaker 2>happened in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working every deprivation,</v>

898
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:03.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sick in bed for 15 years and even </v>

899
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:03.210
<v Speaker 2>that turned out to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was nightmarish.</v>

900
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:08.010
<v Speaker 2>It was horrible at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inflicted pains for which there are no </v>

901
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.851
<v Speaker 2>words in the English language because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was isolated for five years and could </v>

902
00:48:11.851 --> 00:48:13.750
<v Speaker 2>not talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally could not muster the energy to</v>

903
00:48:13.751 --> 00:48:16.630
<v Speaker 2>move the larynx to give a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>syllable of sound.</v>

904
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.860
<v Speaker 2>And yet I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was nightmarish.</v>

905
00:48:20.861 --> 00:48:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A monsters does.</v>

906
00:48:22.331 --> 00:48:23.530
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of,</v>

907
00:48:23.531 --> 00:48:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I found it to international scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups at that time.</v>

908
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I wrote three books and I learned what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like to be at that extreme of the </v>

909
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.060
<v Speaker 2>human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extreme isolation,</v>

910
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme pain.</v>

911
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.690
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

912
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.520
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were you suffering from?</v>

913
00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we figured it out.</v>

914
00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:46.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured it out on my own and then </v>

915
00:48:46.231 --> 00:48:46.231
<v Speaker 2>taught my doctor about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called chronic fatigue syndrome.</v>

916
00:48:46.231 --> 00:48:50.911
<v Speaker 2>It's better sometimes known as Myalgic </v>
<v Speaker 2>encephalomyelitis and nobody knows what </v>

917
00:48:50.911 --> 00:48:52.480
<v Speaker 2>causes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in 1988,</v>

918
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I really had been working on my book for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long enough to have fifth,</v>

919
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.090
<v Speaker 2>the first 15 chapters of my first book.</v>

920
00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I really wanted to get out of publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I could have because I </v>

921
00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:10.201
<v Speaker 2>was a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the billboard guide to music </v>

922
00:49:10.201 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 2>publicity had 20 pages of nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

923
00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

924
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife is not going to let you out of</v>

925
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:20.470
<v Speaker 2>a successful career and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't want to lose the money.</v>

926
00:49:20.471 --> 00:49:22.530
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't want to lose the status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

927
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.290
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden wank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what was happening to me.</v>

928
00:49:26.291 --> 00:49:29.110
<v Speaker 2>It was 90 degrees out and I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>freezing and shivering.</v>

929
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:32.500
<v Speaker 2>It was 40 degrees out and I will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>overheated.</v>

930
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

931
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:39.541
<v Speaker 2>I was losing strengths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was losing the strength to pick up </v>

932
00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:41.830
<v Speaker 2>coat and I had no idea of what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

933
00:49:41.831 --> 00:49:45.070
<v Speaker 2>And I went to doctors and the doctors </v>
<v Speaker 2>had no idea of what was happening.</v>

934
00:49:45.071 --> 00:49:46.750
<v Speaker 2>And I walked into my office one day.</v>

935
00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:51.560
<v Speaker 2>It was the biggest pr firm in the music </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry and said to myself,</v>

936
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be dying,</v>

937
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:57.220
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to be out of here in two </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks and I'm giving you the business,</v>

938
00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:02.990
<v Speaker 2>and the next day a competitor from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>west coast called and offered me a huge </v>

939
00:50:03.011 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 2>amount of money for the business and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

940
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:10.381
<v Speaker 2>I cannot sell it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just gave it to my staff yesterday </v>

941
00:50:10.381 --> 00:50:13.260
<v Speaker 2>because my word is my bond and I kept </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to struggling to try to do normal</v>

942
00:50:14.771 --> 00:50:16.240
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leon Uris,</v>

943
00:50:16.241 --> 00:50:18.970
<v Speaker 2>when I finished my manuscript of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first book,</v>

944
00:50:18.971 --> 00:50:23.971
<v Speaker 2>the Lucifer principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a scientific expedition into the forces </v>

945
00:50:23.971 --> 00:50:24.460
<v Speaker 2>of history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a copy to Leon Uris,</v>

946
00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:29.490
<v Speaker 2>the novelist and Leon Uris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reddit and called on a Sunday night and </v>

947
00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:34.031
<v Speaker 2>raved about it for half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I tried to get into New York to see </v>

948
00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:34.820
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had to rent.</v>

949
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Are you ready for this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I couldn't afford this.</v>

950
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I had a rental Lillo so I could lay down</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the back seat all the way into </v>

951
00:50:42.981 --> 00:50:47.981
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan to see Leon and then lay down </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the back seat all the way home and </v>

952
00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 2>it's the world's most glamorous </v>
<v Speaker 2>limousine story.</v>

953
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not at all the world's most </v>

954
00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.441
<v Speaker 2>glamorous limousines journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually I learned I couldn't even do </v>

955
00:50:59.441 --> 00:51:02.051
<v Speaker 2>that and eventually it became too weak </v>
<v Speaker 2>to even try because I was just lucky to </v>

956
00:51:02.051 --> 00:51:06.401
<v Speaker 2>be able to get to my bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I tried to get to my kitchen and </v>

957
00:51:06.401 --> 00:51:09.580
<v Speaker 2>extra 10 steps away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no my body wouldn't let me do it.</v>

958
00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:14.110
<v Speaker 2>And one of the lessons I learned in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood again when I was 16 years old,</v>

959
00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:19.040
<v Speaker 2>poetry was extremely important to me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lesson from two poets.</v>

960
00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:23.600
<v Speaker 2>One was at the St Vincent Millay and her</v>
<v Speaker 2>poem Renascence said too,</v>

961
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:26.090
<v Speaker 2>see the infinite in the tiniest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

962
00:51:26.091 --> 00:51:31.091
<v Speaker 2>which was definitely a goal on my list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to comprehend the </v>

963
00:51:31.091 --> 00:51:35.721
<v Speaker 2>suffering of every human on the face of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this planet under every extreme </v>

964
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:40.141
<v Speaker 2>circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I expanded that to mean you have to </v>

965
00:51:40.141 --> 00:51:40.960
<v Speaker 2>come to understand not just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>

966
00:51:40.961 --> 00:51:45.961
<v Speaker 2>but the point of view of every one who </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from a culture that's so foreign </v>

967
00:51:45.961 --> 00:51:49.060
<v Speaker 2>to years that it seems like comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>another planet.</v>

968
00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:54.420
<v Speaker 2>So this was what Edna Saint Vincent </v>
<v Speaker 2>Millay was telling me was 15 years </v>

969
00:51:56.070 --> 00:52:00.140
<v Speaker 2>absolute and unbelievable punishment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>an advantage</v>

970
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and it will serve you well for the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>

971
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:07.950
<v Speaker 1>You've got a story to tell you then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something I learned from Carl </v>

972
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the,</v>

973
00:52:08.111 --> 00:52:09.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

974
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.640
<v Speaker 1>in the sharp cathedral in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in France,</v>

975
00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:18.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a maze and that you walk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's at the center point of the </v>

976
00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crucifix essentially.</v>

977
00:52:22.751 --> 00:52:27.751
<v Speaker 1>And so the maze is at the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>acts that marks the point of maximum </v>

978
00:52:27.751 --> 00:52:29.590
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

979
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:32.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbolic pilgrimage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you do is you,</v>

980
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:37.400
<v Speaker 1>it amazes a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the middle is a symbol that looks</v>

981
00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:40.760
<v Speaker 1>kinda like a rose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order to get to the middle,</v>

982
00:52:40.761 --> 00:52:45.761
<v Speaker 1>which is that central point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to enter the maze and then you </v>

983
00:52:45.761 --> 00:52:47.870
<v Speaker 1>have to walk through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the each quadrant.</v>

984
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:50.150
<v Speaker 1>So you have to circumambulating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

985
00:52:50.151 --> 00:52:51.580
<v Speaker 1>You have to go northwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>

986
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:52.340
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and south.</v>

987
00:52:52.341 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 1>You have to cover every bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

988
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:58.070
<v Speaker 1>And then you get to the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the middle is marked by the x,</v>

989
00:52:58.071 --> 00:53:00.940
<v Speaker 1>which is the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point of consciousness,</v>

990
00:53:00.941 --> 00:53:02.890
<v Speaker 1>you might say the center point of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

991
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.950
<v Speaker 1>but also the place where you voluntarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept your suffering</v>

992
00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.260
<v Speaker 2>sandwiches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Christ did.</v>

993
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I'm not a Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you believe in the,</v>

994
00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:20.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the religion that St Paul created based </v>

995
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:20.620
<v Speaker 2>on Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

996
00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.080
<v Speaker 1>than okay.</v>

997
00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 2>God had to become human in to experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>human suffering.</v>

998
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:33.350
<v Speaker 2>And when Christ was on the cross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writhing in agony and screamed,</v>

999
00:53:33.571 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Eli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eli Sabachthani,</v>

1000
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:36.000
<v Speaker 2>my Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Lord,</v>

1001
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:41.001
<v Speaker 2>why Hast Thou forsaken me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because God needed to experience </v>

1002
00:53:41.001 --> 00:53:43.560
<v Speaker 2>the absolute extreme of human despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1003
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:47.040
<v Speaker 2>in order to carry out his task of saving</v>
<v Speaker 2>mankind.</v>

1004
00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one way or the other religion talks </v>

1005
00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:53.820
<v Speaker 2>to us really about what we need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this,</v>

1006
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I've got this saying in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me see if I can find it.</v>

1007
00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not in front of me at the moment,</v>

1008
00:53:59.941 --> 00:54:02.400
<v Speaker 2>but it gives me a second as it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1009
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 2>It's an epigram that I wrote a few years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago and it says,</v>

1010
00:54:07.201 --> 00:54:11.070
<v Speaker 2>since there is no god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is our job to do his work.</v>

1011
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.850
<v Speaker 2>God is not a beating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He isn't aspiration,</v>

1012
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:16.110
<v Speaker 2>a gift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a vision,</v>

1013
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:21.150
<v Speaker 2>a goal to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ours is the responsibility of making a </v>

1014
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:24.480
<v Speaker 2>cool universe turned just of turning </v>
<v Speaker 2>pains to understandings and new insights</v>

1015
00:54:24.481 --> 00:54:26.670
<v Speaker 2>into joy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of creating ways to soar,</v>

1016
00:54:26.671 --> 00:54:28.650
<v Speaker 2>the skies for generations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet to come,</v>

1017
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 2>a fascinating wings with which our </v>
<v Speaker 2>children's children shall overcome,</v>

1018
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:38.210
<v Speaker 2>of making worlds of fantasy materialize </v>
<v Speaker 2>as reality of mining and transforming </v>

1019
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:40.260
<v Speaker 2>our greatest gifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our passions,</v>

1020
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.540
<v Speaker 2>our imaginings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our pains,</v>

1021
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.880
<v Speaker 2>our insecurities and our lusts.</v>

1022
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:49.470
<v Speaker 2>This is the work of deity and D,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a power that resides in us.</v>

1023
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:53.160
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if these are things that we imagine that</v>

1024
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:58.161
<v Speaker 2>Jesus has done on our behalf and on </v>
<v Speaker 2>behalf of a more ethereal God in the </v>

1025
00:54:59.191 --> 00:55:02.550
<v Speaker 2>sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these have to be our aspirations,</v>

1026
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:05.670
<v Speaker 2>indeed one of my books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the genius of the beast,</v>

1027
00:55:05.671 --> 00:55:08.640
<v Speaker 2>a radical revision of capitalism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talks about material miracles,</v>

1028
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:13.140
<v Speaker 2>the very laptops with which we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>having this conversation,</v>

1029
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.110
<v Speaker 2>the various zoom with software that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are using.</v>

1030
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:21.230
<v Speaker 2>These are fucking material miracles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>m and s and we are here to save each </v>

1031
00:55:21.991 --> 00:55:26.991
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When when Joan jets manager came to me </v>

1032
00:55:26.991 --> 00:55:30.560
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joan has been turned down by 23 record </v>

1033
00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.871
<v Speaker 2>companies that if you get her just one </v>
<v Speaker 2>line and one of the trade magazines or </v>

1034
00:55:32.871 --> 00:55:35.370
<v Speaker 2>record company will snap her up and make</v>
<v Speaker 2>her a star and I can go back.</v>

1035
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:39.780
<v Speaker 2>He said to being a song writer and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>producer and I sat him down on the couch</v>

1036
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:40.410
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenny,</v>

1037
00:55:40.411 --> 00:55:43.260
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The day they are.</v>

1038
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Record come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No record company is going to sign you </v>

1039
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.181
<v Speaker 2>on the basis of one sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The day a record company signs you was </v>

1040
00:55:50.181 --> 00:55:54.741
<v Speaker 2>the day your troubles beginning and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to fashion a panzer take </v>

1041
00:55:55.950 --> 00:56:00.810
<v Speaker 2>tank strategy that can ride over every </v>
<v Speaker 2>obstacle you can possibly imagine.</v>

1042
00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:03.660
<v Speaker 2>So if you work the way I worked 17 hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>a day,</v>

1043
00:56:03.661 --> 00:56:06.330
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do everything I tell you too,</v>

1044
00:56:06.331 --> 00:56:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you we will have a star in </v>
<v Speaker 2>two years.</v>

1045
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:14.510
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I knew is that I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>rock and roll was going to be a hit.</v>

1046
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Now what does that have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>secular salvation?</v>

1047
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because according to work that was done </v>

1048
00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.390
<v Speaker 2>with deeper studies and the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 nineties,</v>

1049
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.450
<v Speaker 2>we all cycled through about seven major </v>
<v Speaker 2>mood swings.</v>

1050
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:31.030
<v Speaker 2>A date we adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more like 22 for kids,</v>

1051
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:36.270
<v Speaker 2>for adolescents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means we go from heaven to hell </v>

1052
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:39.541
<v Speaker 2>and back again seven times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can succeed in making Joel a star </v>

1053
00:56:42.421 --> 00:56:47.421
<v Speaker 2>so that her soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love rock and roll appears on the </v>

1054
00:56:47.421 --> 00:56:48.900
<v Speaker 2>radio and you will love that song for </v>
<v Speaker 2>three and a half minutes.</v>

1055
00:56:48.901 --> 00:56:52.770
<v Speaker 2>That song is going to Yank you out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the misery of a personal hell.</v>

1056
00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:55.980
<v Speaker 2>That is secular salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If on the other hand,</v>

1057
00:56:55.981 --> 00:57:00.981
<v Speaker 2>I'm working with a filmmaker and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked with a bunch of films who can </v>

1058
00:57:00.981 --> 00:57:03.660
<v Speaker 2>yank you out of yourself or an hour and </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes or an hour and 50 minutes,</v>

1059
00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:06.950
<v Speaker 2>that's an over an hour of sexual or </v>
<v Speaker 2>salvation.</v>

1060
00:57:06.951 --> 00:57:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there always angels playing music </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Heaven,</v>

1062
00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.300
<v Speaker 1>isn't that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1063
00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:16.400
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately it gets very boring up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there because all they do is sing the </v>

1064
00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.820
<v Speaker 1>praises of God he was doing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1065
00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:21.170
<v Speaker 1>exactly making hits we're having.</v>

1066
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at any rate,</v>

1067
00:57:22.891 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 2>anything that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1068
00:57:23.561 --> 00:57:26.280
<v Speaker 2>God can do anything we imagined that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>god can do,</v>

1069
00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:31.340
<v Speaker 2>that's our aspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we have to do our best </v>

1070
00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.850
<v Speaker 2>to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we don't achieve these things in a </v>

1071
00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:36.540
<v Speaker 2>single lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we engage in multigenerational</v>

1072
00:57:36.541 --> 00:57:37.560
<v Speaker 2>projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last one,</v>

1073
00:57:37.561 --> 00:57:40.240
<v Speaker 2>hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 or 300 lifetimes,</v>

1074
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.730
<v Speaker 2>300 generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But flying,</v>

1075
00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:46.740
<v Speaker 2>we can see the myth of has flying in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1076
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.500
<v Speaker 2>dataless makes a pair of wax wings for </v>
<v Speaker 2>his son,</v>

1077
00:57:49.501 --> 00:57:54.501
<v Speaker 2>ICARUS and ICARUS indeed flies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just was a little too close to the </v>

1078
00:57:54.501 --> 00:57:55.470
<v Speaker 2>solder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>melts the wax and falls into the sea.</v>

1079
00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:59.550
<v Speaker 2>So that dream has been around for at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least 2,800</v>

1080
00:57:59.551 --> 00:58:04.551
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many generations does it take to </v>

1081
00:58:04.551 --> 00:58:04.950
<v Speaker 2>make that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even do the arithmetic,</v>

1082
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:10.280
<v Speaker 2>but it took until 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until 110 years ago to make that dream </v>

1083
00:58:10.951 --> 00:58:13.070
<v Speaker 2>come true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we persist,</v>

1084
00:58:13.071 --> 00:58:17.210
<v Speaker 2>and I don't just mean individually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean collectively,</v>

1085
00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.610
<v Speaker 2>if we persist generation after </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>

1086
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:23.300
<v Speaker 2>the things we regard as godly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can achieve.</v>

1087
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.230
<v Speaker 2>We must,</v>

1088
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:30.080
<v Speaker 1>we must go back now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go back.</v>

1089
00:58:30.081 --> 00:58:35.081
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I also think that that what and </v>

1090
00:58:35.081 --> 00:58:35.840
<v Speaker 1>what do I mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1091
00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:40.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it is this,</v>

1092
00:58:40.691 --> 00:58:43.060
<v Speaker 1>that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see that we have anything better</v>

1093
00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:45.140
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1094
00:58:45.141 --> 00:58:46.940
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good phrase.</v>

1095
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:52.150
<v Speaker 1>This is something I've been talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>two people about a lot in the last year </v>

1096
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:54.170
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to be resonating </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with young men.</v>

1097
00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Is that because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is maybe partly also tied into </v>

1098
00:59:00.171 --> 00:59:02.300
<v Speaker 1>your idea of the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation,</v>

1099
00:59:02.301 --> 00:59:07.301
<v Speaker 1>it's like in some ways each person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently lost because we're fragile </v>

1100
00:59:07.301 --> 00:59:11.510
<v Speaker 1>and finite and mortal and all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and so the game is up pretty much</v>

1101
00:59:11.511 --> 00:59:16.511
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that's so </v>

1102
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:16.520
<v Speaker 1>interesting about that is the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lose everything.</v>

1103
00:59:16.521 --> 00:59:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Also beans that you could risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1104
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:21.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a very interesting point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>

1105
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:23.900
<v Speaker 2>if the one thing that comes out in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

1106
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:28.960
<v Speaker 2>because I read it a month or two ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not coming out until </v>

1107
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.471
<v Speaker 2>something like February is there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>definite Christian perspective and it is</v>

1108
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:38.200
<v Speaker 2>a stern and austere perspective in in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book and what you just expressed </v>

1109
00:59:39.921 --> 00:59:44.921
<v Speaker 2>comes from a deep Christian perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to lose it all so we might </v>

1110
00:59:44.921 --> 00:59:46.850
<v Speaker 2>as well risk at all and I would agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1111
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Even though I come from a very different</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of perspective.</v>

1112
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:55.570
<v Speaker 2>How did you arrive at that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although we're saving that for a later </v>

1113
00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:55.760
<v Speaker 2>podcast when I will interview you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your book.</v>

1114
00:59:57.090 --> 01:00:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it was a matter of trying to </v>

1115
01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:04.841
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say mostly trying to understand </v>

1116
01:00:04.841 --> 01:00:05.930
<v Speaker 2>what happened in the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go me too.</v>

1117
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:09.350
<v Speaker 2>But that's strange because you're about </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years younger than I am.</v>

1118
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even more younger than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And well I'm 74.</v>

1119
01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 55 so.</v>

1120
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a big difference.</v>

1121
01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 2>But I did 350 pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this morning and I was very </v>

1122
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.320
<v Speaker 2>disappointed because last week I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>600.</v>

1123
01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:29.321
<v Speaker 2>So you've got me on the push up front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must say.</v>

1124
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1125
01:00:30.741 --> 01:00:31.850
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1126
01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:35.600
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that phrase of yours,</v>

1127
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there we have nothing better to do.</v>

1128
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a phrase that indicates an open </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended,</v>

1129
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.590
<v Speaker 2>infinity and open ended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as yet on structured infinity.</v>

1130
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not completely unstructured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember you.</v>

1131
01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Your first major work was on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying structures of religion and </v>

1132
01:00:53.811 --> 01:00:58.811
<v Speaker 2>I'm still fascinated to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to get it in word or PDF format </v>

1133
01:00:58.811 --> 01:01:01.040
<v Speaker 2>so I can listen to it on my kindle one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these days.</v>

1134
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I can send it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be wonderful.</v>

1135
01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 2>We could actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to my website,</v>

1136
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can download the PDF.</v>

1137
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1138
01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Because I've been hungry to read this </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time,</v>

1139
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:17.720
<v Speaker 2>so the future isn't entirely unformed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1140
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:21.470
<v Speaker 2>somehow I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now this is a hypothesis,</v>

1141
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:27.310
<v Speaker 2>a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We humans seem to know what to do when </v>

1142
01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:28.150
<v Speaker 2>we come together in groups of a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>$5,</v>

1143
01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:28.990
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$10,</v>

1144
01:01:28.991 --> 01:01:33.991
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$20 million because there are many </v>

1145
01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:33.991
<v Speaker 2>cities in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1146
01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:36.020
<v Speaker 2>with a population of 20 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's Mexico City as well,</v>

1147
01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:41.320
<v Speaker 2>and we fall into it naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're naturally build the </v>

1148
01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.411
<v Speaker 2>infrastructures that we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We naturally develop the infrastructure </v>

1149
01:01:44.411 --> 01:01:48.641
<v Speaker 2>of habit that we need to get along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other at that very compressed </v>

1150
01:01:48.641 --> 01:01:48.860
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you would think,</v>

1151
01:01:48.861 --> 01:01:53.861
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how did that come to be from an </v>

1152
01:01:53.861 --> 01:01:53.861
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary point of view?</v>
<v Speaker 2>After all,</v>

1153
01:01:53.861 --> 01:01:56.120
<v Speaker 2>humans have never had the privilege of </v>
<v Speaker 2>living groups of millions.</v>

1154
01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to all this behavior come </v>

1155
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:01.320
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1156
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.020
<v Speaker 2>remember our great form others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones who are at the very,</v>

1157
01:02:03.021 --> 01:02:05.840
<v Speaker 2>very base of our family tree from whom </v>
<v Speaker 2>we derive.</v>

1158
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Approximately 40 percent of our genes </v>
<v Speaker 2>are bacteria and bacteria,</v>

1159
01:02:10.911 --> 01:02:14.300
<v Speaker 2>do not live a life alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cannot tolerate it.</v>

1160
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:19.630
<v Speaker 2>They live in groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So James Shapiro is one of the great </v>

1161
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:24.030
<v Speaker 2>scholars on bacterial behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I called him one day and said,</v>

1162
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:29.031
<v Speaker 2>James,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you drop a single bacterium into a </v>

1163
01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:29.700
<v Speaker 2>petri dish isn't going to die because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation.</v>

1164
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1165
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:36.260
<v Speaker 2>no way it's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to start dividing until it </v>

1166
01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.980
<v Speaker 2>makes a community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It surrounds itself with a community.</v>

1167
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:43.190
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that you cannot have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria without a community is quite </v>

1168
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:44.260
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the bacteria,</v>

1169
01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.050
<v Speaker 2>if they have enough food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will make their own</v>

1170
01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:52.660
<v Speaker 1>similar intuition about cod fish write </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish have disappeared off the </v>

1171
01:02:53.301 --> 01:02:58.301
<v Speaker 1>northeastern coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've read stories because I did a </v>

1172
01:02:58.301 --> 01:03:02.501
<v Speaker 1>lot of work on oceanic appalling oceanic</v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction about four years ago for a,</v>

1173
01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>for a UN committee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1174
01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was studying about the cod and </v>

1175
01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>they've all disappeared and the schools </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things that existed back with </v>

1176
01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:18.621
<v Speaker 1>the Europeans first came over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Portuguese probably knew about them </v>

1177
01:03:18.621 --> 01:03:20.090
<v Speaker 1>before Christopher Columbus even hit the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>

1178
01:03:20.091 --> 01:03:24.260
<v Speaker 1>the hit the America kept it secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1179
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:29.090
<v Speaker 1>the schools were dozens or even hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of miles long and many,</v>

1180
01:03:29.091 --> 01:03:34.091
<v Speaker 1>many houses the thick and the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish was like three to five feet across </v>

1181
01:03:34.091 --> 01:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>and bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just densely packed day.</v>

1182
01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.640
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that like the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cod fish is an illusion in </v>

1183
01:03:41.961 --> 01:03:44.300
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are schools of cod fish.</v>

1184
01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:50.040
<v Speaker 1>The schools themselves know where to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>for food and they know how to maneuver </v>

1185
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.341
<v Speaker 1>through the ocean because the schools </v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually millions of years old and </v>

1186
01:03:54.341 --> 01:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>tributed knowledge and quads.</v>

1187
01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>The cod organize their mating behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of the existence of the</v>

1188
01:04:01.621 --> 01:04:04.710
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also organize themselves.</v>

1189
01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:09.390
<v Speaker 1>So the larger fish are protected in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools by hordes of the younger fish.</v>

1190
01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:12.000
<v Speaker 1>And the older fish are the ones that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more fertile.</v>

1191
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:15.810
<v Speaker 1>The thing about the cod is that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the schools,</v>

1192
01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:19.680
<v Speaker 1>you get rid of the card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can reintroduce them because the cod</v>

1193
01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:21.480
<v Speaker 1>aren't there like ants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

1194
01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>They're communal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1195
01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:28.340
<v Speaker 1>And so once you demolish this old </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that has this know embodied </v>

1196
01:04:28.481 --> 01:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that's who knows how many tens</v>

1197
01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>of millions of years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no coming back from that,</v>

1198
01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:38.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well back to the bacteria for a second </v>

1199
01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:39.800
<v Speaker 2>because it's a good observation and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw a murmuration of starlings last week</v>

1200
01:04:39.801 --> 01:04:44.801
<v Speaker 2>in Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York when I was up there for </v>

1201
01:04:44.801 --> 01:04:44.801
<v Speaker 2>thanksgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1202
01:04:44.801 --> 01:04:46.940
<v Speaker 2>groups have probably only about 200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>starlings,</v>

1203
01:04:46.941 --> 01:04:50.810
<v Speaker 2>but those groups can become a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they all know what to do.</v>

1204
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:53.510
<v Speaker 2>They know how to wheel around in a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>broader pattern,</v>

1205
01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:57.220
<v Speaker 2>but it all goes back to the bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 2>because bacteria living groups,</v>

1206
01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:02.280
<v Speaker 2>a group in the colony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the size of your palm is 7 trillion,</v>

1207
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.160
<v Speaker 2>which is more than all the humans who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have ever lived.</v>

1208
01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Now there are bacteria like a Reuben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Osa which come into your body and when </v>

1209
01:05:10.781 --> 01:05:13.210
<v Speaker 2>there are small numbers of them lay very</v>
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>

1210
01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.640
<v Speaker 2>but they're constantly monitoring to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of them there are and when will</v>

1211
01:05:17.641 --> 01:05:22.641
<v Speaker 2>they get up to a sufficient number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whammo they grow through a massive </v>

1212
01:05:22.641 --> 01:05:23.650
<v Speaker 2>change and basically it's as if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1213
01:05:23.651 --> 01:05:28.651
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're big enough to take Jordan </v>

1214
01:05:28.651 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 2>apart and they become infectious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they create disease,</v>

1215
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:34.510
<v Speaker 2>but they don't do that until quorum </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensing tells them that there are enough</v>

1216
01:05:34.511 --> 01:05:35.620
<v Speaker 2>of them to do that.</v>

1217
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.670
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so is that.</v>

1218
01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Does that explain why people can harbor </v>
<v Speaker 2>con continue levels of toxic bacteria in</v>

1219
01:05:44.651 --> 01:05:47.560
<v Speaker 2>their bodies without ever falling prey </v>
<v Speaker 2>to disease?</v>

1220
01:05:47.561 --> 01:05:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Is it a matter of the fact that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't hit that core number and</v>

1221
01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:53.660
<v Speaker 2>that they're monitoring that constantly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1222
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:58.680
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of bacteria that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted to living synergistically with </v>

1223
01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.131
<v Speaker 2>us and actually do are digesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go down to the market because you </v>

1224
01:06:02.131 --> 01:06:05.731
<v Speaker 2>have a craving for chocolate eclairs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come back home and you eat one of </v>

1225
01:06:05.731 --> 01:06:08.050
<v Speaker 2>the chocolate eclairs and it's not you </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's digesting the chocolate eclair.</v>

1226
01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:13.290
<v Speaker 2>You have just acted as a transportation </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism to feed a bunch of bacteria in</v>

1227
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:18.511
<v Speaker 2>your gut who will digest that chocolate </v>
<v Speaker 2>eclair and what they shit out his </v>

1228
01:06:18.521 --> 01:06:19.610
<v Speaker 2>glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1229
01:06:19.611 --> 01:06:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may me.</v>

1230
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:22.720
<v Speaker 2>It may also not be used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's craving the damage,</v>

1231
01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:27.760
<v Speaker 2>claire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the background and the fact is that </v>

1232
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:27.910
<v Speaker 2>the bacteria were just at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this research,</v>

1233
01:06:27.911 --> 01:06:30.870
<v Speaker 2>but bacteria have an ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence your behavior.</v>

1234
01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1235
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Noted far more than we think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1236
01:06:34.301 --> 01:06:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and to engineer in a fine point,</v>

1237
01:06:38.621 --> 01:06:43.621
<v Speaker 2>fashion your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should they so choose basic ideas that </v>

1238
01:06:43.621 --> 01:06:46.180
<v Speaker 2>bacteria have been through this business</v>
<v Speaker 2>of living in vast,</v>

1239
01:06:46.181 --> 01:06:51.181
<v Speaker 2>vast multitude before and they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain social evolve social behaviors,</v>

1240
01:06:51.371 --> 01:06:55.570
<v Speaker 2>but turn them into effective groups that</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow them to constantly find new food.</v>

1241
01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:00.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly find new housing and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>we think these things are strange to us </v>

1242
01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.030
<v Speaker 2>because in the 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years since we become Homo Sapiens,</v>

1243
01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:10.170
<v Speaker 2>we've never had such a thing until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last century were crazy because our </v>

1244
01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:14.191
<v Speaker 2>ancestors left us 40 percent of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>genes and it is very likely that it </v>

1245
01:07:14.191 --> 01:07:18.271
<v Speaker 2>encoded in those genes is a whole world </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how you behave when there are the </v>

1246
01:07:18.281 --> 01:07:23.281
<v Speaker 2>kinds of vast masses of tens of millions</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you were talking about on the cob </v>

1247
01:07:23.281 --> 01:07:27.250
<v Speaker 2>behavior or the $20 million who are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico City or in major cities in China.</v>

1248
01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Part of our genetic potential that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>there not as consequences of human </v>

1249
01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:33.550
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that preceded that.</v>

1250
01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1251
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:37.860
<v Speaker 2>But it's a guest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a hypothesis at the moment.</v>

1252
01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to you were,</v>

1253
01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:45.440
<v Speaker 2>you left your biographical story at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where you had finished,</v>

1254
01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:49.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the art magazine and being successful at</v>

1255
01:07:49.091 --> 01:07:51.430
<v Speaker 2>that and then were introduced into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>FM stations.</v>

1256
01:07:51.431 --> 01:07:56.431
<v Speaker 2>And so the beginning of the PR firms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just to mention it again,</v>

1257
01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.760
<v Speaker 2>we're actually here talking about how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>accidentally started the six cs and </v>

1258
01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:03.700
<v Speaker 2>we've skipped over the whole story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>how I accidentally started the six days.</v>

1259
01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get a chance to talk.</v>

1260
01:08:05.111 --> 01:08:07.930
<v Speaker 2>We'll get a chance to talk again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because obviously there's things</v>

1261
01:08:07.931 --> 01:08:10.210
<v Speaker 2>we could talk about for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>

1262
01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically there I was,</v>

1263
01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:18.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping get progressive radio off the </v>

1264
01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.860
<v Speaker 2>ground and I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 12,</v>

1265
01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had turned her eyes to mine,</v>

1266
01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:25.970
<v Speaker 2>was eighth grade.</v>

1267
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:30.970
<v Speaker 2>She turned her eyes to mine and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>startled because no girl had ever done </v>

1268
01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:34.061
<v Speaker 2>that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact then she locked into eye </v>

1269
01:08:34.061 --> 01:08:35.180
<v Speaker 2>contact and I was even more startled </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

1270
01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.170
<v Speaker 2>that had never happened before either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1271
01:08:38.171 --> 01:08:39.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she said,</v>

1272
01:08:39.291 --> 01:08:41.930
<v Speaker 2>I told my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand the theory of relativity.</v>

1273
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Now remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been in science for two years at </v>

1274
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:47.200
<v Speaker 2>this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading two books a day.</v>

1275
01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I had annealed copper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had made coils.</v>

1276
01:08:50.901 --> 01:08:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I had made cold cream from an industrial</v>
<v Speaker 2>formula.</v>

1277
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had built my or a top design,</v>

1278
01:08:56.841 --> 01:09:01.310
<v Speaker 2>my first computer and it won several,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a science fair awards and I had built my</v>

1279
01:09:01.311 --> 01:09:03.020
<v Speaker 2>first Boolean Algebra machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1280
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:08.410
<v Speaker 2>And my mom had schlepped me off to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Buffalo to sit down for </v>

1281
01:09:08.631 --> 01:09:13.631
<v Speaker 2>meetings with the head of the graduate </v>
<v Speaker 2>physics department at the University of </v>

1282
01:09:13.631 --> 01:09:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was probably a courtesy call,</v>

1283
01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:16.610
<v Speaker 2>but he was going to allow me five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

1284
01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:21.611
<v Speaker 2>four and I was in there for an hour and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we discussed the hottest topic of the </v>

1285
01:09:21.611 --> 01:09:25.601
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the interpretation of the </v>

1286
01:09:25.601 --> 01:09:26.270
<v Speaker 2>doppler shift and big bang versus steady</v>
<v Speaker 2>state theory of cosmology.</v>

1287
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:31.300
<v Speaker 2>That's why he kept me in there because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the very year when the chief </v>

1288
01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:35.560
<v Speaker 2>champion of steady state theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fred Hoyle knew with absolute certainty </v>

1289
01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.230
<v Speaker 2>he was about to demolish drawers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>GAM loves theory of the Big Bang,</v>

1290
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:44.500
<v Speaker 2>and it would never be heard from again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was the hottest topic in </v>

1291
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:45.680
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we got out,</v>

1292
01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:47.910
<v Speaker 2>the guy towered over my head and he put </v>
<v Speaker 2>my Santa,</v>

1293
01:09:47.911 --> 01:09:52.911
<v Speaker 2>my shoulder and he said to my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to study for Grad school </v>

1294
01:09:52.911 --> 01:09:53.630
<v Speaker 2>or you don't have to save up red school </v>
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>

1295
01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:57.590
<v Speaker 2>He will get graduate fellowships at any </v>
<v Speaker 2>university in.</v>

1296
01:09:57.650 --> 01:10:02.390
<v Speaker 2>He wants in theoretical physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a good day.</v>

1297
01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a good day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had a history in science already.</v>

1298
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.230
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when this girl turned arise to mind,</v>

1299
01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:11.180
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told my mother that you understand the</v>

1300
01:10:11.181 --> 01:10:14.600
<v Speaker 2>theory of relativity and I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>confess Jordan,</v>

1301
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:16.400
<v Speaker 2>even though truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth at any price,</v>

1302
01:10:16.401 --> 01:10:19.130
<v Speaker 2>including the price of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the first rule of science for me.</v>

1303
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:24.400
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't confess that I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because what did I have going for </v>

1304
01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:24.400
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>

1305
01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.950
<v Speaker 2>God will forgive you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

1306
01:10:27.951 --> 01:10:32.951
<v Speaker 2>So I jumped on my bicycle and I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to the library and the librarians </v>

1307
01:10:32.951 --> 01:10:33.650
<v Speaker 2>literally knew me better than my mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1308
01:10:33.651 --> 01:10:38.651
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me everything you've got on </v>

1309
01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:40.331
<v Speaker 2>relativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they shoved to books across the </v>

1310
01:10:40.331 --> 01:10:40.910
<v Speaker 2>desk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get me a great big fat book by Einstein.</v>

1311
01:10:40.911 --> 01:10:44.990
<v Speaker 2>And two collaborators and a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>skinny book by Einstein all by himself.</v>

1312
01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:49.010
<v Speaker 2>And I started with the big fat book </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'd learned at that point in the</v>

1313
01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:54.011
<v Speaker 2>life that if you go through something </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand at all and you </v>

1314
01:10:54.011 --> 01:10:55.460
<v Speaker 2>shove yourself all the way to the bitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>vicious end,</v>

1315
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:59.780
<v Speaker 2>by the end you come out understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>something if only on a gut level.</v>

1316
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.750
<v Speaker 2>So I was doing that with the big book </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the big bulk head,</v>

1317
01:11:02.751 --> 01:11:04.760
<v Speaker 2>about seven words of English on each </v>
<v Speaker 2>page.</v>

1318
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:09.910
<v Speaker 2>And the rest was all mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 2>equations and mathematical equations or </v>

1319
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Greek to me.</v>

1320
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I've never understood the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at 8:00</v>

1321
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:17.531
<v Speaker 2>at night I suddenly realized I'm only 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>pages into this book and my mom's going </v>

1322
01:11:17.531 --> 01:11:18.300
<v Speaker 2>to put me asleep at 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight.</v>

1323
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:23.540
<v Speaker 2>And if I don't go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding the theory of relativity </v>

1324
01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:23.540
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be humiliated.</v>

1325
01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:28.370
<v Speaker 2>So I turned to the little skinny book </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was written just by Einstein all </v>

1326
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:33.201
<v Speaker 2>on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was an introduction to the </v>

1327
01:11:33.201 --> 01:11:35.511
<v Speaker 2>book and sometimes it feels as if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>author is stepping out through the </v>

1328
01:11:35.511 --> 01:11:36.090
<v Speaker 2>pages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbing you by the lapel.</v>

1329
01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Putting his nose to yours and shouting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal message and in your face,</v>

1330
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:45.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's how it felt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Einstein grabbed me by the lapels and </v>

1331
01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.260
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1332
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:52.270
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not enough to come up with a </v>

1333
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:55.011
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only seven men in the world can </v>

1334
01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:55.011
<v Speaker 2>understand to be a genius.</v>

1335
01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:58.580
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to come up with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory and express it so clearly that </v>

1336
01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:02.331
<v Speaker 2>anyone with a high school education and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a reasonable degree of intelligence can </v>

1337
01:12:02.331 --> 01:12:05.961
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Albert Einstein had told me to be a </v>

1338
01:12:05.961 --> 01:12:10.341
<v Speaker 2>writer and so I was operating a writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>career while I was in undergraduate </v>

1339
01:12:11.671 --> 01:12:16.671
<v Speaker 2>school and then advancing it when I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I started the art studio is the </v>

1340
01:12:17.161 --> 01:12:20.210
<v Speaker 2>goal for me at that point was your next </v>
<v Speaker 2>step to be the writer.</v>

1341
01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Albert Einstein told you to be is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to write for magazines.</v>

1342
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.130
<v Speaker 2>And one day I walked into the office of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a magazine carrying them portfolio,</v>

1343
01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:31.920
<v Speaker 2>my art studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wearing an outfit that I bought from</v>

1344
01:12:31.921 --> 01:12:36.921
<v Speaker 2>a designer that I was collaborating with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them designing stuff and they have women</v>

1345
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:42.950
<v Speaker 2>at this magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a load around magazine called </v>

1346
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.950
<v Speaker 2>rags and underground fashion magazine.</v>

1347
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:46.920
<v Speaker 2>It was a bank rolled by one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who bank rolled rolling stone and</v>

1348
01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:51.921
<v Speaker 2>the women didn't look at my portfolio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All they looked at was what I was </v>

1349
01:12:51.921 --> 01:12:53.490
<v Speaker 2>wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

1350
01:12:53.491 --> 01:12:55.290
<v Speaker 2>do you have more of those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1351
01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:56.850
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a whole closet full of them.</v>

1352
01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you write an article about that?</v>

1353
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been looking for my big break with</v>

1354
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.430
<v Speaker 2>magazine writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Einstein's imperative.</v>

1355
01:13:05.431 --> 01:13:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Was that my back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1356
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.520
<v Speaker 2>so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I can.</v>

1357
01:13:08.521 --> 01:13:11.490
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote an article and then I became</v>
<v Speaker 2>a contributing editor on the road.</v>

1358
01:13:11.491 --> 01:13:16.491
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 75 pieces for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then one of the contributing editors</v>

1359
01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:21.570
<v Speaker 2>are ordered a new magazine called </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural lifestyles and it may be a </v>

1360
01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:25.311
<v Speaker 2>contributing editor there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which meant I was getting up at six in </v>

1361
01:13:25.311 --> 01:13:27.480
<v Speaker 2>the morning going without a stitch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes on to an old Remington,</v>

1362
01:13:27.481 --> 01:13:32.481
<v Speaker 2>1940 is non electric typewriter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounding away at writing until eight or </v>

1363
01:13:32.481 --> 01:13:34.440
<v Speaker 2>nine going into the art studio.</v>

1364
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Getting that up and running and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming back home.</v>

1365
01:13:37.081 --> 01:13:39.420
<v Speaker 2>And sitting there with a pot of coffee </v>
<v Speaker 2>until 11:00</v>

1366
01:13:39.421 --> 01:13:43.290
<v Speaker 2>at night when I put myself to sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting tired of this Jordan.</v>

1367
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.940
<v Speaker 2>It had been going on for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because of the national lampoon,</v>

1368
01:13:47.941 --> 01:13:50.820
<v Speaker 2>because there was a great big steady </v>
<v Speaker 2>check coming in every month.</v>

1369
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.240
<v Speaker 2>My artists voted me out of my studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to pay me the </v>

1370
01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.301
<v Speaker 2>percentage that they owed me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me that was like getting sick.</v>

1371
01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:04.470
<v Speaker 2>It was a fortunate thing because I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been there for three years and I could </v>

1372
01:14:04.571 --> 01:14:08.550
<v Speaker 2>have continued there forever running </v>
<v Speaker 2>this art studio and um,</v>

1373
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:11.650
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was busy writing and one day I was</v>

1374
01:14:11.651 --> 01:14:16.120
<v Speaker 2>covering of all things a parapsychology </v>
<v Speaker 2>convention for natural lifestyles.</v>

1375
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:19.000
<v Speaker 2>The other magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a contributing editor to sue and I</v>

1376
01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:22.420
<v Speaker 2>was taking notes frantically because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no memory if I don't know that it's</v>

1377
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.890
<v Speaker 2>going to disappear.</v>

1378
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:27.850
<v Speaker 2>And somebody walked up to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to edit a magazine?</v>

1379
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my app between my freshman and my </v>

1380
01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:36.121
<v Speaker 2>sophomore year of college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had gotten a job writing for the boy </v>

1381
01:14:36.121 --> 01:14:37.200
<v Speaker 2>scouts of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Britain there,</v>

1382
01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.520
<v Speaker 2>their chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've rewritten their chapter on </v>

1383
01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.581
<v Speaker 2>masturbation for the boy scout handbook </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd written that chapters in your </v>

1384
01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:49.281
<v Speaker 2>cv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have somehow that keeps showing up </v>

1385
01:14:49.281 --> 01:14:49.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1386
01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:54.780
<v Speaker 2>cause cause remember when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first got onto science at the </v>

1387
01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:58.111
<v Speaker 2>Asia tenant was because of bulk appeared</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my lap and it said the first two </v>

1388
01:14:58.111 --> 01:15:00.280
<v Speaker 2>rules of science are these truth at any </v>
<v Speaker 2>price and the price of your life.</v>

1389
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:05.520
<v Speaker 2>And it told the story of Galileo and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>told it all wrong and told it as if he </v>

1390
01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.630
<v Speaker 2>had been a Giordano Bruno and been </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to go to the steak.</v>

1391
01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:08.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

1392
01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Then the second rule of science was look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at things right under the noses if </v>

1393
01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:14.830
<v Speaker 2>you've never seen them before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then proceed from there.</v>

1394
01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.040
<v Speaker 2>And it gave the story of Anton van </v>
<v Speaker 2>Leeuwenhoek who invented the microscope </v>

1395
01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.491
<v Speaker 2>and looked at pond water and discovered </v>
<v Speaker 2>these tiny little things called </v>

1396
01:15:23.491 --> 01:15:26.320
<v Speaker 2>animalcules microscopic beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he also looked at human sperm.</v>

1397
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.680
<v Speaker 2>And then he'd written a letter to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>royal society describing what he had </v>

1398
01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.280
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now think about that Jordan.</v>

1399
01:15:33.281 --> 01:15:38.281
<v Speaker 2>If it took 30 years before I realized </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he'd probably gotten the humans </v>

1400
01:15:38.281 --> 01:15:42.621
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's confessing this to the Royal </v>

1401
01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Society story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1402
01:15:43.271 --> 01:15:46.660
<v Speaker 2>So masturbation kept following me </v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever I went,</v>

1403
01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:52.050
<v Speaker 2>but I wrote the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a boy scout book on camouflage that is </v>

1404
01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:52.750
<v Speaker 2>there a handbook on camouflage and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>handbook,</v>

1405
01:15:53.050 --> 01:15:55.290
<v Speaker 2>they're on stocking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attracting,</v>

1406
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:58.300
<v Speaker 2>and I had been thrown out of boy scouts </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the age of 11,</v>

1407
01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:03.620
<v Speaker 2>competence of Morse Code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only child I have ever heard of who </v>

1408
01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:05.410
<v Speaker 2>has been thrown out of the boy scouts.</v>

1409
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:08.740
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I have learned a lesson.</v>

1410
01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:12.220
<v Speaker 2>And the lesson was if I care enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>about my audience,</v>

1411
01:16:12.221 --> 01:16:17.221
<v Speaker 2>if I want my audience to be able to drop</v>
<v Speaker 2>down on all fours and get so close to a </v>

1412
01:16:17.221 --> 01:16:18.820
<v Speaker 2>bunny rabbit using the techniques of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stalking and tracking.</v>

1413
01:16:18.821 --> 01:16:22.750
<v Speaker 2>But I teach them that the rabbit doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know they're there until they're rubbing</v>

1414
01:16:22.751 --> 01:16:24.610
<v Speaker 2>noses with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1415
01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:30.210
<v Speaker 2>that I can write anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't ask what the magazine was </v>

1416
01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:31.480
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When this kid walked up to me and said,</v>

1417
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:35.020
<v Speaker 2>you want to edit a magazine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we didn't have google in those days.</v>

1418
01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:39.130
<v Speaker 2>So I had the name of the publisher that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to set up a meeting with,</v>

1419
01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:44.520
<v Speaker 2>but I had no idea who he was and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was no way to look him up and I had no </v>

1420
01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.220
<v Speaker 2>idea what his magazine was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked into his office to editors.</v>

1421
01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:53.220
<v Speaker 2>We're in the process of packing up their</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and leave it on the opposite side </v>

1422
01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:57.391
<v Speaker 2>of his office suite from his office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I knew nothing about rock and roll.</v>

1423
01:16:58.661 --> 01:17:03.661
<v Speaker 2>It turned out that the magazine was </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Circus and it was a rock'n'roll </v>

1424
01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:03.661
<v Speaker 2>magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1425
01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:06.190
<v Speaker 2>he asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asked only one question,</v>

1426
01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:09.290
<v Speaker 2>can you turn out a magazine in two </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>

1427
01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:13.640
<v Speaker 2>because he had two weeks before he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to deliver his magazines and the printer</v>

1428
01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 2>and his editors were leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said yes.</v>

1429
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:20.030
<v Speaker 2>And I turned out the magazine in two </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>

1430
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I became the editor of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rock magazine.</v>

1431
01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:28.300
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over the course of time applying </v>

1432
01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Martin gardeners approach to things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for underlying correlations,</v>

1433
01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I invented all kinds of correlational </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies that allowed me to get a handle </v>

1434
01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:40.091
<v Speaker 2>on my audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I learned that my audience wasn't </v>

1435
01:17:40.091 --> 01:17:43.751
<v Speaker 2>interested in the traditional format of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Rock magazine and my publisher </v>

1436
01:17:43.751 --> 01:17:47.711
<v Speaker 2>adhere to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is only cover a band that's of </v>

1437
01:17:47.711 --> 01:17:47.711
<v Speaker 2>interest to your audience.</v>

1438
01:17:47.711 --> 01:17:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I discovered that like the audience for </v>

1439
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Time magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which my boss wanted me to imitate and </v>

1440
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:55.910
<v Speaker 2>which I read from cover to cover when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a child.</v>

1441
01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time magazine has an article of a </v>

1442
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.000
<v Speaker 2>president not once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single week,</v>

1443
01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:07.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a running soap opera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they have a secondary character </v>

1444
01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.900
<v Speaker 2>like Henry Kissinger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in there at least every other week.</v>

1445
01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:12.860
<v Speaker 2>And then there are tertiary characters </v>
<v Speaker 2>who may show up once every four months.</v>

1446
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.280
<v Speaker 2>But you need that star trek that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>track,</v>

1447
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:19.130
<v Speaker 2>that presidential track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I discovered that my,</v>

1448
01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:24.670
<v Speaker 2>that I had one artist that was twice as </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular with my audience as his nearest </v>

1449
01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:26.670
<v Speaker 2>runner up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

1450
01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:32.100
<v Speaker 2>And that was Alice Cooper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the closest runner up was David </v>

1451
01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Bowie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Bowie looked pathetic by </v>

1452
01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:36.560
<v Speaker 2>comparison with Alice Cooper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went to my publisher and I,</v>

1453
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.800
<v Speaker 2>I'd taken the sales figures and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked out additional correlations like </v>

1454
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.050
<v Speaker 2>the fact that if we had cover lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1455
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:48.500
<v Speaker 2>about people who were in the top 10 on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the album charts the week we came out,</v>

1456
01:18:48.501 --> 01:18:53.501
<v Speaker 2>we sold magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that with a four month lead </v>

1457
01:18:53.501 --> 01:18:56.261
<v Speaker 2>time I had to learn to predict what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be in the top 10 on the album </v>

1458
01:18:56.301 --> 01:18:57.710
<v Speaker 2>charts for months in advance.</v>

1459
01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:02.780
<v Speaker 2>So I went to my publisher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a complete format for him.</v>

1460
01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:07.781
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you this is only one of </v>

1461
01:19:07.781 --> 01:19:07.781
<v Speaker 2>three statements of this kind I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>made in my life.</v>

1462
01:19:07.781 --> 01:19:10.520
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you that if you use this </v>
<v Speaker 2>format,</v>

1463
01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.950
<v Speaker 2>we will increase the sales of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine.</v>

1464
01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.030
<v Speaker 2>And he was kind enough to let me get </v>
<v Speaker 2>away with a total overhaul.</v>

1465
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:20.150
<v Speaker 2>And the result was we increased in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next 12 months,</v>

1466
01:19:20.151 --> 01:19:22.520
<v Speaker 2>buy 200,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 percent.</v>

1467
01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:26.450
<v Speaker 2>And my publisher went from a man of </v>
<v Speaker 2>modest means with an apartment on second</v>

1468
01:19:26.451 --> 01:19:31.320
<v Speaker 2>avenue overlooking the traffic to a band</v>
<v Speaker 2>of immodest means with a huge aircraft.</v>

1469
01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Saw anger size apartment overlooking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>East River.</v>

1470
01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1471
01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:41.820
<v Speaker 2>and chef flip over one of the founding </v>
<v Speaker 2>editors of rolling stone to validate </v>

1472
01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:42.410
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't feel well rolling,</v>

1473
01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:47.411
<v Speaker 2>stone validated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently did a history of rock and </v>

1474
01:19:47.411 --> 01:19:50.780
<v Speaker 2>roll journalism for his Masters thesis </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the University of Texas at Austin.</v>

1475
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:56.110
<v Speaker 2>And he sent me six pages by Messenger </v>
<v Speaker 2>one day and it was about this guy </v>

1476
01:19:56.110 --> 01:20:01.001
<v Speaker 2>working in a little windowless closet </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a manual remington typewriter </v>

1477
01:20:01.001 --> 01:20:02.930
<v Speaker 2>singlehandedly pounding out of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine.</v>

1478
01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:08.140
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single handedly inventing a new </v>

1479
01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:08.700
<v Speaker 2>magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heavy metal magazine.</v>

1480
01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:12.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's how I became a scholar of rock</v>
<v Speaker 2>and roll.</v>

1481
01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I buy.</v>

1482
01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Did you develop an acidity for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music?</v>

1483
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love it.</v>

1484
01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's favorite?</v>

1485
01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite before this have been </v>

1486
01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:28.641
<v Speaker 2>Vivaldi's winter in the four seasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's angry and scowling and whip</v>

1487
01:20:29.341 --> 01:20:33.360
<v Speaker 2>lashing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now my favorites became,</v>

1488
01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:38.361
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite as a person was Michael </v>

1489
01:20:38.361 --> 01:20:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Jackson because I never met anybody like</v>
<v Speaker 2>him in my life and never expected to </v>

1490
01:20:41.150 --> 01:20:44.271
<v Speaker 2>meet anybody like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he embodied the first two rules of </v>

1491
01:20:44.271 --> 01:20:46.380
<v Speaker 2>science in a way that none of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>science people that I've known and loved</v>

1492
01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.570
<v Speaker 2>have ever embodied it.</v>

1493
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:49.910
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1494
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:54.810
<v Speaker 2>my favorites musically right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've changed over the years.</v>

1495
01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:00.810
<v Speaker 2>One day I was driving a rental car on </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunset boulevard in Hollywood.</v>

1496
01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:06.200
<v Speaker 2>And a song came on the radio that made </v>
<v Speaker 2>me do something I'd never done since I'd</v>

1497
01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:07.890
<v Speaker 2>never done before and I've never done </v>
<v Speaker 2>since.</v>

1498
01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I had to pull the car over to a side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the side of the road and stop and do </v>

1499
01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:16.810
<v Speaker 2>nothing but listen to this song and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was hurt.</v>

1500
01:21:16.811 --> 01:21:21.570
<v Speaker 2>So good by John Mellencamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Billy Joel,</v>

1501
01:21:21.571 --> 01:21:26.571
<v Speaker 2>I loved him and his angry period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I came to him after his angry period</v>

1502
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:30.540
<v Speaker 2>and one day I wanted to get together </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them socially because I hadn't seen</v>

1503
01:21:30.541 --> 01:21:33.090
<v Speaker 2>him in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't socialize very readily.</v>

1504
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to get together to work together,</v>

1505
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.370
<v Speaker 2>but not necessarily to schmooze </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1506
01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:42.510
<v Speaker 2>But I did call him for socializing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we met for breakfast,</v>

1507
01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a restaurant,</v>

1508
01:21:44.761 --> 01:21:47.470
<v Speaker 2>at the outdoor cafe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of restaurant on the ground,</v>

1509
01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:52.520
<v Speaker 2>ground floor of the Essex House where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had an apartment and he came down the </v>

1510
01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.661
<v Speaker 2>elevator carrying this child's notebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how when you're in first and </v>

1511
01:21:56.661 --> 01:22:00.951
<v Speaker 2>second grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your parents buy you a black covered </v>

1512
01:22:00.951 --> 01:22:02.220
<v Speaker 2>marbled with white notebook to write in.</v>

1513
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:05.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had one of those and he put it in the</v>

1514
01:22:05.011 --> 01:22:10.011
<v Speaker 2>middle of the table while we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking and he explained something and </v>

1515
01:22:10.011 --> 01:22:13.641
<v Speaker 2>he said when I was growing up and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were teenagers and we would hang out on </v>

1516
01:22:15.091 --> 01:22:17.420
<v Speaker 2>the corner just watching all the girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>go by,</v>

1517
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:20.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls to us.</v>

1518
01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:25.040
<v Speaker 2>We're a separate species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like mules or donkeys or dogs </v>

1519
01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.990
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we had anything to do with them.</v>

1520
01:22:27.991 --> 01:22:32.991
<v Speaker 2>The simple goal was to score.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We assumed that they didn't have brains </v>

1521
01:22:32.991 --> 01:22:34.920
<v Speaker 2>like ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I met a girl last night,</v>

1522
01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:39.921
<v Speaker 2>billy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who utterly defied those rules of what </v>

1523
01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:42.000
<v Speaker 2>girls are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is articulate,</v>

1524
01:22:42.001 --> 01:22:44.430
<v Speaker 2>she is intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is on top of things.</v>

1525
01:22:44.431 --> 01:22:48.360
<v Speaker 2>She was a pleasure to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Billy had informed me the first time</v>

1526
01:22:48.361 --> 01:22:53.361
<v Speaker 2>I met him at his home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out on a oyster bay that had a piano</v>

1527
01:22:54.121 --> 01:22:59.121
<v Speaker 2>room and it had a big grand piano and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>explained that at that writing Sol,</v>

1528
01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:03.270
<v Speaker 2>this was like pulling teeth that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes just took them three months to</v>

1529
01:23:03.271 --> 01:23:08.271
<v Speaker 2>write a song that he would pace back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth panel room and he would call his </v>

1530
01:23:08.271 --> 01:23:09.340
<v Speaker 2>piano the beast with Ada teeth.</v>

1531
01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.680
<v Speaker 2>It was the BC was fighting to get songs </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1532
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billy explained that after coming home </v>

1533
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.070
<v Speaker 2>at two in the morning for meeting this </v>
<v Speaker 2>astonishing woman,</v>

1534
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:22.980
<v Speaker 2>he had sat down with this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>notebook and he had written an entire </v>

1535
01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:27.680
<v Speaker 2>album full of songs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made his views it.</v>

1536
01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was Christie Brinkley and yes.</v>

1537
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.760
<v Speaker 2>And you could see how she might inspire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So under two.</v>

1538
01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1539
01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:40.000
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that it was billy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>most vapid album,</v>

1540
01:23:40.001 --> 01:23:42.730
<v Speaker 2>at least to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'd ever heard from him.</v>

1541
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's an album that I really am not </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in listening to,</v>

1542
01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:49.120
<v Speaker 2>but his angry period when he was angry </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his first wife,</v>

1543
01:23:49.121 --> 01:23:50.510
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1544
01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.900
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were really,</v>

1545
01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:56.860
<v Speaker 2>really good songs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Simon astonished me.</v>

1546
01:23:56.861 --> 01:24:00.150
<v Speaker 2>One day I was in the elevator over at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Broadway,</v>

1547
01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:05.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>building Broadway studios or somebody </v>

1548
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.010
<v Speaker 2>that I have the building he owns with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lauren michaels of Saturday night live.</v>

1549
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I was in the elevator and I bumped into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul who was my client.</v>

1550
01:24:10.391 --> 01:24:14.620
<v Speaker 2>I did Simon and Garfunkel reunion tour </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the part or reunion in the park.</v>

1551
01:24:14.621 --> 01:24:18.580
<v Speaker 2>And then I did Simon and Garfunkel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his reunion tour and um,</v>

1552
01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:23.020
<v Speaker 2>and Paul had a piece of paper in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand and I said,</v>

1553
01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1554
01:24:23.861 --> 01:24:25.780
<v Speaker 2>it's lyrics roy next album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now remember,</v>

1555
01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I was so heavily in the poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poetry changed in the nature of my </v>

1556
01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:34.291
<v Speaker 2>life when I was 14 to 16 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was the editor of a literary </v>

1557
01:24:34.391 --> 01:24:38.170
<v Speaker 2>magazine that won two National Academy </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Poets Prizes in addition to the store</v>

1558
01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:41.890
<v Speaker 2>caused in the art community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I asked if I could see the lyrics.</v>

1559
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:46.030
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to describe this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I read the lyrics,</v>

1560
01:24:46.031 --> 01:24:51.031
<v Speaker 2>my knees almost buckled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which almost felt the floor bones and </v>

1561
01:24:51.031 --> 01:24:51.760
<v Speaker 2>stones or something like that.</v>

1562
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible with album names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was some of the most astonishing </v>

1563
01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.841
<v Speaker 2>poetry I'd ever ever read in my life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it reached so deep into me that I've </v>

1564
01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:05.140
<v Speaker 2>literally was losing control of my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1565
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:10.350
<v Speaker 2>so I asked him if he minded if I showed </v>
<v Speaker 2>these to the lyrics to one friend,</v>

1566
01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:15.010
<v Speaker 2>just one friend at the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>

1567
01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:20.040
<v Speaker 2>we went into his office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made a xerox and I walked out with </v>

1568
01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.670
<v Speaker 2>the Xerox of the lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I had learned that the,</v>

1569
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.720
<v Speaker 2>that the media is like sheep and that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take one of the lead shape and </v>

1570
01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:32.011
<v Speaker 2>turn him in your direction that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>change the perception of an artist </v>

1571
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:37.740
<v Speaker 2>within the critical community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had a friend who was an outsider </v>

1572
01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:42.330
<v Speaker 2>and yet a lead sheet because he was at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times and he was an </v>

1573
01:25:42.330 --> 01:25:43.780
<v Speaker 2>outsider because he was gay before you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could admit that you were gay.</v>

1574
01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:46.970
<v Speaker 2>So even I didn't know that he was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just trust no,</v>

1575
01:25:46.971 --> 01:25:51.370
<v Speaker 2>he was a little bit strange and that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence felt protective of him.</v>

1576
01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.690
<v Speaker 2>And I called him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have just seen the most amazing lyrics</v>

1577
01:25:55.691 --> 01:26:00.691
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for all I know it's an illusion for </v>

1578
01:26:00.691 --> 01:26:02.140
<v Speaker 2>all I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have somehow hyped myself into this.</v>

1579
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.050
<v Speaker 2>If I send you the lyrics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you tell me if I'm crazy?</v>

1580
01:26:07.230 --> 01:26:09.530
<v Speaker 2>And two hours later I send it to them by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Messenger.</v>

1581
01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:11.930
<v Speaker 2>In two hours later I got a phone call </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1582
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:16.990
<v Speaker 2>you are not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Paul Simon has amazing astonishing </v>

1583
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:21.740
<v Speaker 2>gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And beyond that,</v>

1584
01:26:21.741 --> 01:26:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love rock and roll and blues </v>
<v Speaker 2>based service.</v>

1585
01:26:24.831 --> 01:26:29.750
<v Speaker 2>So these days I'm listening to Joe </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bonamassa and Johnny Lang and Beth Hart,</v>

1586
01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:32.120
<v Speaker 2>who I think is the best vocalist I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever heard in my life.</v>

1587
01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beth Hart is just amazing.</v>

1588
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.830
<v Speaker 2>She takes everything that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1589
01:26:37.831 --> 01:26:42.831
<v Speaker 2>at uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James did and everything that Janis </v>

1590
01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:44.420
<v Speaker 2>joplin builds on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the base of what I had james had done</v>

1591
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:49.750
<v Speaker 2>and takes it five levels beyond what </v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever thought any vocals could ever </v>

1592
01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:52.820
<v Speaker 2>made your praise because there's editor </v>
<v Speaker 2>James was quite the creature.</v>

1593
01:26:53.150 --> 01:26:56.090
<v Speaker 2>She really was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was an original.</v>

1594
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:58.090
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1595
01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:00.920
<v Speaker 2>but we skipped the story of how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>accidentally started the six days.</v>

1596
01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good place to stop.</v>

1597
01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I think because we got into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1598
01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.510
<v Speaker 2>we completed the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We completed that story.</v>

1599
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I would love to talk to you again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an absolutely great conversation </v>

1600
01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:20.940
<v Speaker 2>and for me it's a privilege because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>love your thinking about Muse,</v>

1601
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:25.990
<v Speaker 2>about religion in terms of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying archetypes because that's a </v>

1602
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:30.101
<v Speaker 2>part of my life quest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've gone out and explored a part </v>

1603
01:27:30.101 --> 01:27:32.510
<v Speaker 2>that I would never have had the time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explore with a mind that's yours.</v>

1604
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:35.000
<v Speaker 2>And so it's going to be different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>

1605
01:27:35.001 --> 01:27:37.930
<v Speaker 2>So I will download the PDF.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hope.</v>

1606
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:38.880
<v Speaker 2>I hope that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1607
01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:40.970
<v Speaker 2>especially because you've read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second book,</v>

1608
01:27:40.971 --> 01:27:43.700
<v Speaker 2>there's 12 rules for life that should </v>
<v Speaker 2>open up maps of meaning,</v>

1609
01:27:43.701 --> 01:27:45.670
<v Speaker 2>if which is a much more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1610
01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's a much denser book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not as well written,</v>

1611
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:51.300
<v Speaker 2>although I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1612
01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:56.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not complaining about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It it accomplish the goal that I'd set </v>

1613
01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:56.800
<v Speaker 2>out to accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

1614
01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:57.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1616
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.391
<v Speaker 2>rules for life and I'd be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested to hear what you have to say </v>

1617

<v Speaker 2>about maps of meaning.</v>
