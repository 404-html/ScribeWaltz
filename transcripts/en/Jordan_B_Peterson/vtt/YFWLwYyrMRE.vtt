1
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.163
<v Speaker 1>So on to Sigmund Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give him somewhat short </v>

2
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:14.944
<v Speaker 1>shrift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid because we only have an hour </v>

3
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:17.980
<v Speaker 1>to talk about Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

4
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.440
<v Speaker 1>We could get a fair way through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.953
<v Speaker 1>he's still persona non grata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say among experimental </v>

6
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and probably clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists as well.</v>

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 1>But that seems to me to be very unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud is one of those thinkers who,</v>

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that's left are his mistakes.</v>

10
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.573
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that he discovered or put </v>

11
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:43.234
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so entrenched in our culture now </v>

12
00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:45.754
<v Speaker 1>that we think it's self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everything correct has been </v>

13
00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:50.164
<v Speaker 1>assimilated and that just leaves </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's more or less floating </v>

14
00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:55.030
<v Speaker 1>on top to look wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

15
00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:55.864
<v Speaker 1>but Freud is also one of those thinkers </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was always wrong in an interesting </v>

16
00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:01.240
<v Speaker 1>way and that's very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

17
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.583
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think that many of the things </v>

18
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:07.090
<v Speaker 1>that he put his finger on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that our abs of steel disputed,</v>

19
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:09.910
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the oedipus complex are much</v>

20
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>more useful than people are willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit,</v>

21
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.670
<v Speaker 1>especially in the clinical realm.</v>

22
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Because the oedipal complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about quite a bit,</v>

23
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.390
<v Speaker 1>is actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.573
<v Speaker 1>a description of a fairly stable form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>familial psychopathology where child </v>

25
00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:34.360
<v Speaker 1>gets trapped within the confines of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>family because the relationship with one</v>

26
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:39.220
<v Speaker 1>parent or the other or both is so tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can't break beyond it.</v>

27
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.140
<v Speaker 1>And maybe because of their own inability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move towards independence,</v>

28
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:47.290
<v Speaker 1>but more frequently because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.183
<v Speaker 1>what you might describe as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy between the sun and the </v>

30
00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:51.994
<v Speaker 1>parent or the child and the parent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevents them from moving towards </v>

31
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>autonomous life and keeps them in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of,</v>

32
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.030
<v Speaker 1>essentially a state of childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependence.</v>

33
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.373
<v Speaker 1>Freud said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started my professional activity as a </v>

34
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:09.804
<v Speaker 1>neurologist trying to bring the relief </v>
<v Speaker 1>to my neurotic patients under the </v>

35
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:13.284
<v Speaker 1>influence of an older friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by my own efforts I discovered some </v>

36
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>important new facts about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and psychic life,</v>

37
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>the role of instinctual urges and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of these findings grew a new science</v>

38
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of psychology,</v>

39
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.313
<v Speaker 1>and a new treatment for the neuroses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to pay heavily for this bit of </v>

40
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:31.244
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People did not believe in my facts and </v>

41
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:37.670
<v Speaker 1>thought my theories unsavory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resistance was strong and unrelenting.</v>

42
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.833
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I succeeded in inquiring pupils and </v>

43
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:42.890
<v Speaker 1>building it up in new international </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic association,</v>

44
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.993
<v Speaker 1>but the struggle is not over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made that recording just shortly </v>

45
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.370
<v Speaker 1>before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He moved to La,</v>

46
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.660
<v Speaker 1>to England to escape the Nazis.</v>

47
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Before Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>

48
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>the mind was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated because Freud of course</v>

49
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>was not the only person to be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>along the lines that he thought.</v>

50
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.303
<v Speaker 1>Pierre Jenay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was one of his teachers had </v>

51
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:08.884
<v Speaker 1>originated and started to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the ideas that I would say were </v>

52
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>popularized by Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

53
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.550
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the unconscious mind was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not as well developed prior to</v>

54
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Freud as it became afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

55
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose</v>

56
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.373
<v Speaker 1>you might say that in so far as people </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of the mind at all they thought </v>

57
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:36.094
<v Speaker 1>of in philosophical terms and the mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be that part of you that's that </v>

58
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>you're aware of like in the dark and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cartesian sense.</v>

59
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.193
<v Speaker 1>Descartes said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think therefore I am and it kind of </v>

60
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:46.864
<v Speaker 1>seems in some sense self evident that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aware of and have control over </v>

61
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.683
<v Speaker 1>the contents of your own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was what Freud really </v>

62
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>questioned and he questioned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply said,</v>

63
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:58.624
<v Speaker 1>well first of all the idea that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing like one mind is a dubious </v>

64
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>idea to begin with because people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of internal contradictions and then</v>

65
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 1>the idea that your mind is all of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>type,</v>

66
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.743
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all of one form was also very </v>

67
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:15.004
<v Speaker 1>questionable as far as Freud was </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned because you could be </v>

68
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>fractionated into subcomponents and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know the idea for example,</v>

69
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:23.044
<v Speaker 1>that your anger or your sexual desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be an autonomous part of your </v>

70
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>personality in some sense that it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>overtake you and control you.</v>

71
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.843
<v Speaker 1>That's really afraid and idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the classic Freud and ideas </v>

72
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.074
<v Speaker 1>really is that people are made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sub personalities and those sub </v>

73
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:39.714
<v Speaker 1>personalities are alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things I really </v>

74
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:42.934
<v Speaker 1>like about the psychoanalytic thinkers </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even the psychologist who say </v>

75
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:52.441
<v Speaker 1>over the last 30 years or thereabouts </v>
<v Speaker 1>since maybe longer now anyways,</v>

76
00:04:52.861 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>since the demise of behaviorism as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology</v>

77
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>and the admission by psychologists that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

78
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 1>there is an act of unconscious or many </v>
<v Speaker 1>active unconscious,</v>

79
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>which is a better way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

80
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists still really haven't come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to terms with the idea in any deep sense</v>

81
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>that these unconscious processes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>living things.</v>

82
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.023
<v Speaker 1>You know there when when psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk for example about the cognitive </v>

83
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:20.044
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about something that </v>

84
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.993
<v Speaker 1>they describe it more machine like with </v>
<v Speaker 1>more machine like metaphors and that's </v>

85
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.870
<v Speaker 1>not reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

86
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.723
<v Speaker 1>you understand things a lot better if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand that the sub components </v>

87
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.543
<v Speaker 1>that make up people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fragmentary bits of them and also </v>

88
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:36.724
<v Speaker 1>the biological subsystems that that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>part and parcel of your being are much </v>

89
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.890
<v Speaker 1>more intelligently viewed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities there.</v>

90
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of unit dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities in some sense.</v>

91
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>So that for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're angry,</v>

92
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:49.564
<v Speaker 1>you're nothing but angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's an overstatement </v>

93
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.683
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're afraid you're nothing but </v>

94
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>afraid or if you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're nothing but hunger.</v>

95
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.603
<v Speaker 1>While certainly true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get hungry enough or thirsty or </v>

96
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.970
<v Speaker 1>too hot or any of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

97
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>you kind of collapsed to a simpler </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality that only has one motivation</v>

98
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:06.404
<v Speaker 1>in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll talk a lot as we progress </v>

99
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.313
<v Speaker 1>about the grounding of those unit </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional motivational systems in </v>

100
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'd have to say that Freud was among</v>

101
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:16.844
<v Speaker 1>the first red least the first to </v>
<v Speaker 1>synthesize a coherent theory of this </v>

102
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:22.154
<v Speaker 1>multiplicity and to put it forth while </v>
<v Speaker 1>also insisting that much of what was </v>

103
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:28.394
<v Speaker 1>happening to you and inside of you was </v>
<v Speaker 1>not immediately accessible to your </v>

104
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very profound,</v>

105
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 1>it's very profound discovery.</v>

106
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.280
<v Speaker 1>It means among any among many other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you can formulate ideas.</v>

107
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.533
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that you can act out things </v>

108
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>that you don't understand for reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't understand.</v>

109
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.110
<v Speaker 1>It also means that your memory can </v>
<v Speaker 1>contain things that's represented in one</v>

110
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:00.164
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that can't be understood it in </v>

111
00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

112
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 1>and we know this is true because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are independent memory systems,</v>

113
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 1>there's an independent memory system for</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures.</v>

114
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.403
<v Speaker 1>That's for actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an independence memory system </v>

115
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 1>for what you might describe as </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination for,</v>

116
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.110
<v Speaker 1>for the memory that uses images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's uh,</v>

117
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 1>another system that articulates </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

118
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:21.763
<v Speaker 1>That's the semantic memory system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not obvious at all that the </v>

119
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>contents of all of those are equivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>

120
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:29.954
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can dream things that you don't </v>

121
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:32.774
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause one of the things you might think </v>

122
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:34.754
<v Speaker 1>is that your dreams watch you act and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they watch other people act and then </v>

123
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>they make a little drama out of that.</v>

124
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>And that drama has information in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't necessarily know what that</v>

125
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 1>information is in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't describe it consciously.</v>

126
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.661
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

127
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:48.494
<v Speaker 1>it's akin to the Ph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie an idea that kids can play a game </v>

128
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>and you can take them away from the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they won't know how to describe</v>

129
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 1>the rules even though they could play </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game.</v>

130
00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:57.914
<v Speaker 1>And so dreams can contain information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's full of the encoding of behavior </v>

131
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>that has information in it that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not consciously aware of.</v>

132
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can become consciously </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of that in kind of a revelation.</v>

133
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Sayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what you do when you become</v>

134
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:12.404
<v Speaker 1>aware of the meaning of a dream or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of a fantasy or something like </v>

135
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.830
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's all our ability to think that</v>

136
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:22.100
<v Speaker 1>way in some ways can be traced back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>

137
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud concentrated mostly I would say at</v>

138
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:32.051
<v Speaker 1>least in terms of pathology on sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>and aggressive impulses and I,</v>

139
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:33.694
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that there's any mystery </v>
<v Speaker 1>for modern people about why aggressive </v>

140
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:38.414
<v Speaker 1>impulses might be particularly difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>to integrate into the personality and </v>

141
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:45.530
<v Speaker 1>might remain underdeveloped or we'll say</v>
<v Speaker 1>repressed,</v>

142
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.030
<v Speaker 1>although those aren't the same thing.</v>

143
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.063
<v Speaker 1>And I think in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that in different times </v>

144
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:52.004
<v Speaker 1>in society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things are allowed to surface and </v>

145
00:08:55.081 --> 00:08:57.890
<v Speaker 1>express themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And other things are less allowed.</v>

146
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And so Victorian Times had a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that made the repression</v>

147
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:04.074
<v Speaker 1>of sexuality particularly likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps also the repression of </v>

148
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:07.554
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're talking about Victorian times </v>

149
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>and in Europe obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and only one time in one place</v>

150
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>as Henry or Ellenberger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay says,</v>

151
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 1>this is a great book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

152
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>the discovery of the unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in,</v>

153
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 1>if you're really interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic ideas,</v>

154
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young and Adler,</v>

155
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:24.624
<v Speaker 1>and also the history of those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no better book than the </v>

156
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>discovery of the unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolutely remarkable book,</v>

157
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.930
<v Speaker 1>a great work of scholarship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>

158
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.760
<v Speaker 1>it goes for about 250 pages before it </v>
<v Speaker 1>even gets to Freud.</v>

159
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>And so it places Freud's discoveries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their historical context.</v>

160
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>So that's a really good thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allan Burke.</v>

161
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:42.054
<v Speaker 1>Jay says it was a world shaped by man </v>
<v Speaker 1>format in which women occupied the </v>

162
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:46.044
<v Speaker 1>second place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Political Rights for women did not </v>

163
00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:48.444
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The separation and dissimilarity of the </v>

164
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 1>sexist was sharper than today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women who wore slacks,</v>

165
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 1>their hair shorter smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're hardly to be found.</v>

166
00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 1>And the university's admitted no female </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

167
00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.633
<v Speaker 1>Man's authority over his children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife was unquestioned education was </v>

168
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:03.834
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The desk product father was a common </v>

169
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:09.900
<v Speaker 1>figure and was particularly conspicuous </v>
<v Speaker 1>only when he became extremely cruel.</v>

170
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Laws were more repressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delinquent youth,</v>

171
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:16.260
<v Speaker 1>sternly punished and corporal punishment</v>
<v Speaker 1>was considered indispensable.</v>

172
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the times themselves,</v>

173
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I would say were harsher and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>repressive,</v>

174
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 1>but then there was an element to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality that was also</v>

175
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

176
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you might notice might </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider,</v>

177
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.203
<v Speaker 1>and people generally don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to overstate how </v>

178
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.740
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary the birth control pill </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually is.</v>

179
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like to think that the political </v>

180
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:45.654
<v Speaker 1>rights that women have attained have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a consequence of a political </v>

181
00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:49.350
<v Speaker 1>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't buy that for a second.</v>

182
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true even in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>

183
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that what happened was that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwent a biological revolution in the</v>

184
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:55.704
<v Speaker 1>1950s late 1950s with the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the birth control pill and that for the </v>

185
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:00.954
<v Speaker 1>first time in human history gave women </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty reliable control over their </v>

186
00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:05.154
<v Speaker 1>reproductive function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really transformed them into </v>

187
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 1>entirely different biological beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many,</v>

188
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:11.820
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's an example,</v>

189
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.410
<v Speaker 1>a subtle example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

190
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.083
<v Speaker 1>if you track women through their </v>
<v Speaker 1>oscillation cycle and you show them a </v>

191
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 1>picture of a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same mat and you do nothing but vary his</v>

192
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:22.824
<v Speaker 1>jaw width when there are relating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy with the wider jaws more attractive </v>

193
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:29.430
<v Speaker 1>and when they're not ovulating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the farthest away from that,</v>

194
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.413
<v Speaker 1>the guy with the thinner jaws more </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive and that's associated with </v>

195
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:33.540
<v Speaker 1>testosterone levels.</v>

196
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>And so women who are fertile like more </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine men.</v>

197
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.913
<v Speaker 1>And basically if you're on the pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're never in that operation </v>

198
00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:42.870
<v Speaker 1>phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one thing that may have happened,</v>

199
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:44.340
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know this for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

200
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to consider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that since women have been taking the</v>

201
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:48.714
<v Speaker 1>birth control pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their preference for less masculine men </v>

202
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:51.294
<v Speaker 1>has become more pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that could easily be of the things </v>

203
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:54.454
<v Speaker 1>that's fueling at least some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tension that's existed and exists now </v>

204
00:11:58.031 --> 00:12:01.930
<v Speaker 1>politically between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that you just cannot</v>

205
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 1>ignore the massive consequences of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological revolution like that.</v>

206
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:07.534
<v Speaker 1>And to make any other factor causal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're trying to understand the </v>

207
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 1>political movement movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the last say 40 years,</v>

208
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:16.810
<v Speaker 1>it's you're putting the cart before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>

209
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.943
<v Speaker 1>Now it's reasonable to point out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pill wouldn't have been accepted as </v>

210
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:26.671
<v Speaker 1>a technology if certain political </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes with regards to the emancipation</v>

211
00:12:27.131 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 1>of women hadn't already been in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

212
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.543
<v Speaker 1>No one would have even been allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do something like investigate </v>

213
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:33.544
<v Speaker 1>contraception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't separate the biological </v>

214
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:38.110
<v Speaker 1>from the political entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>

215
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 1>it's still very useful to organize your </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizing,</v>

216
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:42.274
<v Speaker 1>your thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to realize just how profound a </v>

217
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 1>revolution that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now back in the Victorian Times,</v>

218
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>see there's another thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality.</v>

219
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.093
<v Speaker 1>Modern people like to think that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing dangerous about sex and that is </v>

220
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:54.394
<v Speaker 1>like the stupidest thing you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly ever hypothesize because </v>

221
00:12:57.101 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 1>everything about it is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous emotionally,</v>

222
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.413
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socially it's dangerous because of the </v>

223
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:04.743
<v Speaker 1>possibility of unwanted pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's dangerous because of the </v>

224
00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:10.060
<v Speaker 1>possibility of sickness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a major one.</v>

225
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:10.894
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when aids emerged in the 1980s that </v>

226
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:13.834
<v Speaker 1>could have easily killed all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the fact that it didn't was </v>

227
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.013
<v Speaker 1>wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it did kill hundreds of millions of </v>

228
00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was no joke.</v>

229
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.213
<v Speaker 1>It was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And AIDS mutated to take advantage of </v>

230
00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:25.504
<v Speaker 1>promiscuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the relationship between sexual </v>

231
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:29.584
<v Speaker 1>behavior in the transmission of disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually mediated at the biological </v>

232
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

233
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:35.920
<v Speaker 1>back in the 1890s they had the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

234
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:36.754
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had the problem with syphilis and </v>

235
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.400
<v Speaker 1>syphilis is one nasty disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

236
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.523
<v Speaker 1>it can mimic almost any other disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's devastating to your nervous </v>

237
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:46.690
<v Speaker 1>system and you can pass it on to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

238
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:47.853
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason that sexuality</v>
<v Speaker 1>was heavily repressed in the Victorian </v>

239
00:13:51.071 --> 00:13:55.120
<v Speaker 1>period was not only because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of unwanted pregnancy,</v>

240
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 1>the relative poverty of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:13:57.611 --> 00:13:59.860
<v Speaker 1>back in 1895 in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe,</v>

242
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 1>the average person lived on less than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar a day.</v>

243
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.160
<v Speaker 1>In modern terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.870
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to understand how</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor people were.</v>

245
00:14:07.871 --> 00:14:08.704
<v Speaker 1>And so sex in a poverty stricken place </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also a lot more dangerous than it is </v>

246
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 1>in a rich place.</v>

247
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.373
<v Speaker 1>Because especially if you were given the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of employment opportunities for </v>

248
00:14:19.241 --> 00:14:20.074
<v Speaker 1>women back in the Victorian period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to get pregnant out of </v>

249
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:25.210
<v Speaker 1>wedlock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were and you are in serious trouble.</v>

250
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.290
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that sexuality was </v>
<v Speaker 1>repressed is hardly,</v>

251
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.303
<v Speaker 1>it's hardly a surprise because it was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to integrate into the full </v>

252
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:34.900
<v Speaker 1>fledged personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 1>and it as it as it still is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sexual repression,</v>

254
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:40.563
<v Speaker 1>supposedly characteristic feature of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Victorian period was often merely the </v>

255
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:44.104
<v Speaker 1>expression of two facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lack of diffusion of contraceptives </v>

256
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.540
<v Speaker 1>and the fear of venereal disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all the more dangerous because of</v>

257
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:50.374
<v Speaker 1>the great spread of prostitution and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because prostitutes were almost </v>

258
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:55.730
<v Speaker 1>invariably contaminated and therefore </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential sources of infection.</v>

259
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.043
<v Speaker 1>We can hardly imagine today how monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfoss syphilis appeared to people of </v>

260
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:02.810
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we can imagine a little bit better</v>

261
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 1>than they could in 1970 because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't,</v>

262
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>AIDS is still with us,</v>

263
00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 1>although it's nowhere near the plague </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was say 25 years ago.</v>

264
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the floridian world,</v>

265
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

266
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:17.774
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the history of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the idea of the unconscious to begin </v>

267
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:20.864
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that you might </v>

268
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:22.803
<v Speaker 1>want to consider conceptually is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many different forms of </v>

269
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not just one.</v>

270
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.663
<v Speaker 1>And so Alan Borchez points out that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>1,904 functions of the unconscious had </v>

271
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 1>been described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a conservative function.</v>

272
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.580
<v Speaker 1>So the unconscious stores memories often</v>
<v Speaker 1>unaccessible to voluntary recall.</v>

273
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a strange one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

274
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:43.184
<v Speaker 1>obviously you remember your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't remember all of what you </v>

275
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:50.120
<v Speaker 1>can remember at any given time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't really have access to that</v>

276
00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 1>full store of memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you can try to remember.</v>

277
00:15:52.581 --> 00:15:53.414
<v Speaker 1>So the unconscious is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine the memories are </v>

278
00:15:57.231 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Speaker 1>represented somehow neurologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but neuro,</v>

279
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 1>the neurological structure isn't exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind.</v>

280
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Like the neurological structure isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly your consciousness.</v>

281
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.810
<v Speaker 1>There's some relationship between them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't know.</v>

282
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.153
<v Speaker 1>And the unconscious from a conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is the place that your </v>

283
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:17.870
<v Speaker 1>memories are that you sometimes can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to and sometimes can't.</v>

284
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.213
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that there are the memories that </v>

285
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:22.664
<v Speaker 1>you can't get access to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be a variety of reasons you </v>

286
00:16:24.591 --> 00:16:25.424
<v Speaker 1>can't get access to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One might be that you've just forgotten </v>

287
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.113
<v Speaker 1>and one might be that they're so painful</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want to bring them to </v>

288
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:32.564
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll you'll engage in tricks to stop </v>

289
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:35.234
<v Speaker 1>yourself from getting access to them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they're memories that are so </v>

290
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:43.130
<v Speaker 1>complex that and painful that even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you did get access to them,</v>

291
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't exactly know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

292
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 1>And so there's not a lot of reason for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to bring them to mind because all it</v>

293
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:51.710
<v Speaker 1>is is pain without any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any utility.</v>

294
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 1>And when you understand that a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

295
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:56.720
<v Speaker 1>you understand more about what Freud </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant by repression.</v>

296
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.363
<v Speaker 1>The think about Freud is that he kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that like many people believe </v>

297
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:05.570
<v Speaker 1>now that when you remember an event in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>

298
00:17:05.571 --> 00:17:06.404
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost as if you're using a video </v>

299
00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:08.184
<v Speaker 1>tape recorder and that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that the memory is somehow </v>

300
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:12.404
<v Speaker 1>recorded in you like it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not a very accurate version </v>

301
00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:18.980
<v Speaker 1>of how memory works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

302
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>we know that memories can be easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>distorted.</v>

303
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.250
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you interview some one about an event</v>

304
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.533
<v Speaker 1>and you make suggestions that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something present in the event that </v>

305
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:32.030
<v Speaker 1>wasn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you bring them back a couple of</v>

306
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.500
<v Speaker 1>weeks later and you ask them about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same event,</v>

307
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 1>they'll often incorporate the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were told into the event.</v>

308
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:38.563
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that you can make an </v>

309
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:40.664
<v Speaker 1>objective record of something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to you is kind of a strange </v>

310
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.920
<v Speaker 1>notion anyways because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

311
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:46.754
<v Speaker 1>if you're having an argument with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone and later you're asked what the </v>

312
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 1>argument was about and the other person </v>
<v Speaker 1>is asked what the argument is about,</v>

313
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.780
<v Speaker 1>there's no necessary reason why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts will jibe at all.</v>

314
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of time when you're having</v>
<v Speaker 1>an argument with someone,</v>

315
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 1>you're arguing about what the argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>is about,</v>

316
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

317
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're angry at me.</v>

318
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

319
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 1>This is why I think you're angry at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

320
00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:09.084
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why I think this event has </v>

321
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 1>occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're thinking about,</v>

322
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.553
<v Speaker 1>especially if we know each other well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about the </v>

323
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:16.434
<v Speaker 1>contextualization of that event across </v>
<v Speaker 1>our entire history and I'm doing the </v>

324
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:21.174
<v Speaker 1>same thing and I'm going to highlight </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you're not going to </v>

325
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:23.574
<v Speaker 1>highlight and I'm going to draw causal </v>
<v Speaker 1>inferences that you're not going to </v>

326
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:26.364
<v Speaker 1>draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for us just to get on the same page </v>

327
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:30.000
<v Speaker 1>about the memory's going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

328
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.223
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that in especially with </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex interactions with people that </v>

329
00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:35.094
<v Speaker 1>you can somehow make a video recording </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the memory and actually capture what </v>

330
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:40.620
<v Speaker 1>happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very,</v>

331
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:42.440
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

332
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.283
<v Speaker 1>it's not true.</v>

333
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.153
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

334
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might be able to extract out </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain objective facts,</v>

335
00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:47.904
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally if it's a dialogical </v>

336
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.110
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a relationship issue,</v>

337
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.213
<v Speaker 1>it spans such a long period of time that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just cutting a slice of it out doesn't </v>

338
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.540
<v Speaker 1>constitute a reasonable record of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what it means.</v>

339
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're more concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>with too.</v>

340
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have an experience,</v>

341
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.933
<v Speaker 1>you're not under so much concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened from an objective </v>

342
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:08.904
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more concerned about what the </v>

343
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:13.440
<v Speaker 1>experience means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask,</v>

344
00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:15.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to mean something?</v>

345
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.003
<v Speaker 1>And that was the question I was trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to answer in that paper I had you read </v>

346
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:24.000
<v Speaker 1>right at the beginning of the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that meaning means</v>

347
00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:28.260
<v Speaker 1>is that it has implication for the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the world or the way you act</v>

348
00:19:28.261 --> 00:19:28.740
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

349
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.660
<v Speaker 1>And so if I tell you something </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>

350
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.003
<v Speaker 1>what that's going to mean is in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future you're going to act slightly </v>

351
00:19:34.471 --> 00:19:35.304
<v Speaker 1>differently or maybe radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently depending on how meaning it </v>

352
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.363
<v Speaker 1>meaningful it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also that the way that you look at </v>

353
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:41.064
<v Speaker 1>the world has shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that you look at the world </v>

354
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:46.470
<v Speaker 1>is actually an unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an unconscious process.</v>

355
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:47.304
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know while you're looking at </v>

356
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:50.184
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is or why it is that you're </v>

357
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:54.570
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because,</v>

358
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.553
<v Speaker 1>well first of all it would just be too </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and second you wouldn't be </v>

359
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:01.290
<v Speaker 1>able to concentrate on what was actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

360
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 1>So your attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

361
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:04.734
<v Speaker 1>is mediated by unconscious forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know that you know that </v>

362
00:20:07.921 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is another 40 and observation.</v>

363
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're sitting down to study,</v>

364
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.940
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your conscious intent is to study,</v>

365
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 1>but you know perfectly well that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of distraction fantasies are going</v>

366
00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:23.154
<v Speaker 1>to enter the theater of your imagination</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonstop and annoyingly and there isn't </v>

367
00:20:27.001 --> 00:20:29.610
<v Speaker 1>really a lot you can do about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>except maybe wait it out,</v>

368
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:30.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'll be sitting there reading and </v>

369
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.050
<v Speaker 1>your attention will flicker away.</v>

370
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.330
<v Speaker 1>You'll think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

371
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe you want to watch Jane the Virgin </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Netflix or something like that.</v>

372
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:39.294
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's time to have a peanut </v>
<v Speaker 1>butter sandwich or you should get the </v>

373
00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:42.174
<v Speaker 1>dust bunnies from an out from underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bed or it's time to go outside and </v>

374
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:46.950
<v Speaker 1>have a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's time for a cup of,</v>

375
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.243
<v Speaker 1>or it's like all these subsystems in you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would like something aren't very </v>

376
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:53.464
<v Speaker 1>happy just to sit there while you read </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that you're actually bored </v>

377
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:56.704
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they pop up and try to take </v>

378
00:20:58.271 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 1>control of your perceptions in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions nonstop.</v>

379
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:01.961
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

380
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:05.130
<v Speaker 1>this is a stupid course anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I have to read this damn paper?</v>

381
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.140
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing in university?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the point of life?</v>

382
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

383
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:13.770
<v Speaker 1>you can really get going if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to avoid doing your homework and,</v>

384
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.520
<v Speaker 1>and then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

385
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:17.680
<v Speaker 1>what is it in you that's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid?</v>

386
00:21:17.681 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Because after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took the damn course and you've told</v>

387
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 1>yourself to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you listen well,</v>

388
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a mess.</v>

389
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically why you haven't got</v>
<v Speaker 1>control over yourself at all.</v>

390
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.310
<v Speaker 1>And no more than I have control over </v>
<v Speaker 1>this laptop.</v>

391
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the memory function of,</v>

392
00:21:40.531 --> 00:21:41.364
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the unconscious and there's the </v>

393
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:45.910
<v Speaker 1>distis dillutive function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting one.</v>

394
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.030
<v Speaker 1>The unconscious contains habits once </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary,</v>

395
00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.043
<v Speaker 1>now automatized and dissociated elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the personality which may lead at </v>

396
00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:56.170
<v Speaker 1>parasitic existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting one.</v>

397
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I would relate that more to procedural </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>

398
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.823
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you've done is practice certain </v>

399
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 1>habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they might be,</v>

400
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.370
<v Speaker 1>let's call them bad habits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd like those things to get under</v>

401
00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:07.480
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>

402
00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So maybe when you're speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

403
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.050
<v Speaker 1>you use like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

404
00:22:11.051 --> 00:22:13.810
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Om Malott and you've practiced that,</v>

405
00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:16.180
<v Speaker 1>so you're really good at it and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to stop it,</v>

406
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:17.014
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get to because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>built that little machine right into </v>

407
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:21.160
<v Speaker 1>your being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

408
00:22:21.161 --> 00:22:24.910
<v Speaker 1>It's neurologically wired and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>under conscious control.</v>

409
00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:29.370
<v Speaker 1>And anything you practice becomes that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes part of you.</v>

410
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.203
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's another element of the </v>

411
00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:32.230
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different part.</v>

412
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a creative part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

413
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.831
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:38.410
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting around and maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to write something,</v>

415
00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:42.520
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you want to produce a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>art or a piece of music,</v>

416
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.623
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're just laying in bed </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreaming and you have all these weird </v>

417
00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:48.130
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially in dreams,</v>

418
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:50.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do those things come from?</v>

419
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:51.303
<v Speaker 1>And even more strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's really weird </v>

420
00:22:55.031 --> 00:22:58.750
<v Speaker 1>about dreams and almost impossibly weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're an observer in the dream.</v>

421
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dream is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to you.</v>

422
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dreaming it theoretically.</v>

423
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.880
<v Speaker 1>So how is it that you can be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>observer?</v>

424
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.640
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you're watching a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>game or a movie,</v>

425
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 1>but you're producing it that at least in</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>

426
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.650
<v Speaker 1>although the psychoanalyst would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

427
00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:15.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>

428
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Your ego isn't producing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your unconscious is producing.</v>

429
00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>

430
00:23:20.381 --> 00:23:21.550
<v Speaker 1>And of course young would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

431
00:23:21.551 --> 00:23:22.384
<v Speaker 1>it's deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The collective unconscious might be </v>

432
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:24.604
<v Speaker 1>producing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in some sense it isn't you exactly </v>

433
00:23:27.521 --> 00:23:28.354
<v Speaker 1>or it isn't the you that you think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think of you and that's the </v>

434
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:34.420
<v Speaker 1>eagle from the Freudian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the you that you identify with,</v>

435
00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:37.450
<v Speaker 1>that's the ego and outside of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious,</v>

436
00:23:37.451 --> 00:23:40.660
<v Speaker 1>the ID.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more of the place of impulses.</v>

437
00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:41.494
<v Speaker 1>And you could think about those as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological subsystems that can derail </v>

438
00:23:44.201 --> 00:23:45.470
<v Speaker 1>your thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

439
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:46.304
<v Speaker 1>And that govern things like hunger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex and aggression and your basic </v>

440
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.233
<v Speaker 1>instincts is another way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a reasonable way of thinking </v>

441
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:56.180
<v Speaker 1>about it because these are subsystems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you share with with animals.</v>

442
00:23:56.181 --> 00:23:57.830
<v Speaker 1>You share them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly with mammals,</v>

443
00:23:57.831 --> 00:23:58.664
<v Speaker 1>you share most of them with reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you share a lot of them with amphibians </v>

444
00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 1>and even going all the way down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans.</v>

445
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 1>There's commonality for example in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy circuits.</v>

446
00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:09.560
<v Speaker 1>And so these are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old things.</v>

447
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.890
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that you're in control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is,</v>

448
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 1>well you're not exactly in control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

449
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.820
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the less integrated you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

450
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.493
<v Speaker 1>the less you're in control of them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the more they're in control of you and </v>

451
00:24:24.681 --> 00:24:26.630
<v Speaker 1>that can get really out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

452
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.010
<v Speaker 1>you can be like with people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessive compulsive disorder,</v>

453
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:32.690
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which which,</v>

454
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be,</v>

455
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I would say that dissoluted elements in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense of the unconscious,</v>

456
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:39.134
<v Speaker 1>the way that it's portrayed here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor people with obsessive compulsive </v>

457
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:42.824
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can spend half their time doing </v>

458
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:47.840
<v Speaker 1>things that they can't really control </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have very strong impulses to do</v>

459
00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:50.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very hard on them to block them</v>

460
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.850
<v Speaker 1>and holiday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll almost panic if those things are</v>

461
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 1>blocked.</v>

462
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.100
<v Speaker 1>And then you have people with two Rett </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syndrome,</v>

463
00:24:55.101 --> 00:24:57.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'll be doing all sorts of weird</v>

464
00:24:57.951 --> 00:25:01.440
<v Speaker 1>dances and spouting off obscenities and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

465
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.453
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and imitating people without being able </v>

466
00:25:05.061 --> 00:25:05.894
<v Speaker 1>to control a 10 and sometimes a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of antipsychotic medication can </v>

467
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:10.664
<v Speaker 1>dampen that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's as if there are these </v>

468
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:12.434
<v Speaker 1>autonomous semi spirits inside of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that grip control over their behavior </v>

469
00:25:16.311 --> 00:25:19.100
<v Speaker 1>and make them do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

470
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:19.934
<v Speaker 1>you find that to some degree in your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>life because maybe you've become very </v>

471
00:25:22.641 --> 00:25:26.060
<v Speaker 1>attracted to someone even maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be attracted to the person</v>

472
00:25:26.061 --> 00:25:27.740
<v Speaker 1>and then you find yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

473
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.890
<v Speaker 1>texting them when you know perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>well that you should be going to bed and</v>

474
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:31.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

475
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:34.640
<v Speaker 1>you're in a grip of something and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't control it.</v>

476
00:25:34.641 --> 00:25:37.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's all part of the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all part of what Freud was studying,</v>

477
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:41.120
<v Speaker 1>the dynamic unconscious.</v>

478
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:41.953
<v Speaker 1>It's alive and it's a compass that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is a composite of contradictory </v>

479
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:49.430
<v Speaker 1>drives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the way Freud thought about this,</v>

480
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:51.830
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has that with the ID and the ego and</v>

481
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:52.664
<v Speaker 1>the superego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about the Ed as the </v>

482
00:25:54.201 --> 00:25:57.620
<v Speaker 1>place where these contradictory drives </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>

483
00:25:57.621 --> 00:25:58.454
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of nature within the ego is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's sort of being pushed </v>

484
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>back and forth by those contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives.</v>

485
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And the Superego is the thing that's on </v>
<v Speaker 1>top saying you better behave yourself,</v>

486
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:08.774
<v Speaker 1>you better behave yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a different model than the </v>

487
00:26:10.911 --> 00:26:11.744
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] model because Piaget assumed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what would happen is that as the </v>

488
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:18.500
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I liked the Piagetian model better,</v>

489
00:26:18.501 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in healthy development,</v>

490
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:24.530
<v Speaker 1>the Piagetian model is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an unhealthy development.</v>

491
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I think the Freudian model is correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>that instead of integrating,</v>

492
00:26:28.491 --> 00:26:29.324
<v Speaker 1>say the aggressive and sexual drives for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sake of argument into your </v>

493
00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:33.740
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you develop,</v>

494
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.950
<v Speaker 1>what happens is the superego just </v>
<v Speaker 1>represses them instead.</v>

495
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:41.030
<v Speaker 1>So they don't become a dynamic part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you integrated into your ego.</v>

496
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 1>They're just repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't manifest them.</v>

497
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:44.993
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how you be a good person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can be the victim of a very </v>

498
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:48.084
<v Speaker 1>harsh superego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that often happens if you've had a </v>

499
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:53.970
<v Speaker 1>particularly tyrannical parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one or both,</v>

500
00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:54.804
<v Speaker 1>or maybe a tyrannical grandparent or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your or your own inner tyrant and </v>

501
00:26:58.111 --> 00:26:58.944
<v Speaker 1>you've picked up to radical voices </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your whole life and aggregated </v>

502
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:04.800
<v Speaker 1>them into this terrible judge that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always watching you.</v>

503
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.873
<v Speaker 1>That's criticizing everything you do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>restricting you badly and really badly </v>

504
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 1>and what you're allowed to not allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

505
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.870
<v Speaker 1>You see that with anorexic women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Ben could be anorexic too,</v>

506
00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less rare.</v>

507
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 1>They have super egos that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's one way of thinking about it,</v>

508
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just deadly.</v>

509
00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:24.270
<v Speaker 1>They just criticizing every bit of them.</v>

510
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.373
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to the point they're really </v>

511
00:27:25.981 --> 00:27:28.110
<v Speaker 1>criticizing the out of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

512
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:28.944
<v Speaker 1>is you have to be so perfect that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfection is not aligned with the </v>

513
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:36.030
<v Speaker 1>ability to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to eat,</v>

514
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

515
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.330
<v Speaker 1>and people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at their bodies,</v>

516
00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.790
<v Speaker 1>they even look at their bodies </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrectly,</v>

517
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 1>like anorexic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be unable to see their bodies as</v>

518
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 1>a whole that can only see their bodies </v>
<v Speaker 1>as parts.</v>

519
00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 1>And when you start seeing your body as </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts,</v>

520
00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:51.024
<v Speaker 1>you're really in trouble because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get a sense of actually what it </v>

521
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:55.890
<v Speaker 1>looks like and body perception is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

522
00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.073
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget thought about the ego as in some </v>

523
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.673
<v Speaker 1>senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game that's played by all these </v>

524
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:05.783
<v Speaker 1>dynamic drives that shaped by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader community and so that could all </v>

525
00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:09.720
<v Speaker 1>be integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Freud would say,</v>

526
00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:11.100
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that doesn't happen,</v>

527
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:15.180
<v Speaker 1>instead you're subject to the tyranny of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the superego and it just says you should</v>

528
00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 1>never be angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

529
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 1>You should never express yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually because if you do,</v>

530
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:19.914
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a bad person and you're a bad </v>

531
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:27.261
<v Speaker 1>person if you ever get aggressive or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people who are living like that</v>

532
00:28:27.451 --> 00:28:29.280
<v Speaker 1>under those circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:30.390
<v Speaker 1>they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

534
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

535
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.680
<v Speaker 1>they're repressed is the right way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

536
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.293
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud was interested in the idea that </v>

537
00:28:40.921 --> 00:28:43.830
<v Speaker 1>mental disorders could be caused for two</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

538
00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:44.664
<v Speaker 1>One would be purely bodily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe a head injury or say in the </v>

539
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:48.504
<v Speaker 1>case of schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good example of manic </v>

540
00:28:50.131 --> 00:28:50.964
<v Speaker 1>depressive disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have reason to believe that there's </v>

541
00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:57.240
<v Speaker 1>something physiological going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though by identifying that has been</v>

542
00:28:57.241 --> 00:28:58.074
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's probably because there isn't </v>

543
00:28:59.161 --> 00:28:59.994
<v Speaker 1>one form of schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably many pathways of brain </v>

544
00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:05.880
<v Speaker 1>injury that lead to schizophrenia </v>
<v Speaker 1>symptoms.</v>

545
00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:09.150
<v Speaker 1>And there's likely not one form of manic</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressive disorder either.</v>

546
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.600
<v Speaker 1>If you think of the form is having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard causal pathway,</v>

547
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.673
<v Speaker 1>we know that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've done genetic studies on </v>

548
00:29:15.781 --> 00:29:16.614
<v Speaker 1>people who have manic depressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder in their family and you can </v>

549
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:20.814
<v Speaker 1>identify genes within a family that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be contributing to the </v>

550
00:29:23.071 --> 00:29:23.904
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that those genes </v>

551
00:29:25.591 --> 00:29:26.424
<v Speaker 1>don't seem to be.</v>

552
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.850
<v Speaker 1>So then you'll take another family group</v>
<v Speaker 1>with manic depressive disorder and it'll</v>

553
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:32.250
<v Speaker 1>be a different genetic combination that </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes that.</v>

554
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so part of the reason why it's difficult</v>

555
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:37.854
<v Speaker 1>to associate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the more biological mental </v>

556
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.200
<v Speaker 1>disorders with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with biology all the way down is because</v>

557
00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:47.620
<v Speaker 1>they're so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are other forms of mental</v>

558
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 1>disorder that don't seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured at all structural at all.</v>

559
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:52.870
<v Speaker 1>They seem to have more to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

560
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:54.820
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

561
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:55.654
<v Speaker 1>And that it's more like the contents of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your thought have a problem rather than </v>

562
00:29:58.661 --> 00:30:03.150
<v Speaker 1>the structures underlying your thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that distinction is,</v>

563
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 1>is difficult to make an a fine grained </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

564
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:05.974
<v Speaker 1>but you kind of get the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just because there's an error in </v>

565
00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:10.174
<v Speaker 1>your thinking doesn't mind really mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the underlying biology in some </v>

566
00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:14.350
<v Speaker 1>sense has been compromised.</v>

567
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.810
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated because if the air is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad enough,</v>

568
00:30:16.811 --> 00:30:18.880
<v Speaker 1>then it can compromise the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology,</v>

569
00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:19.714
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a conceptual distinction and part </v>

570
00:30:22.931 --> 00:30:23.764
<v Speaker 1>of the conceptual distinction is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is helpful if you're trying to think at </v>

571
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:27.874
<v Speaker 1>least in part about how you might cure </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because if you're thinking about a </v>

572
00:30:30.611 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 1>brain disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that</v>

573
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:38.320
<v Speaker 1>implies a different course of treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle than it does.</v>

574
00:30:38.321 --> 00:30:39.154
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking about a psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder where you might think about </v>

575
00:30:42.191 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 1>talking to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

576
00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:44.584
<v Speaker 1>in straightening out their thoughts or </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping them learn to behave in a </v>

577
00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:47.224
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was really Freud who started to </v>

578
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.670
<v Speaker 1>think that he was the first person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really pause it.</v>

579
00:30:54.671 --> 00:30:57.130
<v Speaker 1>And this is pretty interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly pause it.</v>

580
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:01.990
<v Speaker 1>That dialogue or conversation or </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking could be curative.</v>

581
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like to give him credit for.</v>

582
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.213
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be all of these helping </v>

583
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.760
<v Speaker 1>industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

584
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.070
<v Speaker 1>social work and psychology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological psychiatry and so far is that</v>

585
00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:18.490
<v Speaker 1>also involves communication and </v>
<v Speaker 1>counseling and all of these things.</v>

586
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.473
<v Speaker 1>Now that would have existed in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihood if Freud wouldn't have made </v>

587
00:31:23.621 --> 00:31:28.621
<v Speaker 1>the original hypothesis that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about communication that could</v>

588
00:31:29.501 --> 00:31:33.640
<v Speaker 1>be curative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Freud believed that</v>

589
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.420
<v Speaker 1>experiences that hadn't been now he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about experiences has repressed,</v>

590
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:43.420
<v Speaker 1>and this goes back to the videotape idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of memory.</v>

591
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.583
<v Speaker 1>So the idea would be that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>record of everything that's happened to </v>

592
00:31:46.811 --> 00:31:47.644
<v Speaker 1>you and the records actually accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then some of those things that </v>

593
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:52.420
<v Speaker 1>happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very,</v>

594
00:31:52.421 --> 00:31:56.200
<v Speaker 1>very shocking to you are very hurtful or</v>
<v Speaker 1>very depressing or very threatening.</v>

595
00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:01.470
<v Speaker 1>And so you've decided that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those have become repressed.</v>

596
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:03.573
<v Speaker 1>You're not paying any attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he has a complex mechanism to </v>

597
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:06.910
<v Speaker 1>account for that.</v>

598
00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:07.743
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think this is a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where his theory went badly wrong </v>

599
00:32:10.301 --> 00:32:11.134
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have a videotape </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory and it isn't obvious that the </v>

600
00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:15.844
<v Speaker 1>memories that you have of traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>events are fully fledged and causally </v>

601
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 1>appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just not paid attention to.</v>

602
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:25.203
<v Speaker 1>It's more like they're murky and unclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and of themselves and they contain </v>

603
00:32:29.381 --> 00:32:30.214
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that people so much </v>

604
00:32:31.751 --> 00:32:36.751
<v Speaker 1>repress as they do refuse to attend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>or are unable to attend to.</v>

605
00:32:37.871 --> 00:32:38.704
<v Speaker 1>So it's more like a passive avoidance </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a passive avoidance of something </v>

606
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:44.780
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be explored and gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>through rather than,</v>

607
00:32:44.781 --> 00:32:49.070
<v Speaker 1>it is something you know that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to look at that you are part of,</v>

608
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:49.904
<v Speaker 1>you has put away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a major weakness in </v>

609
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:55.910
<v Speaker 1>his theory and has led to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with the idea of repression per</v>

610
00:32:55.911 --> 00:32:56.150
<v Speaker 1>se.</v>

611
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:56.983
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was his idea that terrible things </v>

612
00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.980
<v Speaker 1>have happened to you and you or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of you doesn't want to,</v>

613
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.350
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know about,</v>

614
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.870
<v Speaker 1>to know about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they live this,</v>

615
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 1>those repressed experiences live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous life of their own too.</v>

616
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.840
<v Speaker 1>And here's an example of a trivial </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of how that might work.</v>

617
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you're at work and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>boss says something to you that disturbs</v>

618
00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:25.190
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it makes you question whether your</v>

619
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:27.380
<v Speaker 1>job is stable and so you're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset about that.</v>

620
00:33:27.381 --> 00:33:32.210
<v Speaker 1>But it's a casual offhand comment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go back to work and you just sort of</v>

621
00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:34.020
<v Speaker 1>forget that that even happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

622
00:33:34.021 --> 00:33:36.170
<v Speaker 1>we baby cause you're attending to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>

623
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:37.183
<v Speaker 1>but then you go home and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>crabby as as can possibly be and you go </v>

624
00:33:39.921 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 1>home and one of the people there says </v>
<v Speaker 1>something a little annoying and you snap</v>

625
00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:43.604
<v Speaker 1>at them.</v>

626
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:44.563
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's analogous to what Freud </v>

627
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:47.990
<v Speaker 1>would call a complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

628
00:33:47.991 --> 00:33:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Is that this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can imagine what's happened is</v>

629
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:51.764
<v Speaker 1>that the bosses words have brought up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole little subpersonality predicated </v>

630
00:33:55.821 --> 00:33:59.840
<v Speaker 1>on doubt up to the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who knows how deep that would be.</v>

631
00:33:59.841 --> 00:34:00.674
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens if I lose my job and if I </v>

632
00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:02.721
<v Speaker 1>lose my job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

633
00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:03.554
<v Speaker 1>what sort of person am I exactly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what about all these other times that </v>

634
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:07.274
<v Speaker 1>I've failed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you remember the other </v>

635
00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:10.770
<v Speaker 1>times that you failed and what am I </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do in the future?</v>

636
00:34:10.771 --> 00:34:11.604
<v Speaker 1>And so it's this whole cluster of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that surrounds that doubt and that's </v>

637
00:34:14.811 --> 00:34:16.730
<v Speaker 1>been activated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little part of you.</v>

638
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.833
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you're not attending to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you're busy doing some </v>

639
00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.680
<v Speaker 1>other work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you go home,</v>

640
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.290
<v Speaker 1>something triggers it and it like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>already there.</v>

641
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 1>It's already get way more upset than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>

642
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what a complex is,</v>

643
00:34:28.431 --> 00:34:31.190
<v Speaker 1>except in a much more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

644
00:34:31.191 --> 00:34:32.024
<v Speaker 1>Like a complex might be a whole series </v>
<v Speaker 1>of experiences that you've had that are </v>

645
00:34:37.281 --> 00:34:41.330
<v Speaker 1>united by some emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like threat that are,</v>

646
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.780
<v Speaker 1>haven't been transformed into a coherent</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

647
00:34:44.781 --> 00:34:47.240
<v Speaker 1>but that can rise out of the unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and possess you.</v>

648
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.343
<v Speaker 1>If you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of you guys have been a depressed </v>

649
00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:53.600
<v Speaker 1>at at least one point in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

650
00:34:53.601 --> 00:34:56.750
<v Speaker 1>it's actually very common for University</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto Students,</v>

651
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:02.270
<v Speaker 1>especially in their first year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about one in three if you,</v>

652
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:04.670
<v Speaker 1>if you have students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Beck depression inventory,</v>

653
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.713
<v Speaker 1>but one in three Touro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto students in our </v>

654
00:35:08.031 --> 00:35:11.300
<v Speaker 1>research of have hit criteria for </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitalization.</v>

655
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean the back is a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>oversensitive as far as I'm concerned,</v>

656
00:35:14.301 --> 00:35:15.134
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what it's like when you're </v>

657
00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:17.660
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's,</v>

658
00:35:17.661 --> 00:35:18.494
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a part of your personality sort of </v>

659
00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:23.150
<v Speaker 1>subsumes the whole and depression quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>classically is,</v>

660
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.253
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't think of anything good that </v>

661
00:35:24.921 --> 00:35:25.754
<v Speaker 1>happened to you in the past and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't think of any reason why the </v>

662
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:31.220
<v Speaker 1>present is good for anything and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn hopeless about the future.</v>

663
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.533
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a complex as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a complex that consists of </v>

664
00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:36.134
<v Speaker 1>nothing but negative emotion and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures your memory and your </v>

665
00:35:39.331 --> 00:35:42.570
<v Speaker 1>perception and your plans for the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>all at the same time.</v>

666
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:43.883
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud had a very lengthy list of ways </v>

667
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:53.520
<v Speaker 1>that people could be treacherous towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences they had that they wanted to</v>

668
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:54.354
<v Speaker 1>repress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he called them defense </v>

669
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:56.544
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how you fool yourself into </v>

670
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.053
<v Speaker 1>believing that you don't have to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>into account a certain set of negative </v>

671
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:05.190
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

672
00:36:05.191 --> 00:36:06.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

673
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 1>we'll go through the repression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

674
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:09.384
<v Speaker 1>well we talked about that denial well </v>
<v Speaker 1>that often denial's a very complicated </v>

675
00:36:13.801 --> 00:36:14.880
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

676
00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.040
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

677
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.630
<v Speaker 1>See if I can come up with a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

678
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

679
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.280
<v Speaker 1>What is a classic example for people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

680
00:36:25.281 --> 00:36:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called Anosognosia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly.</v>

681
00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:28.993
<v Speaker 1>It's neglect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a less technical way of thinking </v>

682
00:36:30.951 --> 00:36:31.784
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you have a right parietal </v>

683
00:36:32.661 --> 00:36:36.200
<v Speaker 1>damage from a stroke and you'll lose the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left side of your body,</v>

684
00:36:36.201 --> 00:36:38.840
<v Speaker 1>so you can't move it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a worse,</v>

685
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:39.703
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's there and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know that the left side of </v>

686
00:36:41.151 --> 00:36:44.150
<v Speaker 1>anything is there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows how that happens.</v>

687
00:36:44.151 --> 00:36:46.760
<v Speaker 1>But like you'll only eat half the food </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your plate,</v>

688
00:36:46.761 --> 00:36:47.594
<v Speaker 1>only on the right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if someone asked you to draw a </v>

689
00:36:49.551 --> 00:36:51.590
<v Speaker 1>clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll cram all the numbers into the one</v>

690
00:36:51.591 --> 00:36:52.424
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you kind of lose the idea of </v>

691
00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:56.090
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's sort of like,</v>

692
00:36:56.091 --> 00:36:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you know how when you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

693
00:36:57.771 --> 00:37:00.440
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see anything back here.</v>

694
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even God.</v>

695
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:08.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just simply not there at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you could imagine that sort of</v>

696
00:37:08.211 --> 00:37:12.470
<v Speaker 1>stretching around halfway at seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>something what neglect is like,</v>

697
00:37:12.471 --> 00:37:14.030
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

698
00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.600
<v Speaker 1>if you take someone with neglect </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to Robert Shaundra,</v>

699
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.250
<v Speaker 1>and then if you irrigate their ear with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold water,</v>

700
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:19.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

701
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:21.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the year on the opposite side,</v>

702
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:26.780
<v Speaker 1>then they'll kind of have a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>convulsion and then all of a sudden they</v>

703
00:37:26.781 --> 00:37:29.510
<v Speaker 1>become aware of their missing left hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

704
00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.670
<v Speaker 1>If you talk to them before you do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrigation,</v>

705
00:37:31.671 --> 00:37:32.504
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

706
00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with your left arm?</v>

707
00:37:34.131 --> 00:37:34.840
<v Speaker 1>And they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

708
00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

709
00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:38.120
<v Speaker 1>my arthritis is bothering me and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to move it.</v>

710
00:37:38.121 --> 00:37:42.200
<v Speaker 1>They come up with some something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds akin to denial,</v>

711
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you can snap them out of </v>

712
00:37:44.451 --> 00:37:45.284
<v Speaker 1>that with that irrigation and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a catastrophic emotional response </v>

713
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.470
<v Speaker 1>logically enough to the loss of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire left side.</v>

714
00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.813
<v Speaker 1>And Rama Shondra and reports that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lasting about 20 minutes and then </v>

715
00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:57.500
<v Speaker 1>they'll snap out of it and go right back</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the denial.</v>

716
00:37:58.070 --> 00:37:58.903
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes people deny things because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't update what's happened to </v>

717
00:38:03.201 --> 00:38:06.980
<v Speaker 1>them is so overwhelming that they cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>construct a new model.</v>

718
00:38:06.981 --> 00:38:10.220
<v Speaker 1>They just rely on the old one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see this,</v>

719
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.540
<v Speaker 1>well imagine first that you've just had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a tooth pulled and you know how many,</v>

720
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:17.720
<v Speaker 1>how long your tongue takes to remap the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of your mouth.</v>

721
00:38:17.721 --> 00:38:21.590
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to come up with a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of you if something catastrophic</v>

722
00:38:21.591 --> 00:38:24.710
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes the denial is just that</v>

723
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.233
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that has happened is so </v>

724
00:38:26.991 --> 00:38:29.030
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming that the person can't model</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

725
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.030
<v Speaker 1>But then maybe also they refuse to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

726
00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.620
<v Speaker 1>And you see this emerging in lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

727
00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people develop diabetes for example,</v>

728
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:40.234
<v Speaker 1>they're often not very good at taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>their medication or regulating their </v>

729
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:43.090
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

730
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:43.781
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

731
00:38:43.781 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 1>they're denying the existence of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

732
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.300
<v Speaker 1>And to some degree they're probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that because who the hell wants to</v>

733
00:38:49.301 --> 00:38:51.970
<v Speaker 1>think that they're diabetic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even worse than that,</v>

734
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's complicated to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetic.</v>

735
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:56.440
<v Speaker 1>You're no longer the same person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were.</v>

736
00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:00.400
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to learn a whole bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of new ways to be this new person,</v>

737
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:01.840
<v Speaker 1>what to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when to eat,</v>

738
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.123
<v Speaker 1>how to check your blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be careful whenever you go </v>

739
00:39:04.871 --> 00:39:05.410
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neat.</v>

740
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.243
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a hundred new things a day that </v>

741
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:09.424
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so separating denial from inability </v>

742
00:39:12.071 --> 00:39:12.904
<v Speaker 1>as a hard one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also understand that people </v>

743
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:16.690
<v Speaker 1>might deny no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not happening.</v>

744
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:17.940
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

745
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to admit to that reaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>formation.</v>

746
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one.</v>

747
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you hate your sister and maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have your reasons,</v>

748
00:39:25.091 --> 00:39:26.590
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't hate your sister.</v>

749
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.640
<v Speaker 1>So what you do is act as if you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really liked her.</v>

750
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:33.220
<v Speaker 1>That's an overcompensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another form of,</v>

751
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.020
<v Speaker 1>of defense mechanism displacement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My boss yells at me,</v>

752
00:39:38.021 --> 00:39:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I yell at my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my husband yells at the baby,</v>

753
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.373
<v Speaker 1>the baby bites the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they're not really dealing with </v>

754
00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:45.280
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the boss,</v>

755
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:49.570
<v Speaker 1>it's just pushed on down the road and </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification.</v>

756
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.753
<v Speaker 1>You're bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead of coming to terms with the </v>

757
00:39:52.871 --> 00:39:56.170
<v Speaker 1>fact that bullying occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start bullying other people.</v>

758
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalization.</v>

759
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what that means already.</v>

760
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:03.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't do your homework,</v>

761
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:04.683
<v Speaker 1>you're procrastinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you can come up with 15 </v>

762
00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:07.624
<v Speaker 1>rationalizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem for why it's actually not </v>

763
00:40:10.121 --> 00:40:14.290
<v Speaker 1>necessary for you to do your homework </v>
<v Speaker 1>right then intellectual ization.</v>

764
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Well Woody Allen's movies are about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

765
00:40:16.631 --> 00:40:19.180
<v Speaker 1>He's got all these neurotic problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's smart.</v>

766
00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:23.410
<v Speaker 1>And so he can come up with intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why he's so messed up,</v>

767
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.370
<v Speaker 1>even though he knows he's messed up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't help sublimation.</v>

768
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.773
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things that Freud </v>

769
00:40:30.881 --> 00:40:32.920
<v Speaker 1>thought characterized art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

770
00:40:32.921 --> 00:40:33.754
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of erotic content in art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're having trouble </v>

771
00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:37.564
<v Speaker 1>establishing a relationship or if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have a relationship with many </v>

772
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:40.564
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe what you do is sculpt nudes </v>

773
00:40:42.281 --> 00:40:44.620
<v Speaker 1>or paint them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's projection,</v>

774
00:40:44.621 --> 00:40:46.130
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

775
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:47.223
<v Speaker 1>I'm having an argument with you and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>unwilling to admit to my mo my dark </v>

776
00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:53.260
<v Speaker 1>motivations and I'm very skeptical of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

777
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:57.340
<v Speaker 1>And so I assume that your characterized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by all the dark motivations that I won't</v>

778
00:40:57.341 --> 00:40:59.470
<v Speaker 1>admit to in myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

779
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:03.693
<v Speaker 1>now Freud also believed that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious ideas that were at the core </v>

780
00:41:06.581 --> 00:41:07.414
<v Speaker 1>of psychological conflicts and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>described those conflicts as </v>

781
00:41:10.091 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible distress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic symptoms.</v>

782
00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And so those would be the manifestation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychological,</v>

783
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.840
<v Speaker 1>of the manifestation of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>content in bodily form.</v>

784
00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:23.773
<v Speaker 1>So that might be stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stress related illness might be one </v>

785
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:26.524
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had clients who had hysterical </v>

786
00:41:29.381 --> 00:41:31.390
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was quite interesting.</v>

787
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:32.224
<v Speaker 1>So that was a somatic of a psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem back when Freud was practicing </v>

788
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.383
<v Speaker 1>hysteria was much more common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that was partly cause </v>

789
00:41:43.611 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Victorian society was so centered on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater and so dramatic and people would</v>

790
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 1>come in with like a paralyzed arm or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

791
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.673
<v Speaker 1>that he could sort out with hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they were manifesting their </v>

792
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.143
<v Speaker 1>psychological distress in bodily form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often in a manner that was </v>

793
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 1>representative of that psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict in some way.</v>

794
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Behavioral anomalies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hallucinations and delusions.</v>

795
00:42:08.601 --> 00:42:09.434
<v Speaker 1>He thought that all of those could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of inner internal </v>

796
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:17.780
<v Speaker 1>psychological conflict with their sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>of unconscious ideas.</v>

797
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:19.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.550
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the boss example.</v>

799
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Your boss says something nasty to you.</v>

800
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:25.853
<v Speaker 1>Come home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone says something a bit provoking </v>

801
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:28.904
<v Speaker 1>and you fly off the handle and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an argument about what the hell is </v>

802
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:34.070
<v Speaker 1>up with you because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look what I said was,</v>

803
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.470
<v Speaker 1>you know this big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you reacted like this.</v>

804
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:37.520
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

805
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:38.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

806
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:42.500
<v Speaker 1>you're always annoying like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And which is kind of a denial thing.</v>

807
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the person doesn't let up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

808
00:42:45.051 --> 00:42:45.411
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

809
00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I really know that something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do like six other things to keep</v>

810
00:42:48.321 --> 00:42:51.110
<v Speaker 1>them the hell away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally they're persistent enough.</v>

811
00:42:51.111 --> 00:42:53.090
<v Speaker 1>So you break down crying and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

812
00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:53.924
<v Speaker 1>I had this terrible day at work and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even really notice that you knew </v>

813
00:42:57.321 --> 00:43:00.500
<v Speaker 1>that until the moment of the moment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tiers.</v>

814
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.350
<v Speaker 1>And you see that very frequently in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy to,</v>

815
00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

816
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:07.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're relating a story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

817
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:08.603
<v Speaker 1>their marriage that collapsed badly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking and all of a sudden </v>

818
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.720
<v Speaker 1>they'll say something and they'll tear </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and then they'll continue.</v>

819
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.370
<v Speaker 1>And you can grab that and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

820
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:17.413
<v Speaker 1>you just said something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that your eyes filled with </v>

821
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:22.700
<v Speaker 1>tears when you said that what was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your mind.</v>

822
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Now often they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

823
00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.750
<v Speaker 1>unless you catch it quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll forget.</v>

824
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.220
<v Speaker 1>So they're talking and they'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the talking about the past is,</v>

825
00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flashing off images,</v>

826
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:35.000
<v Speaker 1>stick memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll say,</v>

827
00:43:35.001 --> 00:43:36.680
<v Speaker 1>well that made you cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

828
00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:37.563
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they often don't like that because for </v>

829
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:42.920
<v Speaker 1>obvious reasons that something's come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't want to talk about.</v>

830
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.480
<v Speaker 1>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

831
00:43:44.481 --> 00:43:45.314
<v Speaker 1>what was flashing through your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the personal tell you like quite a </v>

832
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:48.434
<v Speaker 1>lengthy little memory fantasy about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of events that you know is </v>

833
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:53.663
<v Speaker 1>still a hot button issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another example of this </v>

834
00:43:57.441 --> 00:43:59.060
<v Speaker 1>underlying complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

835
00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.193
<v Speaker 1>and if you watch people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch people in normal </v>

836
00:44:02.241 --> 00:44:03.730
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happens all the times.</v>

837
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Their eyes will move or they'll smile or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see as they're speaking that all</v>

838
00:44:08.391 --> 00:44:10.580
<v Speaker 1>sorts of different ideas are flooding </v>
<v Speaker 1>through their head.</v>

839
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:14.540
<v Speaker 1>It's dreamlike in a sense too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of as if the person is talking</v>

840
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:18.950
<v Speaker 1>and they're dreaming out the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this image laden set of memories</v>

841
00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:21.860
<v Speaker 1>that's going on at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can be quite broad,</v>

842
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.740
<v Speaker 1>far broader than they could encapsulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the words.</v>

843
00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.160
<v Speaker 1>And so you can catch that and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really listening to someone,</v>

844
00:44:28.161 --> 00:44:28.994
<v Speaker 1>really paying attention to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see when they're doubtful or </v>

845
00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:33.690
<v Speaker 1>when they pause for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another one.</v>

846
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:34.973
<v Speaker 1>You know that something's come up that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's occupying their mind and </v>

847
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:40.380
<v Speaker 1>interfering with the flow of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

848
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Freud was very good at listening in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

849
00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Well that happens with jokes too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

850
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.553
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was showing you guys the lion </v>

851
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:52.224
<v Speaker 1>king stills the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I showed you that picture of Nella </v>

852
00:44:55.111 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 1>laying on her back with that peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression on her face.</v>

853
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Everybody immediately laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Freud would have considered that</v>

854
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:06.750
<v Speaker 1>an entry point into the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there a reason you were laughing</v>

855
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:07.584
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes along with it well would have </v>

856
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:11.250
<v Speaker 1>gotten along with a sexual complex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that situation.</v>

857
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 1>And everybody recognizes it instantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they laugh about it.</v>

858
00:45:14.671 --> 00:45:18.330
<v Speaker 1>And comedians are really good at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they're good comedians,</v>

859
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.970
<v Speaker 1>they say what everyone's thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no one will say,</v>

860
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's a relief to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

861
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

862
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:25.674
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

863
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Canadian comedian.</v>

864
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So always making racial jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

865
00:45:32.131 --> 00:45:33.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Canadian.</v>

866
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell.</v>

867
00:45:34.501 --> 00:45:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Russell Peters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

868
00:45:35.491 --> 00:45:37.080
<v Speaker 1>he's a great example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

869
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.093
<v Speaker 1>he feels the whole stadium with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all different ethnicities and every </v>

870
00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:41.934
<v Speaker 1>single one of them is dying to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulted because of their racial </v>

871
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:45.270
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

872
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a relief to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had salts,</v>

873
00:45:47.521 --> 00:45:49.800
<v Speaker 1>the herbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he insults the Jews and then he</v>

874
00:45:49.801 --> 00:45:51.280
<v Speaker 1>insults the Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's going,</v>

875
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad.</v>

876
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Finally someone said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

877
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:55.284
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's speaking to part of their </v>

878
00:45:56.791 --> 00:45:57.624
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and it's the part that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually uncomfortable with all of that </v>

879
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.470
<v Speaker 1>kind of discussion being repressed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>staying below the surface.</v>

880
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:05.304
<v Speaker 1>It's way too weighty for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So jokes express in playful language </v>

881
00:46:09.361 --> 00:46:10.194
<v Speaker 1>would culture will not formally express.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know too that when the culture </v>

882
00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:16.170
<v Speaker 1>starts going after the comedians that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are not good.</v>

883
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:17.223
<v Speaker 1>So you should leave the damn comedians </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone because there are the people that </v>

884
00:46:19.531 --> 00:46:21.690
<v Speaker 1>can tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you start to get annoyed at them,</v>

885
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:23.940
<v Speaker 1>then that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

886
00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:31.180
<v Speaker 1>so Freud was also extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in dreams.</v>

887
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Poor Freud who are just not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to cover them in enough detail.</v>

888
00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

889
00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:41.763
<v Speaker 1>how will we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I should tell you about the </v>

890
00:46:43.361 --> 00:46:44.194
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

891
00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Freud wrote a book called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of dreams.</v>

892
00:46:48.971 --> 00:46:51.850
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the first person I would say,</v>

893
00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:55.030
<v Speaker 1>who subjected dreams to a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive analysis.</v>

894
00:46:55.031 --> 00:46:55.864
<v Speaker 1>And he used them to investigate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place of complexes in his </v>

895
00:47:01.541 --> 00:47:02.374
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic practice so his </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients would recount their dreams to </v>

896
00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:05.643
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he believed that dreams always </v>

897
00:47:06.881 --> 00:47:07.714
<v Speaker 1>expressed an unconscious wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was tied into his theory of </v>

898
00:47:10.811 --> 00:47:12.490
<v Speaker 1>repression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

899
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:15.130
<v Speaker 1>if you are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sexually repressed,</v>

900
00:47:15.131 --> 00:47:15.964
<v Speaker 1>which was very common at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd have dreams with sexual </v>

901
00:47:18.881 --> 00:47:22.480
<v Speaker 1>content that we're expressing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

902
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.380
<v Speaker 1>expressing the undesirable fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

903
00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:29.050
<v Speaker 1>And by analyzing the dream you could get</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to,</v>

904
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 1>you could get down to what was being </v>
<v Speaker 1>repressed.</v>

905
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:33.243
<v Speaker 1>Now Freud believed that the dream more </v>
<v Speaker 1>or less tied itself in knots trying to </v>

906
00:47:37.991 --> 00:47:38.824
<v Speaker 1>hide its content in some sense and young</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed instead that the dream was </v>

907
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:43.990
<v Speaker 1>actually trying to be as clear as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>

908
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.823
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the semantic memory </v>

909
00:47:47.351 --> 00:47:48.184
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

910
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.680
<v Speaker 1>it was more like a feeler out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

911
00:47:50.681 --> 00:47:53.740
<v Speaker 1>It was trying to represent things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly as it could.</v>

912
00:47:53.741 --> 00:47:54.574
<v Speaker 1>And so it's use of symbols and that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing wasn't so much to hide the </v>

913
00:47:58.061 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 1>actual unpleasant content from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreamer,</v>

914
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.480
<v Speaker 1>but to express it in the only language </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the dream could use.</v>

915
00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.040
<v Speaker 1>And so Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

916
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.200
<v Speaker 1>also believed that some of that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

917
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.823
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

918
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:10.683
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So since it's two o'clock so we'll see </v>

919
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:16.120
<v Speaker 1>you on Tuesday.</v>
