1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 2>So today I'm talking to two of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>compatriots I suppose,</v>

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.233
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this ongoing discussion in Canada </v>

4
00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 2>free speech issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including compelled speech.</v>

6
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:17.834
<v Speaker 2>And I met Jared Brown and Bruce Party </v>
<v Speaker 2>jareds a practicing lawyer and Bruce is </v>

7
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:29.420
<v Speaker 2>a professor at Queen's University in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>law school there.</v>

8
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:30.254
<v Speaker 2>And I met them both when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we manifested a mutual interest </v>

9
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 2>last year and bill see 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we all regarded as,</v>

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.853
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece of legislation that was </v>

11
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 2>infringing on the rights to free speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Canadian individuals in a manner that</v>

12
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:49.850
<v Speaker 2>hadn't been ever attempted before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 2>and more recently the Law Society of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Upper Canada,</v>

14
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.953
<v Speaker 2>soon to be known as the Law Society of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ontario has put forward a requirement </v>

15
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 2>for all of its members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of the lawyers in Ontario,</v>

16
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to produce a document,</v>

17
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.630
<v Speaker 2>a principle that we all have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

18
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:14.900
<v Speaker 2>the three of us have been talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we regard as a another,</v>

19
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Speaker 2>but far more egregious example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>compelled speech.</v>

20
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.403
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to let jared introduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself and say a little bit about who </v>

21
00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:22.244
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He testified with me at the Canadian </v>

22
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Senate last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Party also testified at the Senate</v>

23
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:28.274
<v Speaker 2>on Bill See 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Bruce was also the lawyer that I </v>

24
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:31.694
<v Speaker 2>debated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He played devil's advocate at Queen's </v>

25
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:36.140
<v Speaker 2>university at some of you watching this </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be familiar with that video.</v>

26
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:38.360
<v Speaker 2>So jared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you introduce yourself.</v>

27
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 2>And then Bruce and then Bruce Bruce </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently wrote a column for the,</v>

28
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 2>now she'll post on this new requirement </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the law society.</v>

29
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 2>And so we're going to let him begin the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion proper onto you.</v>

30
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:51.164
<v Speaker 2>Jared.</v>

31
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm a an everyday litigator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a commercial litigator in Toronto.</v>

32
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been practicing for about 15 years,</v>

33
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.093
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing increasingly more and more human </v>

34
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 3>rights tribunal work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

35
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

36
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.220
<v Speaker 3>and obviously stepped into the breach on</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

37
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 3>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

38
00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:10.634
<v Speaker 3>I may have been the only practicing </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyer that actually spoke out against </v>

39
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 3>the legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

40
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 3>there were certainly a lot of lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a including the Canadian bar association</v>

41
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 3>that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

42
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.960
<v Speaker 3>arraigned in favor of the legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as far as I can tell,</v>

43
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boots on the ground,</v>

44
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I think I was the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

45
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 3>so I've got a pretty benign practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

46
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly if a</v>

47
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 2>taking up the fight if you will.</v>

48
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.663
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.793
<v Speaker 2>Bruce.</v>

50
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.340
<v Speaker 4>Thanks Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.203
<v Speaker 4>well this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this issue arose for me a couple of </v>

52
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.583
<v Speaker 4>weeks ago when I received an email from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the law society and all lawyers get </v>

53
00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 4>these emails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

54
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.343
<v Speaker 4>to do various things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this was different because it </v>

55
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:54.760
<v Speaker 4>announced a new requirement for this </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

56
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.483
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jared I think was aware of this </v>

57
00:02:58.031 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 4>developing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

58
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.380
<v Speaker 4>before I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

59
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 4>but like many other lawyers in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>province,</v>

60
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:03.720
<v Speaker 4>this is supposed to the first indication</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

61
00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:04.554
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this new requirement existed and </v>

62
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 4>essentially email said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

63
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.173
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that said amongst </v>
<v Speaker 4>others was that every licensed lawyer </v>

64
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:15.664
<v Speaker 4>now is required to draft and submit what</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are calling a statement of </v>

65
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 4>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that statement is,</v>

66
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

67
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.900
<v Speaker 4>required to express your agreement and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the value you place on inclusion,</v>

68
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.773
<v Speaker 4>diversity and equality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the fact that you will actively </v>

69
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:43.231
<v Speaker 4>promote those values.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's me just sprung off the screen</v>

70
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

71
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.660
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

72
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 4>an outrageous example of forced speech </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

73
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 4>the same kind that we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>under [inaudible] 16.</v>

74
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but worse,</v>

75
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one actually requires you to make a</v>

76
00:03:59.051 --> 00:03:59.884
<v Speaker 4>full fledged statement that will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>subject to their approval in order to </v>

77
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 4>maintain your license.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

78
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 4>this is not a matter of it being </v>
<v Speaker 4>suggested to you that you might ought to</v>

79
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.003
<v Speaker 4>want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a condition of your ability to </v>

80
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 4>practice law in the province of Ontario.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

81
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this district,</v>

82
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 4>me as a matter that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

83
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 4>needed to be aired publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I needed to be discussed amongst lawyers</v>

84
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 4>in the province because this is a slow </v>
<v Speaker 4>march to a dark place,</v>

85
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where it all began.</v>

86
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

87
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:41.010
<v Speaker 2>it was concerning to me when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>encountered this.</v>

88
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.203
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the member of a college as well at </v>

89
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:44.424
<v Speaker 2>college of psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my sense of this is that if the </v>

90
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:49.590
<v Speaker 2>lawyers full and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

91
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.543
<v Speaker 2>and go along with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that this will be </v>

92
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:57.390
<v Speaker 2>required of every professional in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ontario and then very rapidly,</v>

93
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:02.391
<v Speaker 2>every profession in Canada is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>high because if some lawyers who are,</v>

94
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively disagreeable bunch and who </v>

95
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:06.234
<v Speaker 2>are very familiar with the law and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>common law in general are willing to </v>

96
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:13.860
<v Speaker 2>have their political beliefs dictated to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them by their college,</v>

97
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.723
<v Speaker 2>then the probability that the rest of us</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be able to withstand that I think </v>

98
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 2>is extremely low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a strong,</v>

99
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.700
<v Speaker 2>a strong independent bar is always </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to</v>

100
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.613
<v Speaker 3>be the defense or at least one line of </v>
<v Speaker 3>defense against tyranny or against </v>

101
00:05:26.841 --> 00:05:28.340
<v Speaker 3>government overreach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

102
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:29.870
<v Speaker 3>and by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

103
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:33.740
<v Speaker 3>having the lawyers under the guise of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their regulatory body,</v>

104
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being compelled to speak or,</v>

105
00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:39.140
<v Speaker 3>or share opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

106
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.110
<v Speaker 3>it's obviously something scary and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's something that lawyers should</v>

107
00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:45.530
<v Speaker 3>wake up to and they need to push back </v>
<v Speaker 3>against compelled speech,</v>

108
00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:48.090
<v Speaker 3>which was obviously the issue on see 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

109
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 3>is a particularly nefarious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

110
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.090
<v Speaker 3>infringement and intrusion.</v>

111
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's,</v>

112
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's one thing to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictions on what people say.</v>

113
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know you can't incite someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>to crime for example.</v>

114
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a completely different thing to</v>

115
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 2>require people to espouse a particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>political stance,</v>

116
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 2>especially when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

117
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.813
<v Speaker 2>when it's being reviewed by what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially an arbitrary committee and </v>

118
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>when the punishment is so as draconian </v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

119
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.123
<v Speaker 2>as potentially losing your right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice and that that's enforced as a </v>

120
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:23.924
<v Speaker 2>mandatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the first step was to make that </v>

121
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 2>mandatory rather than as a suggestion.</v>

122
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 4>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just emphasize this point that the</v>

123
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 4>distinction between restrictions on </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech,</v>

124
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.553
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are not with things and are </v>

125
00:06:38.971 --> 00:06:39.804
<v Speaker 4>debatable and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is a different category of </v>

126
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is compelled speech.</v>

127
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 4>This is a requirement that makes you say</v>
<v Speaker 4>something you may not agree with.</v>

128
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.703
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned it'll be at the column I </v>

129
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.843
<v Speaker 4>statements from the Supreme Court of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada and maybe I'll just read out one </v>

130
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 4>of those gyms too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to make the point.</v>

131
00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 4>Because even if the court has said </v>
<v Speaker 4>explicitly that,</v>

132
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this is,</v>

133
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 4>this is not on in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a free society,</v>

134
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 4>you're hear the words of the Supreme </v>
<v Speaker 4>Court,</v>

135
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forcing someone to express opinions that</v>

136
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:15.410
<v Speaker 4>they do not have is to tell Alterian and</v>
<v Speaker 4>as such,</v>

137
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 4>alien to the tradition of free nations </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Canada,</v>

138
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 4>even for the repression of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>serious crimes,</v>

139
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 4>which of course is not in Preston here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

140
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.853
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was cool.</v>

141
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 3>Sorry Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

142
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.840
<v Speaker 3>that was the cornerstone of not only the</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion piece that I,</v>

143
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.090
<v Speaker 3>I put up on my website about </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

144
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 3>but also in the cornerstone of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>presentation that was made to the Senate</v>

145
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:41.921
<v Speaker 3>is that this is a particularly egregious</v>
<v Speaker 3>infringement on freedom of expression.</v>

146
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.213
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're having to mouth opinions and </v>

147
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 3>ideas that may not be your own and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government is forcing you to do it.</v>

148
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 3>And then obviously in this incidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you've got your regulatory body,</v>

149
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

150
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.770
<v Speaker 3>which holds your license,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

151
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:55.703
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your ability to carry on the </v>

152
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 3>livelihood in the chosen profession that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in.</v>

153
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you that you've got to start</v>
<v Speaker 3>voicing these opinions.</v>

154
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:03.941
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jared,</v>

155
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:06.910
<v Speaker 2>when we talked before too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you pointed out,</v>

156
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:08.890
<v Speaker 2>and Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had commented on this as well,</v>

157
00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:10.050
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.183
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Law Society Administration </v>

159
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.623
<v Speaker 2>theoretically did some background work </v>
<v Speaker 2>before deciding that this was a </v>

160
00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:17.284
<v Speaker 2>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they produced a report essentially </v>

161
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.950
<v Speaker 2>proclaiming that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

162
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.143
<v Speaker 2>the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are practicing law in </v>

163
00:08:26.501 --> 00:08:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Ontario are essentially racist in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>orientation,</v>

164
00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:35.311
<v Speaker 2>which is why this is racist and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 2>misogynist as well,</v>

165
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.920
<v Speaker 2>which is why this piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrative,</v>

166
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.280
<v Speaker 2>let's call it law or requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has come into practice.</v>

167
00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:46.300
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't obvious that their own data</v>
<v Speaker 2>support that conclusion.</v>

168
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:47.134
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can easily read what they wrote as </v>

169
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.480
<v Speaker 2>pretty providing pretty compelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that the legal profession,</v>

170
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 2>the demographics of the legal profession</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what that's worth,</v>

171
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 2>you are transforming quite rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

172
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that concerned me as well from</v>

173
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:03.894
<v Speaker 2>a psychological perspective about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing is that lawyers who agree </v>

174
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:08.664
<v Speaker 2>to participate in this process are </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically admitting their racism and </v>

175
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 2>misogyny on a conscious and unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis and thereby convicting themselves.</v>

176
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're guilty to begin with.</v>

177
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:20.334
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't have an opportunity to </v>

178
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 2>prove their innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by,</v>

179
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.383
<v Speaker 2>by going along with these requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're basically admitting through </v>

180
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:28.494
<v Speaker 2>their action that the accusations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are being thrown at them both </v>

181
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:32.964
<v Speaker 2>individually and as a collective are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not only accurate but require </v>

182
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:38.370
<v Speaker 2>immediate remediation.</v>

183
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.191
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

184
00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

185
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.163
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rec or the requirement that's a </v>

186
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.790
<v Speaker 3>being rolled out right now as the result</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

187
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.683
<v Speaker 3>I think it's about a 58 page report that</v>
<v Speaker 3>had 13 recommendations that were passed </v>

188
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.424
<v Speaker 3>by convocation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the governing body of the law </v>

189
00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:57.050
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the report itself,</v>

190
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.173
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was entitled strategies to address </v>

191
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.570
<v Speaker 3>issues of systemic racism in the legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>professions.</v>

192
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that statement on its own is saying that</v>

193
00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:06.644
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our industry as well as the Law Society </v>

194
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.360
<v Speaker 3>Organization itself is systemically </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

195
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.250
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and clearly that's a to me,</v>

196
00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:15.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

197
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.270
<v Speaker 3>a very bold statement and one that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

198
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>requires some level of scrutiny.</v>

199
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

200
00:10:22.281 --> 00:10:23.114
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the group that came up with this report </v>

201
00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:27.080
<v Speaker 3>is an esteemed group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are all highly respected,</v>

202
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well accomplished individuals.</v>

203
00:10:29.121 --> 00:10:30.140
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

204
00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:30.974
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a body of data that they've </v>

205
00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:34.340
<v Speaker 3>produced as well as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

206
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.563
<v Speaker 3>some qualitative anecdotal stories as to</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the issues that are being faced </v>

207
00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:40.040
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

208
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.930
<v Speaker 3>by what they call racialized licensees.</v>

209
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.183
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the data is something that a lot of </v>

210
00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:45.404
<v Speaker 3>people aren't going to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do encourage people to look at it </v>

211
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:48.164
<v Speaker 3>and see what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the basis on that finding that </v>

212
00:10:50.121 --> 00:10:53.360
<v Speaker 3>we're a systemically racist industry </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

213
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.450
<v Speaker 3>and obviously profession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

214
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.710
<v Speaker 3>I encourage people to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

215
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.900
<v Speaker 3>study the report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can assure you that most,</v>

216
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.540
<v Speaker 3>most lawyers won't 58 pages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

217
00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:04.040
<v Speaker 3>something that happened back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>December.</v>

218
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:04.761
<v Speaker 3>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

219
00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:06.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of shocking,</v>

220
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.603
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information in there and there's a </v>

221
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.250
<v Speaker 3>obviously some shocking findings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

222
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:11.361
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

223
00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:11.950
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

224
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:12.783
<v Speaker 3>it's got me concerned because my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my industry has now been deemed racist </v>

225
00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:17.600
<v Speaker 3>by the body that governs it.</v>

226
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:18.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

227
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:19.594
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's really </v>

228
00:11:20.711 --> 00:11:21.544
<v Speaker 2>appalling about that and I think and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also about the requirements for the </v>

229
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 2>statement of principles is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pronounced ideological bent to them.</v>

230
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the first is the idea of systemic </v>

231
00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:39.430
<v Speaker 2>racism because the way that you prove </v>
<v Speaker 2>systemic racism is,</v>

232
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.630
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

233
00:11:40.631 --> 00:11:41.464
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say call it questionable </v>

234
00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.493
<v Speaker 2>methodologically to say the least </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the basic concept is that you </v>

235
00:11:47.891 --> 00:11:52.891
<v Speaker 2>divide the population up by racial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnic and sex based identification,</v>

236
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 2>which you can do in a very large number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ways by the way.</v>

237
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 2>And then you compare any organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

238
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 2>to that population based division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if the,</v>

239
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.903
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

240
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
<v Speaker 2>ratio of individuals categorized in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>general population isn't the same as the</v>

241
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:13.894
<v Speaker 2>ratio of individuals in that profession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can automatically make a case </v>

242
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:19.090
<v Speaker 2>for systemic racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very,</v>

243
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 2>very weak methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No credible scientist would regard that.</v>

244
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 2>And I would regard that as proof of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

245
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 2>And worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine that any,</v>

246
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.950
<v Speaker 2>any claim like that would stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>something resembling a court of law if,</v>

247
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:34.803
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was possible to take a group to </v>

248
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:37.294
<v Speaker 2>court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's all sorts of reasons why </v>

249
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 2>there might be differential </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation in a group</v>

250
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:42.523
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that is assuming that that's what </v>

251
00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:44.524
<v Speaker 4>the data shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in many respects that's actually </v>

252
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.113
<v Speaker 4>what this data shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I take your point about the </v>

253
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Speaker 4>methodology but but even so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you like set that methodology,</v>

254
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:59.690
<v Speaker 4>it's not crystal clear that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the numbers actually suggestion.</v>

255
00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 4>Can I get back for a moment to your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to your implication point,</v>

256
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.113
<v Speaker 4>I mean I agree that the requirements to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make this statement in this context </v>

257
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:09.783
<v Speaker 4>essentially put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be interpreted as though you were </v>

258
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.143
<v Speaker 4>required to make a confession about what</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is you've done wrongly in the past </v>

259
00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 4>and what it is you will do now in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>present to correct it as an individual.</v>

260
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.343
<v Speaker 4>And there is also the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the the trouble that once you have </v>

261
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 4>written a statement so as to come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>comply with the requirement,</v>

262
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.513
<v Speaker 4>then you have on the record a statement </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what it is that you believe and </v>

263
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 4>thereafter your future actions can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>compared to that statement.</v>

264
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.423
<v Speaker 4>So as to show that you are not acting in</v>
<v Speaker 4>co in compliance with what you have set </v>

265
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 4>you believe or that on one occasion or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other,</v>

266
00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:49.630
<v Speaker 4>you haven't been telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So some,</v>

267
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.770
<v Speaker 4>some I've heard some lawyers say in </v>
<v Speaker 4>response to this requirement that,</v>

268
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.930
<v Speaker 4>oh well this is not a big deal because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just going to write the statement.</v>

269
00:13:55.931 --> 00:13:56.764
<v Speaker 4>They'll put it in a file,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll sit in some corner of the law </v>

270
00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:00.220
<v Speaker 4>society computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

271
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 4>and who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who cares,</v>

272
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 4>it's no big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it actually,</v>

273
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:04.594
<v Speaker 4>it is a very big deal because they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>hurting you towards both a certain way </v>

274
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:13.000
<v Speaker 4>to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain way to express yourself and I,</v>

275
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:17.110
<v Speaker 4>and a certain restriction on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior and your expression in terms of</v>

276
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.200
<v Speaker 4>how you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

277
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.043
<v Speaker 4>what you say you believe in the future </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this kind of law and all kinds of </v>

278
00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:24.244
<v Speaker 4>other loans,</v>

279
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.710
<v Speaker 3>but also your subs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're subscribing to this idea that the</v>

280
00:14:27.711 --> 00:14:30.080
<v Speaker 3>system is racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

281
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.470
<v Speaker 3>that the industry and the profession </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves are racist.</v>

282
00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:36.680
<v Speaker 3>And that to me that implies hopelessly </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt.</v>

283
00:14:36.681 --> 00:14:39.160
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that shocks me and I don't think I,</v>

284
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:41.300
<v Speaker 3>I want my industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

285
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.420
<v Speaker 3>advertising that unless of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

286
00:14:44.421 --> 00:14:45.254
<v Speaker 3>we've got an issue here and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not entirely clear to me from </v>

287
00:14:48.381 --> 00:14:50.510
<v Speaker 3>reading the report that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

288
00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan May have some comments</v>

289
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.113
<v Speaker 2>obviously about writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing a statement and the declaration </v>

290
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 2>and what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just find that,</v>

291
00:14:57.591 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to affirm in a statement that,</v>

292
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:01.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our industry is,</v>

293
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.810
<v Speaker 2>is hopelessly corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

294
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:03.644
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not something I'm willing to do at </v>

295
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:06.254
<v Speaker 2>this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I've learned after </v>

296
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.013
<v Speaker 2>over the last year is that apologizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>or admitting guilt to ideologues is an </v>

297
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably dangerous thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>because all it's taken as,</v>

298
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 2>as Bruce Basically alluded to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a statement of guilt.</v>

299
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.633
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other problem from a psychological </v>

300
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:26.270
<v Speaker 2>perspective is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>

301
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:29.180
<v Speaker 2>this is a very clear psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature on this.</v>

302
00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

303
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 2>if you have a particular set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical positions,</v>

304
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Speaker 2>let's say principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call them,</v>

305
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.140
<v Speaker 2>and maybe your principles or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like excellence,</v>

306
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:39.974
<v Speaker 2>meritocracy and honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which strike me as a better set of </v>

307
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:46.580
<v Speaker 2>principles for lawyers than diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equity and inclusiveness.</v>

308
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Not that those aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

309
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:51.470
<v Speaker 2>in in certain context and carefully </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined.</v>

310
00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Also important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

311
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.373
<v Speaker 2>if you write a statement of principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially one that's going to have to </v>

312
00:15:57.201 --> 00:15:58.034
<v Speaker 2>pass muster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what will happen is you will bring </v>

313
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 2>your beliefs and your actions in line </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that statement of principle.</v>

314
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.120
<v Speaker 2>You'll do that unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a bunch of reasons for that.</v>

315
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:08.954
<v Speaker 2>And one reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you've now made a coherent and </v>

316
00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:15.290
<v Speaker 2>credible argument in favor of that set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of principles.</v>

317
00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:16.124
<v Speaker 2>And you will find that convincing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because articulating yourself in that </v>

318
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:23.110
<v Speaker 2>manner actually changes your character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second is,</v>

319
00:16:23.111 --> 00:16:27.080
<v Speaker 2>is that it puts you in into a position </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

320
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

321
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 2>that's often been described as cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>dissonance,</v>

322
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:34.220
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the most famous findings</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

323
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:35.523
<v Speaker 2>in psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And cognitive dissonance is the UN on a </v>

324
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.220
<v Speaker 2>pleasant feeling that you get when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're holding two opposing beliefs,</v>

325
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:44.570
<v Speaker 2>let's say at the same time.</v>

326
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.403
<v Speaker 2>And you notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the cognitive dissonance here </v>

327
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:48.410
<v Speaker 2>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

328
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to write this statement </v>
<v Speaker 2>of principles.</v>

329
00:16:50.571 --> 00:16:53.090
<v Speaker 2>What difference does it make?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But however,</v>

330
00:16:53.091 --> 00:16:55.760
<v Speaker 2>that is a statement of principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

331
00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:56.594
<v Speaker 2>it's intrinsically dishonest and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and character damaging to craft a </v>

332
00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:03.740
<v Speaker 2>statement of Principles with which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do not agree.</v>

333
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.873
<v Speaker 2>And so then you can either regard </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself as a coward and a liar or you </v>

334
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.433
<v Speaker 2>bring your thinking in line with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement of principles and that the </v>

335
00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:14.960
<v Speaker 2>latter thing is what people tend to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

336
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 2>and then the idea that this is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to sit in some musty,</v>

337
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>file drawer.</v>

338
00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:22.760
<v Speaker 2>That's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's completely naive in my estimation</v>

339
00:17:22.761 --> 00:17:23.594
<v Speaker 2>because basically what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen this happening with the </v>

340
00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:29.060
<v Speaker 2>creep of ethics committees on university</v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses,</v>

341
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:33.680
<v Speaker 2>is that once you decide that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty and that you're going to abide by</v>

342
00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:34.514
<v Speaker 2>a new set of principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it now becomes incumbent on the law </v>

343
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:42.110
<v Speaker 2>society as a matter of the intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 2>logic of the,</v>

344
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.093
<v Speaker 2>of the movement to do things like check </v>
<v Speaker 2>you out on a year to year basis to see </v>

345
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 2>how your attitude and behavior is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

346
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 4>actually in keeping with your statement </v>
<v Speaker 4>of principles,</v>

347
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 4>it's not just going to hang there in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>air,</v>

348
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.243
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be enforced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is part of the transition I </v>

349
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:05.361
<v Speaker 4>would say from the law society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regulating competence,</v>

350
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.343
<v Speaker 4>regulating values.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it used to be at one point the </v>

351
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.513
<v Speaker 4>last study was there to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you had the skills to be able to </v>

352
00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:17.000
<v Speaker 4>practice law and as time has gone on </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

353
00:18:17.001 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are overseeing is more and more in</v>

354
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:20.844
<v Speaker 4>the area what it is that you sync and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not that thinking is </v>

355
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:24.744
<v Speaker 4>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one good comparison of this is the </v>

356
00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:28.344
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the case involving the Trinity Western </v>

357
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.513
<v Speaker 4>Law School of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

358
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.613
<v Speaker 4>graduates of that law school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is a private law school that </v>

359
00:18:35.001 --> 00:18:38.880
<v Speaker 4>would be in bridge and they require all </v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

360
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 4>all their faculty and students to sign </v>
<v Speaker 4>on to a pledge that had,</v>

361
00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 4>contains certain values.</v>

362
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.470
<v Speaker 4>They promised not to do certain things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like have premarital sex and,</v>

363
00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.620
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all kinds of other things.</v>

364
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:50.993
<v Speaker 4>The law society on the basis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it is inappropriate for an </v>

365
00:18:56.821 --> 00:18:57.654
<v Speaker 4>institution to impose values upon the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people within it have said that they </v>

366
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:04.650
<v Speaker 4>will not license graduates from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

367
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.730
<v Speaker 4>Now you might agree or disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that perspective,</v>

368
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.893
<v Speaker 4>but it is different critical now that </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they have done is the same thing </v>

369
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.150
<v Speaker 4>essentially except with a different set </v>
<v Speaker 4>of values.</v>

370
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.223
<v Speaker 4>They have indeed imposed instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>values on the people within their own </v>

371
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:23.784
<v Speaker 4>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that they haven't chosen </v>

372
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:27.270
<v Speaker 4>different values,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means that their objection to turn</v>

373
00:19:27.271 --> 00:19:28.104
<v Speaker 4>to your question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was not really at all about the </v>

374
00:19:29.521 --> 00:19:30.354
<v Speaker 4>position of the values.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just don't like the values that </v>

375
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.630
<v Speaker 4>attorney Western chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

376
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.473
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty ironic that the argument </v>

377
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:38.844
<v Speaker 4>would be made that an organization </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have the right to impose its </v>

378
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:42.240
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>

379
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.760
<v Speaker 4>So when it's on it's voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 4>participants,</v>

380
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:45.594
<v Speaker 4>which we should point out because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly don't have to go to Trinity </v>

381
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:48.893
<v Speaker 4>Western or signed the agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of law schools you can go </v>

382
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:53.580
<v Speaker 4>to where he's in this particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

383
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.773
<v Speaker 4>You're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean to say that a gun is pointed to </v>

384
00:19:57.361 --> 00:20:01.590
<v Speaker 4>your head is too dramatic obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's no joke to be faced with it.</v>

385
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:02.663
<v Speaker 4>With the threat of losing your license </v>
<v Speaker 4>and also to have to undergo what would </v>

386
00:20:05.551 --> 00:20:09.210
<v Speaker 4>essentially be a bureaucratic </v>
<v Speaker 4>inquisition and those are not pleasant.</v>

387
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.770
<v Speaker 4>Those are seriously not pleasant if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you fail to comply.</v>

388
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.900
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's other,</v>

389
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 4>there's other parts of this before we </v>
<v Speaker 4>leave Trinity Western,</v>

390
00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 4>can we just underline what you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

391
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:21.654
<v Speaker 4>which I think is very important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that that the law society is </v>

392
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:30.510
<v Speaker 4>essentially an arm of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has coercive power given to it by the</v>

393
00:20:30.511 --> 00:20:33.810
<v Speaker 4>state to license lawyers and it is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gatekeeper,</v>

394
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.760
<v Speaker 4>so you have no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas as,</v>

395
00:20:36.761 --> 00:20:37.740
<v Speaker 4>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan,</v>

396
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.120
<v Speaker 4>the they association with Trinity </v>
<v Speaker 4>Western is entirely voluntary.</v>

397
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.130
<v Speaker 4>If you don't want to go to that school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't go to that school.</v>

398
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.920
<v Speaker 4>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

399
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's ironic in the extreme that</v>

400
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.100
<v Speaker 2>it is the law society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

401
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.973
<v Speaker 2>which has imposed such a requirement in </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances that is much more </v>

402
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 2>objectionable than the Trinity Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

403
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:00.863
<v Speaker 2>And it's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite disconcerting to me to say </v>

404
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:04.264
<v Speaker 2>the least to see that it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyers that are doing this and that </v>

405
00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:07.924
<v Speaker 2>have that and that and that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of seeing or unwilling to see </v>

406
00:21:12.431 --> 00:21:17.410
<v Speaker 2>for some reasons that I don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand why that this is an egregious</v>

407
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:19.420
<v Speaker 2>assault on the rights of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

408
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.283
<v Speaker 2>well I would say of of lawyers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ontario but also of individual citizens </v>

409
00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:26.890
<v Speaker 2>in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the fact that that,</v>

410
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.680
<v Speaker 2>that it's lawyers that are involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really,</v>

411
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that much more terrifying in some</v>

412
00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:38.761
<v Speaker 2>sense than the unfounded or likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfounded accusation that the entire,</v>

413
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>profession is racist,</v>

414
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 2>which are also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:48.160
<v Speaker 2>now what are people who are to use the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hated word racialized,</v>

416
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.163
<v Speaker 2>which is also an ideological term </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to conclude if all the lawyers </v>

417
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.210
<v Speaker 2>in Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

418
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 2>just go along with this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really supposed to be able to go</v>

419
00:21:58.241 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 2>into a law firm and trust that their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

420
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.690
<v Speaker 2>their claims are going to be put forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

421
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:05.770
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

422
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 2>with fairness and clarity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment.</v>

423
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 2>If the whole society is already agreed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the lawyers go along with it,</v>

424
00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:13.264
<v Speaker 2>that it's an intrinsically racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>association and how is that going to do </v>

425
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:20.110
<v Speaker 2>anything but damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racial and,</v>

426
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.820
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sex related.</v>

427
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call them?</v>

428
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Relationships in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't see that as anything,</v>

429
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:27.334
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be something that </v>

430
00:22:28.571 --> 00:22:32.320
<v Speaker 2>brings us together with regards to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it inclusiveness,</v>

431
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.393
<v Speaker 2>but I can't see this as anything other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than something that's going to be </v>

432
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:36.880
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily divisive.</v>

433
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

434
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.340
<v Speaker 3>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were raising the issue of,</v>

435
00:22:40.341 --> 00:22:41.174
<v Speaker 3>of why are lawyers going along with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>or why aren't they recognizing the </v>

436
00:22:43.791 --> 00:22:45.110
<v Speaker 3>danger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

437
00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some,</v>

438
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.820
<v Speaker 3>some talk about this at the convocation </v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting where,</v>

439
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:49.683
<v Speaker 3>where these recommendations were passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were some dissenting voices and </v>

440
00:22:52.491 --> 00:22:54.920
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very well put dissenting voices.</v>

441
00:22:54.921 --> 00:22:56.150
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

442
00:22:56.151 --> 00:23:00.470
<v Speaker 3>just within my own professional network,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most lawyers don't know what's going on.</v>

443
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 3>They got the email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

444
00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.070
<v Speaker 3>they didn't think anything of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get a,</v>

445
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 of these things a month.</v>

446
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.360
<v Speaker 3>It's just an additional requirement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another piece of paper.</v>

447
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.201
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

448
00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:13.070
<v Speaker 3>What the law society has done when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushed this requirement out is they also</v>

449
00:23:13.071 --> 00:23:14.360
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

450
00:23:14.361 --> 00:23:16.760
<v Speaker 3>if you need some help completing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement of declar,</v>

451
00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>statement of principles,</v>

452
00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.140
<v Speaker 3>we're going to provide two templates </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would satisfy us.</v>

453
00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.660
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>98% of the,</v>

454
00:23:23.661 --> 00:23:26.650
<v Speaker 3>the lawyers that I practice with who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>our he time grinds,</v>

455
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:27.583
<v Speaker 3>what are they gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna file it out of their </v>

456
00:23:28.701 --> 00:23:31.130
<v Speaker 3>template a or B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get on with their life.</v>

457
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.023
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's one of those things where </v>

458
00:23:33.861 --> 00:23:35.930
<v Speaker 3>you've got time pressed lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

459
00:23:35.931 --> 00:23:36.764
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or licensees and you've got a </v>

460
00:23:37.941 --> 00:23:41.270
<v Speaker 3>bureaucracy adding a new law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a level of requirement to them,</v>

461
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.520
<v Speaker 3>and they're just going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

462
00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go along to get,</v>

463
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

464
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.800
<v Speaker 2>from what I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I do stop people and ask them about</v>

465
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:49.873
<v Speaker 2>their statement of principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the first time they've actually </v>

466
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:52.700
<v Speaker 2>thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

467
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.790
<v Speaker 2>go ahead bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that as a template,</v>

468
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.560
<v Speaker 2>and you can choose between one or up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 points.</v>

469
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make it less of a concern.</v>

470
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:09.320
<v Speaker 2>It's actually more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to overstate this,</v>

471
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:10.154
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a lot of similarities to </v>

472
00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:13.490
<v Speaker 2>mccarthyism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

473
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Cause I don't statement that you know I </v>
<v Speaker 2>am not now nor have I ever been a member</v>

474
00:24:18.981 --> 00:24:22.760
<v Speaker 2>of the communist party that that was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>templates in the McCarthy era.</v>

475
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.073
<v Speaker 2>It's just a template.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to say certain things and and </v>

476
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.870
<v Speaker 2>look how meaningless it becomes in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of actual substance.</v>

477
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.733
<v Speaker 2>If it's a template and you just sign on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they have literally put words in </v>

478
00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:39.350
<v Speaker 2>your mouth and that is the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot be allowed to happen.</v>

479
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a couple of ways.</v>

480
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:43.394
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first thing is is that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were committed to this in any deep </v>

481
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:47.984
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last thing they would provide was a </v>

482
00:24:49.131 --> 00:24:49.964
<v Speaker 2>template because the idea that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can require from people a statement </v>

483
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:56.144
<v Speaker 2>of principles that's of such fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 2>import that if it is not crafted </v>

484
00:24:59.211 --> 00:25:00.890
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose your license.</v>

485
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.570
<v Speaker 2>And yet that they could produce a </v>
<v Speaker 2>template of principles that wouldn't see</v>

486
00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:08.330
<v Speaker 2>in some manner apply to everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>equally.</v>

487
00:25:08.331 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's absurd.</v>

488
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Almost beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

489
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 2>principals actually happened to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>

490
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:16.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>From a psychological perspective,</v>

491
00:25:16.341 --> 00:25:17.174
<v Speaker 2>your deepest principles are the axioms </v>
<v Speaker 2>from which you generate not only your </v>

492
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:23.420
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and your actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your perceptions,</v>

493
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.910
<v Speaker 2>your emotional responses and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation.</v>

494
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:26.744
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's virtually nothing more</v>
<v Speaker 2>important from the perspective of </v>

495
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.220
<v Speaker 2>psychological integrity then your </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles and to think that those could</v>

496
00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:35.054
<v Speaker 2>be reduced to an externally produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>template and that that could be imposed </v>

497
00:25:39.111 --> 00:25:39.944
<v Speaker 2>as a requirement.</v>

498
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.010
<v Speaker 2>So it would be easier for you is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it,</v>

499
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 2>it reminds me of the Soviet era where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there were templates of guilt,</v>

500
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were accused of something,</v>

501
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether you were guilty or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

502
00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 2>because that really wasn't very </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant,</v>

503
00:25:55.670 --> 00:26:00.020
<v Speaker 2>you'd be required to sign a template of </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilt essentially.</v>

504
00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:00.854
<v Speaker 2>And that would well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and once you've done that well you were </v>

505
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:05.210
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's really quite,</v>

506
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:06.044
<v Speaker 2>it's really quite amazing that that from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conceptual philosophical perspective </v>

507
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:14.030
<v Speaker 2>that that sort of thing could even be </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered for a moment as,</v>

508
00:26:14.031 --> 00:26:14.864
<v Speaker 2>as as acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me to be a way of </v>

509
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.330
<v Speaker 2>sliding it in under the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

510
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.730
<v Speaker 2>as jared pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are busy.</v>

511
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.920
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

512
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.350
<v Speaker 2>when I made my first videos objecting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bill,</v>

513
00:26:27.351 --> 00:26:28.184
<v Speaker 2>see 16 last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of what motivated me was a comment </v>

514
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:35.870
<v Speaker 2>by a colleague and about political </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness on campuses.</v>

515
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:36.621
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

516
00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:37.454
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequence of standing up against </v>

517
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:42.890
<v Speaker 2>it from a personal perspective is </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely,</v>

518
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:48.710
<v Speaker 2>and the probability that your opposition</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it is going to have a broad scale.</v>

519
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 2>A social consequence is very low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

520
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.183
<v Speaker 2>the logical thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're pressed for time </v>

521
00:26:56.141 --> 00:26:56.974
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also if you want to not put your </v>

522
00:26:58.441 --> 00:26:59.274
<v Speaker 2>head up above the herd where it can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>locked off is to a not notice because </v>

523
00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:05.700
<v Speaker 2>you're too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And B,</v>

524
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.373
<v Speaker 2>because you're isolated as an individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this circumstance facing a large </v>

525
00:27:11.161 --> 00:27:12.420
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

526
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.313
<v Speaker 2>the easiest thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're concerned with </v>

527
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:16.434
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just to go along with it because </v>

528
00:27:18.271 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 2>you're isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

529
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if there's other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

530
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who might be feeling uneasy about this.</v>

531
00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 2>And there's no real way of telling,</v>

532
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.360
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in our profession,</v>

533
00:27:28.361 --> 00:27:29.194
<v Speaker 3>my understanding is that the majority of</v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers in the province of Ontario are </v>

534
00:27:31.901 --> 00:27:33.850
<v Speaker 3>generally practicing in a small firm </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

535
00:27:33.851 --> 00:27:34.684
<v Speaker 3>are sole practitioners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're going to have a lot of </v>

536
00:27:35.981 --> 00:27:37.630
<v Speaker 3>people standing on an island on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own,</v>

537
00:27:37.631 --> 00:27:38.464
<v Speaker 3>in their own practice and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to fully appreciate that this is </v>

538
00:27:40.931 --> 00:27:41.850
<v Speaker 3>an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

539
00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.693
<v Speaker 3>what other people are thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're absolutely going to think that </v>

540
00:27:44.561 --> 00:27:46.540
<v Speaker 3>they're putting their head above the </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard.</v>

541
00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it,</v>

542
00:27:47.681 --> 00:27:48.880
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a unique,</v>

543
00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.700
<v Speaker 3>I think we have a unique industry in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that regard.</v>

544
00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.043
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just make it this point at this </v>

545
00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.523
<v Speaker 4>moment in time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that all those lawyers who </v>

546
00:27:59.681 --> 00:28:00.514
<v Speaker 4>think that they may be sticking their </v>
<v Speaker 4>head out all by themselves are actually </v>

547
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.370
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>

548
00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:08.223
<v Speaker 4>I have certainly heard from a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of lawyers now who are all </v>

549
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.910
<v Speaker 4>extremely concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shocked,</v>

550
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.833
<v Speaker 4>alarmed at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the one thing that we want to </v>

551
00:28:17.201 --> 00:28:18.034
<v Speaker 4>overcome is the possible inclination to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that that any lawyer who is </v>

552
00:28:22.331 --> 00:28:23.164
<v Speaker 4>concerned about this is an army of one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that in this situation is not the </v>

553
00:28:27.671 --> 00:28:28.990
<v Speaker 4>case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there,</v>

554
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.390
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are possibilities here that if,</v>

555
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.980
<v Speaker 4>if people do act upon their concerns </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

556
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.060
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

557
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:37.953
<v Speaker 4>decline to comply with this requirement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the change in this situation </v>

558
00:28:43.031 --> 00:28:44.980
<v Speaker 4>actually is a possibility.</v>

559
00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.001
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bruce,</v>

560
00:28:46.001 --> 00:28:47.380
<v Speaker 3>there's also the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

561
00:28:47.381 --> 00:28:48.550
<v Speaker 3>the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

562
00:28:48.551 --> 00:28:49.870
<v Speaker 3>that we're servicing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

563
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.720
<v Speaker 3>in the private practice world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clients,</v>

564
00:28:52.721 --> 00:28:55.360
<v Speaker 3>the clients are going to watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to know what we're doing.</v>

565
00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:56.403
<v Speaker 3>I think they want their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lawyers to stand up on their </v>

566
00:28:58.481 --> 00:28:59.650
<v Speaker 3>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>

567
00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:00.603
<v Speaker 3>and push back against something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that there's something to </v>

568
00:29:02.291 --> 00:29:03.124
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be said in terms of your </v>

569
00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.660
<v Speaker 3>differentiation in the marketplace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in private practice,</v>

570
00:29:07.661 --> 00:29:11.080
<v Speaker 3>if you do exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My clients were relying on me to be this</v>

571
00:29:11.081 --> 00:29:14.260
<v Speaker 3>bulwark against this type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of lawyers should,</v>

572
00:29:14.261 --> 00:29:15.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should take note of that.</v>

573
00:29:15.591 --> 00:29:17.620
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there might be something here worth</v>

574
00:29:17.621 --> 00:29:18.454
<v Speaker 3>fighting for.</v>

575
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally agree.</v>

576
00:29:19.881 --> 00:29:20.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really your,</v>

577
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.880
<v Speaker 4>your lawyer credibility is at stake </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

578
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:27.910
<v Speaker 4>You can't stand up and protect herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When your own fundamental rights are,</v>

579
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.510
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are being threatened,</v>

580
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.540
<v Speaker 4>then why should clients believe you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to do so on their map?</v>

581
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inclination to do so.</v>

582
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because by swollen we can just hook,</v>

583
00:29:40.161 --> 00:29:40.994
<v Speaker 2>line and sinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say an exceeding to what's </v>

584
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:45.860
<v Speaker 2>essentially an ideological demand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

585
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 2>then you also brand yourself as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Avatar of that particular radiology.</v>

586
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.560
<v Speaker 2>And so that's another reason to not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>trusted.</v>

587
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.693
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's the aspect of inability to </v>

588
00:29:56.951 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 2>stand up for yourself or unwillingness </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

589
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:04.081
<v Speaker 2>but then the two to come out as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an active agent for this,</v>

590
00:30:04.361 --> 00:30:08.020
<v Speaker 2>for this particular set of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of let's call them principles,</v>

591
00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:08.781
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

592
00:30:08.781 --> 00:30:13.240
<v Speaker 2>and there's absolutely no reason to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assumption that the whole,</v>

593
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 2>the new holy trinity of diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equity and inclusiveness constitutes the</v>

594
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:19.740
<v Speaker 2>highest order of moral value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

595
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.643
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an extraordinarily weak </v>

596
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:23.230
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>

597
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:24.064
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's flaws in it at virtually every </v>

598
00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:27.490
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

599
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.120
<v Speaker 2>and it certainly runs contrary to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>central themes of,</v>

600
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.860
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of English common law,</v>

601
00:30:32.861 --> 00:30:33.730
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

602
00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:39.340
<v Speaker 4>So we make note just for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that the law society is playing</v>

603
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.133
<v Speaker 4>a little bit close to their chest in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense that they have not spelled out </v>

604
00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.630
<v Speaker 4>what the penalty is going to be for </v>
<v Speaker 4>those lawyers who declined to,</v>

605
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:50.563
<v Speaker 4>to comply with this requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've only sit and their materials </v>

606
00:30:53.421 --> 00:30:54.254
<v Speaker 4>that those lawyers who are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>compliance will be advised of their </v>

607
00:30:57.951 --> 00:30:58.784
<v Speaker 4>obligations in writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which of course leaves all the choices </v>

608
00:31:01.911 --> 00:31:03.490
<v Speaker 4>open to the law society.</v>

609
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was discussed,</v>

610
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:06.683
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to some extent at the convocation </v>

611
00:31:08.391 --> 00:31:10.370
<v Speaker 3>meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was concerns what happens,</v>

612
00:31:10.371 --> 00:31:13.160
<v Speaker 3>what is the recourse here and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

613
00:31:13.161 --> 00:31:13.994
<v Speaker 3>I'm left to speculate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what your obligations are typically </v>

614
00:31:16.581 --> 00:31:17.414
<v Speaker 3>is to file what's called the Mendel </v>
<v Speaker 3>member's annual report of which this is </v>

615
00:31:19.911 --> 00:31:20.744
<v Speaker 3>going to be a component of it by not </v>
<v Speaker 3>filling out a portion of your member's </v>

616
00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:24.464
<v Speaker 3>annual report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that you're going to face at a </v>

617
00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:29.960
<v Speaker 3>minimum what's called an administrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>processor suspension.</v>

618
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.320
<v Speaker 3>And it may even turn into something much</v>
<v Speaker 3>larger than that.</v>

619
00:31:33.321 --> 00:31:34.154
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

620
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.143
<v Speaker 3>I'm speculating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but absolutely the Law Society did not </v>

621
00:31:37.101 --> 00:31:41.630
<v Speaker 3>make clear what's going to happen if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if somebody decides that they don't want</v>

622
00:31:41.631 --> 00:31:43.670
<v Speaker 3>to go along to get along.</v>

623
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's also rather troublesome in </v>

624
00:31:46.941 --> 00:31:47.960
<v Speaker 2>and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

625
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:51.530
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not reasonable to,</v>

626
00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.580
<v Speaker 2>to specify a requirement and then leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>the penalty undefined.</v>

627
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.923
<v Speaker 2>And it smacks of political opportunism </v>
<v Speaker 2>from my perspective because it means </v>

628
00:32:00.771 --> 00:32:01.604
<v Speaker 2>that the law society hasn't put itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the line with regards to the degree </v>

629
00:32:04.941 --> 00:32:08.750
<v Speaker 2>to which they're going to be draconian </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this and then can incrementally,</v>

630
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced the penalties on a per person</v>

631
00:32:13.401 --> 00:32:14.234
<v Speaker 2>basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where you would get the least </v>

632
00:32:15.351 --> 00:32:16.184
<v Speaker 2>amount of pushback too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're a professional and </v>

633
00:32:18.351 --> 00:32:23.030
<v Speaker 2>then the board goes after you like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a horrifying experience and especially,</v>

634
00:32:23.031 --> 00:32:23.864
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it puts your family livelihood and your </v>

635
00:32:25.611 --> 00:32:26.444
<v Speaker 2>reputation online and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive to deal with and time </v>

636
00:32:29.631 --> 00:32:33.290
<v Speaker 2>consuming and troublesome and an anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 2>provoking and all of those things.</v>

637
00:32:33.291 --> 00:32:37.580
<v Speaker 2>So you have someone who's immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>put in a tremendous position of weakness</v>

638
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:40.790
<v Speaker 2>in order to to say push back against </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

639
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.340
<v Speaker 3>When the law society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all public as well.</v>

640
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:44.220
<v Speaker 3>So I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

641
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 3>the role of the law society from what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand is to protect the public from</v>

642
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:48.464
<v Speaker 3>the big bad lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we are a self regulating </v>

643
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:52.100
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that,</v>

644
00:32:52.101 --> 00:32:53.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the law society does is it has,</v>

645
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 3>it makes its disciplinary process </v>
<v Speaker 3>public.</v>

646
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 3>So things like administrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspensions or,</v>

647
00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.750
<v Speaker 3>or disciplinary action are things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be known to the public.</v>

648
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:03.584
<v Speaker 3>So you're out there potentially being </v>
<v Speaker 3>tarred and feathered on this thing and </v>

649
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:07.243
<v Speaker 3>people are going to know,</v>

650
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:08.413
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well and to streamline important for a </v>

651
00:33:09.831 --> 00:33:12.380
<v Speaker 2>professional to maintain a pristine </v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation.</v>

652
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:14.560
<v Speaker 2>And even the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

653
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.990
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the suggestion that you're known in</v>

654
00:33:17.991 --> 00:33:18.824
<v Speaker 2>accordance with even an administrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>detail with regards to the law society </v>

655
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.173
<v Speaker 2>is you can imagine that that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put doubt in the mind of anyone who </v>

656
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.910
<v Speaker 2>called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows you or doesn't know you.</v>

657
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.850
<v Speaker 2>So that means the process is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment.</v>

658
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:32.684
<v Speaker 2>And that's very much the case with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>mid level organizations where it seems </v>

659
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:39.800
<v Speaker 2>to me that proclivity for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

660
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.903
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more totalitarian view of the world is </v>

661
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.000
<v Speaker 2>like leaping forward in leaps and or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaps and bounds.</v>

662
00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.560
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

663
00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.660
<v Speaker 4>so we consider for a moment what we </v>
<v Speaker 4>might suggest to all the lawyers who are</v>

664
00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 4>concerned about this and don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go along with the requirement what it is</v>

665
00:33:57.651 --> 00:34:01.070
<v Speaker 4>that what we wouldn't suggest that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

666
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.010
<v Speaker 4>Jared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want to take them off?</v>

667
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be you approach that in your</v>

668
00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:06.420
<v Speaker 3>article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the national post in,</v>

669
00:34:06.421 --> 00:34:07.770
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a pretty adept way.</v>

670
00:34:07.771 --> 00:34:10.230
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my first inclination is that is that</v>

671
00:34:10.231 --> 00:34:11.580
<v Speaker 3>you don't file,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

672
00:34:11.581 --> 00:34:14.520
<v Speaker 3>the act of filing in itself as we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>already discussed is,</v>

673
00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.040
<v Speaker 3>is half of the admission of guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>

674
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>

675
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:19.363
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that not filing sense sends a </v>

676
00:34:21.361 --> 00:34:22.590
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good statement,</v>

677
00:34:22.591 --> 00:34:23.870
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

678
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.700
<v Speaker 3>you want to obviously let them know why </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not filing.</v>

679
00:34:26.701 --> 00:34:29.820
<v Speaker 3>So perhaps you have to send something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would let them,</v>

680
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.103
<v Speaker 3>the law society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the regulator know why you're not </v>

681
00:34:32.521 --> 00:34:34.140
<v Speaker 3>filing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean those are the things that come to</v>

682
00:34:34.141 --> 00:34:36.420
<v Speaker 3>mind and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you discuss them I think quite well.</v>

683
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.330
<v Speaker 4>So it's what I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For them to realize that you didn't just</v>

684
00:34:40.331 --> 00:34:43.210
<v Speaker 4>forget,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually consciously decided that it</v>

685
00:34:43.211 --> 00:34:44.650
<v Speaker 4>wasn't a thing that you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

686
00:34:44.651 --> 00:34:46.630
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a very good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

687
00:34:46.631 --> 00:34:49.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of short statement but not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

688
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.360
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be inclined to suggest that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they should draft their own statement of</v>

689
00:34:54.881 --> 00:34:57.430
<v Speaker 4>principles that reflects what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually think,</v>

690
00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:58.953
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because then they are actually going </v>

691
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.600
<v Speaker 4>three quarters of the way of what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of what they've been asked to do.</v>

692
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason why,</v>

693
00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:06.843
<v Speaker 4>even if they've been says something that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you believe that you should be filing </v>

694
00:35:09.851 --> 00:35:10.900
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

695
00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.480
<v Speaker 4>because it's still forced speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're still requiring him to make that</v>

696
00:35:13.481 --> 00:35:15.000
<v Speaker 4>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes.</v>

697
00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 3>And it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's none of their business.</v>

698
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.020
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>

699
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:21.470
<v Speaker 3>I thought about that myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought maybe you do a google memo,</v>

700
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Demora more Google memo,</v>

701
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.170
<v Speaker 3>but then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

702
00:35:24.171 --> 00:35:25.520
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're playing the game.</v>

703
00:35:25.521 --> 00:35:28.390
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are declaring your thoughts to,</v>

704
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.040
<v Speaker 3>to the regulator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's reprehensible.</v>

705
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

706
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.860
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any right to the content</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your thoughts,</v>

707
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 2>not unless you're to voluntarily put </v>
<v Speaker 2>them forward.</v>

708
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's definitely a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A very big difference between,</v>

709
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.213
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assessment of competence which has </v>

710
00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:46.074
<v Speaker 2>already taken place after you've passed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bar and you're in compliance with </v>

711
00:35:49.111 --> 00:35:50.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

712
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.113
<v Speaker 2>with the regulatory boards requirements </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that they should have </v>

713
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 2>privileged access to your deepest </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles is,</v>

714
00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I agree that's absolutely reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no excuse for it whatsoever.</v>

715
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.593
<v Speaker 2>Whether you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you agree with the principles </v>

716
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 2>they want you to agree with or not and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reprehensible.</v>

717
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.583
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>

718
00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.460
<v Speaker 4>Let's emphasize this point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

719
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:11.243
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is essentially a debate about </v>

720
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.863
<v Speaker 4>whether or not those values are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are good or bad or desirable or </v>

721
00:36:17.721 --> 00:36:18.554
<v Speaker 4>undesirable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is about the forced speech first </v>

722
00:36:20.751 --> 00:36:24.020
<v Speaker 4>and foremost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that you can be required to</v>

723
00:36:24.021 --> 00:36:27.470
<v Speaker 4>indicate how you feel about them and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>agree with some,</v>

724
00:36:27.471 --> 00:36:28.304
<v Speaker 4>an endorsement zone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you do agree with them and </v>

725
00:36:30.471 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Speaker 4>endorse them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that you must have to say so it</v>

726
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:35.670
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just not on it.</v>

727
00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:40.450
<v Speaker 4>It crosses a line into a dark place that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

728
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:41.583
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does not bode well for the future of </v>

729
00:36:45.201 --> 00:36:46.870
<v Speaker 4>freedom of speech in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

730
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.530
<v Speaker 4>the rules go ahead and drink</v>

731
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:51.850
<v Speaker 2>the rules of professional conduct for </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyers,</v>

732
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.733
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>already have a rule that requires us to </v>

733
00:36:55.281 --> 00:37:00.281
<v Speaker 2>act in accordance with the Human Rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>Code and principles of,</v>

734
00:37:00.341 --> 00:37:01.610
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

735
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.130
<v Speaker 2>not to discriminate I guess is the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using.</v>

736
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:09.100
<v Speaker 2>And so clearly our actions are already </v>
<v Speaker 2>governed by a code of conduct and,</v>

737
00:37:09.101 --> 00:37:11.030
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the legislation generally.</v>

738
00:37:11.031 --> 00:37:13.790
<v Speaker 2>So for them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to request the statement of principles,</v>

739
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.460
<v Speaker 2>it really is just asking you to the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think.</v>

740
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.440
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not like,</v>

741
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:22.040
<v Speaker 4>it's not like this is needed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's,</v>

742
00:37:22.041 --> 00:37:27.040
<v Speaker 4>it's the distinction between your </v>
<v Speaker 4>obligation to comply with the law and to</v>

743
00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:29.230
<v Speaker 4>state that you agree with the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which again,</v>

744
00:37:29.231 --> 00:37:30.860
<v Speaker 4>going back to the Supreme Court of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada is,</v>

745
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.400
<v Speaker 4>is our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are two quite different things.</v>

746
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.100
<v Speaker 4>I read again what the Supreme Court said</v>
<v Speaker 4>on this question.</v>

747
00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.353
<v Speaker 4>Three court says this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>however admirable the objectives and </v>

748
00:37:43.991 --> 00:37:44.824
<v Speaker 4>provisions of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe no one is obliged to approve of </v>

749
00:37:49.031 --> 00:37:50.410
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyone.</v>

750
00:37:50.411 --> 00:37:54.790
<v Speaker 4>May criticize them and seek to have them</v>
<v Speaker 4>amended or repealed,</v>

751
00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.350
<v Speaker 4>although complying with them so long as </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are ineffective.</v>

752
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.730
<v Speaker 4>So this is not a question of whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>lawyers are subject to human rights code</v>

753
00:38:03.731 --> 00:38:05.320
<v Speaker 4>and antidiscrimination laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

754
00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:06.183
<v Speaker 4>that is not the question here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is whether or not you are </v>

755
00:38:08.831 --> 00:38:11.860
<v Speaker 4>required to endorse them and say that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you agree,</v>

756
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.210
<v Speaker 4>which is quite a different thing.</v>

757
00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.480
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that disturbs me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

758
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.713
<v Speaker 2>and I suppose this is a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my experience with delving deeply into </v>

759
00:38:22.241 --> 00:38:27.241
<v Speaker 2>the history of places like the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union in its early stages of development</v>

760
00:38:27.701 --> 00:38:31.090
<v Speaker 2>is that there's a class based guilt </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena that's,</v>

761
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.013
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's lurking at the bottom of this </v>

762
00:38:33.791 --> 00:38:34.624
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also absolutely I would say </v>

763
00:38:36.491 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 2>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's just say for a moment,</v>

764
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.563
<v Speaker 2>although I don't believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is systemic racism among </v>

765
00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:49.960
<v Speaker 2>lawyers defined the way that this sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thing is defined.</v>

766
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what this requirement,</v>

767
00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.153
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>implies is that every single lawyer of </v>

768
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:02.740
<v Speaker 2>that group is now guilty of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena,</v>

769
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:08.350
<v Speaker 2>merely sb and merely as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a member of that class of people.</v>

770
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something,</v>

771
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:11.583
<v Speaker 2>the idea of class based guilt is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well first of all it's the basis for </v>

772
00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:17.350
<v Speaker 2>racism itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

773
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.360
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

774
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:20.253
<v Speaker 2>it's a terrifying proposition from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of a informed Western </v>

775
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:27.690
<v Speaker 2>individual because one of the bedrock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

776
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions,</v>

777
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.260
<v Speaker 2>let's call it a principle of our legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

778
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:36.100
<v Speaker 2>is that you're judged on your guilt or </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocence as an individual,</v>

779
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:38.800
<v Speaker 2>not as the member of a class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>

780
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:41.980
<v Speaker 2>that is not a road we want to walk down </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's,</v>

781
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:42.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of us,</v>

782
00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:43.774
<v Speaker 2>it might be the members of six or seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>different classes and if you look into </v>

783
00:39:47.681 --> 00:39:50.260
<v Speaker 2>the history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say of those classes,</v>

784
00:39:50.261 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic,</v>

785
00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Speaker 2>professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racial,</v>

786
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 2>gender based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

787
00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.730
<v Speaker 2>the probability that sometime in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

788
00:39:57.731 --> 00:39:58.564
<v Speaker 2>some members of our so called class did </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that were morally reprehensible </v>

789
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:03.424
<v Speaker 2>or illegal is 100% and if we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be judged on the basis of the actions </v>

790
00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:09.754
<v Speaker 2>taken by people that we didn't even know</v>
<v Speaker 2>merely because we happen to be vaguely </v>

791
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:14.134
<v Speaker 2>associated with that group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're all guilty of all sorts of </v>

792
00:40:17.171 --> 00:40:20.710
<v Speaker 2>terrible things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that puts us completely in the hands</v>

793
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:22.500
<v Speaker 2>of people who want to make those guilt </v>
<v Speaker 2>bay,</v>

794
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.530
<v Speaker 2>those group guilt based accusations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

795
00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.270
<v Speaker 2>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bad,</v>

796
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to overstress how</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad an idea that is.</v>

797
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.500
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

798
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:35.363
<v Speaker 4>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no one that you can't identify </v>

799
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:43.470
<v Speaker 4>who in terms of group association and in</v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of of lineage as well.</v>

800
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:48.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is also a casting the net </v>
<v Speaker 4>back into history to see if you know,</v>

801
00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:51.870
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which group did wrong to,</v>

802
00:40:51.871 --> 00:40:53.300
<v Speaker 4>to which group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But of course there,</v>

803
00:40:53.301 --> 00:40:58.301
<v Speaker 4>there is no one who doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in their ancestral lineage,</v>

804
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrongs done by somebody you related to,</v>

805
00:41:02.761 --> 00:41:04.690
<v Speaker 4>to some other person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if,</v>

806
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.130
<v Speaker 4>if that is the record is the criteria </v>
<v Speaker 4>for guilt as you have said,</v>

807
00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.970
<v Speaker 4>then everybody is guilty and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing starts to become silicon.</v>

808
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.243
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well when everyone's guilty that means </v>

809
00:41:14.631 --> 00:41:18.530
<v Speaker 2>that the people who hold the right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment become all powerful.</v>

810
00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.990
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all discretionary to yes.</v>

811
00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.080
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in Soviet Russia,</v>

812
00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:23.914
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd prime you up and torture you a </v>

813
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:27.020
<v Speaker 2>bit before they had you swear your </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement of a,</v>

814
00:41:27.021 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 2>of principles or your confession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

815
00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.021
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

816
00:41:32.021 --> 00:41:36.470
<v Speaker 2>So here's another thing that I thought I</v>
<v Speaker 2>might do is I'm going to put together an</v>

817
00:41:36.471 --> 00:41:38.940
<v Speaker 2>anonymous list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

818
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:43.370
<v Speaker 2>so that lawyers who are willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicate their,</v>

819
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.593
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>objections to this requirement can sign </v>

820
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:49.064
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that way I can tweet and also stay </v>

821
00:41:51.021 --> 00:41:53.270
<v Speaker 2>in contact with you guys on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis,</v>

822
00:41:53.271 --> 00:41:58.040
<v Speaker 2>how many signatories I've obtained and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't make that public.</v>

823
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll make sure that it's not crackable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

824
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.423
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way it'll help people discover how </v>

825
00:42:06.471 --> 00:42:07.304
<v Speaker 2>many other people are also concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this and indicate to what degree </v>

826
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:12.223
<v Speaker 2>there might be strength in numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'll set that up very carefully </v>

827
00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 2>and I'll put the link to that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>description of this video.</v>

828
00:42:18.591 --> 00:42:22.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I guess we've decided on three </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential,</v>

829
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modes of action and,</v>

830
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

831
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:30.560
<v Speaker 2>jareds fundamental suggested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

832
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:31.783
<v Speaker 2>was to not file the statement of </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle and also write a letter </v>

833
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:39.980
<v Speaker 2>indicating precisely why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess that would be,</v>

834
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.153
<v Speaker 4>well it</v>
<v Speaker 4>might be most effective if you filed a </v>

835
00:42:46.031 --> 00:42:46.864
<v Speaker 4>piece of paper as your fitness but don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it a statement just to say on the </v>

836
00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:52.383
<v Speaker 4>statement of principles that you object </v>
<v Speaker 4>to filing if they can or principles or </v>

837
00:42:56.741 --> 00:42:59.210
<v Speaker 4>if they wish to call them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're more than welcome to just to,</v>

838
00:42:59.211 --> 00:43:01.690
<v Speaker 4>just to send in a copy of the it from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the National Post.</v>

839
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.793
<v Speaker 4>Anything that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that indicates that you're not </v>

840
00:43:05.711 --> 00:43:07.810
<v Speaker 4>doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you haven't just forgotten,</v>

841
00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.160
<v Speaker 4>but there is a piece of paper that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>filed in place of what they've asked for</v>

842
00:43:12.161 --> 00:43:13.470
<v Speaker 4>but it is not what they've asked for.</v>

843
00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that can be very straight forward.</v>

844
00:43:15.721 --> 00:43:18.510
<v Speaker 2>That means that it wouldn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>be very time consuming.</v>

845
00:43:18.511 --> 00:43:19.344
<v Speaker 2>You could take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take the time to delineate why </v>

846
00:43:23.131 --> 00:43:26.400
<v Speaker 2>you're opposed to this or you could send</v>
<v Speaker 2>to in Nicola more.</v>

847
00:43:26.401 --> 00:43:28.740
<v Speaker 2>You could just state that you're opposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this.</v>

848
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they should go to great </v>

849
00:43:31.481 --> 00:43:32.314
<v Speaker 4>lengths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very simple and they just </v>

850
00:43:34.181 --> 00:43:35.014
<v Speaker 4>say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is forced speech and I choose not </v>

851
00:43:39.341 --> 00:43:43.000
<v Speaker 4>to comply or send to the column or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

852
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.170
<v Speaker 4>something that that stands for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The proposition that I'm,</v>

853
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:50.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm declining this request.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it can be very short.</v>

854
00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.180
<v Speaker 4>It does not have to be a full reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

855
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.620
<v Speaker 4>I objected to be justifiable.</v>

856
00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.350
<v Speaker 3>Most lawyers know how to do that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been in a courtroom.</v>

857
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

858
00:44:00.751 --> 00:44:01.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

859
00:44:01.401 --> 00:44:02.234
<v Speaker 2>It should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be something they're quite </v>

860
00:44:03.051 --> 00:44:04.730
<v Speaker 2>accustomed to doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

861
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:05.564
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll put up this late for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last so that we can start to collect </v>

862
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.733
<v Speaker 2>signatories and decide who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let people know how many people are </v>

863
00:44:13.701 --> 00:44:14.534
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it philosophically and </v>

864
00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:19.940
<v Speaker 2>professionally opposed to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular set of maneuvers.</v>

865
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.420
<v Speaker 3>And to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

866
00:44:21.421 --> 00:44:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to know anybody's politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to know anything other than</v>

867
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.350
<v Speaker 3>are they uncomfortable with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being compelled to do something,</v>

868
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to speak something.</v>

869
00:44:29.701 --> 00:44:30.211
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

870
00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:31.044
<v Speaker 3>that's important and going to be a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people who are concerned about </v>

871
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:33.720
<v Speaker 3>anonymity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

872
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:35.570
<v Speaker 3>I fully respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

873
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.443
<v Speaker 3>but they need to know that there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>people out there that are like mindedly </v>

874
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.100
<v Speaker 3>objecting to this.</v>

875
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.133
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one question obviously that comes up </v>

876
00:44:44.961 --> 00:44:47.600
<v Speaker 4>about this and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you want to speak to this,</v>

877
00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:48.434
<v Speaker 4>but I understand if there have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations between lots of various </v>

878
00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:56.830
<v Speaker 4>people about whether or not a legal </v>
<v Speaker 4>action is a possibility,</v>

879
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.761
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on this,</v>

880
00:44:57.761 --> 00:45:00.050
<v Speaker 4>you'd do you want to just make some very</v>
<v Speaker 4>general comments?</v>

881
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

882
00:45:03.031 --> 00:45:05.060
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this may come to a head and I and I have</v>

883
00:45:05.061 --> 00:45:05.894
<v Speaker 3>had discussions with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with many people within my own </v>

884
00:45:07.611 --> 00:45:08.444
<v Speaker 3>professional network and I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>expand that network and I've had it at </v>

885
00:45:10.821 --> 00:45:12.770
<v Speaker 3>least one person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

886
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.630
<v Speaker 3>very senior lawyer come forward and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm prepared to challenge this.</v>

887
00:45:17.631 --> 00:45:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm prepared to be the person that takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>the slings and arrows,</v>

888
00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through a challenging process.</v>

889
00:45:22.941 --> 00:45:24.050
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>

890
00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:27.950
<v Speaker 3>I imagine it would have to flow through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the law society initially,</v>

891
00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.360
<v Speaker 3>but at some point you are entitled to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Judicial Review of,</v>

892
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.253
<v Speaker 3>of regulatory decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it would get pushed out into the </v>

893
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.400
<v Speaker 3>general court system at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

894
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.010
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely it can if,</v>

895
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:41.250
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if let's say what,</v>

896
00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.760
<v Speaker 3>there are people that are willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go to the mat for this.</v>

897
00:45:43.761 --> 00:45:47.480
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I've been able to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to discern just within my own network.</v>

898
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

899
00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Well that's reassuring.</v>

900
00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the way lawyers should be.</v>

901
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.290
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to be objectionable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't we?</v>

902
00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Is we'll put that feature to good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The good news.</v>

903
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's exactly it.</v>

904
00:46:02.461 --> 00:46:04.440
<v Speaker 2>I would say from a temperamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

905
00:46:04.441 --> 00:46:05.274
<v Speaker 2>lawyers are perfectly positioned to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because they tend to be rather </v>

906
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:08.724
<v Speaker 2>disagreeable and emotionally stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we do the rest of us and I'm </v>

907
00:46:12.361 --> 00:46:14.580
<v Speaker 2>speaking as the member of another </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional,</v>

908
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

909
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.823
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We depend on you guys to be the bull </v>

910
00:46:19.951 --> 00:46:24.660
<v Speaker 2>work against any incursions into our </v>
<v Speaker 2>essential rights.</v>

911
00:46:24.661 --> 00:46:26.680
<v Speaker 2>And if you guys fold and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

912
00:46:26.681 --> 00:46:30.510
<v Speaker 2>and go along with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's really not a good day for,</v>

913
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.600
<v Speaker 2>for the English common law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

914
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:34.434
<v Speaker 2>And I think the English common law is </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most remarkable achievements </v>

915
00:46:38.341 --> 00:46:39.174
<v Speaker 2>of civilization of world civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an absolute gift and evolved legal </v>

916
00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:45.000
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works unbelievably well.</v>

917
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.133
<v Speaker 2>And to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to not object to serious challenges </v>

918
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.113
<v Speaker 2>to it at a fundamental level means that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we deserve whatever restrictions on our </v>

919
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 2>freedoms we accrue as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our cowardice.</v>

920
00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:58.883
<v Speaker 4>And to let that happen when we're really</v>
<v Speaker 4>just not paying attention would be the </v>

921
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:03.960
<v Speaker 4>ultimate tragedy.</v>

922
00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:06.013
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
