00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Hi there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm on.</v>

2
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 1>My son isn't here tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm doing this in my</v>

3
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>relatively technologically clueless </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

4
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.673
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>here's one thing I've noticed about </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting older.</v>

6
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.393
<v Speaker 1>I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept up with computer technology pretty </v>

7
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:06.684
<v Speaker 1>well I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do find maybe because of the </v>

8
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>demands on me in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm not stupid or it's possible.</v>

9
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>

10
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Nice to see you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like I've got the chat working.</v>

11
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Is Everything working?</v>

12
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.163
<v Speaker 2>Looks like it.</v>

13
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.933
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to start with some </v>

14
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>questions that people sent me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

15
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for all beat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of you for being here.</v>

16
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very much appreciated.</v>

17
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.583
<v Speaker 1>It's quite remarkable as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned that you tune in to listen to </v>

18
00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>me talk with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely do appreciate it.</v>

19
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.173
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to start with some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions that people sent me earlier </v>

20
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>and I'll keep an eye on the chat youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>chat as well.</v>

21
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.060
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the audio is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about that?</v>

23
00:01:55.061 --> 00:02:00.061
<v Speaker 1>How's the audio guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now Adam,</v>

24
00:02:00.581 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>w dot Patterson asked me a question that</v>
<v Speaker 1>got 410 volts.</v>

25
00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.863
<v Speaker 1>I am a web software developer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you hiring or can I volunteer for </v>

27
00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can build anything.</v>

28
00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I can automate things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could simply be an assistant of sorts.</v>

29
00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>what I would like to say about that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>first thank you out.</v>

31
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.003
<v Speaker 1>It's much appreciated on a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have volunteered their time to me and </v>

32
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:26.524
<v Speaker 1>their and their technological expertise </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as much as I'd like to make use of </v>

33
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:32.140
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

34
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.973
<v Speaker 1>That simple truth of the matter is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sufficiently overwhelmed by the </v>

35
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:38.014
<v Speaker 1>complexity of my life at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's very difficult to undertake a </v>

36
00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:44.740
<v Speaker 1>new collaborative project with anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean generally speaking,</v>

37
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.850
<v Speaker 1>before all this political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it before all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>political events overtook my life.</v>

39
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.060
<v Speaker 1>I was already scheduled probably about </v>
<v Speaker 1>six months to a year out.</v>

40
00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all my was already eaten up.</v>

41
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:01.114
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the addition of everything that's </v>

42
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.024
<v Speaker 1>happened in the last year or two that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has occupied my time to a degree that </v>

43
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

44
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.203
<v Speaker 1>is really somewhat unimaginable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I just can't take on additional </v>

45
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.923
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so strange because you think </v>

46
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>that help is help and that it would save</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

47
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:21.251
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:22.084
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to enter into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborative relationship with someone </v>

49
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>and especially if you want to give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit and do things properly.</v>

50
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.893
<v Speaker 1>at the moment I'm afraid that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertain any such offers even though </v>

52
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there may come a time in the future,</v>

53
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:38.794
<v Speaker 1>especially when I'm hopefully starting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work more on this online university </v>

54
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:43.290
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.763
<v Speaker 1>I've got a few projects to finish up </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that to the new personality </v>

56
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.124
<v Speaker 1>tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we've just about got all the bugs </v>

57
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:49.894
<v Speaker 1>worked out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the high school version of the </v>

58
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program are all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all set up long before any of this</v>

59
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have to clear them out before I can</v>

60
00:03:59.081 --> 00:03:59.914
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on a new project that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>finished a book over the last couple of </v>

61
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>years to called a 12 rules for life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidote to chaos,</v>

62
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:08.164
<v Speaker 1>which is now available by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested on Amazon for </v>

63
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>preorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.163
<v Speaker 1>and so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my roundabout way of saying </v>

65
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:17.974
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't accept more help at the </v>

66
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>moment because my time is too restricted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make proper use of it.</v>

67
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.193
<v Speaker 1>So I'm clay's nor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how to use the results in the new </v>

68
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:30.994
<v Speaker 1>personality tests for progress in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to compensate some sites that that </v>

69
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>received fewer points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.663
<v Speaker 1>at the risk of sounding self serving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually why we developed the </v>

71
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 1>self authoring suite was to help people </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve their,</v>

72
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.853
<v Speaker 1>let's say performance and mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't have direct evidence that </v>

73
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will improve personality,</v>

74
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect that that evidence would </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a very long time to accumulate.</v>

75
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 1>What we do know is that the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring suite,</v>

76
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 1>especially the future authoring suite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps people,</v>

77
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>helps university students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

78
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:06.664
<v Speaker 1>stay enrolled in university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It increases the probability of that by </v>

79
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 1>about 25 percent and increased his grade</v>
<v Speaker 1>point average by about the same.</v>

80
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:17.761
<v Speaker 1>And there's good theoretical reasons for</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that writing is a good way of,</v>

81
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as writing about yourself and about your</v>

82
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:27.061
<v Speaker 1>past and about your future is a good way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of catalyzing personality transformation</v>

83
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:28.564
<v Speaker 1>because it appears that personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human psyche is organized at the </v>

84
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 1>highest level of abstraction.</v>

85
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Using something like self narrative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a well developed narrative makes a frame</v>

86
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:39.904
<v Speaker 1>for your life and helps you stabilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>your negative emotions and also </v>

87
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:43.714
<v Speaker 1>experienced more positive emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you only experienced positive </v>

88
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:50.971
<v Speaker 1>emotion in relationship to a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can make goal directed activity</v>

89
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>a lot more rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

90
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:53.824
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot easier to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities that aren't intrinsically </v>

91
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>rewarding if they're linked to something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you really find important.</v>

92
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say if you want to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your personality,</v>

93
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you have to do is figure</v>

94
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:05.984
<v Speaker 1>out who it is that you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to make a plan and </v>

95
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to clean up your past as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

96
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:12.134
<v Speaker 1>And the self authoring suite was </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed quite carefully in order to </v>

97
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 1>help people do that with a relative </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum of effort.</v>

98
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's easy because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a relative minimum minimum of effort</v>

99
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>compared to other technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

100
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.853
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like longterm psychotherapy and to make </v>

101
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>it cost effective as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

102
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another question voted up 77 votes.</v>

103
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Australia is holding a plebiscite on </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether to legalize gay marriage.</v>

104
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm against the yes campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only because it's backed by Cultural</v>

105
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.383
<v Speaker 1>Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious to hear your views on gay </v>

106
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:52.394
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

107
00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be against,</v>

108
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.020
<v Speaker 1>it was backed by Cultural Marxists </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't clear to me that,</v>

109
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will satisfy the ever increasing.</v>

110
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.080
<v Speaker 1>What would you call a demand for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>assault on traditional modes of being.</v>

111
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Now with regards to gay marriage </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>

112
00:07:16.081 --> 00:07:18.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a really tough one for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

113
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine</v>

114
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I can't do anything really other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>spout platitudes about it.</v>

115
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I suppose unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.280
<v Speaker 1>is if the marital vows are taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

117
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.653
<v Speaker 1>then it seems to me that it's a means </v>
<v Speaker 1>whereby gay people can be integrated </v>

118
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:47.314
<v Speaker 1>more thoroughly and to standard society </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's probably a good thing and </v>

119
00:07:50.531 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe that would decrease promiscuity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a public health problem.</v>

120
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although obviously that's not limited to</v>

121
00:07:57.071 --> 00:07:58.600
<v Speaker 1>gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

122
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.750
<v Speaker 1>although gay men tend to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>promiscuous than average,</v>

123
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.273
<v Speaker 1>probably because there's no women to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bind them with regards to their sexual </v>

124
00:08:07.331 --> 00:08:12.331
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

125
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:16.870
<v Speaker 1>is that it does seem to me to be part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wedge and it isn't obvious to me that,</v>

126
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.903
<v Speaker 1>that legalizing gay marriage has done </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to decrease the demands that </v>

127
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 1>the radical left neo marxists types are </v>
<v Speaker 1>placing on traditional society.</v>

128
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

129
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.980
<v Speaker 1>those are my views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they're confused,</v>

130
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:32.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm in favor of extending the </v>

131
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.163
<v Speaker 1>bounds of traditional relationships to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who wouldn't be involved in a </v>

132
00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:41.604
<v Speaker 1>traditional longterm relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm concerned about the undermining </v>

133
00:08:46.261 --> 00:08:48.390
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of traditional modes of being,</v>

134
00:08:48.391 --> 00:08:49.224
<v Speaker 1>including marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is technically and historically </v>

135
00:08:52.111 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 1>been a union between a man and a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

136
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.150
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of raising children in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a stable and,</v>

137
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.063
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

138
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an optimal and stable environment.</v>

139
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.313
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and marriage has already taken a fair </v>

140
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 1>bit of damage over the last few decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

141
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 1>poor people are increasingly less likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be married and that's really not good</v>

142
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 1>for them as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

143
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:17.334
<v Speaker 1>I'm currently going through a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a first time mum with a nine month </v>

144
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:20.424
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel depressed and anxious and I'm </v>

145
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 1>highly neurotic and volatile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you suggest anything to help me be a</v>

146
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:26.214
<v Speaker 1>better mom?</v>

147
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:30.060
<v Speaker 1>lots of people have a hard time with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're nine months old.</v>

149
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I guess the first question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you getting enough sleep?</v>

150
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you have enough help?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you eating enough?</v>

151
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Especially in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:38.993
<v Speaker 1>and you're gonna feel highly neurotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and volatile to some degree because </v>

153
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.803
<v Speaker 1>while you've been through quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological trauma and it's very </v>

154
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:49.761
<v Speaker 1>demanding to have a newborn baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the best thing I could say,</v>

155
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.693
<v Speaker 1>not knowing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to make sure that you have people </v>

156
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:56.000
<v Speaker 1>around that you can talk to about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby and that you can and,</v>

157
00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:01.030
<v Speaker 1>and that you can take a break when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to and have someone spell you.</v>

158
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's often the role that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>husband plays in the first year of,</v>

159
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.050
<v Speaker 1>of a baby's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he can,</v>

160
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:08.723
<v Speaker 1>he's supposed to watch the mother to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that she doesn't get </v>

161
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:11.304
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by the demands of the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would hope that you're able to </v>

162
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:19.530
<v Speaker 1>ask for support when you need it and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be afraid of asking for support,</v>

163
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:20.364
<v Speaker 1>especially to get a rest and to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to eat because that's really </v>

164
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:24.630
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the morning.</v>

165
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.473
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you anything really </v>

166
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:29.304
<v Speaker 1>specific unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that I don't know anything about </v>

167
00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:34.150
<v Speaker 1>the specifics of your situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

168
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 1>if it gets out of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:37.933
<v Speaker 1>you should go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I should say as if it </v>

170
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 1>gets out of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should go speak with your,</v>

171
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 1>with your doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a professional,</v>

172
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:45.770
<v Speaker 1>because you might have postpartum </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

173
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:46.973
<v Speaker 1>There's some dispute about whether that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists and as an independent diagnostic </v>

174
00:10:51.121 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 1>entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can certainly be physiologically</v>

175
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:54.474
<v Speaker 1>stressed and if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>predisposition to depression then that </v>

176
00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 1>kind of physiological stress and sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>disruption can bring it on.</v>

177
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.600
<v Speaker 1>So I would say if it really gets out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

178
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 1>don't hesitate to go talk to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional.</v>

179
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:05.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

180
00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:06.570
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

181
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.403
<v Speaker 1>it may be necessary to do that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to fall too far down a </v>

182
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

183
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.850
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emma Joe Lovano,</v>

184
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 1>vic says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson,</v>

185
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:20.574
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this isn't a question for what </v>

186
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:22.674
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a 22 year old girl and your videos </v>

187
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:26.940
<v Speaker 1>are helping me so much with figuring my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life out.</v>

188
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.510
<v Speaker 1>You are alone are helping me be braver </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

189
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really happy about that.</v>

190
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I like your emphasis on bravery,</v>

191
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:34.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that we've </v>

192
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:40.170
<v Speaker 1>learned as clinicians say is that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you help people overcome anxiety,</v>

193
00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that you make them less anxious</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily.</v>

194
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.493
<v Speaker 1>Although I think you could do that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree by having people confront </v>

195
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>some of the demons in their past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of making them less anxious,</v>

196
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:52.080
<v Speaker 1>you make them braver and that's not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

197
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.943
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's lots of reason to be </v>

198
00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 1>anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world's full of uncertainty and fear</v>

199
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.560
<v Speaker 1>and reasons for fear and reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

200
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.413
<v Speaker 1>but to be braver means to confront those</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily and that's really a good </v>

201
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:04.534
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

202
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 1>When will the next Bible lecture </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred?</v>

203
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.693
<v Speaker 1>October 24th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll be three of them before the end </v>

204
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 1>of December and I want to keep them </v>
<v Speaker 1>going into the future.</v>

205
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:12.694
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been quite successful I would </v>

206
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would like to go through the whole</v>

207
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that would probably take me the</v>

208
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:19.894
<v Speaker 1>rest of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do really think it's necessary </v>

209
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:22.444
<v Speaker 1>because it is the case that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The specific narratives and the </v>

210
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.413
<v Speaker 1>metanarrative that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are embedded in the biblical </v>

211
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:30.124
<v Speaker 1>stories and its surrounding literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>are at the fundament of Western culture </v>

212
00:12:34.371 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 1>and we need to reconnect with that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to make sure that our,</v>

213
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.913
<v Speaker 1>that our culture stays strong and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think it's particularly strong </v>

214
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 1>right now and that's a very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very bad thing for everyone.</v>

215
00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:46.024
<v Speaker 1>It leads to nihilism and despair and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an ability to plan for a meaningful </v>

216
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 1>future and cynicism and all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

217
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:55.624
<v Speaker 1>and that's especially bad for young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because when you're young and </v>

218
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.620
<v Speaker 1>your life is ahead of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the last.</v>

219
00:13:00.621 --> 00:13:03.790
<v Speaker 1>It's the last time that you need to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic and cynical.</v>

220
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

221
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.943
<v Speaker 1>Shark Pyre to says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you dispute the theory that </v>

222
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Jesus is just a rewrite of the Sun God </v>
<v Speaker 1>myth?</v>

223
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:21.843
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't necessarily dispute that </v>

224
00:13:23.061 --> 00:13:26.690
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I would dispute the just.</v>

225
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean the strange things about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical stories and let's say about the</v>

226
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:34.600
<v Speaker 1>new testament stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they echo across multiple levels</v>

227
00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 1>of analysis and so there is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>astrological element to the Christ.</v>

228
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 1>A story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

229
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 1>that you wrote about a fair bit in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book called Ion,</v>

230
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:45.394
<v Speaker 1>which is a very terrifying book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are echoes of the myths of the </v>

231
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:49.090
<v Speaker 1>sudden God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

232
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.433
<v Speaker 1>but the funny thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things I can't </v>

233
00:13:52.781 --> 00:13:54.910
<v Speaker 1>really understand about the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

234
00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:55.744
<v Speaker 1>is that they manifest themselves at </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple levels of interpretation </v>

235
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:00.544
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could say that that's merely a </v>

236
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:05.110
<v Speaker 1>consequence of continual historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>reworking.</v>

237
00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:05.944
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that could be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they manifest </v>

238
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:10.624
<v Speaker 1>themselves as a personal story and as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmic story and as a historical story </v>

239
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:15.484
<v Speaker 1>and as a mythological story and that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all works at the same time strikes me </v>

240
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:20.044
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as pointing to something that's really </v>

241
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.340
<v Speaker 1>somewhat beyond our current level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>

242
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.333
<v Speaker 1>I can't elaborate on that a lot because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would take us into places that I </v>

243
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:30.544
<v Speaker 1>really would rather not go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do believe that there's something </v>

244
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.870
<v Speaker 1>synchronous using young's terminology </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

245
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a death and resurrection story.</v>

246
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.273
<v Speaker 1>And the synchronous element is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is associated with the fact that the </v>

247
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:48.400
<v Speaker 1>story echoes across so many levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

248
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:53.910
<v Speaker 1>And my sense is that when something </v>
<v Speaker 1>echoes across many levels of analysis,</v>

249
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 1>that means that it's approaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like a very deep truth.</v>

250
00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.293
<v Speaker 1>So I know that isn't normally how we go </v>
<v Speaker 1>about determining what constitutes </v>

251
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:03.104
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know everything about how </v>

252
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:05.774
<v Speaker 1>to determine what constitutes truth yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are many things that we have </v>

253
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 1>yet to figure out and that's certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them as far as I'm concerned.</v>

254
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.323
<v Speaker 1>So there is a Sungard myth element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly parallels between Christ and </v>

255
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 1>horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

256
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.373
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you can just say it's </v>

257
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 1>just a rewrite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the,</v>

258
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's historically </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a psychologically accurate.</v>

259
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Have you watched rick and morty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

260
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.673
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people have told me to watch rick </v>

261
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 1>and Morty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they said it's very dark and.</v>

262
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Well that doesn't bother me so much I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose,</v>

263
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:46.640
<v Speaker 1>although I'm plenty dark perhaps without</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding to it.</v>

264
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.960
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

265
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I would like to watch it and I probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

266
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:53.990
<v Speaker 1>So I would love for you to do come and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a talk in Montreal.</v>

267
00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never know that might happen.</v>

268
00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to Gad Saad about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair bit,</v>

269
00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's coming to Toronto November 11th so </v>

270
00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:02.294
<v Speaker 1>we can do the talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was shut down by Ryerson back in </v>

271
00:16:04.761 --> 00:16:06.950
<v Speaker 1>August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm looking forward to that.</v>

272
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.353
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to stop drinking </v>

273
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:14.300
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and start doing my best?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my psychology degree,</v>

274
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.630
<v Speaker 1>it's affecting my study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can do very well if I stop.</v>

275
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm 26.</v>

276
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

277
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.103
<v Speaker 1>what I would say is I think you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the future authoring program and you </v>

278
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:29.144
<v Speaker 1>should really concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a section in it that helps you </v>

279
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>determine what your positive view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your future would be,</v>

280
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:40.220
<v Speaker 1>but another section that helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine what would happen in your life</v>

281
00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:41.054
<v Speaker 1>if you're negative habits got out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and one of the things that can </v>

282
00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 1>really help you control your alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 1>intake is to really,</v>

283
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:48.254
<v Speaker 1>really think through what you're giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and where you could be in five years </v>

284
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:57.011
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get it under control and </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivity to alcoholism can be a really</v>

285
00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.880
<v Speaker 1>vicious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

286
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 1>lots of people get dragged down into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mud by alcohol,</v>

287
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:03.993
<v Speaker 1>excessive alcohol intake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're sensitive to the </v>

288
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:08.840
<v Speaker 1>opiate response that alcohol can </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>

289
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you drink,</v>

290
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:13.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get alert and,</v>

291
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

292
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:14.893
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say more enthusiastic and </v>

293
00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 1>energetic and then you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop drinking.</v>

294
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.943
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely a bad sign with </v>

295
00:17:21.111 --> 00:17:21.944
<v Speaker 1>regards to developing alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say you need to figure out </v>

296
00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:26.534
<v Speaker 1>something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more important to you that </v>

297
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:31.310
<v Speaker 1>drinking and also think through very </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

298
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.620
<v Speaker 1>The negative consequences of continuing </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

299
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 1>You're at about the age 26 where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should stop.</v>

300
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean guys who are going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally start slow down pretty,</v>

301
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.890
<v Speaker 1>pretty intensely around that age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

302
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get also treating your psychology,</v>

303
00:17:46.821 --> 00:17:49.470
<v Speaker 1>studying as a fulltime job can also be </v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>

304
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.443
<v Speaker 1>get up at eight morning or 7:30 in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and start hitting the books by </v>

306
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:58.590
<v Speaker 1>nine and put in a 68 hour day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then even if you do keep drinking,</v>

307
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 1>at least you're moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I say about that.</v>

308
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Are you a science fiction fan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You referenced timelines,</v>

309
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:08.994
<v Speaker 1>starship troopers in lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your ideas often remind me of Harry </v>

310
00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Selden's plan from Asia mobs foundation </v>
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>

311
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:15.321
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

312
00:18:15.321 --> 00:18:18.410
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a long time ago now,</v>

313
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.593
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in this town called Fairview </v>

314
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.303
<v Speaker 1>Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a town of about 3000 people a </v>

315
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:29.390
<v Speaker 1>way the hell north 350 miles northwest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Edmonton.</v>

316
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 1>And I have this neighbor across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street across the La actually.</v>

317
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And he had a huge science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>library.</v>

318
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.460
<v Speaker 1>It must've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

319
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.590
<v Speaker 1>5,000 books there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies,</v>

320
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.443
<v Speaker 1>1960,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies classics like Heinlein </v>

321
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:44.870
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how's it Marvin?</v>

322
00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.093
<v Speaker 1>He would let me go over there and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20 books at a time and I was </v>

323
00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:49.874
<v Speaker 1>reading about a book a day at that point</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I read science fiction like mad </v>

324
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.850
<v Speaker 1>probably till I was about 19 or so and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little younger than that.</v>

325
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.950
<v Speaker 1>And then turn more to classic literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got to college.</v>

326
00:19:00.951 --> 00:19:02.150
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

327
00:19:02.151 --> 00:19:02.984
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also partly as a consequence of some </v>

328
00:19:04.491 --> 00:19:07.550
<v Speaker 1>lessons that the local librarian taught </v>
<v Speaker 1>me about what to read.</v>

329
00:19:07.551 --> 00:19:08.384
<v Speaker 1>So I was a science fiction fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read science fiction for a </v>

330
00:19:12.471 --> 00:19:15.290
<v Speaker 1>very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I was pretty happy with it when</v>

331
00:19:15.291 --> 00:19:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

332
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Richard Vanc carpet and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

333
00:19:34.931 --> 00:19:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I phobia.</v>

334
00:19:35.991 --> 00:19:37.570
<v Speaker 1>And would love to hear about anxiety.</v>

335
00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:40.203
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a rough thing to have </v>

336
00:19:41.441 --> 00:19:43.150
<v Speaker 1>agoraphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So agoraphobic,</v>

337
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.103
<v Speaker 1>get increasingly isolated and afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things outside of their domain and </v>

338
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:53.530
<v Speaker 1>familiarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often what happens with agora phobia</v>

339
00:19:53.531 --> 00:19:56.320
<v Speaker 1>is that people who develop it or afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of two things,</v>

340
00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:57.723
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid that something is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go dreadfully wrong with their </v>

341
00:19:59.771 --> 00:20:01.960
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to their hearts.</v>

342
00:20:01.961 --> 00:20:02.794
<v Speaker 1>So they start to become afraid that </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they'll have a heart attack and </v>

343
00:20:05.141 --> 00:20:05.974
<v Speaker 1>that they'll die in public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far from a hospital and that don't make </v>

344
00:20:08.681 --> 00:20:11.280
<v Speaker 1>a fool of themselves while they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or well,</v>

345
00:20:11.281 --> 00:20:11.791
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

346
00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:12.624
<v Speaker 1>they think they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a combination of two fears and </v>

347
00:20:15.071 --> 00:20:15.904
<v Speaker 1>one is fear of mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other is fear of social </v>

348
00:20:18.401 --> 00:20:19.234
<v Speaker 1>judgement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think about those as the </v>

349
00:20:20.501 --> 00:20:21.334
<v Speaker 1>two main categories of feared that </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed people because one is </v>

350
00:20:24.131 --> 00:20:24.964
<v Speaker 1>associated obviously with mortality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and the other is associated with </v>

351
00:20:28.391 --> 00:20:29.224
<v Speaker 1>exclusion from the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course can lead to mortality </v>

352
00:20:31.781 --> 00:20:32.290
<v Speaker 1>and death.</v>

353
00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.780
<v Speaker 1>And so the agoraphobic skip the worst of</v>
<v Speaker 1>both worlds.</v>

354
00:20:34.781 --> 00:20:38.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's often a disease of middle aged </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

355
00:20:38.201 --> 00:20:39.034
<v Speaker 1>but not always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are often people who've been </v>

356
00:20:40.811 --> 00:20:41.644
<v Speaker 1>somewhat dependent in their previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and then undergo some traumatic </v>

357
00:20:44.951 --> 00:20:45.784
<v Speaker 1>event like a divorce or the death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone close and at the same time are </v>

358
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:50.854
<v Speaker 1>perhaps experiencing heart palpitations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with menopause that </v>

359
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:59.070
<v Speaker 1>brings ideas of mortality to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can trigger a panic attack,</v>

360
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:00.850
<v Speaker 1>which is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

361
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant experience to say the least.</v>

362
00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.323
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that fear of panic attack </v>

363
00:21:08.751 --> 00:21:09.584
<v Speaker 1>starts making people avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when Agora Phobia develops </v>

364
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:14.670
<v Speaker 1>out of anxiety disorders with panic </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>

365
00:21:14.671 --> 00:21:15.504
<v Speaker 1>So you go out and maybe you go to a mall</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're in a crowd and maybe </v>

366
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

367
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:21.784
<v Speaker 1>your heartbeat and about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone close to you has died and maybe </v>

368
00:21:24.671 --> 00:21:25.504
<v Speaker 1>then you become aware of your heartbeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start to panic because you feel </v>

369
00:21:28.271 --> 00:21:32.500
<v Speaker 1>that maybe it's the beat is irregular or</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that or that.</v>

370
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 1>You can't detect it as well as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually can.</v>

371
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.350
<v Speaker 1>And then that makes your heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerate because it makes you afraid.</v>

372
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:39.184
<v Speaker 1>And then you get more more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call sensitive to that </v>

373
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.070
<v Speaker 1>and that makes your heart rate beat even</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

374
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:45.904
<v Speaker 1>And then you panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get to the hospital to get </v>

375
00:21:47.921 --> 00:21:48.754
<v Speaker 1>checked out to make sure that you're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and then you make your fatal </v>

376
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:52.594
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you avoid going back to </v>

377
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:55.054
<v Speaker 1>the mall and then you go to a grocery </v>
<v Speaker 1>store and the same thing happens and </v>

378
00:21:58.181 --> 00:22:00.310
<v Speaker 1>then you start to avoid going to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grocery store.</v>

379
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.413
<v Speaker 1>Then you start to avoid avoiding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subway or taxis or crowds or anywhere </v>

380
00:22:05.321 --> 00:22:07.990
<v Speaker 1>you might get trapped and wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to get to the hospital.</v>

381
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.123
<v Speaker 1>Soon you end up avoiding everything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when your life really starts to </v>

382
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:14.140
<v Speaker 1>become a living hell.</v>

383
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.460
<v Speaker 1>So the basic way to treat or a phobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two ways.</v>

384
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.520
<v Speaker 1>One is to develop some control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing,</v>

385
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.383
<v Speaker 1>to do progressive relaxation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way you do that is that you </v>

386
00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:25.714
<v Speaker 1>start with your start by concentrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your toes and your feet and your </v>

387
00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:31.940
<v Speaker 1>ankles and your shins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your knees.</v>

388
00:22:31.941 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 1>You move all the way up your body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let the tension flow out of your muscles</v>

389
00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:41.401
<v Speaker 1>and regulate your breathing calmly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully so that you can learn to relax</v>

390
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:42.963
<v Speaker 1>and then you go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go out voluntarily am start to </v>

391
00:22:47.261 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 1>confront the things you're afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

392
00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:50.524
<v Speaker 1>if you're afraid of the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you go to the parking lot and you </v>

393
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:56.580
<v Speaker 1>look at them all and then you walk close</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the door and you look inside,</v>

394
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go home because that's </v>

395
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 1>enough for one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you do progressive exposure.</v>

396
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.123
<v Speaker 1>And that's the base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the basic rules of psychotherapy </v>

397
00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:08.770
<v Speaker 1>is that if you're afraid of something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you progressively and voluntarily expose</v>

398
00:23:08.771 --> 00:23:09.604
<v Speaker 1>yourself to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that generally it's the voluntary </v>

399
00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>exposure that's curative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

400
00:23:13.841 --> 00:23:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Accidental exposure could make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>

401
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:16.624
<v Speaker 1>but voluntary exposure can be curative </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's sort of associated with the </v>

402
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.340
<v Speaker 1>myth of the hero and the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the hero is the person who goes</v>

403
00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:28.390
<v Speaker 1>out voluntarily to confront the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and overcome it and get the treasure.</v>

404
00:23:28.391 --> 00:23:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And so if you voluntarily expose </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to things you're afraid of,</v>

405
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:37.230
<v Speaker 1>like no more than you can tolerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll find that you get braver and</v>

406
00:23:37.271 --> 00:23:40.600
<v Speaker 1>you learned that you can tolerate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear and that can chase the agora phobia</v>

407
00:23:40.601 --> 00:23:41.434
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very important to do it on a </v>

408
00:23:43.361 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 1>regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you agoraphobic full fledged,</v>

409
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:47.534
<v Speaker 1>agoraphobic and should probably consult </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional help because it's very </v>

410
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 1>tricky condition and it can be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can really impair you badly.</v>

411
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would recommend.</v>

412
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.033
<v Speaker 1>Hi Jp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering how the computer program </v>

413
00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:05.890
<v Speaker 1>that rates university courses as </v>
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile or not is coming along well.</v>

414
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.933
<v Speaker 1>It isn't rating them as worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rating the mess postmodern Neil </v>

415
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Marxist or not and it's actually fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>

416
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I was going to launch it and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't design it a,</v>

417
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.373
<v Speaker 1>somebody volunteered to design it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented it to me and it seems to work </v>

418
00:24:20.531 --> 00:24:21.970
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

419
00:24:21.971 --> 00:24:22.804
<v Speaker 1>I was going to launch it at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>August so that this year is university </v>

420
00:24:25.781 --> 00:24:26.614
<v Speaker 1>students could benefit from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was the Charlottesville event </v>

421
00:24:29.321 --> 00:24:30.154
<v Speaker 1>and then I got busy and I also wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling great and so I just didn't hit </v>

422
00:24:34.031 --> 00:24:34.864
<v Speaker 1>the window of time properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I hope to be able to launch it for </v>

423
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.023
<v Speaker 1>the January incoming class to do a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what's wrong with the university </v>

424
00:24:43.631 --> 00:24:45.550
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That many things that are wrong with the</v>

425
00:24:45.551 --> 00:24:47.650
<v Speaker 1>university system and to launch the </v>
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

426
00:24:47.651 --> 00:24:48.484
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also had people suggest to me that </v>

427
00:24:50.501 --> 00:24:54.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe it wasn't a good idea that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would increase polarization,</v>

428
00:24:54.221 --> 00:24:57.070
<v Speaker 1>but I've thought about that for about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month and a half.</v>

429
00:24:57.071 --> 00:24:59.320
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the benefit to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer.</v>

430
00:24:59.321 --> 00:25:03.550
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the informed student </v>
<v Speaker 1>outweighs any danger of polarization.</v>

431
00:25:03.551 --> 00:25:04.384
<v Speaker 1>And besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something has to be done because the </v>

432
00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:08.500
<v Speaker 1>situation in the universities is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

433
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.873
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

434
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.420
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's see what else we've got here in</v>

435
00:25:13.421 --> 00:25:14.380
<v Speaker 1>the chat room.</v>

436
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Dvs S,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k e r three.</v>

437
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.820
<v Speaker 1>That's quite a mouthful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says I'm studying to be a teacher,</v>

438
00:25:24.821 --> 00:25:27.550
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also an introvert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could this be a big problem?</v>

439
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Can I still be a successful teacher?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

440
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.533
<v Speaker 1>what seems to predict success at </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching best is intelligence and </v>

441
00:25:35.651 --> 00:25:38.230
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the data so far.</v>

442
00:25:38.231 --> 00:25:41.860
<v Speaker 1>So if you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll probably be fine.</v>

443
00:25:41.861 --> 00:25:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean extra introverts have a harder </v>
<v Speaker 1>time speaking in front of groups,</v>

444
00:25:46.271 --> 00:25:47.800
<v Speaker 1>but you can learn to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

445
00:25:47.801 --> 00:25:50.950
<v Speaker 1>an introvert can become a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful public speaker.</v>

446
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.770
<v Speaker 1>May Not enjoy it the same way that an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extrovert might.</v>

447
00:25:53.771 --> 00:25:56.260
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn the skills.</v>

448
00:25:56.261 --> 00:25:57.094
<v Speaker 1>And what I would recommend for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>introvert is the same thing that I do </v>

449
00:26:00.071 --> 00:26:02.650
<v Speaker 1>when I'm lecturing is I never talked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole group.</v>

450
00:26:02.651 --> 00:26:04.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter how big the crowd is,</v>

451
00:26:04.661 --> 00:26:05.494
<v Speaker 1>I'm always picking out individuals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the group and talking specifically to </v>

452
00:26:08.861 --> 00:26:09.130
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

453
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:09.963
<v Speaker 1>So I'll make a point to an individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I watched their face and see if </v>

454
00:26:12.731 --> 00:26:14.530
<v Speaker 1>they're nodding and understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

455
00:26:14.531 --> 00:26:17.620
<v Speaker 1>because that way you make contact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire audience and then,</v>

456
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.833
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll all talk to someone for about 15 </v>

457
00:26:20.171 --> 00:26:22.300
<v Speaker 1>seconds or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put them on the spot too</v>

458
00:26:22.301 --> 00:26:23.134
<v Speaker 1>much and then I shift my attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else and I sort of pin point </v>

459
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:27.334
<v Speaker 1>around the room and that keeps everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the room focused on what I'm saying </v>

460
00:26:30.431 --> 00:26:34.090
<v Speaker 1>because each person reflects the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd back to you.</v>

461
00:26:34.091 --> 00:26:34.924
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say if you're an </v>
<v Speaker 1>introvert or if you want to speak in </v>

462
00:26:37.121 --> 00:26:39.670
<v Speaker 1>public in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about the damn crowd.</v>

463
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speak to people one on one at a time and</v>

464
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:47.330
<v Speaker 1>an introvert can do that just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

465
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.570
<v Speaker 1>that's where your strengths would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say you're,</v>

466
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.473
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsuccessful as a teacher if you don't </v>

467
00:26:54.991 --> 00:26:57.270
<v Speaker 1>work hard at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not interested in it.</v>

468
00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 1>So if you're an introvert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't worry about that.</v>

469
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that'll be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest problem that you'll face.</v>

470
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.003
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

471
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.590
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick's are overrated.</v>

472
00:27:18.591 --> 00:27:19.424
<v Speaker 1>Says ditch your barber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my barber quite a bit to hit his </v>

473
00:27:22.761 --> 00:27:23.594
<v Speaker 1>haircuts a little shorter than I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to and there's some reasons </v>

474
00:27:26.061 --> 00:27:27.020
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

475
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.610
<v Speaker 1>um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

476
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.433
<v Speaker 1>what can I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hair grows back and it will be just </v>

477
00:27:32.931 --> 00:27:34.970
<v Speaker 1>as beautiful as I was before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No time.</v>

478
00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:35.893
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's how that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See now Richard Van Copeland says my </v>

479
00:27:39.261 --> 00:27:41.300
<v Speaker 1>haircuts looking fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who's that?</v>

480
00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Nick's are overrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the APP.</v>

481
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

482
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.713
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

483
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.510
<v Speaker 1>would you consider having a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Thomas Soul that Sam,</v>

484
00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:00.590
<v Speaker 1>dogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogen,</v>

485
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.560
<v Speaker 1>dogen probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

486
00:28:02.561 --> 00:28:03.394
<v Speaker 1>I definitely considered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking hard about reaching out to </v>

487
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.273
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some discussions coming up that </v>

488
00:28:07.821 --> 00:28:08.654
<v Speaker 1>you might be interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to talk on Jocko willink </v>

489
00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:14.283
<v Speaker 1>podcast and he was the leader of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Navy seals team in Ramadan and he's </v>

490
00:28:19.461 --> 00:28:20.294
<v Speaker 1>quite the tough character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him down in San Diego a while </v>

491
00:28:22.941 --> 00:28:24.290
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month ago or so,</v>

492
00:28:24.291 --> 00:28:25.124
<v Speaker 1>and that was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a video already prepared that's </v>

493
00:28:30.501 --> 00:28:32.420
<v Speaker 1>an interview with our out in hers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elite,</v>

494
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:33.563
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was done by skype and needs some </v>

495
00:28:35.391 --> 00:28:37.310
<v Speaker 1>editing and so that's been a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>delayed.</v>

496
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.133
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed or discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a discussion with Nina Paley who </v>

497
00:28:41.461 --> 00:28:43.580
<v Speaker 1>was a great animator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys should look her up.</v>

498
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.313
<v Speaker 1>That's Nina Paley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She animated a lot of the Old Testament </v>

499
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:53.380
<v Speaker 1>and set it to music and I think your </v>
<v Speaker 1>animations are unbelievably beautiful.</v>

500
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.340
<v Speaker 1>And the meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has great musical tastes.</v>

501
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.880
<v Speaker 1>They're illegal videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically she's making an illegal movie.</v>

502
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

503
00:29:01.551 --> 00:29:02.384
<v Speaker 1>I really liked your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also had a discussion with Claire </v>

504
00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Lehmann who runs quill at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a new newsmagazine online,</v>

505
00:29:09.591 --> 00:29:14.140
<v Speaker 1>which I think has got real promise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a good discussion and um,</v>

506
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.610
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that helped?</v>

507
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it on and you probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>know or maybe you don't.</v>

508
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just finished a discussion with </v>

509
00:29:22.071 --> 00:29:22.904
<v Speaker 1>Camille Paglia and we went down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a film crew down there to </v>

510
00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:31.331
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia and met her at her </v>
<v Speaker 1>university and we talked for a couple of</v>

511
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.310
<v Speaker 1>hours and that was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's quite the fireball,</v>

512
00:29:34.311 --> 00:29:38.870
<v Speaker 1>that woman and unbelievably verbally </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluent and sharp.</v>

513
00:29:38.871 --> 00:29:42.910
<v Speaker 1>And so I finally met someone who could </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than me and,</v>

514
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably good.</v>

515
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.263
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really enjoyed speaking with her </v>

516
00:29:47.361 --> 00:29:50.680
<v Speaker 1>and I think about 100,000 people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched that now in a day,</v>

517
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:51.640
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty good.</v>

518
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.473
<v Speaker 1>So we talked about postmodernism and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>malaise that confronts the modern </v>

519
00:29:56.441 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 1>university and all of those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

520
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:02.320
<v Speaker 1>So Robin Deon says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever Miss Montreal?</v>

521
00:30:02.321 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just in Montreal.</v>

522
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I went there to saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw a band called half moon run,</v>

523
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:07.534
<v Speaker 1>which are abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would highly recommend they were </v>

524
00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:09.634
<v Speaker 1>playing with the Montreal Symphony </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orchestra and I got invited to meet one </v>

525
00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:16.960
<v Speaker 1>of the singers and also go in and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the concert,</v>

526
00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:18.040
<v Speaker 1>which was excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

527
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:20.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd Miss Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal is a great city for you.</v>

528
00:30:20.261 --> 00:30:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Americans who are listening should go </v>
<v Speaker 1>visit Montreal.</v>

529
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool place and spend a week there</v>

530
00:30:25.631 --> 00:30:26.510
<v Speaker 1>in the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

531
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good city in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

532
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.133
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

533
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:41.550
<v Speaker 1>it seems we are bound to repeat history </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what his old becomes new again.</v>

534
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that we can't seem to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium within a society?</v>

535
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Ideas begin with good intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lead towards the extreme.</v>

536
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

537
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:51.023
<v Speaker 1>the reason we can't find equilibrium is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the environment that we live in </v>

538
00:30:54.391 --> 00:30:56.490
<v Speaker 1>isn't an equilibrium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I.</v>

539
00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I kind of imagine it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're,</v>

540
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:00.543
<v Speaker 1>we're traversing the back of a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is obviously a symbolic reference </v>

541
00:31:03.811 --> 00:31:08.670
<v Speaker 1>of the giant serpent and it's and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaves back and forth and you don't know</v>

542
00:31:08.671 --> 00:31:11.250
<v Speaker 1>at any moment which way it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>curve and turn.</v>

543
00:31:11.251 --> 00:31:15.030
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes it turns to the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it turns to the left.</v>

544
00:31:15.031 --> 00:31:15.864
<v Speaker 1>And what that means politically is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometime we have to turn to the right </v>

545
00:31:18.331 --> 00:31:19.164
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes we have to turn to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left and we don't know exactly when </v>

546
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.260
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you call,</v>

547
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.720
<v Speaker 1>we don't know exactly how to time that.</v>

548
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:28.853
<v Speaker 1>And so what we all have to do is keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>our eyes open and tell the truth and </v>

549
00:31:31.351 --> 00:31:32.184
<v Speaker 1>discuss things with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with people who have </v>

550
00:31:34.171 --> 00:31:35.004
<v Speaker 1>political beliefs that are different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than us so that we can ensure that we </v>

551
00:31:37.771 --> 00:31:40.350
<v Speaker 1>haven't tilted too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way or the other,</v>

552
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.940
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I'm an advocate of free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech or one of the many reasons I'm an</v>

553
00:31:44.941 --> 00:31:49.470
<v Speaker 1>advocate of free speech is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the continual dialogue between people of</v>

554
00:31:49.471 --> 00:31:50.304
<v Speaker 1>different temperamental types that keeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>us oriented as close as we can to the </v>

555
00:31:53.941 --> 00:31:54.774
<v Speaker 1>center of the serpents back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there is no permanent </v>

556
00:31:57.271 --> 00:31:58.104
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only the equilibrium that's </v>

557
00:31:59.521 --> 00:32:04.521
<v Speaker 1>produced by continual negotiation and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy is a formalized negotiation.</v>

558
00:32:04.831 --> 00:32:06.260
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

559
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.621
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

560
00:32:07.621 --> 00:32:10.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's free speech that keeps it </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy and alive.</v>

561
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:15.200
<v Speaker 1>So there's no permanent equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium state except death.</v>

562
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's always negotiation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships too,</v>

563
00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:20.124
<v Speaker 1>like if you have an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship or a familial relationship </v>

564
00:32:22.741 --> 00:32:25.800
<v Speaker 1>or even a friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no final equilibrium state.</v>

565
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.633
<v Speaker 1>You have to communicate with each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly all the time and keep the </v>

566
00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:30.474
<v Speaker 1>relationship moving to adjust the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that the relationship is </v>

567
00:32:33.481 --> 00:32:35.970
<v Speaker 1>operating in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it stays alive.</v>

568
00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:38.850
<v Speaker 1>And in an intimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm intimate relationship like a,</v>

569
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a continual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

570
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.300
<v Speaker 1>it takes continual effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

571
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.153
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile effort and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be conscious and awake </v>

572
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.480
<v Speaker 1>to keep your relationship alive and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be communicating all the time.</v>

573
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:51.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not all the time because you can </v>

574
00:32:52.881 --> 00:32:57.881
<v Speaker 1>overcommunicate too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm so well,</v>

575
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.180
<v Speaker 1>so that's why we can't reach a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent equilibrium.</v>

576
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.193
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to the previously </v>

577
00:33:08.731 --> 00:33:13.731
<v Speaker 1>submitted questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can I overcome my fear of driving on</v>

578
00:33:13.831 --> 00:33:15.120
<v Speaker 1>freeways?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

579
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Ellis,</v>

580
00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.343
<v Speaker 1>is do a fair bit of imagining driving on</v>
<v Speaker 1>freeways and try to make the imagining </v>

581
00:33:23.341 --> 00:33:26.790
<v Speaker 1>as realistic as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the other thing you can do is,</v>

582
00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.340
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's graduated exposure.</v>

583
00:33:29.341 --> 00:33:30.174
<v Speaker 1>If you're afraid of driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go drive with someone you trust in a </v>

584
00:33:32.551 --> 00:33:33.384
<v Speaker 1>parking lot on Sunday morning when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no one there and then drive </v>

585
00:33:36.331 --> 00:33:37.164
<v Speaker 1>around the block and the street that </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't busy and then go to a slightly </v>

586
00:33:39.961 --> 00:33:40.794
<v Speaker 1>busier street and then go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly busier street and then find a </v>

587
00:33:43.831 --> 00:33:47.760
<v Speaker 1>highway that's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a two layer so that you know,</v>

588
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.020
<v Speaker 1>you could practice merging and that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

589
00:33:50.021 --> 00:33:50.854
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to build a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say with 20 degrees of difficulty with </v>

590
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:55.853
<v Speaker 1>the highest degree of difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe being more merging onto a busy </v>

591
00:33:58.621 --> 00:34:03.210
<v Speaker 1>four lane highway and you can go at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and practice merging onto the busy</v>

592
00:34:03.211 --> 00:34:05.040
<v Speaker 1>highway because they won't be busy at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

593
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:06.263
<v Speaker 1>So I would say what you do is you break </v>
<v Speaker 1>it down into small steps and then </v>

594
00:34:09.361 --> 00:34:13.410
<v Speaker 1>practice each step until you're bored </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the step and when you're bored with</v>

595
00:34:13.411 --> 00:34:14.244
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you're no longer anxious </v>

596
00:34:14.881 --> 00:34:17.520
<v Speaker 1>about it and don't quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.490
<v Speaker 1>like stick at it because it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful to overcome a fear.</v>

598
00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:22.350
<v Speaker 1>And once you've identified it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>

599
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.453
<v Speaker 1>then you've identified something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome that can definitely make you </v>

600
00:34:25.351 --> 00:34:26.184
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like good luck with it and get </v>

601
00:34:28.531 --> 00:34:29.364
<v Speaker 1>professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like take a driving course if you need </v>

602
00:34:31.171 --> 00:34:33.890
<v Speaker 1>to as well and find someone to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

603
00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:36.540
<v Speaker 1>It isn't going to make you nervous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to harass you,</v>

604
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.750
<v Speaker 1>but don't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to overcome a fear</v>

605
00:34:39.751 --> 00:34:44.751
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

606
00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I just picked something I shouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>clicked.</v>

607
00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty happy with myself.</v>

608
00:34:50.201 --> 00:34:51.820
<v Speaker 1>My son isn't here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned,</v>

609
00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm still not like destroying this </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>

610
00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:58.270
<v Speaker 1>although I may have done it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

611
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

612
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:24.560
<v Speaker 1>See that's what happens when you brag </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now all I've got is one question</v>

613
00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:28.820
<v Speaker 1>from pigeon hole and not all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

614
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to chart</v>

615
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.530
<v Speaker 2>was the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Hey,</v>

616
00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:43.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually managing this up too badly.</v>

617
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 2>So let's see here.</v>

618
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Some more questions from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Youtube people,</v>

619
00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.663
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hoping you can share your </v>

620
00:36:01.051 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 1>thoughts on the daigous shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

621
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:07.523
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would do is recommend the </v>

622
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.833
<v Speaker 1>biblical lecture I did on Cain and Abel </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say because I think that that's a </v>

623
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:14.694
<v Speaker 1>good summary of the state of mind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody has to be in in order to do </v>

624
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:23.070
<v Speaker 1>what was done at Los Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be very,</v>

625
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:23.904
<v Speaker 1>very embittered by lights in order to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing and you have to be </v>

626
00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:30.420
<v Speaker 1>searching for revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

627
00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

628
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:32.604
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's only revenge on other people </v>

629
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:36.780
<v Speaker 1>because you've developed hatred for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

630
00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:39.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just hatred for people.</v>

631
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.243
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's hatred for being itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and the desire to take revenge on </v>

632
00:36:45.481 --> 00:36:46.314
<v Speaker 1>being for the outrage of the tragedy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering that's associated with being </v>

633
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:51.913
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the tragedy and suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been part and parcel of your own </v>

634
00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:55.764
<v Speaker 1>life and that makes you embittered and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then past embittered becomes outraged </v>

635
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:00.474
<v Speaker 1>and past outraged becomes well homicidal</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even genocidal and that's terrible </v>

636
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 1>state of mind to be in.</v>

637
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a hellish state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

638
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:10.463
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize the state of mind that </v>

639
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:14.934
<v Speaker 1>someone has to be in in order to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the columbine shootings </v>

640
00:37:17.311 --> 00:37:18.144
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what happened in Las Vegas is that </v>

641
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you're really an now you have to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

642
00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.813
<v Speaker 1>Religious languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really out for revenge against </v>

643
00:37:24.511 --> 00:37:25.344
<v Speaker 1>God for the outrage of creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me and </v>

644
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:30.263
<v Speaker 1>that's a state of mind that's truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>hellish and you could get there by </v>

645
00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:35.010
<v Speaker 1>broody long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's also possible.</v>

646
00:37:35.011 --> 00:37:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy didn't have any previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

647
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.320
<v Speaker 1>criminal history or anything like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's pretty old.</v>

648
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:41.154
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also also also the possibility </v>

649
00:37:43.891 --> 00:37:44.724
<v Speaker 1>of some kind of neurological pathway log</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that might be characteristic of </v>

650
00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:48.931
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:49.764
<v Speaker 1>some degenerative neurological disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a kid years ago at the </v>

652
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.630
<v Speaker 1>University of Texas at Austin who </v>
<v Speaker 1>climbed up on the tower there and shot a</v>

653
00:37:57.631 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 1>number of people with a high powered </v>
<v Speaker 1>rifle and he had a fast growing tumor on</v>

654
00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:01.884
<v Speaker 1>his hypothalamus and had reported like </v>
<v Speaker 1>these being overcome with extreme </v>

655
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.500
<v Speaker 1>feelings of rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another possibility.</v>

656
00:38:10.501 --> 00:38:15.501
<v Speaker 1>But I would say the embitterment </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis is the strongest one.</v>

657
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:21.150
<v Speaker 1>I would also say too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted this</v>

658
00:38:21.151 --> 00:38:21.984
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that one of the ways of controlling </v>

659
00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:24.414
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing would be for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>press to agree not for there to be a </v>

660
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:28.554
<v Speaker 1>blanket agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to publicize the name or any other </v>

661
00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:34.320
<v Speaker 1>identity markers of the people who do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shooting.</v>

662
00:38:34.321 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Because there's also this</v>

663
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.590
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it,</v>

664
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.753
<v Speaker 3>arrogance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a kind of arrogance and pride last </v>

665
00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:43.504
<v Speaker 3>ditch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrogance and pride that that is </v>

666
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 3>associated with the fantasies that drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of behavior.</v>

667
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:51.430
<v Speaker 3>And the fantasy is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

668
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Speaker 3>after I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone will know the who,</v>

669
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.960
<v Speaker 3>who the hell I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

670
00:38:55.961 --> 00:38:59.710
<v Speaker 3>even though maybe I was ignored or </v>
<v Speaker 3>unhappy when I was alive after I'm dead,</v>

671
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:03.010
<v Speaker 3>everybody's going to know who I was and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I did and you know,</v>

672
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:06.100
<v Speaker 3>so there's this underground desire for </v>
<v Speaker 3>fame,</v>

673
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:07.653
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's notoriety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but notoriety might be preferable to </v>

674
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 3>being ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

675
00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.013
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of talk about gun control </v>

676
00:39:14.231 --> 00:39:15.064
<v Speaker 3>and that's understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with regards to automatic </v>

677
00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:17.824
<v Speaker 3>rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I also understand why the </v>

678
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:24.530
<v Speaker 3>people who are gun owners are afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

679
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:29.590
<v Speaker 3>of allowing what they regard as one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their fundamental rights to be infringed</v>

680
00:39:29.591 --> 00:39:30.730
<v Speaker 3>upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

681
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:31.953
<v Speaker 3>but it would certainly be useful if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped giving people who do this sort </v>

682
00:39:35.591 --> 00:39:38.560
<v Speaker 3>of thing now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$100,000,000 worth of free publicity and</v>

683
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:41.170
<v Speaker 3>all the notoriety they can manage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

684
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.023
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another way of thinking about </v>

685
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:44.500
<v Speaker 3>controlling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

686
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.560
<v Speaker 3>and Tony was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sylvia says,</v>

687
00:39:54.561 --> 00:39:56.330
<v Speaker 3>you need a break,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a glass of wine.</v>

688
00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

689
00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just up.</v>

690
00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:02.180
<v Speaker 3>I have this little cabin up north of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto,</v>

691
00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.860
<v Speaker 3>about three hours north that my wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>bought with some money that her dad left</v>

692
00:40:06.861 --> 00:40:08.000
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave her.</v>

693
00:40:08.001 --> 00:40:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's still alive and I was up there this</v>

694
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:12.763
<v Speaker 3>weekend and it was relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working a bit on this new </v>

695
00:40:15.891 --> 00:40:16.724
<v Speaker 3>personality scale and on the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did relax a bit and I'm actually </v>

696
00:40:22.101 --> 00:40:22.934
<v Speaker 3>feeling a lot better than it was for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last and a so the mornings are still </v>

697
00:40:28.011 --> 00:40:28.844
<v Speaker 3>rough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by this time of night I'm feeling </v>

698
00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:31.694
<v Speaker 3>vaguely human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so thank God for that because it was </v>

699
00:40:33.141 --> 00:40:35.480
<v Speaker 3>pretty brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyhow,</v>

700
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.513
<v Speaker 3>Franklin says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fans are cancer for the authentic </v>

701
00:40:40.651 --> 00:40:42.780
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

702
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.410
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

703
00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer know that.</v>

704
00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:52.110
<v Speaker 3>That's too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's too dramatic.</v>

705
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that what you're pointing out is</v>

706
00:40:55.111 --> 00:40:58.320
<v Speaker 3>the danger of fame and I can certainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate that.</v>

707
00:40:58.321 --> 00:41:00.630
<v Speaker 3>I can't say that I'm particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable with it,</v>

708
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.870
<v Speaker 3>which might seem to be rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypocritical as it isn't.</v>

709
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:08.670
<v Speaker 3>Like I've shied away from exposing my </v>
<v Speaker 3>views in public,</v>

710
00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:10.523
<v Speaker 3>but I felt that I was driven to that by </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessity and also by my desire to </v>

711
00:41:13.831 --> 00:41:14.960
<v Speaker 3>educate people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

712
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.613
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say despite the fact that I'm </v>

713
00:41:18.061 --> 00:41:18.894
<v Speaker 3>somewhat uncomfortable with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's mostly because of the </v>

714
00:41:21.661 --> 00:41:22.900
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

715
00:41:22.901 --> 00:41:26.040
<v Speaker 3>what I've been terrified for a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>year that I say something,</v>

716
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:28.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unforgivably stupid and</v>

717
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>demolished myself in public and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't feel guilty and horrible about</v>

718
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.520
<v Speaker 1>that for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so far I'd be fortunate there's been</v>

719
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:39.410
<v Speaker 1>some close calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been fortunate,</v>

720
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

721
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.940
<v Speaker 1>now when I go places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people often recognize me.</v>

722
00:41:43.941 --> 00:41:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Even at this little town we went up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this weekend,</v>

723
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:47.054
<v Speaker 1>there were two people that came up to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the parking lot and we're excited to </v>

724
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:52.430
<v Speaker 1>meet the and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of encounters,</v>

725
00:41:52.431 --> 00:41:53.264
<v Speaker 1>all of the encounters that I have with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in public and have been really </v>

726
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.073
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say that the people have been </v>

727
00:41:58.701 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 1>extremely friendly and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're a bit star struck,</v>

728
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:05.450
<v Speaker 1>which I find strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see the projection,</v>

729
00:42:05.451 --> 00:42:06.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

730
00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.490
<v Speaker 1>it's unsettling for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not judging anybody for it.</v>

731
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just a strange thing to observe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

732
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.020
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I can't complain about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

734
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.253
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

735
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:22.543
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are positively predisposed to what I'm </v>

736
00:42:24.951 --> 00:42:25.360
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

737
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a privilege.</v>

738
00:42:26.871 --> 00:42:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine what it would be like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be hated publicly.</v>

739
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that would just kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that.</v>

740
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:36.380
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I mean it's,</v>

741
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:37.243
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose there's the possibility of </v>

742
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:41.330
<v Speaker 1>having that sort of thing go to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head and it's,</v>

743
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that happens to people,</v>

744
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:44.174
<v Speaker 1>but I think I've said this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe on the q and a's I have a pretty </v>

745
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:50.480
<v Speaker 1>sensible family and I have a pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

746
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.393
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a pretty good sense of my </v>

747
00:42:56.151 --> 00:42:57.550
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

748
00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:58.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

749
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:59.383
<v Speaker 1>we could even call it an acute sense and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not particularly worried that </v>

750
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.210
<v Speaker 1>this is going to go to my head in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that,</v>

751
00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.213
<v Speaker 1>that would</v>

752
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:10.953
<v Speaker 2>no</v>

753
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.570
<v Speaker 1>inflate my ego or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

754
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things I have noticed</v>

755
00:43:16.571 --> 00:43:19.690
<v Speaker 1>is that I might be a little less patient</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people when I'm speaking.</v>

756
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.933
<v Speaker 1>I'm because I'm more used to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more used to that might be good for me </v>

757
00:43:26.141 --> 00:43:28.360
<v Speaker 1>to be listened to and so I have to watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

758
00:43:28.361 --> 00:43:29.194
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been pretty noisy and </v>

759
00:43:30.401 --> 00:43:31.234
<v Speaker 1>talkative and so that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's plagued me or being a </v>

760
00:43:34.001 --> 00:43:37.360
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of me ever since I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little tiny kid.</v>

761
00:43:37.361 --> 00:43:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to talk all the time when I was a</v>

762
00:43:40.441 --> 00:43:42.670
<v Speaker 1>little little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little guy.</v>

763
00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my cousin Eric Bonus,</v>

764
00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.053
<v Speaker 1>he probably listens to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to call me motor mouth and that </v>

765
00:43:48.491 --> 00:43:51.310
<v Speaker 1>was about exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like a miniature Camille Paglia.</v>

766
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:52.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

767
00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.350
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't complain about having let's say,</v>

768
00:43:56.351 --> 00:43:58.870
<v Speaker 1>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people have been unbelievably good to</v>

769
00:43:58.871 --> 00:44:01.630
<v Speaker 1>me and I'm really grateful for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

770
00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.610
<v Speaker 1>what is the best way to find a routine </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're diagnosed?</v>

771
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Bipolar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

772
00:44:14.441 --> 00:44:15.274
<v Speaker 1>I would say a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is try to set your sleep wake </v>

773
00:44:22.061 --> 00:44:25.990
<v Speaker 1>cycle stabling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so pick a time in the morning to get up.</v>

774
00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.213
<v Speaker 1>That's the most important thing is get </v>
<v Speaker 1>up at the same time every morning and </v>

775
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:30.503
<v Speaker 1>that that might be difficult both when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're mad mannequin when you're </v>

776
00:44:32.311 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the closer you can stick to that,</v>

777
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:35.904
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say try to stabilize </v>

778
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:38.184
<v Speaker 1>when you go to bed and maybe a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>later rather than a little earlier </v>

779
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:44.060
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want to be laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>there flipping around like a,</v>

780
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.370
<v Speaker 1>like a fish trying to go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

781
00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:50.883
<v Speaker 1>you want to stabilize your sleep wake </v>
<v Speaker 1>routines because bipolar disorder is in </v>

782
00:44:54.701 --> 00:44:55.534
<v Speaker 1>part a circadian rhythm disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anything that destabilizes your </v>

783
00:44:59.171 --> 00:45:00.004
<v Speaker 1>secret and rhythms is going to increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll have an </v>

784
00:45:03.281 --> 00:45:05.110
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that includes flying.</v>

785
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that at Gatwick airport </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

786
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.103
<v Speaker 1>in England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a special team that deals with </v>

787
00:45:11.051 --> 00:45:13.810
<v Speaker 1>people whose main mainly has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggered by the overnight flight.</v>

788
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.033
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other thing I would say is </v>

789
00:45:16.391 --> 00:45:20.860
<v Speaker 1>stabilized the times you eat because </v>
<v Speaker 1>these basic biological rhythms,</v>

790
00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.753
<v Speaker 1>eating and sleeping in particular are </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what stabilize your nervous </v>

791
00:45:24.161 --> 00:45:26.110
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have bipolar disorder,</v>

792
00:45:26.111 --> 00:45:31.000
<v Speaker 1>then you're likely to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>very susceptible to destabilize,</v>

793
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.390
<v Speaker 1>destabilize routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>routinized activities,</v>

794
00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.090
<v Speaker 1>routinize your life to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>

795
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.960
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the other thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do is use a calendar,</v>

796
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like a Google calendar or whatever,</v>

797
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:45.010
<v Speaker 1>whatever calendar.</v>

798
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.033
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's a good thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who's listening to think about </v>

799
00:45:49.241 --> 00:45:54.241
<v Speaker 1>so one to plan out your days and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and you don't plan to prison,</v>

800
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.653
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You use the calendar to design the days </v>

801
00:45:57.611 --> 00:45:58.444
<v Speaker 1>that you would like to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of that is going to be </v>

802
00:46:00.041 --> 00:46:00.874
<v Speaker 1>responsibility obviously because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to keep up with your </v>

803
00:46:02.861 --> 00:46:07.630
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities or they overwhelm you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they multiply like hydrus and.</v>

804
00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:10.990
<v Speaker 1>But you need to plan for things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to do as well.</v>

805
00:46:10.991 --> 00:46:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And the calendar can really be your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

806
00:46:12.851 --> 00:46:13.684
<v Speaker 1>And I would say of all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do to organize yourself and </v>

807
00:46:16.571 --> 00:46:17.404
<v Speaker 1>routinize yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learning to use a calendar is probably </v>

808
00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.513
<v Speaker 1>among the foremost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't matter if it takes you a </v>

809
00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:25.180
<v Speaker 1>year to get good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

810
00:46:25.181 --> 00:46:28.060
<v Speaker 1>You've got the rest of your life then to</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit from that.</v>

811
00:46:28.061 --> 00:46:30.130
<v Speaker 1>And you should make friends with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar.</v>

812
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't treat it like a prison,</v>

813
00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's really important to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

814
00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:37.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stabilize yourself as much as possible.</v>

815
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>periphery Pete says,</v>

816
00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I fell asleep listening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My battery died.</v>

817
00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:22.873
<v Speaker 1>I got to change it.</v>

818
00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.070
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like everything is okay.</v>

819
00:47:56.071 --> 00:48:01.071
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use it a reflex camera my and um,</v>

820
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.290
<v Speaker 3>it has a battery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No electrical plugins.</v>

821
00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.300
<v Speaker 3>So I'm afraid I'm at the mercy of its </v>
<v Speaker 3>batteries,</v>

822
00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:13.700
<v Speaker 3>the very high quality camera though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's worth,</v>

823
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.150
<v Speaker 3>worth the trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

824
00:48:15.151 --> 00:48:18.570
<v Speaker 3>periphery Pete said I fell asleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to you,</v>

825
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.501
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

826
00:48:19.501 --> 00:48:21.690
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't sound so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that part's not so good.</v>

827
00:48:21.691 --> 00:48:22.524
<v Speaker 3>But this part is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next day my 60 filter less </v>

828
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.870
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes a day habit disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not sure what you said,</v>

829
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.270
<v Speaker 3>but thank you Claire X.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey.</v>

830
00:48:30.271 --> 00:48:31.104
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can figure out what you were </v>

831
00:48:31.981 --> 00:48:33.090
<v Speaker 3>listening to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

832
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:34.223
<v Speaker 3>maybe I can make a tape of things to </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to by Jordan Peterson while </v>

833
00:48:37.261 --> 00:48:39.540
<v Speaker 3>you're falling asleep to fix your </v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarette habit.</v>

834
00:48:39.541 --> 00:48:41.250
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's great.</v>

835
00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:42.510
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't start again.</v>

836
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.610
<v Speaker 3>Or if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure you quit.</v>

837
00:48:44.611 --> 00:48:45.444
<v Speaker 3>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really glad to hear that and I've </v>

838
00:48:47.041 --> 00:48:49.830
<v Speaker 3>never had that particular talent pointed</v>
<v Speaker 3>out to me before.</v>

839
00:48:49.831 --> 00:48:52.740
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>comical.</v>

840
00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:54.623
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you believe there's a strong </v>

841
00:49:00.781 --> 00:49:03.060
<v Speaker 3>undercurrent of gnosticism in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>country?</v>

842
00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:04.380
<v Speaker 3>GNOSTICISM,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

843
00:49:04.381 --> 00:49:05.214
<v Speaker 3>is the doctrine heretical doctrine from </v>
<v Speaker 3>a classical Christian perspective that </v>

844
00:49:09.211 --> 00:49:10.044
<v Speaker 3>you can attain religious insight through</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding that's an oversimplified </v>

845
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.840
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

846
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.810
<v Speaker 3>things like the sacred feminine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hatred of the created world.</v>

847
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:26.210
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a complicated question.</v>

848
00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:31.190
<v Speaker 3>I think there's an undercurrent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to be gnosticism in our country.</v>

849
00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.113
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that people believe they can </v>

850
00:49:33.981 --> 00:49:37.460
<v Speaker 3>come to religious enlightenment through </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding,</v>

851
00:49:37.461 --> 00:49:38.294
<v Speaker 3>but that they are generally less willing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do the work that would be necessary </v>

852
00:49:42.411 --> 00:49:45.740
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then then is in fact necessary.</v>

853
00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.813
<v Speaker 3>It takes an awful lot of study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it took me years of reading young </v>

854
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.240
<v Speaker 3>to really start to understand what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was talking about.</v>

855
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:53.991
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

856
00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:55.790
<v Speaker 3>you could think about young as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gnostic,</v>

857
00:49:55.791 --> 00:49:59.330
<v Speaker 3>but most people who talk about young </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't read anything he wrote.</v>

858
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.823
<v Speaker 3>While that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often of things that people talk about </v>

859
00:50:02.931 --> 00:50:03.764
<v Speaker 3>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I think there is a place for </v>

860
00:50:06.441 --> 00:50:08.600
<v Speaker 3>understanding and religious belief or </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

861
00:50:08.601 --> 00:50:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise I wouldn't be doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>biblical lecture series,</v>

862
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:12.583
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's pseudo gnosticism </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally and it's people putting </v>

863
00:50:16.821 --> 00:50:21.440
<v Speaker 3>forward ill considered opinions in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place of solid religious,</v>

864
00:50:21.441 --> 00:50:24.200
<v Speaker 3>symbolic doctrine and I think that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big problem.</v>

865
00:50:24.201 --> 00:50:29.201
<v Speaker 3>I think it's part of what makes us weak </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think we are at the moment week in</v>

866
00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:32.420
<v Speaker 3>our foundations as a civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

867
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:38.653
<v Speaker 3>I have trouble regulating my emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a suspicion it's to do with the </v>

868
00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:44.330
<v Speaker 3>fact that I'm 90 percentile and </v>
<v Speaker 3>openness,</v>

869
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:45.373
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness and neuroticism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>second percentile in agreeableness and </v>

870
00:50:49.341 --> 00:50:52.130
<v Speaker 3>extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any tips on dealing with that?</v>

871
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

872
00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:58.660
<v Speaker 3>if you're really high in openness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really high in neuroticism,</v>

873
00:50:58.690 --> 00:50:59.523
<v Speaker 3>that can be a rough combination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The conscientious news should actually </v>

874
00:51:01.811 --> 00:51:02.644
<v Speaker 3>help with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it might make you a bit </v>

875
00:51:03.551 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 3>perfectionistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

876
00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:06.663
<v Speaker 3>the problem with being high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is creativity and interest in </v>

877
00:51:09.581 --> 00:51:10.414
<v Speaker 3>ideas and high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is tendency towards anxiety and </v>

878
00:51:13.481 --> 00:51:14.314
<v Speaker 3>emotional pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that like open people like to break </v>

879
00:51:16.901 --> 00:51:19.180
<v Speaker 3>open boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptual boxes,</v>

880
00:51:19.181 --> 00:51:21.490
<v Speaker 3>and see what's inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Pandora's box,</v>

881
00:51:21.491 --> 00:51:26.491
<v Speaker 3>but people are high in neuroticism or </v>
<v Speaker 3>are more likely to respond negatively to</v>

882
00:51:27.311 --> 00:51:28.144
<v Speaker 3>complexity and uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're an open person and you're </v>

883
00:51:30.581 --> 00:51:32.050
<v Speaker 3>always thinking of new things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

884
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:33.750
<v Speaker 3>you tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

885
00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:38.350
<v Speaker 3>saw off the branch that you're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>on on a regular basis.</v>

886
00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:42.910
<v Speaker 3>And that can be pretty destabilizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any tips on dealing with that?</v>

887
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would repeat what I said earlier.</v>

888
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:49.990
<v Speaker 3>I think that one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do if you're high in anxiety,</v>

889
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.290
<v Speaker 3>is to stabilize your sleep wake cycles.</v>

890
00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.153
<v Speaker 3>So get up at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to bed at the same time and eat at </v>

891
00:51:56.981 --> 00:51:57.814
<v Speaker 3>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make sure that you eat breakfast and a </v>

892
00:51:59.681 --> 00:52:00.514
<v Speaker 3>big breakfast too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's heavy on fat and protein because </v>

893
00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.420
<v Speaker 3>if you're hungry and then you stress </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

894
00:52:07.421 --> 00:52:09.040
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're high in </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism,</v>

895
00:52:09.041 --> 00:52:09.874
<v Speaker 3>you destabilize your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your insulin production system and it </v>

896
00:52:13.031 --> 00:52:15.010
<v Speaker 3>will restabilize till you go to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

897
00:52:15.011 --> 00:52:15.844
<v Speaker 3>So I would say like two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is have a big breakfast and then </v>

898
00:52:20.591 --> 00:52:22.960
<v Speaker 3>also if you're feeling particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxious,</v>

899
00:52:22.961 --> 00:52:23.794
<v Speaker 3>try eating something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not carbohydrates and see if that helps </v>

900
00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:27.993
<v Speaker 3>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be somewhat permanently </v>

901
00:52:30.371 --> 00:52:35.350
<v Speaker 3>dysregulated in your insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress-related insulin production.</v>

902
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.213
<v Speaker 3>That would be worth trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would also say that you should shield </v>

903
00:52:38.741 --> 00:52:43.741
<v Speaker 3>yourself to some degree from news </v>
<v Speaker 3>sources and sources of bad news,</v>

904
00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.210
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

905
00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:48.940
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic news because most of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't news.</v>

906
00:52:48.941 --> 00:52:49.774
<v Speaker 3>It's the repetition of things that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>already know full well and there's </v>

907
00:52:53.111 --> 00:52:57.670
<v Speaker 3>reason to protect yourself from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>onslaught of negative information,</v>

908
00:52:57.671 --> 00:52:59.800
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary for you.</v>

909
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.633
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should bury your head </v>

910
00:53:01.631 --> 00:53:02.464
<v Speaker 3>in the sand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but constant exposure to the </v>

911
00:53:04.301 --> 00:53:05.134
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when there's nothing you can </v>

912
00:53:10.571 --> 00:53:12.970
<v Speaker 3>do about those catastrophes even </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothetically,</v>

913
00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.520
<v Speaker 3>is something that can really destabilize</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

914
00:53:15.521 --> 00:53:17.890
<v Speaker 3>I often tell people in my clinical </v>
<v Speaker 3>practice,</v>

915
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:18.993
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't operating right now by the </v>

916
00:53:20.381 --> 00:53:21.214
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shield themselves from news reports </v>

917
00:53:24.251 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 3>because it's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're depressed and anxious,</v>

918
00:53:27.391 --> 00:53:28.224
<v Speaker 3>it's just not something that you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not helpful to you second </v>

919
00:53:31.321 --> 00:53:33.960
<v Speaker 3>percentile in agreeableness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>extroversion.</v>

920
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

921
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.063
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you can do if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're that low in agreeableness that </v>

922
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:41.514
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't disregulate your emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might interfere with your </v>

923
00:53:43.531 --> 00:53:45.190
<v Speaker 3>relationships with other people you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

924
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:48.810
<v Speaker 3>because you might be a little bit harder</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

925
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:50.543
<v Speaker 3>You might take other people's feelings </v>
<v Speaker 3>into consideration less than might be </v>

926
00:53:54.241 --> 00:53:55.074
<v Speaker 3>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that people who are </v>

927
00:53:56.731 --> 00:53:57.564
<v Speaker 3>low in agreeableness can do is to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of things they could do for other </v>

928
00:54:00.811 --> 00:54:02.550
<v Speaker 3>people and make that a practice.</v>

929
00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:03.733
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe once a week you could </v>

930
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.050
<v Speaker 3>consciously do someone a favor or give </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone a gift,</v>

931
00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:12.270
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And practice being,</v>

932
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:14.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it?</v>

933
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Compassionate and polite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

934
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 3>that'll expand your personality rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than transforming it.</v>

935
00:54:20.731 --> 00:54:23.550
<v Speaker 3>So then maybe you could have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantages of being disagreeable,</v>

936
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:24.384
<v Speaker 3>which means you're tough minded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And skeptical and competitive and and </v>

937
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.560
<v Speaker 3>those can all be really good things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would be nice to be able to leave</v>

938
00:54:31.561 --> 00:54:32.394
<v Speaker 3>it out a little bit with some with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to take other people's </v>

939
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:37.650
<v Speaker 3>perspectives a bit more and to take them</v>
<v Speaker 3>into account.</v>

940
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:40.020
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your relationships improve,</v>

941
00:54:40.021 --> 00:54:40.854
<v Speaker 3>that can also improve your emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>stability because one of the ways that </v>

942
00:54:44.551 --> 00:54:45.384
<v Speaker 3>people regulate their anxiety is by </v>
<v Speaker 3>having people around them that they get </v>

943
00:54:47.761 --> 00:54:48.594
<v Speaker 3>along with because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're upset people then they upset </v>

944
00:54:51.901 --> 00:54:52.734
<v Speaker 3>you and especially if you're high in </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism and that can increase your </v>

945
00:54:56.911 --> 00:54:59.130
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and your pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

946
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:04.493
<v Speaker 3>Mr David says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should I hide my antifeminist </v>

947
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.830
<v Speaker 3>anti-feminism I presume as I studied </v>
<v Speaker 3>university to become a nurse?</v>

948
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

949
00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.753
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't make unnecessary enemies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you probably shouldn't mouth your </v>

950
00:55:20.181 --> 00:55:21.014
<v Speaker 3>opinion more than necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think you risk damaging your soul </v>

951
00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:28.220
<v Speaker 3>under certain circumstances when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't say what you think.</v>

952
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:32.990
<v Speaker 3>So I wouldn't hide it because I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dangerous to hide it.</v>

953
00:55:32.991 --> 00:55:33.824
<v Speaker 3>And you also won't find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find the other people that you listened </v>

954
00:55:36.111 --> 00:55:38.120
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would say be prudent.</v>

955
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:39.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

956
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:43.370
<v Speaker 3>don't falsify your opinions when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>

957
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:44.263
<v Speaker 3>That's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't falsify your opinions when you're </v>

958
00:55:46.161 --> 00:55:49.130
<v Speaker 3>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can always choose not to speak,</v>

959
00:55:49.131 --> 00:55:49.964
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you feel that you would be doing </v>

960
00:55:53.511 --> 00:55:54.344
<v Speaker 3>damage to your integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to say what you have to </v>

961
00:55:57.291 --> 00:55:59.510
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it carefully and,</v>

962
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.780
<v Speaker 3>and prepare for the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

963
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably prepare beforehand I would say.</v>

964
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.380
<v Speaker 3>So I think the hiding is a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

965
00:56:09.381 --> 00:56:11.540
<v Speaker 3>but don't make unnecessary enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

966
00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:13.280
<v Speaker 3>because there's just no utility in that.</v>

967
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:17.140
<v Speaker 3>How important do you believe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>American right?</v>

968
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Is the American right to bear arms and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain malicious?</v>

969
00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Is it equivalent to the right to free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech?</v>

970
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.213
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anything is equivalent to </v>

971
00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:28.360
<v Speaker 3>the right to free speech or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for free speech.</v>

972
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how important do I believe that?</v>

973
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:33.910
<v Speaker 3>That right is Jesus?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a tough question.</v>

974
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad's a hunter,</v>

975
00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.680
<v Speaker 3>he has 200 rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

976
00:56:38.681 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 3>They're all single shots because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>believes the naming carefully.</v>

977
00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the culture I come from,</v>

978
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:48.190
<v Speaker 3>which is northwestern Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a rural culture,</v>

979
00:56:48.191 --> 00:56:49.024
<v Speaker 3>a hunting culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People take their guns seriously there </v>

980
00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.440
<v Speaker 3>and it is definitely part of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle.</v>

981
00:56:53.441 --> 00:56:54.274
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad hunted his whole life and we ate </v>

982
00:56:55.961 --> 00:56:58.240
<v Speaker 3>wild meat almost all the time I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up.</v>

983
00:56:58.850 --> 00:56:59.683
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the right to bear arms is </v>

984
00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:05.560
<v Speaker 3>one of the markers of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a free society.</v>

985
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:06.483
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's reasonable that only </v>
<v Speaker 3>the police and the army should be </v>

986
00:57:09.131 --> 00:57:13.690
<v Speaker 3>allowed to be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having said that.</v>

987
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'll just leave it at that.</v>

988
00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean I feel obligated in some sense to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go farther,</v>

989
00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:25.650
<v Speaker 3>especially with regards to what happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Las Vegas,</v>

990
00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:26.484
<v Speaker 3>but</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that mostly what happens </v>

991
00:57:29.701 --> 00:57:30.534
<v Speaker 3>after these mass shootings is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>event gets absolutely politicized and </v>

992
00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:39.300
<v Speaker 3>people take their standard positions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no moving either side and that's</v>

993
00:57:39.301 --> 00:57:40.890
<v Speaker 3>too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

994
00:57:40.891 --> 00:57:41.724
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

995
00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:50.143
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's unfortunate to use an </v>
<v Speaker 3>event like the Las Vegas event or the </v>

996
00:57:53.511 --> 00:57:55.880
<v Speaker 3>columbine shootings to make political </v>
<v Speaker 3>capital.</v>

997
00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:59.870
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's usually what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm not going to do that.</v>

998
00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

999
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:02.623
<v Speaker 3>I believe that the individual should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed or even encouraged to be </v>

1000
00:58:05.331 --> 00:58:06.890
<v Speaker 3>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but controlled.</v>

1001
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:09.290
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So along with that,</v>

1002
00:58:09.291 --> 00:58:14.210
<v Speaker 3>right is a responsibility and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess maybe from the NRA,</v>

1003
00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:16.670
<v Speaker 3>there should be more discussion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

1004
00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

1005
00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Seems to me to be reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1006
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:36.690
<v Speaker 3>any advice for a person with intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>chronic pain that wants to become.</v>

1007
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Who wants to become a uh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1008
00:58:41.281 --> 00:58:44.140
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It switched on me.</v>

1009
00:58:44.141 --> 00:58:44.974
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>

1010
00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Crayola sheep says any advice for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person with intense chronic pain?</v>

1011
00:58:48.511 --> 00:58:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Who wants to become a contributing </v>
<v Speaker 3>member of society?</v>

1012
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Specifically having the self discipline </v>
<v Speaker 3>to push through pain,</v>

1013
00:58:53.971 --> 00:58:56.310
<v Speaker 3>to take care of responsibilities?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1014
00:58:56.370 --> 00:58:59.190
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I would say is that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have intense chronic pain,</v>

1015
00:58:59.191 --> 00:59:02.520
<v Speaker 3>then my heart goes out to you because </v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's really awful.</v>

1016
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.610
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that you can cut yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>a break.</v>

1017
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:06.503
<v Speaker 3>I think the fact that you want to become</v>
<v Speaker 3>or continue being a contributing member </v>

1018
00:59:11.221 --> 00:59:12.054
<v Speaker 3>to society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>society is a testament to your </v>

1019
00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:14.373
<v Speaker 3>fortitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the first thing I would ask you </v>

1020
00:59:16.111 --> 00:59:18.570
<v Speaker 3>is if your pain has been reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 3>managed,</v>

1021
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:19.463
<v Speaker 3>you probably know this and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving you any medical advice because I </v>

1022
00:59:22.161 --> 00:59:22.994
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you might want to note that there </v>

1023
00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:25.994
<v Speaker 3>are antidepressants that are quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective as longterm pain medications </v>

1024
00:59:29.421 --> 00:59:31.520
<v Speaker 3>and you may already know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't,</v>

1025
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:32.803
<v Speaker 3>then you should check that out because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not addictive and they can be a </v>

1026
00:59:36.081 --> 00:59:37.340
<v Speaker 3>very effective adjunct.</v>

1027
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:42.320
<v Speaker 3>I would also say that the literature on </v>
<v Speaker 3>chronic pain tends to indicate that more</v>

1028
00:59:42.321 --> 00:59:43.154
<v Speaker 3>activity is better than less and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's partly because when you get </v>

1029
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:50.090
<v Speaker 3>engaged in something that's meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1030
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:51.583
<v Speaker 3>and important to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that activates the dopaminergic </v>

1031
00:59:55.881 --> 00:59:56.714
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same system that Takeda activates </v>

1032
00:59:58.251 --> 01:00:01.730
<v Speaker 3>and that can produce a fairly pronounced</v>
<v Speaker 3>analgesic effect.</v>

1033
01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:02.564
<v Speaker 3>So I would say everything that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>do to get yourself occupied with things </v>

1034
01:00:06.411 --> 01:00:09.170
<v Speaker 3>that you regard as important and </v>
<v Speaker 3>worthwhile is actually probably going to</v>

1035
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:13.760
<v Speaker 3>help you manage your pain better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like inactivity is a bad,</v>

1036
01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.090
<v Speaker 3>is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Generally speaking for chronic pain,</v>

1037
01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:17.924
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the sort of activity that you're </v>

1038
01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:21.854
<v Speaker 3>engaged in is of the type that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggravate an underlying chronic </v>

1039
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:30.950
<v Speaker 3>physiological condition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would say make a plan,</v>

1040
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:33.590
<v Speaker 3>make a daily plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a weekly plan,</v>

1041
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:35.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it,</v>

1042
01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:36.403
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push yourself a little bit farther than </v>

1043
01:00:37.671 --> 01:00:42.170
<v Speaker 3>you can go comfortably on a weekly basis</v>
<v Speaker 3>and see how far you can get any year.</v>

1044
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 3>That's because what's your choice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1045
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:45.913
<v Speaker 3>you're laying there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suffering is not preferable to doing </v>

1046
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.530
<v Speaker 3>things and suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not generally.</v>

1047
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.180
<v Speaker 3>So I would say like more power to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>for trying and,</v>

1048
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.130
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also do keep in mind that activity,</v>

1049
01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:03.340
<v Speaker 3>meaningful activity is a good analgesic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm Eric Butler says sheesh.</v>

1050
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Canadians never get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1051
01:01:06.951 --> 01:01:08.570
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know we get it sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric,</v>

1052
01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:09.590
<v Speaker 3>come on now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1053
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.360
<v Speaker 3>give us a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just.</v>

1054
01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:13.520
<v Speaker 3>Canadians were freezing to death half </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1055
01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.713
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do pretty well given the fact that </v>

1056
01:01:16.971 --> 01:01:17.804
<v Speaker 3>every day here in the winter is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>equivalent of a national catastrophe in </v>

1057
01:01:20.481 --> 01:01:21.314
<v Speaker 3>the U.</v>
<v Speaker 3>s.</v>

1058
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:26.080
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Betsy Kirkland.</v>

1059
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:28.310
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the second amendment is taken away,</v>

1060
01:01:28.311 --> 01:01:30.530
<v Speaker 3>there will be nothing to protect your </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech.</v>

1061
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.810
<v Speaker 3>That is how important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1062
01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.411
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1063
01:01:32.411 --> 01:01:34.640
<v Speaker 3>that is certainly the argument that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are</v>

1064
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.350
<v Speaker 3>motivated to protect the second </v>
<v Speaker 3>amendment make,</v>

1065
01:01:39.351 --> 01:01:41.270
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not going to oppose that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1066
01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:48.300
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech is not licensed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bully.</v>

1067
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually it is.</v>

1068
01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:52.480
<v Speaker 3>That is exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's clique zero.</v>

1069
01:01:52.481 --> 01:01:53.314
<v Speaker 3>Two zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three.</v>

1070
01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.700
<v Speaker 3>Freedom of speech is licensed to bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's licensed to offend.</v>

1071
01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:57.923
<v Speaker 3>It's licensed to disrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all sorts of things that are </v>

1072
01:02:01.621 --> 01:02:02.454
<v Speaker 3>unpleasant and upsetting and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean that you should go </v>

1073
01:02:07.471 --> 01:02:09.810
<v Speaker 3>around bullying or being disruptive or </v>
<v Speaker 3>upsetting.</v>

1074
01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.330
<v Speaker 3>That isn't the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is exactly what it is.</v>

1075
01:02:12.331 --> 01:02:15.210
<v Speaker 3>So I'm afraid please zero to three are </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1076
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:16.463
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you say use some discretion and </v>

1077
01:02:17.551 --> 01:02:18.510
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yes,</v>

1078
01:02:18.511 --> 01:02:19.344
<v Speaker 3>of course that's perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>advice and that is what people should </v>

1079
01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:23.730
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1080
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.870
<v Speaker 3>what constitutes discretion is often </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that has to be discussed.</v>

1081
01:02:27.871 --> 01:02:28.704
<v Speaker 3>And I would say that the threat to </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech is being put forward </v>

1082
01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 3>very strongly by people who say things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While it's not as,</v>

1083
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 3>it's not the same as the licensed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullying and bullying,</v>

1084
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:43.500
<v Speaker 3>by the way generally speaking is it is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sequence of physical auctions.</v>

1085
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:45.780
<v Speaker 3>When it's verbal bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which also can occur,</v>

1086
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:48.960
<v Speaker 3>then that has to be put into somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>different category.</v>

1087
01:02:48.961 --> 01:02:49.794
<v Speaker 3>If you're interested in bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a great book and seriously </v>

1088
01:02:52.411 --> 01:02:53.244
<v Speaker 3>interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great book by a guy named Dan </v>

1089
01:02:54.841 --> 01:02:58.140
<v Speaker 3>always called bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it's called,</v>

1090
01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.880
<v Speaker 3>what we know and what we can do about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1091
01:02:59.881 --> 01:03:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Dan Always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you know,</v>

1092
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:04.290
<v Speaker 3>if you're actually concerned about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing,</v>

1093
01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:07.260
<v Speaker 3>you could read that book and see if </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are places that you could put what</v>

1094
01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:09.990
<v Speaker 3>he advises in schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1095
01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:10.980
<v Speaker 3>into practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1096
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1097
01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.553
<v Speaker 3>you look young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asked what moment triggered your </v>

1098
01:03:31.561 --> 01:03:35.340
<v Speaker 3>obsession with the topics outlined in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the biblical series and maps?</v>

1099
01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:38.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

1100
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:41.880
<v Speaker 3>I actually don't know the answer though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say it was a moment.</v>

1101
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I know that from the time I was about 16</v>
<v Speaker 3>until the time that I was 24.</v>

1102
01:03:47.071 --> 01:03:50.100
<v Speaker 3>So I had recurrent nightmares about </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear war.</v>

1103
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.533
<v Speaker 3>And so that was certainly part of it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were very vivid and very realistic </v>

1104
01:03:55.410 --> 01:04:00.410
<v Speaker 3>and so and certainly my reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially about the Holocaust,</v>

1105
01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.013
<v Speaker 3>I'm also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then later Solzhenitsyn's accounts </v>

1106
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.730
<v Speaker 3>of the Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1107
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:11.550
<v Speaker 3>the horrors there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was also a major contributor.</v>

1108
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.823
<v Speaker 3>It was my concern about the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that was really the trigger </v>

1109
01:04:16.711 --> 01:04:19.290
<v Speaker 3>in general because I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

1110
01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:20.143
<v Speaker 3>I took a political science degree first </v>
<v Speaker 3>and looked at it from a political </v>

1111
01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:23.214
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of my professors by the time I </v>

1112
01:04:25.741 --> 01:04:26.574
<v Speaker 3>was in my third or fourth year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insisted that the reason that people </v>

1113
01:04:29.311 --> 01:04:30.144
<v Speaker 3>fought the reasons that people thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>were economic and I never did believe </v>

1114
01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:34.764
<v Speaker 3>that because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well people fight about the things they </v>

1115
01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:37.914
<v Speaker 3>value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't the obvious why people </v>

1116
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:43.380
<v Speaker 3>value the things they value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1117
01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:44.214
<v Speaker 3>so it's a psychological issue as far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned with and not an economic </v>

1118
01:04:48.331 --> 01:04:48.740
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

1119
01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:49.573
<v Speaker 3>And so it was my discomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissatisfaction with the standard </v>

1120
01:04:54.271 --> 01:04:55.104
<v Speaker 3>political science view point directing </v>
<v Speaker 3>team point combined with this strange </v>

1121
01:04:57.901 --> 01:04:58.734
<v Speaker 3>obsession I had about the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's associated to some degree </v>

1122
01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 3>with my proclivity to depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1123
01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:05.130
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1124
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was obsessed with it and I,</v>

1125
01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:12.060
<v Speaker 3>it isn't obvious why things grip you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shake you like a rat,</v>

1126
01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:14.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess some,</v>

1127
01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.353
<v Speaker 3>there's something about that that seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be associated with people used to </v>

1128
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:19.570
<v Speaker 3>call it destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1129
01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:21.173
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1130
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.750
<v Speaker 3>but it certainly wasn't obsession when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was 23 or 24 when I started writing maps</v>

1131
01:05:26.751 --> 01:05:29.840
<v Speaker 3>of meaning I was thinking about it 16 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours a day,</v>

1132
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:31.970
<v Speaker 3>like top speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just nonstop.</v>

1133
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.710
<v Speaker 3>And the only relief I could get from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rudy was to go work out with weights,</v>

1134
01:05:36.711 --> 01:05:41.060
<v Speaker 3>which I did for quite a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gained about 35 pounds in about a year</v>

1135
01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:41.893
<v Speaker 3>and a half working out with weights and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to quit because I was eating so </v>

1136
01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:46.010
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was taking up like half my life.</v>

1137
01:05:46.011 --> 01:05:47.200
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1138
01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.520
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it was,</v>

1139
01:05:49.521 --> 01:05:50.354
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1140
01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.420
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what,</v>

1141
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:56.200
<v Speaker 3>what darkness lurks in the bottom of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>soul.</v>

1142
01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:57.640
<v Speaker 3>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why it's there.</v>

1143
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:00.063
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was also the fact that I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>see in myself the tendencies that might </v>

1144
01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:07.270
<v Speaker 3>lead people to do terrible things and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was also very,</v>

1145
01:06:07.271 --> 01:06:08.104
<v Speaker 3>very curious about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe that was an encounter with the </v>

1146
01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:12.100
<v Speaker 3>union shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was something like that.</v>

1147
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:15.250
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you lecture in the Netherlands?</v>

1148
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>

1149
01:06:16.421 --> 01:06:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming to the Netherlands in January</v>
<v Speaker 3>to lecture there.</v>

1150
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:21.303
<v Speaker 3>I'll put the link to that up on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>website at some point in the relatively </v>

1151
01:06:23.951 --> 01:06:25.540
<v Speaker 3>near future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1152
01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.553
<v Speaker 3>saga strike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard depressed people who stopped </v>

1153
01:06:38.001 --> 01:06:40.550
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant said they never helped in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>

1154
01:06:40.551 --> 01:06:42.260
<v Speaker 3>What do you say to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Peterson?</v>

1155
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1156
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:44.023
<v Speaker 3>that certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm antidepressants don't necessarily </v>

1157
01:06:48.081 --> 01:06:48.914
<v Speaker 3>work for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My personal opinion is that </v>

1158
01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:57.220
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants work quite well for many</v>
<v Speaker 3>people whose lives are in decent order,</v>

1159
01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.640
<v Speaker 3>so they have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have family that love them,</v>

1160
01:07:01.641 --> 01:07:02.474
<v Speaker 3>they have a career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're educated approximately to the </v>

1161
01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:08.210
<v Speaker 3>level of their intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have things to look forward to,</v>

1162
01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:11.450
<v Speaker 3>but for some reason their mood is </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely distorted.</v>

1163
01:07:11.451 --> 01:07:12.284
<v Speaker 3>Him and and negative and I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants have miraculous effects </v>

1164
01:07:16.401 --> 01:07:20.090
<v Speaker 3>or people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're less likely to work when</v>

1165
01:07:20.091 --> 01:07:20.924
<v Speaker 3>people have a plethora of life problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't exactly the same thing as </v>

1166
01:07:25.401 --> 01:07:28.660
<v Speaker 3>being</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed,</v>

1167
01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you think having a terrible life is</v>

1168
01:07:32.331 --> 01:07:33.164
<v Speaker 3>not the same thing as being depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although the two can overlap and it </v>

1169
01:07:36.501 --> 01:07:38.570
<v Speaker 3>isn't obvious to me that people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1170
01:07:38.571 --> 01:07:41.210
<v Speaker 3>maybe they have a drinking problem or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug abuse problem,</v>

1171
01:07:41.211 --> 01:07:42.044
<v Speaker 3>mender unemployed and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathological family and their friends </v>

1172
01:07:45.741 --> 01:07:48.620
<v Speaker 3>aren't good for them and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1173
01:07:48.621 --> 01:07:49.131
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1174
01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:49.964
<v Speaker 3>they have a string of failures behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and they don't have much to look </v>

1175
01:07:52.281 --> 01:07:53.330
<v Speaker 3>forward to in the future.</v>

1176
01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:54.163
<v Speaker 3>And all about it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot for an antidepressant </v>

1177
01:07:56.001 --> 01:07:58.130
<v Speaker 3>overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But under those circumstances,</v>

1178
01:07:58.131 --> 01:07:58.964
<v Speaker 3>maybe the antidepressants can help stave</v>
<v Speaker 3>off feelings of like suicidal feelings </v>

1179
01:08:03.801 --> 01:08:04.634
<v Speaker 3>and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But antidepressants don't work for </v>

1180
01:08:06.621 --> 01:08:07.454
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some people they work really well </v>

1181
01:08:09.981 --> 01:08:11.210
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're depressed,</v>

1182
01:08:11.211 --> 01:08:13.340
<v Speaker 3>they're definitely worth a try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1183
01:08:13.341 --> 01:08:15.740
<v Speaker 3>in a month if they're going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

1184
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:16.574
<v Speaker 3>there are a variety of different kinds </v>
<v Speaker 3>of antidepressants and you have to </v>

1185
01:08:18.741 --> 01:08:22.070
<v Speaker 3>figure out dose and you have to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out when you should take them during the</v>

1186
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:23.750
<v Speaker 3>day and you and you have to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>type,</v>

1187
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:26.240
<v Speaker 3>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not a cure,</v>

1188
01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:27.074
<v Speaker 3>they're a tool for helping control </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative emotion and they can be very </v>

1189
01:08:30.201 --> 01:08:31.490
<v Speaker 3>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1190
01:08:31.491 --> 01:08:34.280
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that they didn't help.</v>

1191
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.620
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I would say about that.</v>

1192
01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:47.710
<v Speaker 3>What the player formerly known as most </v>
<v Speaker 3>cops says.</v>

1193
01:08:47.711 --> 01:08:50.470
<v Speaker 3>What do you think the role of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics will be in the future?</v>

1194
01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:51.603
<v Speaker 3>Marijuana will most likely be somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>legal everywhere in the US and this may </v>

1195
01:08:54.791 --> 01:08:57.700
<v Speaker 3>push someone to try stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>PSYCHEDELICS is this bad?</v>

1196
01:08:58.210 --> 01:08:59.043
<v Speaker 3>Let's start with the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what the role of </v>

1197
01:09:01.031 --> 01:09:05.830
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics will be in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that the FDA just cleared ecstasy</v>

1198
01:09:05.831 --> 01:09:08.260
<v Speaker 3>for use for post traumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 3>disorder,</v>

1199
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.333
<v Speaker 3>so that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there's some very interesting </v>

1200
01:09:11.501 --> 01:09:14.260
<v Speaker 3>work being done at Johns Hopkins on </v>
<v Speaker 3>silicide mushrooms,</v>

1201
01:09:14.261 --> 01:09:16.360
<v Speaker 3>which seemed to be very effective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1202
01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.194
<v Speaker 3>in helping people stop smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we don't know anything </v>

1203
01:09:20.231 --> 01:09:22.210
<v Speaker 3>about psychedelics at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1204
01:09:22.211 --> 01:09:25.540
<v Speaker 3>we know that they seem to have an effect</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the serotonin system,</v>

1205
01:09:25.541 --> 01:09:28.240
<v Speaker 3>but that's a pretty broad brush stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1206
01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:29.403
<v Speaker 3>I think they are incalculably I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>peculiar and that they reveal things </v>

1207
01:09:36.731 --> 01:09:40.870
<v Speaker 3>about the structure of the world that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>are beyond ignorant about,</v>

1208
01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:41.880
<v Speaker 3>beyond ignorant about.</v>

1209
01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:44.080
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what role they'll play in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>

1210
01:09:44.081 --> 01:09:46.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics at all.</v>

1211
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:47.833
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana will most likely be somewhat </v>

1212
01:09:49.841 --> 01:09:52.690
<v Speaker 3>legal everywhere in the US and this may </v>
<v Speaker 3>push some to try stronger.</v>

1213
01:09:52.691 --> 01:09:53.524
<v Speaker 3>PSYCHEDELICS is this bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose it depends on how they're </v>

1214
01:09:56.231 --> 01:09:57.064
<v Speaker 3>used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's bad and what the </v>

1215
01:09:58.121 --> 01:10:01.090
<v Speaker 3>intent is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they are very bad party drugs.</v>

1216
01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelics aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't for fun.</v>

1217
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that's the right way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to use them at all.</v>

1218
01:10:07.901 --> 01:10:08.734
<v Speaker 3>I think they need to be used seriously </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they need to be used in a manner </v>

1219
01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:13.174
<v Speaker 3>that's life affirming and they need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be used in a manner that's commensurate </v>

1220
01:10:16.451 --> 01:10:20.470
<v Speaker 3>with genuine exploration and they need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be used carefully or they can cause a</v>

1221
01:10:20.471 --> 01:10:21.304
<v Speaker 3>lot of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Carl Jung said beware of unearned </v>

1222
01:10:25.091 --> 01:10:28.000
<v Speaker 3>wisdom and I think that's very wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1223
01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:29.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

1224
01:10:29.771 --> 01:10:34.480
<v Speaker 3>I hope that we continue investigating </v>
<v Speaker 3>them scientifically because there's much</v>

1225
01:10:34.481 --> 01:10:38.920
<v Speaker 3>to be learned there much more than we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can imagine as far as I'm concerned.</v>

1226
01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:52.563
<v Speaker 3>Ha [inaudible] says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up with all these frog </v>

1227
01:10:54.731 --> 01:10:57.030
<v Speaker 3>occurrences?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen such synchronicity,</v>

1228
01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.730
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to say about that.</v>

1229
01:11:00.210 --> 01:11:01.043
<v Speaker 3>I had some frog synchronicity </v>
<v Speaker 3>occurrences earlier this year that just </v>

1230
01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:07.230
<v Speaker 3>about made me think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1231
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:08.663
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

1232
01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:13.090
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what to make of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1233
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:19.490
<v Speaker 3>it leaves me speechless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I can say about that.</v>

1234
01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1235
01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:23.720
<v Speaker 3>I do get Carl young had some strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas and,</v>

1236
01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:25.860
<v Speaker 3>and one of them was synchronicity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1237
01:11:25.861 --> 01:11:30.020
<v Speaker 3>the fact that things could line up in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that seemed meaningful and you know,</v>

1238
01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.960
<v Speaker 3>much as I don't understand how that </v>
<v Speaker 3>occurs.</v>

1239
01:11:32.961 --> 01:11:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I've experienced it many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times and it very convincing ways.</v>

1240
01:11:36.531 --> 01:11:37.364
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things that leads me to </v>

1241
01:11:39.081 --> 01:11:41.690
<v Speaker 3>think that the world isn't structured </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that we think it is.</v>

1242
01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I think it's structured more like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>symphony where where and there are times</v>

1243
01:11:46.281 --> 01:11:48.680
<v Speaker 3>with dis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different parts of the world,</v>

1244
01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.350
<v Speaker 3>different parts of being could come into</v>
<v Speaker 3>harmony spontaneously and,</v>

1245
01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:56.390
<v Speaker 3>and all pointed in the same direction </v>
<v Speaker 3>and why that happens.</v>

1246
01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1247
01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1248
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:11.683
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's go back to the preexisting </v>

1249
01:12:13.221 --> 01:12:18.221
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Semen.</v>

1250
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Eric says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apologies for the weird question.</v>

1251
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:36.170
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever performed a ritual </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice?</v>

1252
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:40.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't and it is a weird question,</v>

1253
01:12:40.041 --> 01:12:42.110
<v Speaker 3>although I can understand why you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>ask it.</v>

1254
01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:51.460
<v Speaker 3>I have performed psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices,</v>

1255
01:12:51.461 --> 01:12:52.294
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose when I decided to give up </v>

1256
01:12:53.861 --> 01:12:54.694
<v Speaker 3>something that I needed to give up so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I could move forward into the </v>

1257
01:12:57.971 --> 01:12:58.804
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1258
01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:00.780
<v Speaker 3>That certainly happened when I quit </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking.</v>

1259
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:02.223
<v Speaker 3>When I more or less quit drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have a drink from time to time </v>

1260
01:13:05.231 --> 01:13:06.064
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I quit for 20 years and that was a </v>

1261
01:13:07.931 --> 01:13:11.680
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't continue to drink again.</v>

1262
01:13:11.681 --> 01:13:12.514
<v Speaker 3>I said I was from northern Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty hard drinking culture and </v>

1263
01:13:14.501 --> 01:13:18.220
<v Speaker 3>I really liked alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't drink and write and do my</v>

1264
01:13:18.221 --> 01:13:21.760
<v Speaker 3>phd and manage my family </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibilities.</v>

1265
01:13:21.761 --> 01:13:25.150
<v Speaker 3>It was too much and so I stopped and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a good thing.</v>

1266
01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:27.340
<v Speaker 3>So that was a sacrifice.</v>

1267
01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:39.940
<v Speaker 3>You are very critical of postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an egalitarianism wave of the sixties.</v>

1268
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.600
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there a danger of throwing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby out with the bathwater?</v>

1269
01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:46.540
<v Speaker 3>Are there positive things about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements at the moment?</v>

1270
01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:47.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>

1271
01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:50.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's much positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>about them at all.</v>

1272
01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:53.740
<v Speaker 3>I think they've gone way too far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they dominate the humanities.</v>

1273
01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:55.053
<v Speaker 3>The postmodernism mean the fact that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernist point is that there is a </v>

1274
01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:05.490
<v Speaker 3>very large number of ways to interpret </v>
<v Speaker 3>any closed set of phenomena,</v>

1275
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:08.510
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any limited set of phenomena,</v>

1276
01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:09.740
<v Speaker 3>and that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1277
01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 3>it's shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

1278
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:13.170
<v Speaker 3>very shallow doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1279
01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:14.443
<v Speaker 3>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm throwing the baby out with the </v>

1280
01:14:16.241 --> 01:14:18.460
<v Speaker 3>bathwater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's a baby that needs to be thrown</v>

1281
01:14:18.461 --> 01:14:19.294
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Afraid are the positive things about </v>

1282
01:14:20.561 --> 01:14:22.120
<v Speaker 3>these movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not at the moment.</v>

1283
01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:25.720
<v Speaker 3>I can't see anything positive about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

1284
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:26.703
<v Speaker 3>it's degenerated into ideological clap </v>
<v Speaker 3>trap and I think it's destroying the </v>

1285
01:14:29.711 --> 01:14:30.544
<v Speaker 3>universities.</v>

1286
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.880
<v Speaker 3>So the egalitarian wave of the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a different issue I would say.</v>

1287
01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:36.814
<v Speaker 3>I mean at mean I don't think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable to deny the utility of the </v>

1288
01:14:42.431 --> 01:14:45.180
<v Speaker 3>civil rights movement in the 19 sixties </v>
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

1289
01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:46.014
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

1290
01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.560
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1291
01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:48.394
<v Speaker 3>there were movements before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the labor movement that had real </v>

1292
01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:51.514
<v Speaker 3>justification for being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't that everything that always </v>

1293
01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:56.560
<v Speaker 3>happens on the left is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that at all.</v>

1294
01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:58.053
<v Speaker 3>I think that the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say on the lower end of the </v>

1295
01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:06.220
<v Speaker 3>economic distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>need a powerful voice in politics.</v>

1296
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:07.423
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's only fair and I mean </v>

1297
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:16.650
<v Speaker 3>there is room for an egalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>oriented east folks,</v>

1298
01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:17.493
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't what equity is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has become completely ideological </v>

1299
01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:21.934
<v Speaker 3>and there's just no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just no excuse for it as far as </v>

1300
01:15:24.461 --> 01:15:25.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1301
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:26.763
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1302
01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.073
<v Speaker 3>if you plan on doing meetups with more </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals like Camille and Sam </v>

1303
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would be your pick?</v>

1304
01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1305
01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to meet Jonathan Heit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll be good.</v>

1306
01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I really admire his work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a really good guy,</v>

1307
01:15:50.441 --> 01:15:52.240
<v Speaker 3>so I'm looking forward to talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1308
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.300
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to talk to Thomas Soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>

1309
01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:58.270
<v Speaker 3>So I think that would be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1310
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:02.290
<v Speaker 3>the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to think more about that.</v>

1311
01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:03.124
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those are two that I would </v>

1312
01:16:04.931 --> 01:16:08.110
<v Speaker 3>definitely like to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to speak with Jocko willink.</v>

1313
01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:10.330
<v Speaker 3>I think I mentioned that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that might be interesting.</v>

1314
01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Will there be a third talk with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris?</v>

1315
01:16:14.441 --> 01:16:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this time with Sam as your guests </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you taking your gloves off?</v>

1316
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any plans for a third talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Sam.</v>

1317
01:16:21.401 --> 01:16:23.500
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be opposed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I think we,</v>

1318
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:24.693
<v Speaker 3>I think we've probably got about as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as we were going to get in or a second </v>

1319
01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:28.354
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the two discussions together </v>

1320
01:16:29.741 --> 01:16:31.660
<v Speaker 3>actually worked quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1321
01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.170
<v Speaker 3>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1322
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.180
<v Speaker 3>and this is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying this in any negative way,</v>

1323
01:16:41.181 --> 01:16:45.260
<v Speaker 3>but I think the third discussion might </v>
<v Speaker 3>be might be beating a dead horse.</v>

1324
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:46.893
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested in particularly in </v>

1325
01:16:49.811 --> 01:16:54.110
<v Speaker 3>putting Sam on the spot and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also possible that he would put</v>

1326
01:16:54.111 --> 01:16:55.880
<v Speaker 3>me on the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't necessarily,</v>

1327
01:16:55.881 --> 01:16:57.920
<v Speaker 3>but I would come out Victoria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

1328
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:59.143
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a very sharp guy and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>many compelling arguments to be made in </v>

1329
01:17:02.901 --> 01:17:05.720
<v Speaker 3>favor of atheism even though I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that overall it's,</v>

1330
01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.490
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1331
01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:08.413
<v Speaker 3>it's a stance lacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it contends with its </v>

1332
01:17:12.381 --> 01:17:13.214
<v Speaker 3>opponent fairly because I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the atheist community in general </v>

1333
01:17:17.061 --> 01:17:20.170
<v Speaker 3>takes the thought of serious religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinkers.</v>

1334
01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:21.950
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they tend to struggle</v>

1335
01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:22.930
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know.</v>

1336
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1337
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.843
<v Speaker 3>Could you please offer advice for </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals with high intelligence but </v>

1338
01:17:34.131 --> 01:17:34.964
<v Speaker 3>low extroversion and low agreeableness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and making and maintaining social </v>

1339
01:17:37.491 --> 01:17:41.720
<v Speaker 3>connections and friendships?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1340
01:17:41.770 --> 01:17:42.670
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Roger,</v>

1341
01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.910
<v Speaker 3>Roger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say</v>

1342
01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:48.680
<v Speaker 3>make a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1343
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.460
<v Speaker 3>spend some time on it weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to things like meetups.</v>

1344
01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:57.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a site called meetup.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good place to meet people.</v>

1345
01:17:57.911 --> 01:18:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Do whatever you have to meet people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a course,</v>

1346
01:18:00.490 --> 01:18:02.800
<v Speaker 3>strike up a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1347
01:18:02.801 --> 01:18:05.230
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ask questions and listen that that's</v>

1348
01:18:05.231 --> 01:18:07.420
<v Speaker 3>particularly good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're low in agreeableness,</v>

1349
01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:10.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people really like to be listened to,</v>

1350
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:11.103
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to pester them with </v>

1351
01:18:12.041 --> 01:18:12.874
<v Speaker 3>questions too badly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can get an awful long ways by </v>

1352
01:18:15.371 --> 01:18:16.204
<v Speaker 3>listening to people and asking them </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions people hardly ever get </v>

1353
01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:22.060
<v Speaker 3>listened to and they're so damn help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy when you do it,</v>

1354
01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.800
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1355
01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:24.963
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1356
01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.380
<v Speaker 3>they're likely to open themselves up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you very,</v>

1357
01:18:27.381 --> 01:18:28.214
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So get them talking and when they say </v>

1358
01:18:31.761 --> 01:18:34.610
<v Speaker 3>something you don't quite catch your </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand and ask them about it.</v>

1359
01:18:34.611 --> 01:18:35.444
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1360
01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:36.293
<v Speaker 3>and that can help you move forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but put some time into it like you need </v>

1361
01:18:40.161 --> 01:18:42.650
<v Speaker 3>to be going out at least once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1362
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:46.280
<v Speaker 3>and find some social places that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to regularly.</v>

1363
01:18:46.281 --> 01:18:49.610
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing you can do is pick </v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of hangouts,</v>

1364
01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.130
<v Speaker 3>like a local bar or something like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>

1365
01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.590
<v Speaker 3>but go there regularly and say hi to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who own it and run it.</v>

1366
01:18:56.591 --> 01:18:57.424
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually you'll be a regular and then </v>

1367
01:18:59.511 --> 01:19:01.370
<v Speaker 3>you can start to meet people by doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1368
01:19:01.371 --> 01:19:02.204
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might take you two or three years to </v>

1369
01:19:03.681 --> 01:19:04.514
<v Speaker 3>get good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people go to go from being </v>

1370
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:09.403
<v Speaker 3>afraid to strike up a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a conversation with a friend in </v>

1371
01:19:12.951 --> 01:19:14.120
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a coffee shop,</v>

1372
01:19:14.290 --> 01:19:15.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like have a panic attack,</v>

1373
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:18.650
<v Speaker 3>thinking about that to actually doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up comedy.</v>

1374
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:21.630
<v Speaker 3>So you can really move yourself along </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways if you,</v>

1375
01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.620
<v Speaker 3>if you make a long time plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1376
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:28.900
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Dam don't.</v>

1377
01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.073
<v Speaker 3>I've only got three dogs after that says</v>
<v Speaker 3>how should the manager used the preto </v>

1378
01:19:32.751 --> 01:19:37.070
<v Speaker 3>principle in his favorite work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find myself constantly focusing on the</v>

1379
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:39.050
<v Speaker 3>bottom five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 percent that causes 80,</v>

1380
01:19:39.051 --> 01:19:41.780
<v Speaker 3>95 percent of the team's poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>

1381
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's easy.</v>

1382
01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:43.813
<v Speaker 3>Then managerial literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the solid managerial literature is </v>

1383
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:47.623
<v Speaker 3>absolutely crystal clear on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spend all your time with your highest </v>

1384
01:19:50.871 --> 01:19:51.704
<v Speaker 3>producers and put your lowest producers </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they can do the least amount of </v>

1385
01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:57.560
<v Speaker 3>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The probability that as a manager,</v>

1386
01:19:57.561 --> 01:19:58.394
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be able to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems of the poorest five to 20 </v>

1387
01:20:02.001 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 3>percent of your work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A team is zero.</v>

1388
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 3>You just don't have the time or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources at your disposal.</v>

1389
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:09.263
<v Speaker 3>So what you should definitely do in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to increase performance is to </v>

1390
01:20:13.921 --> 01:20:17.580
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on your top performers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that's not what managers do.</v>

1391
01:20:17.581 --> 01:20:19.080
<v Speaker 3>They do exactly what you say.</v>

1392
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.450
<v Speaker 3>They focus on the bottom five to 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>

1393
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.420
<v Speaker 3>but that's exactly the wrong thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a manager.</v>

1394
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.793
<v Speaker 3>Focus on your best people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hyper productive as you already </v>

1395
01:20:27.901 --> 01:20:28.890
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1396
01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1397
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.823
<v Speaker 3>maybe you need to reconceptualize the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that you're interacting with your </v>

1398
01:20:34.321 --> 01:20:35.154
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you should have regular </v>

1399
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:40.110
<v Speaker 3>conversations at least with those that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think are outstanding.</v>

1400
01:20:40.111 --> 01:20:41.810
<v Speaker 3>Let them know that you really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1401
01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:43.403
<v Speaker 3>what would you say that you're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy with their performance and see </v>

1402
01:20:46.891 --> 01:20:47.724
<v Speaker 3>what you can do to get obstacles the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell out of their way because as a </v>

1403
01:20:50.521 --> 01:20:51.354
<v Speaker 3>manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially what you should be doing is </v>

1404
01:20:53.101 --> 01:20:53.934
<v Speaker 3>identifying the top performers and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing everything you can to clear out </v>

1405
01:20:57.031 --> 01:21:00.000
<v Speaker 3>the obstacles in their path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the right way to think about it.</v>

1406
01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:01.283
<v Speaker 3>And also to give yourself enough time to</v>
<v Speaker 3>develop a medium to longterm plan and </v>

1407
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.650
<v Speaker 3>start fighting fires on a day to day </v>
<v Speaker 3>basis.</v>

1408
01:21:07.651 --> 01:21:08.484
<v Speaker 3>You need at least 90 minutes a week to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about where you want things to be </v>

1409
01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:14.340
<v Speaker 3>going into medium to long term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1410
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.473
<v Speaker 3>but I can't over emphasize the </v>
<v Speaker 3>importance of dealing with your top </v>

1411
01:21:20.491 --> 01:21:21.900
<v Speaker 3>productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your talk,</v>

1412
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:25.110
<v Speaker 3>your highest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your most productive people.</v>

1413
01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:27.750
<v Speaker 3>That's where all the gains are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where all the games are.</v>

1414
01:21:30.170 --> 01:21:32.090
<v Speaker 3>How are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone is asking you,</v>

1415
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:34.103
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1416
01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.213
<v Speaker 3>you said some place that you felt like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were at times dancing on broken </v>

1417
01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:39.641
<v Speaker 3>glass?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1418
01:21:39.641 --> 01:21:40.474
<v Speaker 3>I think I said that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always felt like I was dancing on </v>

1419
01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:45.070
<v Speaker 3>broken glass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you getting enough rest?</v>

1420
01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:48.400
<v Speaker 3>And rnr is the food sensitivity getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked out?</v>

1421
01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:51.580
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe the food sensitivity thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is getting worked out.</v>

1422
01:21:51.581 --> 01:21:52.414
<v Speaker 3>I think it's at the basis of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this depression that's been plaguing </v>

1423
01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:57.063
<v Speaker 3>my family for generations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't figured out exactly what </v>

1424
01:22:00.371 --> 01:22:01.204
<v Speaker 3>it is yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm working very hard on that with my </v>

1425
01:22:03.071 --> 01:22:07.000
<v Speaker 3>daughter who also seems to have the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem and it is absolutely brutal.</v>

1426
01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.340
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm,</v>

1427
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.823
<v Speaker 3>am I getting enough rest in rnr?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hard to say because with the </v>

1428
01:22:15.821 --> 01:22:18.640
<v Speaker 3>responses that I'd been having that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignoring my health back,</v>

1429
01:22:18.641 --> 01:22:19.474
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to discriminate between risks </v>

1430
01:22:21.190 --> 01:22:22.023
<v Speaker 3>and R and r,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lack of that and just getting </v>

1431
01:22:23.681 --> 01:22:24.514
<v Speaker 3>walloped by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by eating what appears to be the wrong </v>

1432
01:22:26.861 --> 01:22:29.830
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's so funny because you know,</v>

1433
01:22:29.831 --> 01:22:30.664
<v Speaker 3>for years I was very skeptical of anyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was concerned about gluten </v>

1434
01:22:36.371 --> 01:22:37.204
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity and that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I sure learned that that was </v>

1435
01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.340
<v Speaker 3>arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

1436
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.333
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found many times in my life that you </v>

1437
01:22:46.121 --> 01:22:46.954
<v Speaker 3>have to be aware of what you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>judgmental about because many things </v>

1438
01:22:49.721 --> 01:22:51.780
<v Speaker 3>come back to haunt you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1439
01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.013
<v Speaker 3>Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have suggestions for how to make </v>

1440
01:23:02.401 --> 01:23:04.200
<v Speaker 3>a schedule that doesn't make you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrant?</v>

1441
01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.153
<v Speaker 3>I've watched your previous videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm struggling to make a weekly </v>

1442
01:23:07.121 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 3>schedule that is productive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Joshua,</v>

1443
01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:15.210
<v Speaker 3>start by making a weekly schedule that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want really like,</v>

1444
01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:16.173
<v Speaker 3>imagine that you're designing your </v>
<v Speaker 3>schedule so that you can have the life </v>

1445
01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.380
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just start with that,</v>

1446
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:23.500
<v Speaker 3>like be easy on yourself to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1447
01:23:23.501 --> 01:23:24.334
<v Speaker 3>you'll get better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can add more responsibilities as </v>

1448
01:23:26.351 --> 01:23:28.060
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you practice,</v>

1449
01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:29.133
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so start by just scheduling and a few </v>

1450
01:23:32.201 --> 01:23:34.900
<v Speaker 3>things that you'd like to do and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>load it up over time,</v>

1451
01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:36.970
<v Speaker 3>but remember like get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your attitude,</v>

1452
01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:37.804
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm using this schedule so that I can </v>

1453
01:23:40.661 --> 01:23:44.020
<v Speaker 3>have the days and the weeks and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>months that would make my life,</v>

1454
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:46.540
<v Speaker 3>that would optimize my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1455
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Not so that I should do what I need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get done.</v>

1456
01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously that's necessary,</v>

1457
01:23:50.771 --> 01:23:53.110
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the right goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1458
01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:01.130
<v Speaker 3>what are your thoughts on students </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking adderall?</v>

1459
01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Are there any longterm effects?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1460
01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:04.573
<v Speaker 3>there are long term studies of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>utility of adderall for attention </v>

1461
01:24:09.321 --> 01:24:11.330
<v Speaker 3>deficit disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hyperactivity,</v>

1462
01:24:11.331 --> 01:24:12.164
<v Speaker 3>and the results are basically negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no evidence that the </v>

1463
01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:19.190
<v Speaker 3>medications help with academic </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance over the long run.</v>

1464
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:24.140
<v Speaker 3>I think that adderall is an amphetamine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is addictive.</v>

1465
01:24:24.141 --> 01:24:27.500
<v Speaker 3>It can sensitize you to other dopamine </v>
<v Speaker 3>agonists.</v>

1466
01:24:27.710 --> 01:24:30.760
<v Speaker 3>So I would generally say it's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be avoided.</v>

1467
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:34.970
<v Speaker 3>You also want to really watch it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>combination with marijuana for example,</v>

1468
01:24:34.971 --> 01:24:35.804
<v Speaker 3>or psychedelics because you can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>unlucky and trigger a psychotic episode </v>

1469
01:24:39.111 --> 01:24:43.490
<v Speaker 3>and that is not a good thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>once you have one psychotic episode,</v>

1470
01:24:43.491 --> 01:24:46.790
<v Speaker 3>you're a bit on the broken side and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard to put yourself back together.</v>

1471
01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:51.791
<v Speaker 3>So I would say use it sparingly if at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1472
01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:53.173
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a good plan and especially not </v>

1473
01:24:55.131 --> 01:24:57.320
<v Speaker 3>something good to be doing habitually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1474
01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1475
01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:03.193
<v Speaker 3>any reading tips for becoming teachers </v>
<v Speaker 3>who don't want to be corrupted by the </v>

1476
01:25:05.691 --> 01:25:08.030
<v Speaker 3>current teacher education at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities?</v>

1477
01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Well I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1478
01:25:09.381 --> 01:25:11.450
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a reading list on my book,</v>

1479
01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.900
<v Speaker 3>on my website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson built column.</v>

1480
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:16.730
<v Speaker 3>You could go look there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to add some more books to read</v>

1481
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:19.940
<v Speaker 3>as much classic literature as you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>read history,</v>

1482
01:25:19.941 --> 01:25:22.700
<v Speaker 3>like going to the libraries and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1483
01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:26.360
<v Speaker 3>and look at great books programs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would say.</v>

1484
01:25:26.361 --> 01:25:29.240
<v Speaker 3>And you have to educate yourself at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>

1485
01:25:29.241 --> 01:25:29.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1486
01:25:29.811 --> 01:25:33.240
<v Speaker 3>that's always been the case and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>even more the case now is,</v>

1487
01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:34.843
<v Speaker 3>is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back and go back and read great </v>

1488
01:25:39.151 --> 01:25:40.650
<v Speaker 3>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Philosophy,</v>

1489
01:25:40.651 --> 01:25:41.484
<v Speaker 3>great thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you will learn a tremendous amount </v>

1490
01:25:43.921 --> 01:25:44.880
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1491
01:25:44.881 --> 01:25:45.714
<v Speaker 3>I think otherwise there's no way you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid being corrupted by the current </v>

1492
01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:49.644
<v Speaker 3>teacher education at universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The education faculties are absolutely </v>

1493
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:54.180
<v Speaker 3>dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely dreadful.</v>

1494
01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:55.613
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1495
01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.113
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1496
01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:15.120
<v Speaker 3>George Gabriel on drugs says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>

1497
01:26:15.121 --> 01:26:15.954
<v Speaker 3>please help me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 99th percentile and openness and </v>

1498
01:26:17.671 --> 01:26:20.160
<v Speaker 3>zero with percentile and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness.</v>

1499
01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well how old are you?</v>

1500
01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:25.790
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're,</v>

1501
01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:26.723
<v Speaker 3>if you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's because younger people are less </v>

1502
01:26:30.361 --> 01:26:31.194
<v Speaker 3>conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's one thing to keep in mind if </v>

1503
01:26:33.871 --> 01:26:36.870
<v Speaker 3>you're very open like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be doing something creative,</v>

1504
01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:39.450
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to have to learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline yourself.</v>

1505
01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.433
<v Speaker 3>There's just no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say go do the future </v>

1506
01:26:42.601 --> 01:26:44.220
<v Speaker 3>authoring program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good start.</v>

1507
01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:45.683
<v Speaker 3>And you'll have to learn how to schedule</v>
<v Speaker 3>your time then and how to get up at the </v>

1508
01:26:49.051 --> 01:26:51.360
<v Speaker 3>same time everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's going to be a real struggle,</v>

1509
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:52.960
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1510
01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:54.163
<v Speaker 3>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had students who were very high in </v>

1511
01:26:55.681 --> 01:26:56.514
<v Speaker 3>openness and low in conscientiousness as</v>
<v Speaker 3>graduate students and they disciplined </v>

1512
01:26:58.981 --> 01:26:59.814
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to find something that you're </v>

1513
01:27:00.571 --> 01:27:01.404
<v Speaker 3>really interested in that you're willing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pursue and then you have to hit it </v>

1514
01:27:04.081 --> 01:27:07.860
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I would say.</v>

1515
01:27:07.861 --> 01:27:08.694
<v Speaker 3>But do the future authoring program and </v>
<v Speaker 3>get yourself a plan and start the </v>

1516
01:27:11.221 --> 01:27:14.110
<v Speaker 3>implemented in every time you fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>astray,</v>

1517
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:15.263
<v Speaker 3>then get back at it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may have to build up your </v>

1518
01:27:17.761 --> 01:27:21.040
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness over a number of years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1519
01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:22.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's worth doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1520
01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.030
<v Speaker 3>my favorite Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late song,</v>

1521
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.823
<v Speaker 3>I really like cold water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My son does a vicious version of cold </v>

1522
01:27:35.131 --> 01:27:36.720
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really like cold water.</v>

1523
01:27:36.970 --> 01:27:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else?</v>

1524
01:27:42.150 --> 01:27:44.760
<v Speaker 3>I like hoists that rag and that's pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>decent song.</v>

1525
01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I like dozens of Tom Waits songs are</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else?</v>

1526
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:56.423
<v Speaker 3>I have this mental tick where when </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone asks me a question having to do </v>

1527
01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:03.100
<v Speaker 3>with a name names immediately damaged </v>
<v Speaker 3>from my mind anyways.</v>

1528
01:28:03.101 --> 01:28:06.250
<v Speaker 3>So I really like cold water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a great song.</v>

1529
01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:09.813
<v Speaker 3>Is it wrong to turn down a promotion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is withdrawing from overwhelming </v>

1530
01:28:12.431 --> 01:28:13.264
<v Speaker 3>additional responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the equivalent of ignoring God's called </v>

1531
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Abraham?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily.</v>

1532
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:20.080
<v Speaker 3>It depends on what it is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1533
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you have a better option,</v>

1534
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:27.340
<v Speaker 3>then take the better option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're afraid,</v>

1535
01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:28.683
<v Speaker 3>if it's just fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you might want to find somebody to </v>

1536
01:28:31.031 --> 01:28:31.864
<v Speaker 3>talk to about that and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and walk through your fears and make a </v>

1537
01:28:34.451 --> 01:28:35.284
<v Speaker 3>plan because you know it's possible that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the equivalent of ignoring God's </v>

1538
01:28:38.591 --> 01:28:40.550
<v Speaker 3>called Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1539
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:41.583
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>

1540
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:44.170
<v Speaker 3>if it's pure fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I would take a look at that.</v>

1541
01:28:44.530 --> 01:28:46.300
<v Speaker 3>But if you have a better option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1542
01:28:46.330 --> 01:28:47.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's up to you to decide the course of </v>

1543
01:28:48.881 --> 01:28:50.980
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wouldn't say that necessarily.</v>

1544
01:28:50.981 --> 01:28:52.480
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1545
01:28:52.481 --> 01:28:53.314
<v Speaker 3>not everyone wants overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility at work and people are </v>

1546
01:28:57.671 --> 01:28:58.504
<v Speaker 3>interested in their private lives and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're interested in their friendships </v>

1547
01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:02.760
<v Speaker 3>or their or what they do outside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1548
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.190
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's all valid,</v>

1549
01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:09.150
<v Speaker 3>but if it's just fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you need to find someone to talk to</v>

1550
01:29:09.151 --> 01:29:09.984
<v Speaker 3>and talk it through to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not throwing away an opportunity </v>

1551
01:29:12.571 --> 01:29:13.470
<v Speaker 3>that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1552
01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:15.600
<v Speaker 3>the other thing too is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1553
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:17.780
<v Speaker 3>what's your mood like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you depressed?</v>

1554
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe you're underestimating your </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability.</v>

1555
01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:21.870
<v Speaker 3>Somebody thinks you're worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>promotion.</v>

1556
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:24.870
<v Speaker 3>And you have to remember too that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get promoted,</v>

1557
01:29:24.871 --> 01:29:29.871
<v Speaker 3>like almost everybody feels like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>imposter for the first year when they're</v>

1558
01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:32.940
<v Speaker 3>promoted to a new position because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what the hell you're doing.</v>

1559
01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:34.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're,</v>

1560
01:29:34.130 --> 01:29:37.770
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of acting out the role </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you're qualified to do it.</v>

1561
01:29:37.771 --> 01:29:38.970
<v Speaker 3>But that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1562
01:29:38.971 --> 01:29:40.260
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1563
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:44.640
<v Speaker 3>it takes awhile to fit into a new skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a perfectionistic,</v>

1564
01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:46.410
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing to take into </v>
<v Speaker 3>account.</v>

1565
01:29:46.411 --> 01:29:47.244
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1566
01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.273
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1567
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:03.143
<v Speaker 3>I'm not very religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your way of presenting the biblical </v>

1568
01:30:04.951 --> 01:30:07.800
<v Speaker 3>stories have given me a respect for </v>
<v Speaker 3>their function in society.</v>

1569
01:30:07.801 --> 01:30:12.330
<v Speaker 3>How do I address those who actively </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppose the wisdom on atheist principles?</v>

1570
01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:15.171
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1571
01:30:15.171 --> 01:30:16.004
<v Speaker 3>I think what you do is you say what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've found carefully and if they </v>

1572
01:30:21.591 --> 01:30:24.980
<v Speaker 3>refuse to listen and just like put up an</v>
<v Speaker 3>impenetrable wall,</v>

1573
01:30:24.981 --> 01:30:27.650
<v Speaker 3>then you shut the hell up and go find </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else to talk to.</v>

1574
01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.513
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the doctrine behind norb casting </v>

1575
01:30:30.621 --> 01:30:32.120
<v Speaker 3>pearls before swine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1576
01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:33.023
<v Speaker 3>there's a good rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is if you're not being listened </v>

1577
01:30:35.571 --> 01:30:36.404
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then shut up because you're not where </v>

1578
01:30:37.671 --> 01:30:38.504
<v Speaker 3>you think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something going on that you </v>

1579
01:30:40.491 --> 01:30:41.324
<v Speaker 3>haven't put your finger on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not in the place that you think </v>

1580
01:30:43.911 --> 01:30:44.744
<v Speaker 3>you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you could also turn from </v>

1581
01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.360
<v Speaker 3>convincing to questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1582
01:30:50.361 --> 01:30:54.200
<v Speaker 3>if someone's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very set in their views,</v>

1583
01:30:54.201 --> 01:30:55.034
<v Speaker 3>instead of opposing them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can ask them to elucidate their </v>

1584
01:30:57.291 --> 01:30:59.600
<v Speaker 3>views and you can use that questioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

1585
01:30:59.601 --> 01:31:04.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like a socratic dialogue to dig </v>
<v Speaker 3>into their fundamental principles.</v>

1586
01:31:04.491 --> 01:31:07.640
<v Speaker 3>And sometime that's a good way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>opening up a space for dialogue.</v>

1587
01:31:08.150 --> 01:31:08.983
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1588
01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:16.210
<v Speaker 3>what do you make of the gnostic gospels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1589
01:31:16.211 --> 01:31:17.740
<v Speaker 3>the Gospel of Thomas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1590
01:31:17.741 --> 01:31:20.980
<v Speaker 3>I've read the Gospel of Thomas and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's a remarkable document.</v>

1591
01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.700
<v Speaker 3>There are things in it that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily powerful.</v>

1592
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:26.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I closed maps of meaning,</v>

1593
01:31:26.501 --> 01:31:28.840
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the book I wrote in Nineteen Ninety nine</v>

1594
01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:32.020
<v Speaker 3>with a quotation from the gospel of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thomas,</v>

1595
01:31:32.021 --> 01:31:34.810
<v Speaker 3>and it's really interesting too that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first person you go to,</v>

1596
01:31:34.811 --> 01:31:35.644
<v Speaker 3>his hands on that Gospel was Carl Young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is an amazing example of </v>

1597
01:31:39.011 --> 01:31:39.940
<v Speaker 3>synchronicity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1598
01:31:39.941 --> 01:31:40.774
<v Speaker 3>The first of the gnostic gospels that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was released into the broader world </v>

1599
01:31:45.971 --> 01:31:49.810
<v Speaker 3>ended up in Carl Jung's hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely amazing historical fact.</v>

1600
01:31:50.290 --> 01:31:51.123
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seem to be to be extraordinarily </v>

1601
01:31:54.161 --> 01:31:54.994
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

1602
01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:56.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1603
01:31:57.670 --> 01:32:00.430
<v Speaker 3>and I read them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose in some ways the same way that</v>

1604
01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:01.264
<v Speaker 3>I read the Canonical Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to extract out what wisdom </v>

1605
01:32:03.701 --> 01:32:07.720
<v Speaker 3>there is in them or what wisdom I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand anyways and utilize it to the</v>

1606
01:32:07.721 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 3>degree that I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1607
01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:14.013
<v Speaker 3>in one of your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned about the power that </v>

1608
01:32:15.911 --> 01:32:16.744
<v Speaker 3>creates order from chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but can also create chaos from </v>

1609
01:32:18.791 --> 01:32:22.000
<v Speaker 3>pathological ordered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you expand and explaining the latter</v>

1610
01:32:22.001 --> 01:32:22.920
<v Speaker 3>one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1611
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:24.093
<v Speaker 3>the logo logos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the human capacity for </v>

1612
01:32:25.991 --> 01:32:27.900
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1613
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:31.990
<v Speaker 3>and communication and awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that it's,</v>

1614
01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:32.853
<v Speaker 3>it's actually the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually one of the fundamental </v>

1615
01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.380
<v Speaker 3>prerequisites for being itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1616
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:40.930
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the things that makes me</v>
<v Speaker 3>different from a standard materialist I,</v>

1617
01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that there can be being </v>
<v Speaker 3>without consciousness.</v>

1618
01:32:44.261 --> 01:32:48.820
<v Speaker 3>And so I think of consciousness as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>primary element of well of reality.</v>

1619
01:32:49.090 --> 01:32:52.300
<v Speaker 3>It's irreducible element of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

1620
01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.180
<v Speaker 3>a prerequisite for reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about.</v>

1621
01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:58.540
<v Speaker 3>And that's the logo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So essentially,</v>

1622
01:32:59.470 --> 01:33:00.303
<v Speaker 3>and it's respect for the logo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would say that's the deepest </v>

1623
01:33:02.681 --> 01:33:05.110
<v Speaker 3>doctrine of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the biblical stories.</v>

1624
01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the logos do?</v>

1625
01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.153
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see this in Christ story most </v>

1626
01:33:12.491 --> 01:33:15.280
<v Speaker 3>particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Christ is often presented as a social</v>

1627
01:33:15.281 --> 01:33:17.680
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All cast,</v>

1628
01:33:17.681 --> 01:33:21.850
<v Speaker 3>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the same mold as Moses,</v>

1629
01:33:21.850 --> 01:33:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moses opposed the Egyptian tyranny,</v>

1630
01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.780
<v Speaker 3>like Christ opposed the tyranny of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pharisees and the scribes.</v>

1631
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.550
<v Speaker 3>And Moses produced tales as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of opposing the tyranny,</v>

1632
01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.393
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He first chaos was the crossing of the </v>

1633
01:33:37.991 --> 01:33:38.824
<v Speaker 3>water and Moses was a master of water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the same symbolically as </v>

1634
01:33:41.711 --> 01:33:42.544
<v Speaker 3>being a master of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But after he freed the Hebrews from the </v>

1635
01:33:46.241 --> 01:33:47.074
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while they entered a period that was 40 </v>

1636
01:33:49.661 --> 01:33:50.494
<v Speaker 3>years long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the story goes of almost on almost </v>

1637
01:33:53.381 --> 01:33:54.580
<v Speaker 3>complete chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1638
01:33:54.581 --> 01:33:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Abandonment in a desert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous moral confusion,</v>

1639
01:33:58.271 --> 01:33:59.104
<v Speaker 3>lack of direction and purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so sometimes the hero is the person </v>

1640
01:34:02.531 --> 01:34:06.490
<v Speaker 3>who makes order out of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes the hero is the person who</v>

1641
01:34:06.491 --> 01:34:10.810
<v Speaker 3>makes intermediary chaos out of an order</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's become too tyrannical.</v>

1642
01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.213
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's best to think of the logo says the </v>

1643
01:34:14.741 --> 01:34:15.574
<v Speaker 3>forest that keeps order and chaos in </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance rather than transform rather </v>

1644
01:34:19.151 --> 01:34:23.450
<v Speaker 3>than generating order out of chaos or </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos on the border because it did.</v>

1645
01:34:23.650 --> 01:34:28.120
<v Speaker 3>The logos operates to do one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>two things depending on the situation.</v>

1646
01:34:28.630 --> 01:34:29.463
<v Speaker 3>And so it's frequently generating order </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of chaos because there's plenty of </v>

1647
01:34:32.951 --> 01:34:35.020
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also plenty of tyranny,</v>

1648
01:34:35.021 --> 01:34:38.620
<v Speaker 3>in which case the hero or the person who</v>
<v Speaker 3>embodies the logos is,</v>

1649
01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:39.813
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is struggling to destroy the tyrannical </v>

1650
01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:45.850
<v Speaker 3>king and replace him with someone that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

1651
01:34:46.050 --> 01:34:46.883
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's playing a more reciprocal and </v>

1652
01:34:49.211 --> 01:34:51.850
<v Speaker 3>property negotiated game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1653
01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:54.430
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>

1654
01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:56.073
<v Speaker 3>I'll answer like two more I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I have to stop because I'm </v>

1655
01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:02.090
<v Speaker 3>getting fuzzy minded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1656
01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:07.310
<v Speaker 3>to what extent do you think your tips </v>
<v Speaker 3>for young people clean your room,</v>

1657
01:35:07.311 --> 01:35:08.144
<v Speaker 3>make a schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read great books are predicated on your </v>

1658
01:35:10.011 --> 01:35:12.410
<v Speaker 3>own personality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1659
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 3>I think they're predicated on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality to some degree.</v>

1660
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:16.623
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that a lot of my </v>

1661
01:35:18.261 --> 01:35:21.140
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness such as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been learned.</v>

1662
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:24.410
<v Speaker 3>I think I disciplined myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in graduate school.</v>

1663
01:35:24.411 --> 01:35:29.411
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think it was necessarily an </v>
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic part of my personality.</v>

1664
01:35:29.421 --> 01:35:30.254
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something that I learned to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do because I felt that I had something </v>

1665
01:35:32.721 --> 01:35:34.910
<v Speaker 3>that was worthwhile to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1666
01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:42.010
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to answer it beyond </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because,</v>

1667
01:35:42.011 --> 01:35:42.844
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am affected by my own personality </v>

1668
01:35:44.771 --> 01:35:45.604
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I think that I give advice </v>

1669
01:35:47.831 --> 01:35:50.170
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty balanced across all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimensions,</v>

1670
01:35:50.171 --> 01:35:51.004
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I think that you should be capable </v>

1671
01:35:53.261 --> 01:35:54.094
<v Speaker 3>of speaking in public fluently and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to communicate with </v>

1672
01:35:59.291 --> 01:36:00.124
<v Speaker 3>groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that you should be able to be </v>

1673
01:36:01.421 --> 01:36:02.254
<v Speaker 3>solitary and work on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that covers extroversion and </v>

1674
01:36:04.541 --> 01:36:05.374
<v Speaker 3>introversion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that working on control of </v>

1675
01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:10.430
<v Speaker 3>negative emotion is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1676
01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:11.673
<v Speaker 3>and so that's partly dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and stress and that's the </v>

1677
01:36:14.111 --> 01:36:14.944
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that you should be agreeable </v>

1678
01:36:17.621 --> 01:36:20.620
<v Speaker 3>when it's necessary and disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's necessary.</v>

1679
01:36:20.621 --> 01:36:23.590
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a broadening alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The agreeableness dimension.</v>

1680
01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:24.813
<v Speaker 3>I think that discipline is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>important in a complex society like </v>

1681
01:36:28.541 --> 01:36:30.640
<v Speaker 3>ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Discipline is extremely important and so</v>

1682
01:36:30.641 --> 01:36:31.474
<v Speaker 3>I think that being able to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientious and reliable and orderly </v>

1683
01:36:34.721 --> 01:36:35.554
<v Speaker 3>to some degree is necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that you should be able to withdraw </v>

1684
01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:42.490
<v Speaker 3>from that when necessary so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a break and have some fun.</v>

1685
01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:43.873
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could risk becoming over </v>

1686
01:36:46.211 --> 01:36:48.280
<v Speaker 3>committed to your work or two year </v>
<v Speaker 3>endeavor.</v>

1687
01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:50.860
<v Speaker 3>So I do think that that's something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I risk</v>

1688
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:55.270
<v Speaker 3>maybe I trained myself to be too </v>
<v Speaker 3>industrious.</v>

1689
01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:57.190
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1690
01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:58.473
<v Speaker 3>openness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that might be a place where I have </v>

1691
01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:05.800
<v Speaker 3>a personality predicated blind spot </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm very,</v>

1692
01:37:05.801 --> 01:37:10.180
<v Speaker 3>very high in openness and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do believe that there's utility in</v>

1693
01:37:10.210 --> 01:37:13.450
<v Speaker 3>exposing yourself to the world of great </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

1694
01:37:13.451 --> 01:37:15.480
<v Speaker 3>And that's not for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1695
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:16.333
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally conservative in their </v>

1696
01:37:18.851 --> 01:37:21.730
<v Speaker 3>orientation and more power to them I </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppose.</v>

1697
01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.593
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to read then you should </v>

1698
01:37:25.091 --> 01:37:28.750
<v Speaker 3>read great things and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in the life of the intellect,</v>

1699
01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:29.613
<v Speaker 3>the philosophical life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then then there's much to be learned by </v>

1700
01:37:32.231 --> 01:37:33.670
<v Speaker 3>reading great books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1701
01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.073
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think that I'm overwhelmingly</v>
<v Speaker 3>biased with regards to my own </v>

1702
01:37:39.401 --> 01:37:41.080
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you never know.</v>

1703
01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

1704
01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:43.323
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for someone to judge that </v>

1705
01:37:46.721 --> 01:37:48.820
<v Speaker 3>about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1706
01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:18.403
<v Speaker 3>can one reason with a stalker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Stalker is highly intelligent and </v>

1707
01:38:21.651 --> 01:38:23.360
<v Speaker 3>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Making him scarier.</v>

1708
01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm beginning to work with police and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers.</v>

1709
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:27.590
<v Speaker 3>But wondering if you have experienced in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this realm,</v>

1710
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:30.470
<v Speaker 3>I would say</v>

1711
01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:34.620
<v Speaker 3>not knowing the specifics of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

1712
01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:36.023
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't really reason with the </v>

1713
01:38:37.441 --> 01:38:38.274
<v Speaker 3>stocker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stocker is already gone beyond the </v>

1714
01:38:42.930 --> 01:38:45.750
<v Speaker 3>realm of normal social behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1715
01:38:45.751 --> 01:38:46.584
<v Speaker 3>and I would say with most stockers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assuming that you're dealing with the </v>

1716
01:38:49.501 --> 01:38:53.010
<v Speaker 3>genuine article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they tend to be a little bit on the</v>

1717
01:38:53.011 --> 01:38:55.810
<v Speaker 3>paranoid side or maybe a lot on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>paranoid side.</v>

1718
01:38:55.811 --> 01:38:56.644
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>paranoid is that they have adopted a </v>

1719
01:39:00.841 --> 01:39:05.430
<v Speaker 3>couple of axioms as absolutely fixed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no shifting them.</v>

1720
01:39:05.431 --> 01:39:09.310
<v Speaker 3>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1721
01:39:09.311 --> 01:39:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I hate to give advice in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

1722
01:39:11.621 --> 01:39:16.621
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't say that the probability </v>
<v Speaker 3>of using reason is precluded by the fact</v>

1723
01:39:17.981 --> 01:39:20.680
<v Speaker 3>of the stalking behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So good luck with it.</v>

1724
01:39:20.681 --> 01:39:21.910
<v Speaker 3>That's very scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

1725
01:39:21.911 --> 01:39:22.744
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for people to be protected </v>
<v Speaker 3>from someone who's intent on following </v>

1726
01:39:26.681 --> 01:39:29.770
<v Speaker 3>them and perhaps making their life </v>
<v Speaker 3>miserable.</v>

1727
01:39:30.430 --> 01:39:31.263
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1728
01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.033
<v Speaker 3>insights on how I would overcome or live</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my fear of Nellis and </v>

1729
01:39:38.801 --> 01:39:40.960
<v Speaker 3>disappointment in Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

1730
01:39:40.961 --> 01:39:42.490
<v Speaker 3>the novel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1731
01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.680
<v Speaker 3>here's something that you might </v>
<v Speaker 3>consider.</v>

1732
01:39:45.190 --> 01:39:46.023
<v Speaker 3>So when you're a child and you're naive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you trust people because you're </v>

1733
01:39:49.241 --> 01:39:50.074
<v Speaker 3>naive and you don't know any better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know that people can hurt you </v>

1734
01:39:52.571 --> 01:39:55.750
<v Speaker 3>unless you're a very unfortunate child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your,</v>

1735
01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:00.960
<v Speaker 3>your trust isn't a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a sign of your innocence,</v>

1736
01:40:00.971 --> 01:40:01.804
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that kind of innocence isn't a </v>

1737
01:40:03.701 --> 01:40:05.500
<v Speaker 3>virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just lack of experience.</v>

1738
01:40:05.501 --> 01:40:06.850
<v Speaker 3>But when you're older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

1739
01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:11.170
<v Speaker 3>courage or trust isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a hallmark of courage.</v>

1740
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:15.700
<v Speaker 3>You extend your hand to people and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>extend your trust to people knowing full</v>

1741
01:40:15.701 --> 01:40:19.180
<v Speaker 3>well that you can be bit like you might </v>
<v Speaker 3>be bitten by a Cobra,</v>

1742
01:40:19.181 --> 01:40:21.910
<v Speaker 3>you can be betrayed and disappointed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1743
01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:26.080
<v Speaker 3>but you extend your hand in trust </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of courage,</v>

1744
01:40:26.081 --> 01:40:29.890
<v Speaker 3>because you decide to take the risk and </v>
<v Speaker 3>by taking that risk,</v>

1745
01:40:29.891 --> 01:40:32.680
<v Speaker 3>you open the door to the best in people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1746
01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.580
<v Speaker 3>but you won't see that door open unless </v>
<v Speaker 3>you first take the step to trust.</v>

1747
01:40:36.970 --> 01:40:41.970
<v Speaker 3>And so I would say you have to practice</v>
<v Speaker 3>trusting people.</v>

1748
01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.113
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to share things that are </v>

1749
01:40:46.871 --> 01:40:47.704
<v Speaker 3>somewhat private.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to ask people for small favors </v>

1750
01:40:50.651 --> 01:40:51.484
<v Speaker 3>and trade small favors and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that knowing full well that you can get </v>

1751
01:40:54.941 --> 01:40:55.774
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So think about it as an act of courage </v>

1752
01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.160
<v Speaker 3>instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1753
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:02.020
<v Speaker 3>instead of naivety or,</v>

1754
01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:02.750
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

1755
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:03.950
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

1756
01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.233
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

1757
01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.400
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of naive t,</v>

1758
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:10.310
<v Speaker 3>let's leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I would recommend.</v>

1759
01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:17.090
<v Speaker 3>All right everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stop.</v>

1760
01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:18.493
<v Speaker 3>So once again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much for listening to me </v>

1761
01:41:22.791 --> 01:41:24.650
<v Speaker 3>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that it went well.</v>

1762
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can never tell when I'm doing this,</v>

1763
01:41:28.521 --> 01:41:32.390
<v Speaker 3>but they seem to be popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very pleased that you all</v>

1764
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:36.890
<v Speaker 3>spend so much time putting these </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions together and,</v>

1765
01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.800
<v Speaker 3>and watching my videos and listening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1766
01:41:39.801 --> 01:41:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm genuinely and continually amazed and</v>

1767
01:41:44.541 --> 01:41:46.610
<v Speaker 3>grateful about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1768
01:41:46.611 --> 01:41:47.444
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you all have a good month and </v>

1769
01:41:49.521 --> 01:41:54.521

<v Speaker 3>can on putting yourself together because</v>

<v Speaker 3>the more together people there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better things are going to go for </v>

1771
01:41:58.851 --> 01:42:00.950
<v Speaker 3>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's very important,</v>

1772
01:42:00.951 --> 01:42:01.784
<v Speaker 3>as I pointed out before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you get your individual life in </v>

1773
01:42:04.671 --> 01:42:09.671
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>
