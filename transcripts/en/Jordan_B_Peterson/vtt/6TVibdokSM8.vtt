00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's</v>

2
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.400
<v Speaker 1>actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying</v>

3
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>to to improve the coherency</v>

4
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.113
<v Speaker 2>of this manuscript by all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave you the summary for the whole </v>

5
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.880
<v Speaker 2>thing last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>week before,</v>

6
00:06:02.881 --> 00:06:03.714
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm going to write a summary for</v>
<v Speaker 2>every chapter and hopefully that'll </v>

7
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.853
<v Speaker 2>provide a structure for the more</v>
<v Speaker 2>either elaborate or vague depending on </v>

8
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:15.790
<v Speaker 2>your perspective arguments that fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

9
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.473
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you have is the summary of the </v>

10
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:23.264
<v Speaker 2>preface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very short and then a summary </v>

11
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:26.114
<v Speaker 2>of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument that I've been making </v>

12
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.890
<v Speaker 2>through that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reasonable to conceive of the world</v>

13
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:35.924
<v Speaker 2>in two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just trying to reduce that argument to </v>

14
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:45.851
<v Speaker 2>its essential aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the last two pages contain</v>

15
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 2>a description of the instinctive </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to novelty</v>

16
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.680
<v Speaker 2>and the manner in which that response </v>
<v Speaker 2>finds its representation and mythology.</v>

17
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.770
<v Speaker 2>And maybe by next week I'll have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>four more chapters,</v>

18
00:07:04.771 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 2>summaries or something for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you look.</v>

19
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so where are generally.</v>

20
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:19.783
<v Speaker 2>We've been discussing the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the dangers that are inherent to </v>

21
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:25.214
<v Speaker 2>group identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the tendency of group identity </v>

22
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:29.234
<v Speaker 2>to adopt that totalitarian stamps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a consequence of its of any </v>

23
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:36.650
<v Speaker 2>groups propensity to try to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that structure over time.</v>

24
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.483
<v Speaker 2>We're we're discussing the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that inevitable tendency of the </v>

25
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:46.661
<v Speaker 2>group might be heightened in its danger </v>
<v Speaker 2>by certain types of individuals.</v>

26
00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Psychopathology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was trying to make the argument</v>

27
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.581
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

28
00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:53.414
<v Speaker 2>this week in the Atlantic monthly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a discussion of William James </v>

29
00:07:56.631 --> 00:07:57.464
<v Speaker 2>and his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his inquiry into religious </v>

30
00:07:58.461 --> 00:07:59.294
<v Speaker 2>phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was apparently motivated in large </v>

31
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 2>part by his use of nitric oxide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an also an argument in there</v>

32
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:05.444
<v Speaker 2>that elaborates upon shelly Taylor's </v>
<v Speaker 2>findings in social psychology that </v>

33
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 2>positive illusions according to tailor </v>
<v Speaker 2>foster mental health.</v>

34
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.353
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That idea has now spread right out into </v>

35
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:17.564
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream press and the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote the Atlantic monthly article and </v>

36
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.793
<v Speaker 2>just making the point that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the validity of a belief might be </v>

37
00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 2>determined by whether or not it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you happy.</v>

38
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 2>She's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

39
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous perspective.</v>

40
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.953
<v Speaker 2>It's back to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to this minority might these and I </v>

41
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:38.924
<v Speaker 2>brought that up is because of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a point that's absolutely </v>

42
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 2>contrary to the point that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained in making this class,</v>

43
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:46.430
<v Speaker 2>which is it's the individual tendency to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deceive themselves,</v>

44
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.473
<v Speaker 2>to deceive ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the deceit oneself about the nature </v>

45
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:51.284
<v Speaker 2>of reality as it's defined personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That constitutes the basic form of </v>

46
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 2>psychopathology attorneys with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

47
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.973
<v Speaker 2>which is a necessary but dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure into something that's </v>

48
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 2>pathologically dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the argument,</v>

49
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.743
<v Speaker 2>basically I'll start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll discuss that argument today a </v>

50
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 2>little bit more detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I want to flip</v>

51
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.473
<v Speaker 2>to the last part of the course which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a discussion of the process and that </v>

52
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:18.684
<v Speaker 2>hopefully will serve as an antithesis to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this individual pathology so you can </v>

53
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:24.301
<v Speaker 2>describe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

54
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:25.134
<v Speaker 2>you can define thing something very well</v>
<v Speaker 2>by describing its opposite and that's </v>

55
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 2>why we have anti heroes and literature </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part because they're good,</v>

56
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:32.994
<v Speaker 2>bad examples and you can infer the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite of something from the </v>

57
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 2>description of that thing.</v>

58
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.010
<v Speaker 2>So it's perfectly reasonable to started </v>
<v Speaker 2>description of</v>

59
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 2>identification with heroism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose by discussing its opposite.</v>

60
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.490
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a quote from him on page 211.</v>

61
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.673
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who alone has reason to lie himself out </v>

62
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 2>of actuality and his answer to that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>he who suffers from it?</v>

63
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.213
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting statement because </v>

64
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.170
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's not a description of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual person</v>

65
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.293
<v Speaker 2>or a way of drawing a distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between those who lie and those who </v>

66
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:11.124
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

67
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.720
<v Speaker 2>It's more a way of saying that since </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious that everybody suffers from</v>

68
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:16.554
<v Speaker 2>actuality that everyone has sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation to lie and what we're going </v>

69
00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 2>to try to get out a little bit today </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

70
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.770
<v Speaker 2>is</v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely what that motivation is</v>

71
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.690
<v Speaker 2>and then what the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inevitable consequences of following</v>

72
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 2>them additive and outpatient might be.</v>

73
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.613
<v Speaker 2>I made the point last week that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to get a picture of the </v>

74
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:47.144
<v Speaker 2>process that serves as the adversarial </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterpart to the mythological hero </v>

75
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.483
<v Speaker 2>because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that that process has been </v>

76
00:10:56.091 --> 00:10:56.924
<v Speaker 2>described as a personality and mythology</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it consists of a number of a </v>

77
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.993
<v Speaker 2>number of things simultaneously and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to discuss something that </v>

78
00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:07.730
<v Speaker 2>consists of a number of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>

79
00:11:07.731 --> 00:11:08.564
<v Speaker 2>Because when we discuss anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to break it down into its </v>

80
00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:10.784
<v Speaker 2>constituent elements and you risk over </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplifying the personality or reducing </v>

81
00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:16.484
<v Speaker 2>it to something to one single thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not and the tendency ally is a </v>

82
00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:21.434
<v Speaker 2>bunch of things at once that are all </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrelated and it would be a mistake </v>

83
00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:28.310
<v Speaker 2>to try to reduce it to a single thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think at least in part</v>

84
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:31.923
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or one of the essential aspects of the </v>

85
00:11:33.701 --> 00:11:34.534
<v Speaker 2>tendency to lie as rejection error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a quote I'm going to read </v>

86
00:11:38.411 --> 00:11:39.244
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A quote from Milton behavior described </v>

87
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Satan's attitude and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a little comment on that.</v>

88
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first which way I fly is hail myself,</v>

89
00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 2>am hill and in the lowest deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lower,</v>

90
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:01.150
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still threatening to devour me,</v>

91
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:04.480
<v Speaker 2>opens wide to which the hell I suffer </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to heaven.</v>

92
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.433
<v Speaker 2>The Devil Who's traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of evil refuses any </v>

93
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:10.444
<v Speaker 2>recognition of imperfection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refuses to admit I was an error in my </v>

94
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:15.244
<v Speaker 2>action or in my representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accepts as a consequence of unbending </v>

95
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eternal misery refuses Metanoia,</v>

96
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.290
<v Speaker 2>which is confession and reconciliation's</v>
<v Speaker 2>remains forever.</v>

97
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 2>The spirit that refuses and rejects this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a quote,</v>

98
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then at last,</v>

99
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:36.430
<v Speaker 2>relent is there no place left for </v>
<v Speaker 2>repentance now for pardon left,</v>

100
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.180
<v Speaker 2>not left by submission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that we're disdain for bids,</v>

101
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:44.014
<v Speaker 2>me and my dread of shame among the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirits beneath whom I seduced with </v>

102
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:51.910
<v Speaker 2>other promises and other violence than </v>
<v Speaker 2>to submit boasting.</v>

103
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:56.260
<v Speaker 2>I could subdue the omnipotent I me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>

104
00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:57.094
<v Speaker 2>Know how dearly I abide that boast so </v>
<v Speaker 2>vein under what torments inwardly I </v>

105
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:01.600
<v Speaker 2>grown well.</v>

106
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.250
<v Speaker 2>They adore me on the throat of hell with</v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic sector,</v>

107
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 2>high advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lower still,</v>

108
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:10.210
<v Speaker 2>I fall only supreme and misery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such joy,</v>

109
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 2>ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fines,</v>

110
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.700
<v Speaker 2>but say I could repent and could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>obtained by active grace,</v>

111
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:18.700
<v Speaker 2>my former state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How soon should height recall?</v>

112
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:22.210
<v Speaker 2>High thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How soon unsay what fain submission.</v>

113
00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:23.044
<v Speaker 2>Swore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These would recant vows made in pain as </v>

114
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:29.260
<v Speaker 2>violent and void for never can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True reconcilement girl,</v>

115
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 2>where were wounds of deadly Hayden peers</v>
<v Speaker 2>so deep,</v>

116
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.860
<v Speaker 2>which would lead me to a worse relapse </v>
<v Speaker 2>and heavier fall.</v>

117
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.340
<v Speaker 2>So should I purchase deere short </v>
<v Speaker 2>intermission,</v>

118
00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 2>bought with double smart vis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows my punisher.</v>

119
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.683
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far from granting heat as I from </v>

120
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:48.320
<v Speaker 2>begging piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all hope excluded us</v>

121
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.790
<v Speaker 2>such refusal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inability to say I was wrong,</v>

122
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:54.803
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should change means the death of hope </v>

123
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.240
<v Speaker 2>and existence and how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This</v>

124
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:02.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

125
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.323
<v Speaker 2>Rejection of fact means alienation from </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning from truth and life without </v>

126
00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:07.434
<v Speaker 2>meaning is suffering without recourse </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the have nothing but construction </v>

127
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.140
<v Speaker 2>in accordance with self definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea I guess what we're trying to</v>

128
00:14:16.921 --> 00:14:20.250
<v Speaker 2>do in a sense as to unpack what </v>
<v Speaker 2>rejection of error means.</v>

129
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.473
<v Speaker 2>You already know from looking at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture we put together of the </v>

130
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.640
<v Speaker 2>mythological portrait or portrayal of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality that the,</v>

131
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.870
<v Speaker 2>that all new information is gathered as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a consequence of contact with a known.</v>

132
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is just a definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

133
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.073
<v Speaker 2>You can't gather anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any new information unless you're </v>

134
00:14:39.331 --> 00:14:41.160
<v Speaker 2>somewhere that you haven't been so to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>

135
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.013
<v Speaker 2>You have to be in territory that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexplored to gather anything that's </v>

136
00:14:45.631 --> 00:14:47.180
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

137
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.290
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that from a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

138
00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:50.124
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since we're dealing with behavior and </v>

139
00:14:52.441 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the only way that you can get to</v>

140
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:56.354
<v Speaker 2>be somewhere that you don't know is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>admitting to the existence of anomalous </v>

141
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Speaker 2>to the existence of anomaly and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>tantamount to an admission that you were</v>

142
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:05.054
<v Speaker 2>incorrect.</v>

143
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.690
<v Speaker 2>The idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>having your vision of yourself and where</v>

144
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 2>you are and you're contracting with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision of where you want to be.</v>

145
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.980
<v Speaker 2>That's that's sort of your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of what constitutes the world</v>

146
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Speaker 2>and both of those polls are subject to </v>
<v Speaker 2>modification,</v>

147
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:23.600
<v Speaker 2>but you're the one who decides what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>polls are.</v>

148
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.453
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're setting up the rules of the game </v>

149
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 2>and then if by your own definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your actions which are designed to bring</v>

150
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 2>where you are to where you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced,</v>

151
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:36.740
<v Speaker 2>a contrary result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's anomalous.</v>

152
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 2>That's an enormous piece of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By your own definition,</v>

153
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.333
<v Speaker 2>see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stress that because the problem with </v>

154
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:44.954
<v Speaker 2>talking about something like error is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you might think that implicit in </v>

155
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:49.124
<v Speaker 2>that discussion is the notion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some that you have to make </v>

156
00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:54.140
<v Speaker 2>recourse to an idea of absolute truth to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about error,</v>

157
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.063
<v Speaker 2>but you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This model is predicated on the notion </v>

158
00:15:57.741 --> 00:16:01.550
<v Speaker 2>that you define the terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument for yourself,</v>

159
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:03.583
<v Speaker 2>which is to say you're the one who </v>
<v Speaker 2>decides where you are and also where </v>

160
00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:07.574
<v Speaker 2>you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you pull in information from </v>

161
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:11.990
<v Speaker 2>outside to make those decisions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

162
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.033
<v Speaker 2>but still your game and if the actions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've constructed produce results </v>

163
00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:20.600
<v Speaker 2>that you didn't intend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what constitutes an anomaly.</v>

164
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.740
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't that you have to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about absolute truth,</v>

165
00:16:23.741 --> 00:16:24.574
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to determine when you are in fact an </v>

166
00:16:26.201 --> 00:16:27.770
<v Speaker 2>error because you make the decisions.</v>

167
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:37.060
<v Speaker 2>Establishing a relationship or an aspect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that information that you get back in</v>

168
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.063
<v Speaker 2>the context of that relationship when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>contradicts information is coming from </v>

169
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:43.064
<v Speaker 2>another source</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than rather than it being some </v>

170
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:50.340
<v Speaker 2>sort of internal framework that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>established.</v>

171
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.223
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a conflict between the meaning </v>

172
00:16:53.501 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 2>you're getting two different </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

173
00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:58.320
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's.</v>

174
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.203
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's an equivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an equivalent phenomenon because </v>

175
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:07.181
<v Speaker 2>it is one of the examples I'm using the </v>
<v Speaker 2>text made about abortion because you can</v>

176
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:08.024
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

177
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:09.643
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of emotional intensity </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding the abortion debate because </v>

178
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:17.210
<v Speaker 2>it pits to cultural schemas against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>against one.</v>

179
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Another one says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right to life is paramount,</v>

180
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.560
<v Speaker 2>which is a perfectly no one position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other position says no,</v>

181
00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:26.180
<v Speaker 2>the right to freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to free choices.</v>

182
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Paramount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

183
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.273
<v Speaker 2>under most circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people in this society except both </v>

184
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 2>of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

185
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:36.260
<v Speaker 2>moral presuppositions about abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to be one situation,</v>

186
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.200
<v Speaker 2>assuming good will on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

187
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.423
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to be one situation where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena of the world presents us with </v>

188
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 2>puts those two positions necessarily at </v>
<v Speaker 2>odds.</v>

189
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.903
<v Speaker 2>So then a third decision is necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the decision to hierarchically </v>

190
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.353
<v Speaker 2>arranged to preceptive presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it can be the case that one </v>

191
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:56.424
<v Speaker 2>philosophical stance that's done in most</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and another valid in most </v>

192
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:03.120
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and meet in a third place </v>
<v Speaker 2>and more in opposition.</v>

193
00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.293
<v Speaker 2>So then you get a situation where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an environmental phenomena </v>

194
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.300
<v Speaker 2>which would be the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unwanted possibility of abortion,</v>

195
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 2>that the two moral systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are modes of adaptation,</v>

196
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.560
<v Speaker 2>do not properly address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens?</v>

197
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.723
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the eruption of an anomalous </v>

198
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:27.150
<v Speaker 2>occurrence into a cultural structure and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happens when that</v>

199
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:28.740
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing happens is that you get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

200
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.980
<v Speaker 2>There is a war in this country between </v>
<v Speaker 2>those two positions.</v>

201
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.680
<v Speaker 2>It's just mostly still fought at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of words,</v>

202
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 2>but not always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the.</v>

203
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a conflict of values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you said,</v>

204
00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:43.854
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the most difficult moral decisions </v>

205
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 2>always come about when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict of duty.</v>

206
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.440
<v Speaker 2>One valid principle says actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern a.</v>

207
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.483
<v Speaker 2>another valid principle says action </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern be the two action patterns </v>

208
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.433
<v Speaker 2>juxtapose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>juxtapose what was producing Iran </v>

209
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.403
<v Speaker 2>irreconcilable situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then then the question is what do you </v>

210
00:19:03.871 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can you do?</v>

211
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.473
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what we're going to get </v>

212
00:19:07.671 --> 00:19:08.504
<v Speaker 2>at when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we get to the end of the argument </v>

213
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible here and it's impossible</v>

214
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:15.990
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

215
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>

216
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I was wondering whether those </v>

217
00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:23.450
<v Speaker 3>two situations are analogous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the emphasis was slightly different.</v>

218
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.403
<v Speaker 3>Whether you've got to resolve it </v>
<v Speaker 3>internally or when did you've got to </v>

219
00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:30.540
<v Speaker 3>resolve it in a sense of several hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>connections with one of those.</v>

220
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an.</v>

221
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.040
<v Speaker 2>That's an option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an option.</v>

222
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.573
<v Speaker 2>I would say one of the things we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to discuss today is consequences </v>

223
00:19:38.381 --> 00:19:39.214
<v Speaker 2>of response patterns to anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 2>information and I would say well one </v>

224
00:19:43.001 --> 00:19:46.650
<v Speaker 2>common way of dealing with the normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurrence that's so tight.</v>

225
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.753
<v Speaker 2>It's just a fortify the position that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think is most appropriate and </v>

226
00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:53.690
<v Speaker 2>exclude the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

227
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.490
<v Speaker 2>it's that sort of solution writ large </v>
<v Speaker 2>and society.</v>

228
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean it has its advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's protected,</v>

229
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:05.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's also that sort of solution that</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken to an extreme causes.</v>

230
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.370
<v Speaker 2>What causes the walls to rise up around </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>

231
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:11.973
<v Speaker 2>One way of eliminating anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 2>information is to increase the </v>

232
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.200
<v Speaker 2>conformance and within the group and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put more barriers up.</v>

233
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Just stop information from flowing in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good solution,</v>

234
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.333
<v Speaker 2>but it has its problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyone's is your idea that all the </v>

235
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.690
<v Speaker 2>anomaly is personal error is experienced</v>
<v Speaker 2>as personal level.</v>

236
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.100
<v Speaker 2>The asset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's basically the idea.</v>

237
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the unknown?</v>

238
00:20:35.411 --> 00:20:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the unknown,</v>

239
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.823
<v Speaker 2>the way that we're construing it is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena that appears cloaked in </v>

240
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:42.963
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always necessarily making its </v>

241
00:20:44.831 --> 00:20:47.140
<v Speaker 2>appearance on the scene of individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

242
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.290
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is you're acting out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your moral presuppositions,</v>

243
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.950
<v Speaker 2>which you have determined by your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules are the ones you should act out.</v>

244
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Then a piece of information pops up its </v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly head suggesting that your means are</v>

245
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or in a catastrophic case,</v>

246
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.770
<v Speaker 2>the manner in which you construe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>present or your ends are wrong.</v>

247
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.260
<v Speaker 2>In which case you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're really,</v>

248
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 2>you're really in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

249
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.100
<v Speaker 2>the question is what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then?</v>

250
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:14.320
<v Speaker 2>What do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

251
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.330
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what we're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

252
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.950
<v Speaker 2>there's three alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

253
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.053
<v Speaker 2>One is that you can even just</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend the anomalous thing never </v>

254
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:24.874
<v Speaker 2>happened and continue on in your path as</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the world was the way you thought it </v>

255
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 2>was when you know it not to be the case.</v>

256
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.523
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other is to actively take measures </v>

257
00:21:34.451 --> 00:21:39.451
<v Speaker 2>to get rid of the anomalous information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a more extreme,</v>

258
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 2>very tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That first position.</v>

259
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.753
<v Speaker 2>The second is to give up your whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral system and the underground </v>

260
00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 2>advantage to that is the normal systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>or hey,</v>

261
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.693
<v Speaker 2>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they they have a protective </v>

262
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 2>function certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to adhere to the means that you have</v>

263
00:21:55.901 --> 00:21:56.734
<v Speaker 2>to discipline your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I made a comment in there at one </v>

264
00:22:01.561 --> 00:22:02.394
<v Speaker 2>point about the dark side of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalism as well as many comments </v>

265
00:22:06.511 --> 00:22:08.150
<v Speaker 2>about the dark side of conservatives.</v>

266
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.103
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons to be extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>to welcome novel information is so that </v>

267
00:22:17.091 --> 00:22:17.924
<v Speaker 2>you can dissolve all those structures to</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you might have otherwise had to </v>

268
00:22:21.291 --> 00:22:22.124
<v Speaker 2>adhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with adhering to those </v>

269
00:22:23.631 --> 00:22:25.340
<v Speaker 2>structures is that it takes a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

270
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.510
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to be an optimal member</v>
<v Speaker 2>of any given society.</v>

271
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.303
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole structure of discipline </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's necessary to adhere to and it's </v>

272
00:22:35.691 --> 00:22:40.250
<v Speaker 2>easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very tolerant when actually what you</v>

273
00:22:40.251 --> 00:22:43.430
<v Speaker 2>mean is I can't tolerate any of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

274
00:22:43.431 --> 00:22:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll just let it go and everything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

275
00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:46.813
<v Speaker 2>but you can get away with that for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time because usually you're </v>

276
00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.100
<v Speaker 2>protected by other people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>adhering to the rules and who makes sure</v>

277
00:22:52.101 --> 00:22:55.310
<v Speaker 2>that like the unabomber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that you stay alive.</v>

278
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.950
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

279
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.080
<v Speaker 2>well the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

280
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.973
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>this argument always loops back onto </v>

281
00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:07.104
<v Speaker 2>itself because the processes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually can only be described as in </v>

282
00:23:10.471 --> 00:23:11.304
<v Speaker 2>terms of feedback loop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's very difficult to get a handle </v>

283
00:23:13.231 --> 00:23:15.810
<v Speaker 2>on the origin of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to say,</v>

284
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.620
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

285
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.453
<v Speaker 2>But</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you reject the appearance of </v>

286
00:23:21.571 --> 00:23:25.110
<v Speaker 2>anomalous information?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say animals don't seem to do that.</v>

287
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.910
<v Speaker 2>While I'm on the argument that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to present is that as you pointed</v>

288
00:23:29.911 --> 00:23:31.920
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all have a reason to lie.</v>

289
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.181
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

290
00:23:33.181 --> 00:23:36.630
<v Speaker 2>why would you bother on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His answer was,</v>

291
00:23:36.631 --> 00:23:37.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you suffered from it.</v>

292
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.600
<v Speaker 2>That's a good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

293
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.443
<v Speaker 2>now it's a one sentence description of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the process that I was trying to </v>

294
00:23:43.801 --> 00:23:46.340
<v Speaker 2>describe in the chapter on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of self consciousness.</v>

295
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.210
<v Speaker 2>The problem for human beings is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>even for animals,</v>

296
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.133
<v Speaker 2>the appearance of an anomalous piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information is sufficient to activate </v>

297
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.780
<v Speaker 2>the right frontal cortical circuitry </v>
<v Speaker 2>that governs negative AFLAC.</v>

298
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Sprite and a normal occurrence stops you</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your tracks.</v>

299
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a rabbit and you're hopping</v>
<v Speaker 2>along the bush and you hear a noise that</v>

300
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:07.154
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you see a shape that's moving like a </v>

301
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will happen to you?</v>

302
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.390
<v Speaker 2>That's something that should not be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What will happen to you</v>

303
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.360
<v Speaker 2>is that you will freeze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

304
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Because the systems that govern anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 2>and inhibition of behavior gripped,</v>

305
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 2>gripped your critical apparatus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing happens in people.</v>

306
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Our first response to an anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>

307
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.350
<v Speaker 2>it is anxiety and the cessation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ongoing behavior,</v>

308
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:36.140
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if an anomalous event occurs,</v>

309
00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:39.140
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It indicates by its very nature that the</v>

310
00:24:39.141 --> 00:24:43.070
<v Speaker 2>plan you were undertaking is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise the anomalous piece of</v>

311
00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:46.130
<v Speaker 2>information wouldn't have showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with us is that</v>

312
00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.503
<v Speaker 2>the whole domain of anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which can be conceptualized as a place </v>

313
00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:55.370
<v Speaker 2>and is conceptualized that way in </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology,</v>

314
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:56.623
<v Speaker 2>is contaminated by our knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential consequences of air and those </v>

315
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.033
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can kind of divided into two </v>

316
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.533
<v Speaker 2>camps.</v>

317
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:10.270
<v Speaker 2>One price of admission of error is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to regard yourself as less than</v>

318
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 2>the group that you identify with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to say that you look like a fool in</v>

319
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:18.830
<v Speaker 2>front of people who theoretically you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want respect and admiration.</v>

320
00:25:18.831 --> 00:25:19.664
<v Speaker 2>Prop knows can be actual people or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be the people that live in your </v>

321
00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:27.350
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Super Ego Persona,</v>

322
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 2>persona five doesn't really matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>either way.</v>

323
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:30.794
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to recognize yourself as less </v>

324
00:25:33.351 --> 00:25:34.184
<v Speaker 2>than you might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one consequence and people are </v>

325
00:25:37.521 --> 00:25:40.490
<v Speaker 2>very terrified about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't like exposure of our weaknesses</v>

326
00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:41.324
<v Speaker 2>in front of the social group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even Freud pointed out in his </v>

327
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>common anxiety dream was to appear naked</v>

328
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:49.970
<v Speaker 2>in front of a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically you could say,</v>

329
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.793
<v Speaker 2>to expose your vulnerability to to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world or to have that vulnerability </v>

330
00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:56.774
<v Speaker 2>accidentally exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you make a fool of someone </v>

331
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:59.960
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what you're doing.</v>

332
00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like they have pretentions which </v>
<v Speaker 2>are there plans.</v>

333
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.033
<v Speaker 2>You just twist them appliance fall and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the person behind the plans and </v>

334
00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:09.034
<v Speaker 2>while they turn red and turned away </v>
<v Speaker 2>because their vulnerability has been </v>

335
00:26:11.571 --> 00:26:13.820
<v Speaker 2>made manifest to the group and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

336
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.090
<v Speaker 2>It's very unpleasant to occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's shaming part,</v>

337
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 2>so that's one reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other reason is that for us,</v>

338
00:26:20.601 --> 00:26:25.370
<v Speaker 2>the whole domain of it normally has a is</v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminated by the threat of mortality,</v>

339
00:26:25.371 --> 00:26:26.204
<v Speaker 2>which is something that's not true for </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals at all because animals can't </v>

340
00:26:27.951 --> 00:26:32.500
<v Speaker 2>conceive of themselves as an object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That faces is extreme limitations.</v>

341
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.170
<v Speaker 2>The limitations of mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have real reason to turn away from</v>

342
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.680
<v Speaker 2>anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

343
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 2>you want to make it concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

344
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.130
<v Speaker 2>I wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an 18 year side</v>

345
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:47.963
<v Speaker 2>that ache,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an anomalous piece of </v>

346
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:50.814
<v Speaker 2>information since you're always acting </v>
<v Speaker 2>too as a general rule at least maybe if </v>

347
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.673
<v Speaker 2>you worked out at the gym tonight night </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you have already made reasoning </v>

348
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.263
<v Speaker 2>and the ache is bounded by an </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation and it's an effect of </v>

349
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Valence is basically zero.</v>

350
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean you might be able to sniff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>day in favor the side,</v>

351
00:27:05.071 --> 00:27:07.080
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to walk around in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state of terror.</v>

352
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 2>If you have already made explanation for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anomaly,</v>

353
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.620
<v Speaker 2>then there's none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an.</v>

354
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 2>It has an unbounded potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance.</v>

355
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under normal circumstances,</v>

356
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.310
<v Speaker 2>you would like to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

357
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.413
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't go that serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go on with my life and see what </v>

358
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:22.050
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your hypochondriacal,</v>

359
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.060
<v Speaker 2>which means that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

360
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.043
<v Speaker 2>it means that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy for you to blow things out of </v>

361
00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Speaker 2>proportion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We allow your fantasy too,</v>

362
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:34.463
<v Speaker 2>which is a hypothesis generating machine</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work on providing potential </v>

363
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:41.430
<v Speaker 2>explanations for the egg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which might range from,</v>

364
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.773
<v Speaker 2>I slept wrong too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the incipient incipient sign of </v>

365
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:49.590
<v Speaker 2>the cancer that will kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know someone,</v>

366
00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:50.424
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's father and grandfather both died </v>

367
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:53.004
<v Speaker 2>of a heart attack when they were in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood of 40 and he's 35 and he's </v>

368
00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:58.853
<v Speaker 2>borderline agoraphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically means that he can't </v>

369
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:02.034
<v Speaker 2>tolerate any fluctuations in his heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate because that's one of the signs of </v>

370
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:06.720
<v Speaker 2>anger phobia.</v>

371
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.910
<v Speaker 2>People of anger phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if their heart rate goes up,</v>

372
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.920
<v Speaker 2>they tend to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

373
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.060
<v Speaker 2>this is the event that will either lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>me to make a fool of myself or that will</v>

374
00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:15.930
<v Speaker 2>kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

375
00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:16.773
<v Speaker 2>he's in a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much like that all the time </v>

376
00:28:18.091 --> 00:28:21.570
<v Speaker 2>because every time he feels some </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexplained internally then thanks.</v>

377
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:26.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the end of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see his.</v>

378
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.590
<v Speaker 2>You can see why he would be neurotic in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a situation like that.</v>

379
00:28:28.591 --> 00:28:30.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean he has good reason for doubting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the intake,</v>

380
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:31.883
<v Speaker 2>for doubting the easy explanations for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the existence of this anomalous </v>

381
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:39.300
<v Speaker 2>information because heart disease is </v>
<v Speaker 2>hereditary.</v>

382
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.840
<v Speaker 2>He's a little overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He drinks a little bit too much.</v>

383
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.440
<v Speaker 2>He smokes a little bit too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He works too hard.</v>

384
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.173
<v Speaker 2>Is good reason for being afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the sort of thing that the </v>

385
00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.753
<v Speaker 2>animals never going to experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>because an animal can't use it's cortex </v>

386
00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:56.363
<v Speaker 2>against it's limbic system in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something we can what your </v>

387
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:01.310
<v Speaker 2>cortex is supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your frontal cortex,</v>

388
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 2>then anomalous piece of information pops</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

389
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Your frontal cortex is supposed to map </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a behavioral pattern that eliminates</v>

390
00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:09.054
<v Speaker 2>the valence from the phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes you can't do that because </v>

391
00:29:11.311 --> 00:29:14.850
<v Speaker 2>your frontal cortex basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

392
00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:19.170
<v Speaker 2>this might be the thing that exposes my </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses to the group or kills me,</v>

393
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.093
<v Speaker 2>in which case your limbic system </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to that labeling as if that in </v>

394
00:29:22.831 --> 00:29:25.740
<v Speaker 2>itself is threat and out of control you </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

395
00:29:25.741 --> 00:29:29.100
<v Speaker 2>which I think is an explanation for </v>
<v Speaker 2>panic attacks,</v>

396
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.340
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic reasoning,</v>

397
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.650
<v Speaker 2>but everybody has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

398
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:35.610
<v Speaker 2>the x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

399
00:29:35.611 --> 00:29:40.500
<v Speaker 2>the mystery of panic attacks is more why</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just don't have the time really,</v>

400
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.423
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the people who haven't had good </v>

401
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:45.670
<v Speaker 2>reason for having them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those reasons are very much like the</v>

402
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:47.020
<v Speaker 2>reasons that we all have,</v>

403
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.353
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

404
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.140
<v Speaker 2>we're lucky is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think under most circumstances,</v>

405
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:54.643
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

406
00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.640
<v Speaker 2>We're protected by our implicit theories</v>
<v Speaker 2>of belief,</v>

407
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.900
<v Speaker 2>it systems of belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most of us,</v>

408
00:30:03.901 --> 00:30:04.734
<v Speaker 2>I suppose we're taught as children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a minor physical anomaly arises that </v>

409
00:30:10.321 --> 00:30:11.154
<v Speaker 2>the best course of action is to carry on</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least as a motive hypothesis testing </v>

410
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:23.130
<v Speaker 2>and that's affordable for lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>acquired adaptations.</v>

411
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.823
<v Speaker 1>Sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willing to consider explanations might </v>

412
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.993
<v Speaker 1>be what?</v>

413
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.963
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what sure,</v>

414
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.090
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the things you teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>in cognitive behavioral therapy,</v>

415
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.373
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is most of us are lucky </v>

416
00:30:37.491 --> 00:30:40.790
<v Speaker 2>you see with most people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotic,</v>

417
00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:44.020
<v Speaker 2>if you provide them with an alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation that day five,</v>

418
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.150
<v Speaker 2>it has no impact whatsoever on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptomatology.</v>

419
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.760
<v Speaker 2>So you take someone who has obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 2>compulsive disorder,</v>

420
00:30:49.761 --> 00:30:50.594
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>camp which is often manifested in fear </v>

421
00:30:53.091 --> 00:30:55.100
<v Speaker 2>of contamination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the line of logic.</v>

422
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.920
<v Speaker 2>There was a garbage can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>garbage cans are dirty,</v>

423
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.963
<v Speaker 2>dirt contains bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bacteria might kill me or worse my </v>

424
00:31:01.881 --> 00:31:02.714
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is an example going from a case </v>

425
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:06.440
<v Speaker 2>that I know were university educated </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

426
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with your intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly normal,</v>

427
00:31:08.991 --> 00:31:11.720
<v Speaker 2>unless she was encountered something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was contaminated.</v>

428
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:13.203
<v Speaker 2>You do response prevention treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that you have personally </v>

429
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.600
<v Speaker 2>encountered the thing that if you're the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most dependent,</v>

430
00:31:17.601 --> 00:31:19.940
<v Speaker 2>stopped him from doing their habitual </v>
<v Speaker 2>response passage,</v>

431
00:31:19.941 --> 00:31:22.940
<v Speaker 2>which for her was washing her hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>until they were so raw,</v>

432
00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:25.100
<v Speaker 2>they were shiny anyways.</v>

433
00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she thought that there was a possibility</v>

434
00:31:28.251 --> 00:31:30.170
<v Speaker 2>that if she encountered something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was contaminated,</v>

435
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.410
<v Speaker 2>which was a category that gotten broader</v>
<v Speaker 2>and broader as her disease progressed,</v>

436
00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.480
<v Speaker 2>did she carry home and disease to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>children?</v>

437
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

438
00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:37.813
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that line of reasoning </v>

439
00:31:38.361 --> 00:31:39.194
<v Speaker 2>is that it's possible and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say to her and she could </v>

440
00:31:41.811 --> 00:31:46.730
<v Speaker 2>understand that the probability of such </v>
<v Speaker 2>an event occurring was virtually zero,</v>

441
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:52.090
<v Speaker 2>but the fact of virtually zero was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently satisfying for that to calm</v>

442
00:31:53.241 --> 00:31:55.880
<v Speaker 2>her because point zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

443
00:31:55.881 --> 00:31:56.714
<v Speaker 2>zero one percent was too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you couldn't rationally reduce the </v>

444
00:32:01.431 --> 00:32:02.264
<v Speaker 2>probability to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a small enough degree so that her </v>

445
00:32:06.081 --> 00:32:08.510
<v Speaker 2>thought of that probability could </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulate your emotions.</v>

446
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:09.703
<v Speaker 2>And the only reason we don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those sorts of thoughts regulate our </v>

447
00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:13.154
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're willing to accept it on faith </v>

448
00:32:15.381 --> 00:32:17.120
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason you jumped in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

449
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.303
<v Speaker 2>Do all sorts of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous without any real </v>

450
00:32:21.621 --> 00:32:22.454
<v Speaker 2>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew another woman who was an </v>

451
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:28.940
<v Speaker 2>agoraphobic first thing she used to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>when she went into any new building when</v>

452
00:32:28.941 --> 00:32:31.370
<v Speaker 2>she didn't like doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's check out little fire escapes.</v>

453
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Why it might be a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

454
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.170
<v Speaker 2>There might be a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the profitability?</v>

455
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Lots of low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knew that.</v>

456
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.770
<v Speaker 2>She knew that the probability was low </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like the rest of us know,</v>

457
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 2>but the capacity of that information to </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibitor anxiety was gone.</v>

458
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:47.863
<v Speaker 2>The only thing you can do under those </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances is actually have people </v>

459
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.460
<v Speaker 2>act out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not caring.</v>

460
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.903
<v Speaker 3>Then then then that works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people argue that her </v>

461
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.133
<v Speaker 3>rationalization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that behavior is something that comes </v>

462
00:33:03.901 --> 00:33:04.734
<v Speaker 3>after her behavior in that something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that causes in other words is it isn't </v>

463
00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:12.150
<v Speaker 3>necessarily it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't it be one of two things?</v>

464
00:33:12.151 --> 00:33:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Either she she will interest the </v>
<v Speaker 3>building and things.</v>

465
00:33:14.611 --> 00:33:16.460
<v Speaker 3>My my dentist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there can be fire,</v>

466
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.303
<v Speaker 3>I have to check fire escapes or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>she walked into a building or anxiety </v>

467
00:33:20.311 --> 00:33:21.660
<v Speaker 3>rises and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to check.</v>

468
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:22.723
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

469
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.743
<v Speaker 2>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these explanations or post hoc </v>

470
00:33:26.331 --> 00:33:27.164
<v Speaker 2>rationalizations and it's hard to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not trying to specify a causal </v>

471
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:32.910
<v Speaker 2>sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens in Andrew Phobia I think is</v>

472
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.153
<v Speaker 2>the behavioral avoidance takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>precedence over the cognitive </v>

473
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.400
<v Speaker 2>rationalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are,</v>

474
00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:39.620
<v Speaker 2>but how does the agoraphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they go to the mall,</v>

475
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.050
<v Speaker 2>something frightening happens and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>run away.</v>

476
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.243
<v Speaker 2>Now it's the running away that </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes the point of origin for the </v>

477
00:33:46.011 --> 00:33:48.590
<v Speaker 2>pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they may say,</v>

478
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.513
<v Speaker 2>I ran away because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my set of cognitive </v>

479
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:53.623
<v Speaker 2>rationalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of which might be post hoc </v>

480
00:33:55.431 --> 00:33:56.264
<v Speaker 2>explanations for my behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is when you run from </v>

481
00:33:58.791 --> 00:33:59.624
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you are doing regardless of what </v>

482
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:02.564
<v Speaker 2>your thinking is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>labeling it as something so frightened </v>

483
00:34:05.031 --> 00:34:09.110
<v Speaker 2>that I have to run away from and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most profound level of labeling that</v>

484
00:34:09.111 --> 00:34:12.930
<v Speaker 2>you can actually utilize it much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>real than it will.</v>

485
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.813
<v Speaker 2>The secondary or even tertiary semantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>labeling that we usually associate with </v>

486
00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:18.674
<v Speaker 2>categorization to run from something </v>
<v Speaker 2>means to categorize it as too </v>

487
00:34:22.071 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 2>frightening to be to bear and also one </v>
<v Speaker 2>more thing.</v>

488
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.413
<v Speaker 2>It also means to categorize yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is even more important as </v>

489
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:31.154
<v Speaker 2>something that's so small that in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation the only thing that can be </v>

490
00:34:33.861 --> 00:34:37.130
<v Speaker 2>done is to run away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason that the exposure therapy</v>

491
00:34:37.131 --> 00:34:41.740
<v Speaker 2>works is probably mostly because it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It counters that latter argument,</v>

492
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:46.280
<v Speaker 2>which is that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you teach someone exposure,</v>

493
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 2>when you use exposure to help someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome their fears,</v>

494
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:53.510
<v Speaker 2>what you were doing is teaching them </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not so small.</v>

495
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.130
<v Speaker 2>That fear will devour them and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what causes the generalization.</v>

496
00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.360
<v Speaker 2>It's learning that.</v>

497
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.490
<v Speaker 3>So can you tell us a profound social </v>
<v Speaker 3>expectation in a situation?</v>

498
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely no.</v>

499
00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:07.403
<v Speaker 2>Or that the therapist uses social </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure and everything else to to </v>

500
00:35:10.681 --> 00:35:13.860
<v Speaker 2>foster the notion that the person can </v>
<v Speaker 2>withstand the exposure.</v>

501
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

502
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Can I just translate something benefit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I,</v>

503
00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.720
<v Speaker 3>that I seem to be hearing in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>from what you said today so far,</v>

504
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:21.951
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I May,</v>

505
00:35:21.951 --> 00:35:26.951
<v Speaker 3>it seems as if the thing that for Texas </v>
<v Speaker 3>from ethology,</v>

506
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:28.933
<v Speaker 3>the ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to attribute and multiple meanings to </v>

507
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:32.084
<v Speaker 3>something that the ability that our </v>
<v Speaker 3>prefrontal cortex gives us is the same </v>

508
00:35:35.181 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can cause a problem also,</v>

509
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.410
<v Speaker 2>you've got a conflict and absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

510
00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:47.670
<v Speaker 2>The thing about any religious myths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

511
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.533
<v Speaker 2>myths of the fall state fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the development of self </v>

512
00:35:52.221 --> 00:35:57.221
<v Speaker 2>consciousness which is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous expansion of cortical ability</v>

513
00:35:57.631 --> 00:36:02.631
<v Speaker 2>plus the ability to model the self as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>object precipitated that catastrophe and</v>

514
00:36:02.821 --> 00:36:06.750
<v Speaker 2>emotional catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the cure for the catastrophe is more</v>

515
00:36:06.751 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 2>of the same disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

516
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:13.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's the problem is that a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>self consciousness is terrible.</v>

517
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.210
<v Speaker 2>A lot however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might might be redemptive and that's the</v>

518
00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:19.044
<v Speaker 2>notion that underlies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that underlies all sorts of redemptive </v>

519
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:22.524
<v Speaker 2>mythologies and that's the notion that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying the argument that I'm trying </v>

520
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:29.451
<v Speaker 2>to elaborate up today because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know enough about yourself,</v>

521
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:35.100
<v Speaker 2>then the consequences of a of a narrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>self consciousness can be removed.</v>

522
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.031
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

523
00:36:36.031 --> 00:36:40.050
<v Speaker 2>what myths are trying to teach you as if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to teach you something,</v>

524
00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:40.890
<v Speaker 2>which they're really not.</v>

525
00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:41.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>

526
00:36:41.461 --> 00:36:44.430
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're trying to teach you is that</v>

527
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.220
<v Speaker 2>your normal conception of who you are is</v>
<v Speaker 2>much too narrow.</v>

528
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:51.563
<v Speaker 2>Now you know at some level you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true because you're modeling </v>

529
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:55.123
<v Speaker 2>yourselves wrong obviously because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're too complex for yourself </v>

530
00:36:59.080 --> 00:36:59.913
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like no one thinks that they have </v>

531
00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:03.414
<v Speaker 2>an accurate model of cosmological </v>
<v Speaker 2>processes and it's certainly arguable </v>

532
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:12.801
<v Speaker 2>that the processes that make up each of </v>
<v Speaker 2>us as individuals are complex at a level</v>

533
00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:14.904
<v Speaker 2>that's exponentially greater than any </v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmological process that we could </v>

534
00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:18.834
<v Speaker 2>possibly conceive of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the notion that your model of </v>

535
00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 2>yourself is inaccurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a statement of fact.</v>

536
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:26.363
<v Speaker 2>The part that's not so factual is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get valid information to </v>

537
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:30.414
<v Speaker 2>increase the breadth of that model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm basically trying to point out </v>

538
00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:36.660
<v Speaker 2>is that mid you can do that is with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amanda,</v>

539
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.513
<v Speaker 2>is a large part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is our accumulated attempt to construct </v>

540
00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:45.570
<v Speaker 2>a story that accounts for our behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

541
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.260
<v Speaker 2>We watch ourselves act and derive </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions.</v>

542
00:37:49.261 --> 00:37:54.261
<v Speaker 2>As a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your entire life is a lie and everything</v>

543
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:58.800
<v Speaker 2>bad that happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you recognize it,</v>

544
00:37:58.801 --> 00:37:59.634
<v Speaker 2>it's bad and you're miserable</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside cause I never resigned with </v>

545
00:38:04.381 --> 00:38:06.140
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

546
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.073
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's intrinsically rewarding about </v>

547
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:09.804
<v Speaker 2>lying to yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know that you're making yourself </v>

548
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:12.024
<v Speaker 2>miserable because look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any defined terror is better than any </v>

549
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:21.330
<v Speaker 2>undefined terror because it defined </v>
<v Speaker 2>terror has a boundary and an undefined.</v>

550
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Tara has none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the law.</v>

551
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:23.994
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been some reliable studies of </v>

552
00:38:26.581 --> 00:38:27.414
<v Speaker 2>late that indicate that gay men who </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage in high risk behavior for aids </v>

553
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 2>are less anxious after being diagnosed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with aids than they were before</v>

554
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 2>because the possibility the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>is worse than the actuality.</v>

555
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.590
<v Speaker 2>No matter how bad the actuality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility is worse.</v>

556
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:50.630
<v Speaker 3>So what about if your product because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>pride and not fear,</v>

557
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.150
<v Speaker 3>like if</v>

558
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.983
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those that that's always the </v>

559
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:54.820
<v Speaker 2>case as far as I've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine.</v>

560
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.963
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I said you can't say this is </v>

561
00:38:57.401 --> 00:39:00.640
<v Speaker 2>just one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things conglomorate together,</v>

562
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:01.743
<v Speaker 2>but people that I've dealt with who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>severely neurotic enough so that their </v>

563
00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:09.820
<v Speaker 2>whole life was a lie and literally it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was pride as well that was stopping them</v>

564
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 2>from letting go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't say,</v>

565
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.430
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand?</v>

566
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.373
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he treated one patient who had an </v>

567
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 2>obsessional neurosis that lasted 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

568
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:21.303
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot reconcile myself to the fact </v>

569
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.633
<v Speaker 2>that I wasted two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think of what that admission </v>

570
00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:32.300
<v Speaker 2>requires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

571
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.900
<v Speaker 2>you have a finite time and if you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>blown,</v>

572
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.120
<v Speaker 2>not only have you blown out a big chunk </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

573
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.920
<v Speaker 2>but in the course of blowing it out you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've added to the cumulative misery of</v>

574
00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:43.080
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

575
00:39:43.081 --> 00:39:43.914
<v Speaker 2>lots of people who are non physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physiologically unhealthy use their </v>

576
00:39:49.601 --> 00:39:53.770
<v Speaker 2>neurotic misery to manipulate others </v>
<v Speaker 2>around them to their own ends,</v>

577
00:39:53.771 --> 00:39:57.220
<v Speaker 2>to make people feel guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get them to do what they want because</v>

578
00:39:57.221 --> 00:39:58.750
<v Speaker 2>they don't think they can just come </v>
<v Speaker 2>right out and say,</v>

579
00:39:58.751 --> 00:39:59.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you please do this?</v>

580
00:39:59.921 --> 00:40:04.180
<v Speaker 2>They have to manifest some sign of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness so that they force other people</v>

581
00:40:04.181 --> 00:40:05.014
<v Speaker 2>to take care of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that has to come up and be </v>

582
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 2>admitted before you can step away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>this situation.</v>

583
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:11.503
<v Speaker 3>What was Satan afraid of eternity like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you had nothing more to lose everything </v>

584
00:40:16.171 --> 00:40:17.460
<v Speaker 3>to gain because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

585
00:40:17.461 --> 00:40:20.130
<v Speaker 3>Groups and gets gotten sucked back into </v>
<v Speaker 3>heaven.</v>

586
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Like where did pride become fear for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Satan in paradise lost.</v>

587
00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I can't answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

588
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know enough to answer that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question specifically.</v>

589
00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I can,</v>

590
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:33.383
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I can say about that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these processes feedback onto one </v>

591
00:40:36.541 --> 00:40:36.820
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

592
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

593
00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:41.720
<v Speaker 2>the more low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

594
00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.180
<v Speaker 2>let me go through this argument to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree and maybe it'll.</v>

595
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'll shed a little bit of light </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that question.</v>

596
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.823
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

597
00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:49.913
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the consequence of injection of </v>

598
00:40:52.021 --> 00:40:56.070
<v Speaker 2>air?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While we know that before you can engage</v>

599
00:40:56.071 --> 00:40:56.904
<v Speaker 2>in any sort of creative exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to at least admit that </v>

600
00:40:58.651 --> 00:41:00.900
<v Speaker 2>something went wrong and so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

601
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.960
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with my and let </v>
<v Speaker 2>some level of analysis.</v>

602
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.033
<v Speaker 2>That's the admission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the next process is to engage in </v>

603
00:41:07.261 --> 00:41:08.094
<v Speaker 2>some sort of creative exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically the generation of </v>

604
00:41:10.291 --> 00:41:14.790
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis and they're testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find out you made someone upset,</v>

605
00:41:14.791 --> 00:41:15.830
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accidentally,</v>

606
00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.730
<v Speaker 2>well then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

607
00:41:17.731 --> 00:41:18.564
<v Speaker 2>maybe this was wrong with my approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we talked to them first about </v>

608
00:41:20.731 --> 00:41:21.930
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if that was right in.</v>

609
00:41:21.931 --> 00:41:23.300
<v Speaker 2>If that wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it out.</v>

610
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:24.143
<v Speaker 2>Hypothesis to side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick up another one and act it out and </v>

611
00:41:26.521 --> 00:41:30.210
<v Speaker 2>see if you get the information you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on and so forth to get the answer and</v>

612
00:41:30.211 --> 00:41:32.220
<v Speaker 2>let's create an exploration.</v>

613
00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:32.721
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

614
00:41:32.721 --> 00:41:35.180
<v Speaker 2>what happens as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative exploration?</v>

615
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

616
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:43.120
<v Speaker 2>remember we talked about symbols of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos that existed prior to the creation</v>

617
00:41:44.931 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

618
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.353
<v Speaker 2>That chaos was symbolized by the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a general rule is composed of the </v>

619
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:55.190
<v Speaker 2>union of all things that are now often </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the source of all things,</v>

620
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.530
<v Speaker 2>not just objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but subjects as well.</v>

621
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's everything that we see as </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinct,</v>

622
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:04.010
<v Speaker 2>melded into some paradoxical unity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that stands for the unknown.</v>

623
00:42:04.011 --> 00:42:06.140
<v Speaker 2>As such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Piaget said,</v>

624
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:07.963
<v Speaker 2>when children that children construct </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as a consequence of their </v>

625
00:42:11.751 --> 00:42:12.584
<v Speaker 2>creative exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically means that the child </v>

626
00:42:15.531 --> 00:42:19.040
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know anything about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very bounded domain of knowledge.</v>

627
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 2>What it does is encountered the vast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known explore,</v>

628
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:25.363
<v Speaker 2>generate information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now that information constructs </v>

629
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:29.023
<v Speaker 2>itself as a subject which means grants </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself a self and also the world as an </v>

630
00:42:33.841 --> 00:42:34.820
<v Speaker 2>objective reality.</v>

631
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.180
<v Speaker 2>So that's what the notion that chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>also contains.</v>

632
00:42:38.181 --> 00:42:39.014
<v Speaker 2>The subject means that as you gathering </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you build yourself out of the </v>

633
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:46.340
<v Speaker 2>information you generated in the process</v>
<v Speaker 2>of exploration,</v>

634
00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.300
<v Speaker 2>have you stopped exploring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although that has obvious conclusions,</v>

635
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.640
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means you start building yourself.</v>

636
00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:54.083
<v Speaker 2>We already know that a system that stops</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing because everything around the </v>

637
00:42:58.281 --> 00:43:01.220
<v Speaker 2>system changes of its own accord decays </v>
<v Speaker 2>over time,</v>

638
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.233
<v Speaker 2>and we know what the decay means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's life comes to a standstill and the </v>

639
00:43:06.201 --> 00:43:08.990
<v Speaker 2>negative forces that are underneath </v>
<v Speaker 2>order rise up.</v>

640
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.660
<v Speaker 2>So that story basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reject anomaly.</v>

641
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Personality stops developing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're in the kingdom that's coming</v>

642
00:43:17.481 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 2>to a standstill where everything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>paralyzed.</v>

643
00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 2>There's no water and everything's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

644
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:22.904
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that the mere fact of</v>
<v Speaker 2>not progressing means that you go </v>

645
00:43:27.711 --> 00:43:32.000
<v Speaker 2>backwards and your life becomes well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>those debt,</v>

646
00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.130
<v Speaker 2>a desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing grows in the desert.</v>

647
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Everything's unbearable there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you say if you reject the possibility</v>

648
00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:40.364
<v Speaker 2>of growth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what necessarily occurs is that all </v>

649
00:43:43.731 --> 00:43:47.210
<v Speaker 2>that's left for you is a life that gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse and worse and worse,</v>

650
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.140
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

651
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your life goes from bad to worse,</v>

652
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:56.141
<v Speaker 2>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know already.</v>

653
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.210
<v Speaker 2>This is just addresses the comment you </v>
<v Speaker 2>made last week.</v>

654
00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.750
<v Speaker 2>You punish an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make me.</v>

655
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.150
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of making meaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

656
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:06.403
<v Speaker 2>If you construct your relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world such that over time the </v>

657
00:44:11.031 --> 00:44:13.850
<v Speaker 2>likelihood is that everything will go </v>
<v Speaker 2>from bad to worse.</v>

658
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.800
<v Speaker 2>The other consequences of that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your attitude towards you existing Cisco</v>

659
00:44:17.801 --> 00:44:20.310
<v Speaker 2>and go from bad to worse as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

660
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:21.203
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do people are people consumed with </v>

661
00:44:23.001 --> 00:44:23.834
<v Speaker 2>hatred and a desire for revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has played out completely milk </v>

662
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.473
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

663
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Once Satan determines that admission of </v>
<v Speaker 2>error is completely out of the question,</v>

664
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.270
<v Speaker 2>he turns his attention to taking revenge</v>
<v Speaker 2>on existence.</v>

665
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.093
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to trying to provide an </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation for why that's a necessary </v>

666
00:44:46.661 --> 00:44:47.494
<v Speaker 2>consequence of this because if you stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you eliminate a priority and </v>

667
00:44:53.171 --> 00:44:54.004
<v Speaker 2>necessity for further deny yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of positive change and </v>

668
00:44:57.201 --> 00:44:58.034
<v Speaker 2>adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the necessary consequence of that is </v>

669
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.120
<v Speaker 2>increased personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffered,</v>

670
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:06.780
<v Speaker 2>and that it's a very likely given that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're narrowing your personality,</v>

671
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.660
<v Speaker 2>which means you get weaker and weaker is</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

672
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:10.523
<v Speaker 2>very likely under those circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to become more and </v>

673
00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:14.334
<v Speaker 2>more full of revenge because life's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfair after all and hatred because </v>

674
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:21.120
<v Speaker 2>you're always being tortured even though</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it to yourself.</v>

675
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.333
<v Speaker 2>We the rationalization is why do all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these terrible things constantly happen </v>

676
00:45:26.981 --> 00:45:27.814
<v Speaker 2>to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must either be that everyone's </v>

677
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.990
<v Speaker 2>against me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a perfectly common hypothesis,</v>

678
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:39.000
<v Speaker 2>or the conditions of existence itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so unbearable that everything should</v>

679
00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:41.760
<v Speaker 2>be eradicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which as we talked about last week,</v>

680
00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:42.594
<v Speaker 2>is the essential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the essential Credo </v>

681
00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Mephistopheles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

682
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:46.643
<v Speaker 2>The world is so intrinsically so </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbearable that the only proper course </v>

683
00:45:50.851 --> 00:45:52.590
<v Speaker 2>of action is to work for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So elimination.</v>

684
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 2>How last week I tried to tie that into </v>
<v Speaker 2>stalins reasoning.</v>

685
00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

686
00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.633
<v Speaker 2>that's what it looks to me like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the philosophy that </v>

687
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.490
<v Speaker 2>characterizes step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's against me,</v>

688
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.310
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a real paranoid</v>

689
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.673
<v Speaker 2>and he worked throughout his life to </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually develop his capacity to </v>

690
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.640
<v Speaker 2>destroy larger and larger swaths of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

691
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's much difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

692
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:35.490
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like this is not always the case</v>

693
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.640
<v Speaker 2>because suicide is motivated by all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of different reasons,</v>

694
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.073
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly the case and I said I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think this is particularly true about </v>

695
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.440
<v Speaker 2>adolescent suicide is that it's an act </v>
<v Speaker 2>of revenge because.</v>

696
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:47.663
<v Speaker 2>Well it and it also is an illustration </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how deep the motivation for revenge </v>

697
00:46:51.001 --> 00:46:51.834
<v Speaker 2>can be because adolescents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicidal fantasies are often go along </v>

698
00:46:55.321 --> 00:46:59.040
<v Speaker 2>the lines of old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those people be sorry when I'm gone,</v>

699
00:46:59.041 --> 00:46:59.874
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a whole fantasy about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how the funeral rule progress in all </v>

700
00:47:01.951 --> 00:47:02.784
<v Speaker 2>these people who paid in sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention or being otherwise cruel will </v>

701
00:47:05.731 --> 00:47:07.910
<v Speaker 2>file by and think about all the terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>things they did.</v>

702
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:09.023
<v Speaker 2>So on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while the truth of the truth of the </v>

703
00:47:11.221 --> 00:47:12.054
<v Speaker 2>matter is that a suicide leaves a hole </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a community that can be reconciled </v>

704
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:16.973
<v Speaker 2>because the people who are leftover are </v>
<v Speaker 2>always faced with the question of why </v>

705
00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:20.670
<v Speaker 2>did this happen?</v>

706
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.560
<v Speaker 2>And also what could I have done about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

707
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:24.720
<v Speaker 2>both of which are essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>unanswerable.</v>

708
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.243
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question that you're posing to some </v>

709
00:47:29.141 --> 00:47:29.974
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one murder worse than a million </v>

710
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:32.673
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that they don't some in </v>

711
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:36.694
<v Speaker 2>a sense just as just as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>society is predicated on the idea that </v>

712
00:47:42.101 --> 00:47:45.850
<v Speaker 2>every individual is of incalculable </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth when you can't.</v>

713
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.283
<v Speaker 2>One thing of incalculable worth is worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as 20 things of incalculable </v>

714
00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.840
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not.</v>

715
00:47:52.841 --> 00:47:54.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not an additive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phenomenal.</v>

716
00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you were saying sort of thing.</v>

717
00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:02.150
<v Speaker 2>The vengeful aspect motivates both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Newman Newman conceptualized suicide</v>

718
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:06.400
<v Speaker 2>is he felt that was the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining.</v>

719
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Explination was regressive wish for </v>
<v Speaker 2>incest with the great mother,</v>

720
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:15.900
<v Speaker 2>which is a very awkward way of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if only I was gone,</v>

721
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.890
<v Speaker 2>if only I banished back to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I had come from.</v>

722
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:21.993
<v Speaker 2>Then all of these problems that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>faced with would just disappear and </v>

723
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:30.560
<v Speaker 2>that's also something that's character </v>
<v Speaker 2>and newman imagined that to census,</v>

724
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.340
<v Speaker 2>an attractive force pulling someone down</v>
<v Speaker 2>below the earth,</v>

725
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.920
<v Speaker 2>so that's just a desire for death as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a solution to the problems of life.</v>

726
00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.560
<v Speaker 2>You can also say these things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

727
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can also say that you thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the collective unconscious produced</v>

728
00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:50.524
<v Speaker 2>conference Satori fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically meant that if your </v>

729
00:48:52.751 --> 00:48:54.160
<v Speaker 2>conscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

730
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.420
<v Speaker 2>which was in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your linguistically constructed itself,</v>

731
00:48:58.690 --> 00:48:59.523
<v Speaker 2>was failing to take certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities into account than the </v>

732
00:49:02.651 --> 00:49:03.484
<v Speaker 2>collective unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you might think about as </v>

733
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:07.780
<v Speaker 2>manifesting itself in fantasies that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>really can't control.</v>

734
00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.720
<v Speaker 2>It just pop up like fantasies of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example.</v>

735
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:12.423
<v Speaker 2>Often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although they may have a pathological </v>

736
00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.453
<v Speaker 2>aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also hold out at least in </v>

737
00:49:16.991 --> 00:49:19.780
<v Speaker 2>possibility the seeds of a cure because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

738
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:21.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were here</v>

739
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:28.280
<v Speaker 2>and you're convinced that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbearable,</v>

740
00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:29.683
<v Speaker 2>the notion that a death is necessary is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a first order attempt to hypothesize </v>

741
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:37.743
<v Speaker 2>that the thing that constrains your </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of meaning should </v>

742
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.073
<v Speaker 2>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is to say that the fact that your </v>

743
00:49:45.141 --> 00:49:50.141
<v Speaker 2>life has become so twisted that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard it as unbearable is evidence that</v>

744
00:49:50.961 --> 00:49:54.020
<v Speaker 2>your motive interpretation is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>outdated that it should die.</v>

745
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfectly reasonable answer.</v>

746
00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Sacrificial Motif for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I read the other day,</v>

747
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the idea of sacrificing of fingers,</v>

748
00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:06.320
<v Speaker 2>very common throughout our camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology.</v>

749
00:50:06.321 --> 00:50:10.640
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that my finger is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's very important.</v>

750
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:14.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the same idea as a sacrifice of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>virgin sacrifice of heroes.</v>

751
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:19.220
<v Speaker 2>That if things are unbearable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you either have to kill what's making it</v>

752
00:50:19.221 --> 00:50:21.860
<v Speaker 2>unbearable so that something new can </v>
<v Speaker 2>come into being.</v>

753
00:50:21.861 --> 00:50:24.020
<v Speaker 2>That's one mode of the sacrificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>hometeam,</v>

754
00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:25.183
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing is is another thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that underlies the sacrificial is the </v>

755
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:30.560
<v Speaker 2>idea of the exposure of the hero to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces of the unknown.</v>

756
00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.160
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another segment</v>

757
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.720
<v Speaker 3>on that diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just one.</v>

758
00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:41.470
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

759
00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:45.420
<v Speaker 3>basically we about suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like returning to the source of,</v>

760
00:50:45.421 --> 00:50:47.350
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn into the world,</v>

761
00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:48.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that,</v>

762
00:50:48.461 --> 00:50:52.430
<v Speaker 2>that unconscious chaos that precedes </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence has a paradise aspect,</v>

763
00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.283
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's no tension of opposites </v>

764
00:50:54.401 --> 00:50:55.234
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically means there's just no </v>

765
00:50:56.321 --> 00:50:57.154
<v Speaker 2>being at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but which could be a relief knew under </v>

766
00:51:00.461 --> 00:51:01.470
<v Speaker 2>certain conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

767
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.410
<v Speaker 3>is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying within that framework,</v>

768
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.333
<v Speaker 3>is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you say that's heading into chaos </v>

769
00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.930
<v Speaker 3>or is that going back a long time?</v>

770
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.041
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>

771
00:51:13.041 --> 00:51:16.850
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you move from border,</v>

772
00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:19.610
<v Speaker 2>like where's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the source of all things?</v>

773
00:51:19.611 --> 00:51:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Where's the break?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we put the great mother?</v>

774
00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

775
00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.340
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

776
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:29.450
<v Speaker 2>This is anomalous information here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>

777
00:51:29.451 --> 00:51:31.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos is not known as such.</v>

778
00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:35.630
<v Speaker 2>He never encountered that because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>always encounter things that are more or</v>

779
00:51:35.631 --> 00:51:36.464
<v Speaker 2>less within a determinant framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never see what you don't understand </v>

780
00:51:39.971 --> 00:51:40.804
<v Speaker 2>and its entirety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe that occurs to people who are </v>

781
00:51:42.561 --> 00:51:43.394
<v Speaker 2>having some sort of mystical experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly what you see are things that you </v>

782
00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:51.950
<v Speaker 2>can somewhat define that pop up in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>day to day experience.</v>

783
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:52.933
<v Speaker 2>Those are actual anomalous pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that you have some </v>

784
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:58.070
<v Speaker 2>definitional handle on what the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother would be.</v>

785
00:51:58.071 --> 00:52:03.071
<v Speaker 2>The story</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can think of,</v>

786
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:04.244
<v Speaker 2>the great mother as the agent of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a perfectly reasonable the way </v>

787
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.410
<v Speaker 2>look at it because in the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>progression,</v>

788
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:12.050
<v Speaker 2>she's the first offs right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

789
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:13.173
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The original chaos separates into the </v>

790
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.860
<v Speaker 2>great mother in the grateful on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

791
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:20.900
<v Speaker 2>so she is the first child of chaos.</v>

792
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Subset essentially of class.</v>

793
00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.593
<v Speaker 2>She's the form of the form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That chaos takes in your actual </v>

794
00:52:28.121 --> 00:52:28.954
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wouldn't it be more effort in that </v>

795
00:52:31.391 --> 00:52:32.224
<v Speaker 2>diagram to say the chaos there is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great mother because what do you </v>

796
00:52:36.161 --> 00:52:38.430
<v Speaker 2>start going back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

797
00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:39.323
<v Speaker 2>you have talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the entire diagram comes </v>

798
00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:44.400
<v Speaker 2>from because that's the world split into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's conduct.</v>

799
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:45.263
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many figures of the great mother have a </v>

800
00:52:48.101 --> 00:52:49.900
<v Speaker 2>snake wrapped around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

801
00:52:49.901 --> 00:52:50.734
<v Speaker 2>that's because the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The association between the Dragon of </v>

802
00:52:53.171 --> 00:52:55.270
<v Speaker 2>chaos in the great mother is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very close.</v>

803
00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:58.510
<v Speaker 2>So to say this is the great mother is </v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

804
00:52:58.511 --> 00:53:01.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the origin of the great father</v>

805
00:53:01.481 --> 00:53:02.314
<v Speaker 2>and also the origin of the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the mythological figures are </v>

806
00:53:06.221 --> 00:53:09.250
<v Speaker 2>contaminated by each other because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're north tight category,</v>

807
00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:12.130
<v Speaker 2>so lots of like the Gorgon is another </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

808
00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Great mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her hair is snakes,</v>

809
00:53:14.711 --> 00:53:18.250
<v Speaker 2>which is representative of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you look at her,</v>

810
00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.640
<v Speaker 2>you turned to stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means be terrified.</v>

811
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.540
<v Speaker 2>So she's an agent of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But chaos is more like that.</v>

812
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.693
<v Speaker 2>That first order category is more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the kind of normally that you </v>

813
00:53:30.691 --> 00:53:33.660
<v Speaker 2>encountered during your day to day life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the source of everything.</v>

814
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's outside the whole process.</v>

815
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just saying,</v>

816
00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:45.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know that this symbol is mesh </v>
<v Speaker 2>together on that level,</v>

817
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:45.924
<v Speaker 2>but if we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're bringing them into a more </v>

818
00:53:47.341 --> 00:53:48.730
<v Speaker 2>systematic framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

819
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Then to to kill yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will eliminate the self entirely.</v>

820
00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:59.940
<v Speaker 2>It would essentially be to send yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>into if you're nothing,</v>

821
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.680
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where everything came.</v>

822
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

823
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So which is somewhat different from what</v>

824
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:05.994
<v Speaker 2>you encounter if that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that is the diagram of the way we </v>

825
00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:10.230
<v Speaker 2>encountered life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then</v>

826
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.773
<v Speaker 2>I would say that the things that make </v>
<v Speaker 2>you desire a return to nothingness are </v>

827
00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:18.624
<v Speaker 2>the the actual anomalous phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatening for the women that you've </v>

828
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:24.090
<v Speaker 2>encountered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the sum total of all of them.</v>

829
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:25.373
<v Speaker 2>So it's repeated appearances of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intolerable information produced within </v>

830
00:54:30.311 --> 00:54:32.820
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The desire to advantage basically.</v>

831
00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.780
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

832
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:38.670
<v Speaker 2>the fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fingers are contaminated.</v>

833
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:40.980
<v Speaker 2>That's why time at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

834
00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:43.440
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Mesopotamian myth,</v>

835
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:44.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean absolute.</v>

836
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.570
<v Speaker 2>He's known in the Mesopotamian myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

837
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.640
<v Speaker 2>The concert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets very little press and that story</v>

838
00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:54.900
<v Speaker 2>is not for lions devoted to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gods killing your stupid me,</v>

839
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.680
<v Speaker 2>and of course the anti map rises up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

840
00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Because he's the thing that protected </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

841
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.373
<v Speaker 2>but that's all that's known about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hammerhead timeout is female and the </v>

842
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:09.660
<v Speaker 2>wife of absent and the mother of Marta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's also the serpent,</v>

843
00:55:09.661 --> 00:55:11.130
<v Speaker 2>the mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the ocean.</v>

844
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:13.590
<v Speaker 2>That's the mother of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the source of everything.</v>

845
00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:17.710
<v Speaker 2>So there you can see the overlap between</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mythological domain.</v>

846
00:55:17.711 --> 00:55:18.960
<v Speaker 2>She's female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's also.</v>

847
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.790
<v Speaker 2>She lives at the bottom of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

848
00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:24.963
<v Speaker 2>derive is a notion of what suicide was </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the fantasies for people who </v>

849
00:55:28.441 --> 00:55:29.274
<v Speaker 2>may come down to commit suicide or did </v>
<v Speaker 2>he just follow a train of reasoning to </v>

850
00:55:33.541 --> 00:55:34.374
<v Speaker 2>decide that suicide was designed for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I don't know the </v>

851
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:41.460
<v Speaker 2>details of the conclusion he came to.</v>

852
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:42.383
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't practicing therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible he got so excited about </v>

853
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:49.830
<v Speaker 2>the system that he was pulling together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

854
00:55:49.831 --> 00:55:51.640
<v Speaker 2>That's always possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

855
00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:53.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more a story.</v>

856
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.100
<v Speaker 2>It's more a way of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

857
00:55:56.101 --> 00:55:56.934
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not unreasonable to suppose that </v>

858
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:01.643
<v Speaker 2>people who commit suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wish for the cessation of their </v>

859
00:56:03.631 --> 00:56:07.740
<v Speaker 2>experience been since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what suicide producers as well as</v>

860
00:56:07.741 --> 00:56:08.574
<v Speaker 2>a lot of general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of misery on the part of people </v>

861
00:56:10.141 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 2>left behind one of the like there's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalytic,</v>

862
00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:16.610
<v Speaker 2>this is a human Erickson actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

863
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.300
<v Speaker 2>If you can't tell what motivates that </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

864
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:22.410
<v Speaker 2>look at the effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The effects are the are motivated.</v>

865
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.000
<v Speaker 2>How you can say that's a pretty extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

866
00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:26.313
<v Speaker 2>It is an extreme position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'll tell you if your partner of </v>

867
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:29.223
<v Speaker 2>your own life that produces very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting consequences at least as a </v>

868
00:56:31.331 --> 00:56:31.840
<v Speaker 2>heuristic.</v>

869
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Like you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

870
00:56:33.311 --> 00:56:34.990
<v Speaker 2>that's not always true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

871
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:36.213
<v Speaker 2>It's not always true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you do something and it has a </v>

872
00:56:39.311 --> 00:56:40.990
<v Speaker 2>certain effect and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

873
00:56:40.991 --> 00:56:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I didn't intend that effect and you ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>why did I do that?</v>

874
00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:49.240
<v Speaker 2>A first order hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hypothesis is I did intend that,</v>

875
00:56:49.241 --> 00:56:50.074
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you follow that line of </v>

876
00:56:52.331 --> 00:56:53.220
<v Speaker 2>reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>

877
00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:57.670
<v Speaker 2>well it can have some have very salutary</v>
<v Speaker 2>effects,</v>

878
00:56:57.671 --> 00:56:58.504
<v Speaker 2>especially if the thing that you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>intend has happened like two or three </v>

879
00:57:01.271 --> 00:57:02.104
<v Speaker 2>times because then it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some indication that of </v>

880
00:57:04.691 --> 00:57:06.400
<v Speaker 2>complicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only one occurrence.</v>

881
00:57:06.401 --> 00:57:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

882
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:09.310
<v Speaker 2>mistakes happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it keeps happening to you.</v>

883
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:13.900
<v Speaker 2>Lucky I think the other state was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's pointing a gun at you,</v>

884
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:14.734
<v Speaker 2>it's likely that it wants to shoot the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same sort of idea and that was in </v>

885
00:57:17.711 --> 00:57:18.990
<v Speaker 2>reference to the Cold War.</v>

886
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Why were people conspiring to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons,</v>

887
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:22.924
<v Speaker 2>to destroy the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While the simple maybe too simple </v>

888
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:28.870
<v Speaker 2>explanation is on some level that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the intent,</v>

889
00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:32.440
<v Speaker 2>but I buy that argument was certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>appeared to be 10th.</v>

890
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was practicing it all the time.</v>

891
00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Now the question is how much was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The intent of the West?</v>

892
00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not an answerable yet,</v>

893
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.433
<v Speaker 2>but I would suspect to a large degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that apply to other people's </v>

894
00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.530
<v Speaker 2>behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

895
00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.230
<v Speaker 2>it's dangerous to apply it to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's behavior,</v>

896
00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:54.160
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't the principal that I rely on as</v>

897
00:57:54.161 --> 00:57:58.120
<v Speaker 2>an absolute explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a useful hypothesis.</v>

898
00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Especially like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing keeps happening.</v>

899
00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.550
<v Speaker 2>See you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth.</v>

900
00:58:03.551 --> 00:58:04.450
<v Speaker 2>You made the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

901
00:58:04.451 --> 00:58:08.830
<v Speaker 2>neurotic people will find themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped in in misery that they recognize</v>

902
00:58:08.831 --> 00:58:11.530
<v Speaker 2>clearly is misery without stepping </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of it,</v>

903
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:12.703
<v Speaker 2>and I would say well that that fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicates that they prefer the misery </v>

904
00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:22.020
<v Speaker 2>they have to the possibilities and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to.</v>

905
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:23.303
<v Speaker 2>It's the only way to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the only way to explain </v>

906
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:26.944
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's one way of accounting for the </v>

907
00:58:28.601 --> 00:58:29.434
<v Speaker 2>fact of resistance in psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the underground where the point is made </v>

908
00:58:35.071 --> 00:58:38.110
<v Speaker 2>that separate is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets attention.</v>

909
00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:39.520
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

910
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.353
<v Speaker 2>that's the secondary gain hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it's an effective manipulative </v>

911
00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:49.500
<v Speaker 2>strategy has all sorts of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing a side effects.</v>

912
00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:52.144
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why it occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rejection of anomalies is very </v>

913
00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:57.580
<v Speaker 2>negatively reinforcing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why it's while</v>

914
00:58:57.581 --> 00:58:58.414
<v Speaker 2>it has this attracted aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you don't attend to all those </v>

915
00:59:03.161 --> 00:59:05.080
<v Speaker 2>things that indicate that you're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>error,</v>

916
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean to the degree that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful and no one attending to them,</v>

917
00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.420
<v Speaker 2>you're not anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not depressed,</v>

918
00:59:10.421 --> 00:59:12.250
<v Speaker 2>you're not confused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

919
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:13.533
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is all that information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't process first of all </v>

920
00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:18.333
<v Speaker 2>isn't transformed by you into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>usable and second bull as far as I've </v>

921
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:22.880
<v Speaker 2>been able to tell.</v>

922
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.713
<v Speaker 2>It accumulates over time and then what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to you is that in a year are </v>

923
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:30.980
<v Speaker 2>getting smaller and smaller just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way things work.</v>

924
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Basically if you stagnate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get sicker and sicker and the things</v>

925
00:59:35.931 --> 00:59:36.764
<v Speaker 2>that you yourself have labeled as </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatening because when you refuse to </v>

926
00:59:40.251 --> 00:59:41.084
<v Speaker 2>process something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying or what you're doing </v>

927
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:47.780
<v Speaker 2>is that thing is terrible for me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contemplate.</v>

928
00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:53.130
<v Speaker 2>So what you're doing is transforming </v>
<v Speaker 2>chunks of the world into the category of</v>

929
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:56.203
<v Speaker 2>those things that are too terrifying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to conflict or you're leaving them </v>

930
00:59:58.911 --> 00:59:59.744
<v Speaker 2>in that category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a more accurate way of looking </v>

931
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:05.780
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sooner or later you're this high and the</v>

932
01:00:05.781 --> 01:00:09.350
<v Speaker 2>world that you've transformed into </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat is everywhere around you and it's</v>

933
01:00:09.351 --> 01:00:10.184
<v Speaker 2>only a matter of time until you're weak </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough so that the whole thing falls in </v>

934
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 2>on you.</v>

935
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.143
<v Speaker 3>Is there a difference between ignoring </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and just interpreting it in such a </v>

936
01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:18.014
<v Speaker 3>way like the positive bias but don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know where nothing was ever your fault </v>

937
01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:23.300
<v Speaker 3>and like you're the martyr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like anything bad that happens to you is</v>

938
01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:25.070
<v Speaker 3>because there's some evil force out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that we're.</v>

939
01:00:25.071 --> 01:00:25.904
<v Speaker 3>You're kind of taking it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only putting such a spin on it that </v>

940
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.860
<v Speaker 3>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's this unknown thing.</v>

941
01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:31.694
<v Speaker 3>I'm making it known,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but labeling it wrong on purpose that </v>

942
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:35.100
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

943
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a.</v>

944
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:40.170
<v Speaker 2>that's just a variant of the same theme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it accumulates well,</v>

945
01:00:40.171 --> 01:00:42.810
<v Speaker 2>but I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

946
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:45.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a feedback mechanism.</v>

947
01:00:45.121 --> 01:00:46.970
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a feedback mechanism at work,</v>

948
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:52.460
<v Speaker 2>so you get smaller and smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You a new mislabeled the problem or.</v>

949
01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.453
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I think really what you're </v>

950
01:00:54.091 --> 01:00:54.924
<v Speaker 2>doing is that you're not pulling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>label off it because we already know </v>

951
01:00:57.511 --> 01:01:00.450
<v Speaker 2>that anomalous information manifests </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself is threat.</v>

952
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:01.583
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how your right frontal cortex </v>

953
01:01:03.151 --> 01:01:03.984
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically mistake comes up in the form </v>

954
01:01:06.571 --> 01:01:09.900
<v Speaker 2>of threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it's indicated on them,</v>

955
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.793
<v Speaker 2>so it's already labeled as threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your job when you explore is to </v>

956
01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:19.370
<v Speaker 2>transform the threat into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant or something beneficial north</v>

957
01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.270
<v Speaker 2>to merely label it as something </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

958
01:01:21.271 --> 01:01:22.104
<v Speaker 2>but to actually change it by altering </v>
<v Speaker 2>your behavior into something that's </v>

959
01:01:24.631 --> 01:01:26.940
<v Speaker 2>usable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't do that well,</v>

960
01:01:26.941 --> 01:01:31.941
<v Speaker 2>then what's happening is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>determinant world transforms itself back</v>

961
01:01:32.551 --> 01:01:37.551
<v Speaker 2>into terrifying chaos and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>failing to stop that from happening.</v>

962
01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:41.220
<v Speaker 2>It'll do that all by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by labeling it an evil force,</v>

963
01:01:41.221 --> 01:01:42.054
<v Speaker 2>you've made an effort to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>forest and everybody making it even </v>

964
01:01:45.491 --> 01:01:46.200
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

965
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.300
<v Speaker 2>That's certainly at least worse for </v>
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>

966
01:01:48.301 --> 01:01:49.330
<v Speaker 2>and I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

967
01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:51.960
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

968
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:52.831
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

969
01:01:52.831 --> 01:01:53.664
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's more motivation to that </v>

970
01:01:55.890 --> 01:02:00.480
<v Speaker 2>because as you're weakening yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hatred for life grows,</v>

971
01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.433
<v Speaker 2>your desire for revenge accelerates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then if you could take the next step </v>

972
01:02:04.441 --> 01:02:05.251
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

973
01:02:05.251 --> 01:02:07.680
<v Speaker 2>not only is this anomalous information </v>
<v Speaker 2>intolerable,</v>

974
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:09.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I can kill it.</v>

975
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:10.463
<v Speaker 2>Well then you've got everything set </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can remove the source of </v>

976
01:02:12.451 --> 01:02:13.284
<v Speaker 2>your trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can act out your hostile fantasies </v>

977
01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:19.680
<v Speaker 2>and you can feel justified because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're patriotic or which is all</v>

978
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.013
<v Speaker 2>rubbish.</v>

979
01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:23.111
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

980
01:02:23.111 --> 01:02:23.561
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

981
01:02:23.561 --> 01:02:24.394
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about stuff and the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>is so terrible that it must be </v>

982
01:02:27.551 --> 01:02:28.384
<v Speaker 3>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible to distinguish that from </v>

983
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:33.970
<v Speaker 3>like the world is so terribly fascism of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be destroyed,</v>

984
01:02:33.971 --> 01:02:34.570
<v Speaker 3>are?</v>

985
01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:35.403
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

986
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

987
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:39.530
<v Speaker 2>That's distinguishable because one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hallmarks of the hero,</v>

988
01:02:39.531 --> 01:02:40.364
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that the night I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was at pains to outline in the latter </v>

989
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:46.590
<v Speaker 2>part of the manuscript is the hero has </v>
<v Speaker 2>two functions.</v>

990
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.650
<v Speaker 2>One is to transfer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transform,</v>

991
01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:50.693
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory into explored </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory which is just Marta battle </v>

992
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.983
<v Speaker 2>against time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to update the social structure </v>

993
01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 2>which has both manifested internally and</v>
<v Speaker 2>externally as that becomes necessary,</v>

994
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:05.363
<v Speaker 2>so the pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we know the problem with updating a </v>

995
01:03:08.101 --> 01:03:13.101
<v Speaker 2>social structure is that sometimes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes on a revolutionary aspect and then</v>

996
01:03:13.471 --> 01:03:14.304
<v Speaker 2>for all the adherence of that social </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure who were either going and </v>

997
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:17.833
<v Speaker 2>forest revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that heroic activity is going to seem </v>

998
01:03:19.951 --> 01:03:20.784
<v Speaker 2>like a demonic demonic force and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>why people are so irritated inheritance </v>

999
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.600
<v Speaker 2>because they pop up the normalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>information and for good reason.</v>

1000
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:28.463
<v Speaker 2>I mean careless hermeticism is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous because it produces </v>

1001
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:34.320
<v Speaker 2>schismatic activity and break societies </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1002
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.633
<v Speaker 2>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a genetic mutation that's the </v>

1003
01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:39.960
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best metaphor.</v>

1004
01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:44.961
<v Speaker 2>I know it's like a 999 revolutions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive,</v>

1005
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:48.470
<v Speaker 2>but the one revolution in the thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars isn't counterproductive,</v>

1006
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.313
<v Speaker 2>is absolutely necessary and the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>is how do you distinguish between the </v>

1007
01:03:52.861 --> 01:03:53.880
<v Speaker 2>two?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1008
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.073
<v Speaker 2>if you just use the odds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you'd say is all </v>

1009
01:03:57.841 --> 01:04:02.100
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary shouldn't be regarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The skepticism like extreme skepticism,</v>

1010
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:03.323
<v Speaker 2>but not skepticism to the point where a </v>
<v Speaker 2>priority they should be eliminated </v>

1011
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:08.150
<v Speaker 2>because one of them just quite the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1012
01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:09.270
<v Speaker 2>it just might be the hero.</v>

1013
01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:15.300
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1014
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:18.993
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still trying to translate what </v>

1015
01:04:22.031 --> 01:04:22.864
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about into sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>parallel framework and what I was just </v>

1016
01:04:27.191 --> 01:04:31.060
<v Speaker 3>thinking of is there might be two ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>to change the social system.</v>

1017
01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.540
<v Speaker 3>One by coming back as a caring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>advocating.</v>

1018
01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:35.973
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way things should be telling people </v>

1019
01:04:37.031 --> 01:04:38.990
<v Speaker 3>what beliefs you're placing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have.</v>

1020
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:42.070
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is to come back changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1021
01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1022
01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Then with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1023
01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then your relationships with other </v>

1024
01:04:44.671 --> 01:04:46.160
<v Speaker 2>people change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

1025
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:48.810
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the sort of the sort of path that</v>

1026
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:50.060
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1027
01:04:50.061 --> 01:04:54.000
<v Speaker 2>that I want to outline in more detail </v>
<v Speaker 2>next week because one,</v>

1028
01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:54.903
<v Speaker 2>I think one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one piece of evidence that should </v>

1029
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:58.703
<v Speaker 2>justify skepticism is the overt desire </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the revolutionary to maintain their </v>

1030
01:05:03.511 --> 01:05:04.344
<v Speaker 2>position at all cost and to transport </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone around them because then you </v>

1031
01:05:07.961 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that revolution or is that,</v>

1032
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.450
<v Speaker 2>is that fascism masquerading as </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelation?</v>

1033
01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Which it almost always is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like a communist ideologue,</v>

1034
01:05:15.601 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 2>he wants to transform a capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

1035
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Isn't the revolutionary just he's just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascist on the left wing.</v>

1036
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:23.733
<v Speaker 2>There's no heroism map,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess I suppose the other thing </v>

1037
01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:31.180
<v Speaker 2>that one might be skeptical of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionaries in groups because that's</v>

1038
01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.860
<v Speaker 2>sort of a contradiction in terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1039
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.600
<v Speaker 2>So not always for either of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's still a sign I would say,</v>

1040
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.750
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the notion of coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>back change,</v>

1041
01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:44.584
<v Speaker 2>that's the issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what these myths are trying to </v>

1042
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:52.621
<v Speaker 2>point out is that the only permanently </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective form of social revolution is a</v>

1043
01:05:54.281 --> 01:05:55.114
<v Speaker 2>personal revolution and then just acts </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself out where that social change is </v>

1044
01:05:59.471 --> 01:06:01.990
<v Speaker 2>just a necessary consequence of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal change.</v>

1045
01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:06.310
<v Speaker 2>It isn't something that's being enforced</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even planned out to a degree.</v>

1046
01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:10.430
<v Speaker 2>It's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me know.</v>

1047
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 2>That strikes me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

1048
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:15.310
<v Speaker 2>that what strikes me as a justifiable </v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

1049
01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.413
<v Speaker 2>at least then you're also much less </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to make catastrophic errors </v>

1050
01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:23.680
<v Speaker 2>because your primary concern is always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing wrong?</v>

1051
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Or here's the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I contributing to it?</v>

1052
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1053
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.270
<v Speaker 2>where are all the bad people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are really causing more trouble,</v>

1054
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:36.000
<v Speaker 2>so I mean I knew lots of this is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sarcastic comment I guess,</v>

1055
01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:37.103
<v Speaker 2>and I knew lots of environmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>activists in graduate school who may be </v>

1056
01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.500
<v Speaker 2>filthy apartments.</v>

1057
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.983
<v Speaker 2>It's like they couldn't even keep their </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal territory clean and yet they </v>

1058
01:06:45.461 --> 01:06:49.090
<v Speaker 2>were willing to engage in activities </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in terms of their own fantasies,</v>

1059
01:06:49.091 --> 01:06:52.690
<v Speaker 2>had the potential impact of </v>
<v Speaker 2>restructuring society.</v>

1060
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Practice what you preach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1061
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.700
<v Speaker 2>at least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1062
01:06:57.701 --> 01:07:01.750
<v Speaker 2>At least at least act it out so that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can see on your own territory,</v>

1063
01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:03.330
<v Speaker 2>one if it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and two,</v>

1064
01:07:03.331 --> 01:07:07.930
<v Speaker 2>if you can actually even acted out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is,</v>

1065
01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.840
<v Speaker 2>while you know there's a lot nip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny mythological statements,</v>

1066
01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:13.780
<v Speaker 2>like the man who rules himself is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

1067
01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.480
<v Speaker 2>has a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the quote precisely.</v>

1068
01:07:16.481 --> 01:07:17.314
<v Speaker 2>The man who rose himself has performed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>more difficult task than the man who </v>

1069
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:20.374
<v Speaker 2>wrote the city.</v>

1070
01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:26.530
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to rule a city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what it means is it is actually.</v>

1071
01:07:26.531 --> 01:07:30.490
<v Speaker 2>The truth is you're much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated phenomenon than a city.</v>

1072
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 2>And to bring yourself under some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>control is much more difficult than.</v>

1073
01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.453
<v Speaker 2>It's more difficult than bringing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>given social structure under control </v>

1074
01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:43.410
<v Speaker 2>because the social structure assemble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harrison plus,</v>

1075
01:07:43.411 --> 01:07:44.244
<v Speaker 2>it's also equivalent to bringing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>social structure and control because </v>

1076
01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:52.600
<v Speaker 2>what you're composed of in large part is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sum total of social structures.</v>

1077
01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Now they as they be generated over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck stretches of time,</v>

1078
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:57.160
<v Speaker 2>so inside you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1079
01:07:57.161 --> 01:07:59.410
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to reconcile the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abortion debate,</v>

1080
01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:01.840
<v Speaker 2>that's an internal reconciliation as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1081
01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.620
<v Speaker 2>You have to rethink the philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions</v>

1082
01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.133
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently deep enough so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to a solution that brings the two </v>

1083
01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:13.030
<v Speaker 2>sides together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can hold,</v>

1084
01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:15.060
<v Speaker 2>take place inside before it takes place </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

1085
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Go past it</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some level.</v>

1086
01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.210
<v Speaker 2>The most powerful social movements bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two things together.</v>

1087
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:23.443
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not drinking in the early days of </v>

1088
01:08:27.911 --> 01:08:28.744
<v Speaker 2>solidarity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the things that really </v>

1089
01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:33.460
<v Speaker 2>impressed me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the way it translated to,</v>

1090
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:34.463
<v Speaker 2>of personal transformation or the way in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the civil rights movement evolved </v>

1091
01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:43.000
<v Speaker 2>in this country requiring a personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>

1092
01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:46.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was through it in a collective way</v>

1093
01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.410
<v Speaker 2>created social change or in the women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

1094
01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

1095
01:08:51.971 --> 01:08:55.150
<v Speaker 2>it seems like in these genuine social </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements,</v>

1096
01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.150
<v Speaker 2>change occurs both in the macro and </v>
<v Speaker 2>micro level.</v>

1097
01:08:58.151 --> 01:09:01.390
<v Speaker 2>They're brought in consonance with one </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

1098
01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.201
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1099
01:09:02.201 --> 01:09:03.034
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that strikes me at least as a plausible </v>

1100
01:09:04.331 --> 01:09:06.130
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1101
01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

1102
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:08.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Orwell,</v>

1103
01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:10.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1104
01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.640
<v Speaker 2>he started out as a socialist </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologically,</v>

1105
01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:14.230
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1106
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:15.303
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that transformed him </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a mere idea log into a writer of </v>

1107
01:09:18.311 --> 01:09:21.610
<v Speaker 2>note and a political commentator of note</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that he decided,</v>

1108
01:09:21.611 --> 01:09:24.220
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he noted that in his experience,</v>

1109
01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:27.940
<v Speaker 2>most academic socialists weren't all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fond of the poor.</v>

1110
01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:30.910
<v Speaker 2>This was particularly true in Britain </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there a higher class structure,</v>

1111
01:09:30.911 --> 01:09:31.744
<v Speaker 2>so they were from the upper classes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>acted out there detests than the lower </v>

1112
01:09:35.711 --> 01:09:36.544
<v Speaker 2>classes in all their action patterns </v>
<v Speaker 2>while holding the ideological belief </v>

1113
01:09:39.611 --> 01:09:42.130
<v Speaker 2>that the poor were in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morally superior.</v>

1114
01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orwell did was,</v>

1115
01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.450
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went to Paris and London and lived in</v>

1116
01:09:46.451 --> 01:09:51.451
<v Speaker 2>Paris among dishwashers and in in Great </v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain among traps and coal miners,</v>

1117
01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.430
<v Speaker 2>forcing himself to overcome what he soon</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognized was a very deep set prejudice</v>

1118
01:09:57.431 --> 01:10:01.070
<v Speaker 2>against everything that the poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented well.</v>

1119
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.943
<v Speaker 2>Then what happened to her well was he </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped his socialism very rapidly </v>

1120
01:10:04.271 --> 01:10:05.104
<v Speaker 2>because he found that the ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure was nowhere near profound </v>

1121
01:10:08.891 --> 01:10:11.020
<v Speaker 2>enough to encompass what he'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced.</v>

1122
01:10:11.021 --> 01:10:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Plus it had enormously dangerous side </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects,</v>

1123
01:10:14.561 --> 01:10:17.800
<v Speaker 2>which he increasingly came to recognize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe,</v>

1124
01:10:17.801 --> 01:10:18.634
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's because one of the things </v>

1125
01:10:20.561 --> 01:10:21.394
<v Speaker 2>that everyone would like to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like how do you distinguish a </v>

1126
01:10:24.731 --> 01:10:27.490
<v Speaker 2>pathological revolution from a valid </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution?</v>

1127
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:32.830
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I would say if you're asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else to bear more of the costs,</v>

1128
01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:35.660
<v Speaker 2>then you're actually bearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that's one sign that it's.</v>

1129
01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.960
<v Speaker 2>That there's some sort of pathology at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of it,</v>

1130
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.633
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that seems like a reasonable first </v>

1131
01:10:41.561 --> 01:10:46.561
<v Speaker 2>approximation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess you also have to see like who</v>

1132
01:10:46.661 --> 01:10:47.494
<v Speaker 2>gets what out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The communist revolution as far as I've </v>

1133
01:10:51.301 --> 01:10:52.134
<v Speaker 2>been able to determine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just replaced one tyrannical group that </v>

1134
01:10:56.381 --> 01:10:57.214
<v Speaker 2>at least we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're bound by tradition with another </v>

1135
01:11:00.101 --> 01:11:04.370
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical group that were completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbound by tradition and,</v>

1136
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:08.410
<v Speaker 2>and even more tyrannical</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the problem was,</v>

1137
01:11:08.411 --> 01:11:11.680
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only reason</v>

1138
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:14.203
<v Speaker 2>the Russian revolutionaries were more </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral than the tsar was because they </v>

1139
01:11:16.801 --> 01:11:19.860
<v Speaker 2>didn't have any power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't do anything.</v>

1140
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:22.460
<v Speaker 2>So when they look to themselves more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm harmless.</v>

1141
01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've put anybody in prison.</v>

1142
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Of course they don't have a prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when they got prisons they certainly</v>

1143
01:11:29.221 --> 01:11:30.280
<v Speaker 2>put lots of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hang on.</v>

1144
01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>what other comments,</v>

1145
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.693
<v Speaker 2>Daniel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1146
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:39.763
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1147
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:43.651
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1148
01:11:43.651 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 2>So we basically got to this point in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument now,</v>

1149
01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.080
<v Speaker 2>which you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1150
01:11:52.081 --> 01:11:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm just outlining this argument so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't forget where I am.</v>

1151
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Basically it goes like this over here.</v>

1152
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:02.343
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is how to get out of </v>

1153
01:12:05.551 --> 01:12:09.730
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1154
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:12.270
<v Speaker 2>if we're willing to take nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if notion seriously,</v>

1155
01:12:12.271 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 2>which is that everyone has sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason to lie.</v>

1156
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that as a premise,</v>

1157
01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:24.660
<v Speaker 2>the conclusion is perhaps to a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>larger degree than we believe.</v>

1158
01:12:24.661 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 2>We're lying to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1159
01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:28.710
<v Speaker 2>one of the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shelley Taylor,</v>

1160
01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:29.544
<v Speaker 2>she's the social psychologist who's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting this positive self delusion </v>

1161
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:35.880
<v Speaker 2>notion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the valuable things she's done,</v>

1162
01:12:35.881 --> 01:12:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I think was although I don't think she </v>
<v Speaker 2>drew the right conclusion from it,</v>

1163
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.193
<v Speaker 2>was that she noted that many people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>we regard as normal and healthy in fact </v>

1164
01:12:46.801 --> 01:12:49.920
<v Speaker 2>erect around themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barriers of positive illusions.</v>

1165
01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Now she drew from that the conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to be normal and healthy,</v>

1166
01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:58.920
<v Speaker 2>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the normal people were healthy,</v>

1167
01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.260
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a real problem with that,</v>

1168
01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.240
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you can see.</v>

1169
01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.073
<v Speaker 2>You can see how that necessarily emerges</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of psychological </v>

1170
01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:07.344
<v Speaker 2>methodology in a sense because okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made the argument to begin within the </v>

1171
01:13:12.361 --> 01:13:15.750
<v Speaker 2>class that as soon as you apply a field </v>
<v Speaker 2>like psychology or medicine,</v>

1172
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:17.183
<v Speaker 2>you're out of the domain of science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the domain of morality because you </v>

1173
01:13:19.501 --> 01:13:23.850
<v Speaker 2>have to make judgments about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes the good if you have to now,</v>

1174
01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:27.000
<v Speaker 2>but people who are in the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science don't like to admit that,</v>

1175
01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:27.834
<v Speaker 2>so they try to figure out ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine what's moral scientifically </v>

1176
01:13:30.391 --> 01:13:31.920
<v Speaker 2>without ever having to address the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1177
01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.720
<v Speaker 2>And the easiest way to do that is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1178
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:35.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the normal distribution,</v>

1179
01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:39.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The optimal level is the midpoint.</v>

1180
01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:43.320
<v Speaker 2>So you take the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see how many positive sell solutions</v>

1181
01:13:43.321 --> 01:13:45.390
<v Speaker 2>they have around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say those average people,</v>

1182
01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.580
<v Speaker 2>they're normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That defines healthy.</v>

1183
01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Therefore positive self lesions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary,</v>

1184
01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:54.030
<v Speaker 2>but this is like this is a real problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>

1185
01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.300
<v Speaker 2>many things that are average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't consider ideal.</v>

1186
01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why the two words exist in</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition.</v>

1187
01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:03.300
<v Speaker 2>It was like we know strive for average </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence or average athletic ability</v>

1188
01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:06.090
<v Speaker 2>or average beauty or average </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment at any level.</v>

1189
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:09.270
<v Speaker 2>We're always moving towards some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal anyway,</v>

1190
01:14:09.271 --> 01:14:13.450
<v Speaker 2>so I think shelley Taylor got caught and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped in a sense she got caught in her</v>

1191
01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.890
<v Speaker 2>own unconscious presuppositions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1192
01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal people have to be healthy.</v>

1193
01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:19.654
<v Speaker 2>By definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal people have lost a part of the </v>

1194
01:14:21.221 --> 01:14:22.360
<v Speaker 2>self illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>

1195
01:14:22.361 --> 01:14:26.740
<v Speaker 2>positive self lesions are necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of flaws in that argument.</v>

1196
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.193
<v Speaker 2>I buy the argument that many people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are considered normal by normal </v>

1197
01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:37.150
<v Speaker 2>standards erect barriers of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive illusions around themselves,</v>

1198
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.253
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they do that as no </v>
<v Speaker 2>indication whatsoever that is necessary </v>

1199
01:14:41.621 --> 01:14:42.454
<v Speaker 2>or desirable because the argument that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to outline this whole </v>

1200
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:46.234
<v Speaker 2>course is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the degree that the members of the </v>

1201
01:14:49.511 --> 01:14:50.344
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the degree that a member or members </v>

1202
01:14:52.541 --> 01:14:53.374
<v Speaker 2>of a society erect positive self </v>
<v Speaker 2>illusions around themselves to protect </v>

1203
01:14:57.161 --> 01:15:00.400
<v Speaker 2>their normality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will make their group pathological.</v>

1204
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:01.743
<v Speaker 2>Pathological it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more likely it is to do something </v>

1205
01:15:04.241 --> 01:15:05.230
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other groups,</v>

1206
01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.030
<v Speaker 2>the sickness is going to come out </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

1207
01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:12.813
<v Speaker 2>Our target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our timescale analysis in psychology is </v>

1208
01:15:14.871 --> 01:15:17.300
<v Speaker 2>something really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't ever question.</v>

1209
01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:18.453
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1210
01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:22.760
<v Speaker 2>a given phenomenon can have a beneficial</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect at</v>

1211
01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.100
<v Speaker 2>at the level of analysis of a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a detrimental effect.</v>

1212
01:15:28.101 --> 01:15:30.380
<v Speaker 2>If you look at its effect over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>course of a day,</v>

1213
01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:31.613
<v Speaker 2>I'm mildly beneficial effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it over the course of a </v>

1214
01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:35.810
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know tremendously detrimental effect</v>

1215
01:15:35.811 --> 01:15:36.644
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it over the course of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year in the same thing can have all </v>

1216
01:15:39.381 --> 01:15:40.214
<v Speaker 2>sorts of different effects depending on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your parameters of evaluation and </v>

1217
01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:46.550
<v Speaker 2>generally psychologists pick one </v>
<v Speaker 2>parameter evaluation and say,</v>

1218
01:15:46.551 --> 01:15:47.384
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's representative of the whole </v>

1219
01:15:48.291 --> 01:15:52.190
<v Speaker 2>temporal framework and that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a justifiable conclusion.</v>

1220
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.373
<v Speaker 2>Say people who are high in self </v>
<v Speaker 2>deception may appear more psychological </v>

1221
01:15:58.311 --> 01:16:00.650
<v Speaker 2>help psychologically healthy in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>short term.</v>

1222
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:05.360
<v Speaker 2>If you define psychological health as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the absence of anxiety and depression in</v>

1223
01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:06.194
<v Speaker 2>the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know anything about what </v>

1224
01:16:07.881 --> 01:16:09.650
<v Speaker 2>that means for their interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

1225
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:11.600
<v Speaker 2>You don't know anything about what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

1226
01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:12.493
<v Speaker 2>You don't know anything about what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means for the course of their lifespan </v>

1227
01:16:14.981 --> 01:16:15.814
<v Speaker 2>or for the children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea what it means for the </v>

1228
01:16:17.541 --> 01:16:20.000
<v Speaker 2>relationships with the group or between </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>

1229
01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.073
<v Speaker 2>so until you answer all those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you have to be pretty careful </v>

1230
01:16:23.091 --> 01:16:23.924
<v Speaker 2>about saying about making it as radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>acclaim as self deception is necessary </v>

1231
01:16:29.301 --> 01:16:30.134
<v Speaker 2>for psychological.</v>

1232
01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Can we ask what types of self deception?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1233
01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.750
<v Speaker 3>shelley tailoring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jonathan Brown.</v>

1234
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:43.583
<v Speaker 3>My understanding is that these are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>types of things that come from making </v>

1235
01:16:47.261 --> 01:16:49.680
<v Speaker 3>down comparisons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm.</v>

1236
01:16:50.130 --> 01:16:51.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm better than average.</v>

1237
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:54.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

1238
01:16:54.141 --> 01:16:55.490
<v Speaker 2>she says those are innocuous,</v>

1239
01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:56.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1240
01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:59.350
<v Speaker 3>That's my understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when asked,</v>

1241
01:16:59.351 --> 01:17:00.161
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you,</v>

1242
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:02.560
<v Speaker 3>ask people to read their ability on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>multitude of trades.</v>

1243
01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.450
<v Speaker 3>If everybody in this room rated </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

1244
01:17:04.451 --> 01:17:05.284
<v Speaker 3>we'd all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole group as a whole would be </v>

1245
01:17:06.701 --> 01:17:08.910
<v Speaker 3>above average,</v>
<v Speaker 3>above average.</v>

1246
01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:11.000
<v Speaker 3>This is a positive illegitimate.</v>

1247
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Thanks Garrison in Wisconsin where every</v>
<v Speaker 2>child is above average,</v>

1248
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:15.913
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1249
01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.550
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we can't.</v>

1250
01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.300
<v Speaker 3>We can't by definition I'll be above </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1251
01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.410
<v Speaker 3>So that sort of definition of positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>illusions,</v>

1252
01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.253
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it sort of a leap to go from </v>
<v Speaker 3>that type of positive allusion to self </v>

1253
01:17:29.581 --> 01:17:34.581
<v Speaker 3>deception that could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the content of which has to do with your</v>

1254
01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:35.874
<v Speaker 3>relationships with other people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truths about the world and in all kinds </v>

1255
01:17:38.341 --> 01:17:39.340
<v Speaker 3>of other things being where's.</v>

1256
01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:41.733
<v Speaker 2>Well it isn't relief because called in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rewalk has just finished a study on </v>

1257
01:17:44.531 --> 01:17:47.710
<v Speaker 2>people who are high in self deception </v>
<v Speaker 2>and found that over the course of a five</v>

1258
01:17:47.711 --> 01:17:48.544
<v Speaker 2>year period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those very people were in fact rated by </v>

1259
01:17:51.521 --> 01:17:52.354
<v Speaker 2>their peers as much more dislikable </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended more psychological troubles than </v>

1260
01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:56.270
<v Speaker 2>people who are lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1261
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:57.343
<v Speaker 3>self deception the same as his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people who were thinking that they </v>

1262
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.440
<v Speaker 3>above average or are these the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>

1263
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:05.623
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it self deception question sort of self </v>

1264
01:18:08.961 --> 01:18:11.030
<v Speaker 3>perception would be the denial of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1265
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:12.750
<v Speaker 3>Positive illusion would be,</v>

1266
01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:13.733
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't.</v>

1267
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:16.980
<v Speaker 2>That hasn't been completely sorted out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what if you told this person?</v>

1268
01:18:16.981 --> 01:18:18.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is you are at</v>

1269
01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:22.230
<v Speaker 3>and they accepted it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

1270
01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:23.970
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that they're looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly different.</v>

1271
01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:25.093
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said in the literature as as a </v>

1272
01:18:26.631 --> 01:18:27.464
<v Speaker 2>whole that hasn't been sorted out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even like where we're using one of the </v>

1273
01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.540
<v Speaker 2>inventories of self deception in our lab</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1274
01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:35.810
<v Speaker 2>the trend is sort some of this element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got different.</v>

1275
01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.010
<v Speaker 2>It's one scale with different factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sub categories,</v>

1276
01:18:40.011 --> 01:18:40.844
<v Speaker 2>one of which is self enhancement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be more like I'm more than </v>

1277
01:18:43.221 --> 01:18:45.200
<v Speaker 2>average and the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two others,</v>

1278
01:18:45.201 --> 01:18:48.800
<v Speaker 2>one of which has to do with the denial </v>
<v Speaker 2>of negative information and maybe one of</v>

1279
01:18:48.801 --> 01:18:49.940
<v Speaker 2>those is more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical,</v>

1280
01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.460
<v Speaker 2>and maybe one isn't pathological level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I wouldn't bet on,</v>

1281
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:55.063
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just really the difference because </v>

1282
01:18:57.021 --> 01:18:57.854
<v Speaker 2>if you say that I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you suggest that if you believe that </v>

1283
01:19:00.141 --> 01:19:00.974
<v Speaker 2>you are better than you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that means you're not going to </v>

1284
01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:05.690
<v Speaker 2>believe you need to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we did with this,</v>

1285
01:19:05.691 --> 01:19:06.524
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done an experiment with this </v>

1286
01:19:07.851 --> 01:19:09.310
<v Speaker 2>questionnaire and we found that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are.</v>

1287
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:12.800
<v Speaker 2>He gives these people standard tests of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological health.</v>

1288
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't tell because they might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be lying because they lie after all,</v>

1289
01:19:16.570 --> 01:19:19.670
<v Speaker 2>neurotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say they're not</v>

1290
01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:23.210
<v Speaker 2>neurotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what we did was we took,</v>

1291
01:19:23.211 --> 01:19:24.044
<v Speaker 2>we took people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we looked at your tendency to self </v>

1292
01:19:25.431 --> 01:19:28.190
<v Speaker 2>enhanced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we divided them into high sulfur and low</v>

1293
01:19:28.191 --> 01:19:29.024
<v Speaker 2>sulfur enhances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we gave them 20 photographs to </v>

1294
01:19:31.011 --> 01:19:31.844
<v Speaker 2>rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We use the neo five factor personality </v>

1295
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:37.490
<v Speaker 2>more to see how they would rate other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who were just.</v>

1296
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:38.623
<v Speaker 2>We took a census cross section of race </v>
<v Speaker 2>and niche and then we call and we used </v>

1297
01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:44.084
<v Speaker 2>five new adjectives per picture and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapsed them all together to kind of </v>

1298
01:19:46.971 --> 01:19:47.804
<v Speaker 2>get their average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their average personality influential </v>

1299
01:19:51.561 --> 01:19:52.394
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is imagine you force all those </v>

1300
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:57.470
<v Speaker 2>pictures together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a competent individual,</v>

1301
01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.570
<v Speaker 2>plus you get a composite personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>score.</v>

1302
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.823
<v Speaker 2>People high in self enhancement regard </v>
<v Speaker 2>others as more negative because we put </v>

1303
01:20:06.321 --> 01:20:07.154
<v Speaker 2>all the negative adjectives in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>category and all the pauses and another </v>

1304
01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 2>has more negative than they regard </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1305
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:14.430
<v Speaker 2>so I would say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no difference.</v>

1306
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.343
<v Speaker 2>The mechanism from the positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>illusions is making downward </v>

1307
01:20:19.471 --> 01:20:21.630
<v Speaker 2>comparisons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what these people did,</v>

1308
01:20:21.970 --> 01:20:23.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1309
01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:24.173
<v Speaker 2>call it phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who do that are rated by </v>

1310
01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:29.770
<v Speaker 2>their peers as less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1311
01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.713
<v Speaker 2>less socially as worse than people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't over the long term short term </v>

1312
01:20:36.001 --> 01:20:38.170
<v Speaker 2>advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's neuroticism.</v>

1313
01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:40.440
<v Speaker 2>That's short term advantage because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where people do it.</v>

1314
01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 2>People also tend to make a comparison to</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they have their sights set,</v>

1315
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:45.183
<v Speaker 2>well this is something that Aaron is </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to work this out because she </v>

1316
01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:48.084
<v Speaker 2>thinks that some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these inventories of self deception are </v>

1317
01:20:52.051 --> 01:20:55.140
<v Speaker 2>contaminated with optimism and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's right.</v>

1318
01:20:55.141 --> 01:20:55.974
<v Speaker 2>Is that optimistic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who think I can make the future </v>

1319
01:20:59.401 --> 01:21:02.940
<v Speaker 2>brighter than probability says it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to be,</v>

1320
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:03.953
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>stance and is dependent on your ability </v>

1321
01:21:06.331 --> 01:21:07.164
<v Speaker 2>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She thinks those people get lumped </v>

1322
01:21:08.521 --> 01:21:09.354
<v Speaker 2>together with the self deceivers proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if they took as their reference </v>

1323
01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:18.510
<v Speaker 2>group one level of accomplishment that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think I can do better for myself.</v>

1324
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:19.531
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1325
01:21:19.531 --> 01:21:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Well a lot of this has to be pulled </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart compared to their peers.</v>

1326
01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1327
01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not all that easy to pull out a</v>

1328
01:21:27.031 --> 01:21:29.880
<v Speaker 2>positive belief in the future and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities from.</v>

1329
01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I've already got that positive future </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1330
01:21:32.791 --> 01:21:35.430
<v Speaker 2>even though all the evidence suggests </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the contrary is true,</v>

1331
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:39.750
<v Speaker 2>so that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fantasy about how good things might be</v>

1332
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:43.920
<v Speaker 2>is not necessarily pathological unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you presume that things are already that</v>

1333
01:21:43.921 --> 01:21:44.731
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1334
01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:45.564
<v Speaker 2>you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He needed a fantasy like that to keep </v>

1335
01:21:47.371 --> 01:21:48.990
<v Speaker 2>you going ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1336
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.010
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1337
01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's another example.</v>

1338
01:21:58.891 --> 01:21:59.724
<v Speaker 2>We ran an experiment because we're very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in this particular line of </v>

1339
01:22:02.971 --> 01:22:03.804
<v Speaker 2>research because it contradicts </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that I'm trying to say in </v>

1340
01:22:05.131 --> 01:22:05.964
<v Speaker 2>this course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that personally irritates me as well </v>

1341
01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:10.674
<v Speaker 2>as I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1342
01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:13.470
<v Speaker 2>for all sorts of other reasons.</v>

1343
01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:14.573
<v Speaker 2>I just can't believe that shelly </v>
<v Speaker 2>Taylor's writing like 5,000 years of </v>

1344
01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:20.610
<v Speaker 2>religious traditions gathered from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world are wrong.</v>

1345
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Just strikes me as highly unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1346
01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:29.850
<v Speaker 2>test that has been used to discriminate </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopaths from non psychopathic.</v>

1347
01:22:29.851 --> 01:22:32.850
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So think about psychopaths is that while</v>

1348
01:22:32.851 --> 01:22:35.070
<v Speaker 2>they're not very pleasant to be around </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the term,</v>

1349
01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.170
<v Speaker 2>although superficially they can be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>charming.</v>

1350
01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make a study of how to be charming.</v>

1351
01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:41.063
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do group therapy with second </v>

1352
01:22:42.841 --> 01:22:45.240
<v Speaker 2>perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very bad idea,</v>

1353
01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:46.613
<v Speaker 2>they become more effective psychopaths </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they pick up the whole </v>

1354
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:50.183
<v Speaker 2>psychological vocabulary and an array of</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional techniques that they would </v>

1355
01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:55.800
<v Speaker 2>never otherwise have access to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1356
01:22:55.950 --> 01:23:00.510
<v Speaker 2>they're not very anxious and depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also dangerous,</v>

1357
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:01.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a test that has been used to </v>

1358
01:23:02.701 --> 01:23:04.700
<v Speaker 2>distinguish psychopaths from non second </v>
<v Speaker 2>pass.</v>

1359
01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:07.370
<v Speaker 2>It's called the Newman card playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>task.</v>

1360
01:23:08.290 --> 01:23:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Daniel computerized it up for use in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this study.</v>

1361
01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:17.450
<v Speaker 2>It consists of an extinction paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of you are going to take this.</v>

1362
01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 2>You might</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean</v>

1363
01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:27.520
<v Speaker 2>well knowing it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't take it.</v>

1364
01:23:27.521 --> 01:23:28.354
<v Speaker 2>If you listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably shouldn't take it anyways </v>

1365
01:23:29.831 --> 01:23:30.664
<v Speaker 2>because he'd been in this course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'll kind of know what the hell's </v>

1366
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.270
<v Speaker 2>going on possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you wouldn't be a good subject.</v>

1367
01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So stay out of my anyways.</v>

1368
01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:41.013
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1369
01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:42.483
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have 100 cards and they're </v>

1370
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:45.423
<v Speaker 2>stacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The deck is staff and in the first deck </v>

1371
01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:49.563
<v Speaker 2>there's 10 cards and their face cards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you turn around and face you </v>

1372
01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:54.770
<v Speaker 2>get a quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start with someone,</v>

1373
01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:56.033
<v Speaker 2>get a quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then in the next deck of 10 the </v>

1374
01:23:58.151 --> 01:23:58.984
<v Speaker 2>subject doesn't know this one out of 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the cars makes you lose randomly and </v>

1375
01:24:03.491 --> 01:24:06.040
<v Speaker 2>in the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two of the 10 make you news.</v>

1376
01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:07.023
<v Speaker 2>Then three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

1377
01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:07.873
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

1378
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:09.190
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

1379
01:24:09.191 --> 01:24:10.840
<v Speaker 2>All the way until the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a 10 out of 10.</v>

1380
01:24:10.841 --> 01:24:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Make loose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose.</v>

1381
01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Now the your instructions are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever ring again?</v>

1382
01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an extinction paradigm.</v>

1383
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:16.663
<v Speaker 2>So you mean the first time you went you </v>
<v Speaker 2>went in for the first 50 percent of the </v>

1384
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.740
<v Speaker 2>right because you went 10 times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you went nine.</v>

1385
01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Then you have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cards,</v>

1386
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:27.003
<v Speaker 2>either winners or losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now all you have to do is segway to </v>

1387
01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:29.464
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the object is to maximize your </v>

1388
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:32.110
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

1389
01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.393
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high self deceivers make half as much </v>

1390
01:24:35.051 --> 01:24:38.830
<v Speaker 2>money as low self to seniors because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know when to quit and I think</v>

1391
01:24:38.831 --> 01:24:40.420
<v Speaker 2>the reason they don't know when to quit </v>
<v Speaker 2>is because</v>

1392
01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.110
<v Speaker 2>losing is indication of error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's labeled with negative apnic.</v>

1393
01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:49.420
<v Speaker 2>That's what stops you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have essentially ignore all signs</v>

1394
01:24:49.421 --> 01:24:50.254
<v Speaker 2>of there.</v>

1395
01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Well you're not gonna stop doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something stupid as fast as you should.</v>

1396
01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:57.040
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make half as much money's low,</v>

1397
01:24:57.041 --> 01:24:59.760
<v Speaker 2>self deceived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wait,</v>

1398
01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

1399
01:25:01.090 --> 01:25:02.980
<v Speaker 2>So they keep going longer than they </v>
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>

1400
01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.233
<v Speaker 2>but do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start losing money or just stop </v>

1401
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:08.000
<v Speaker 2>winning every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of these sort.</v>

1402
01:25:08.001 --> 01:25:10.360
<v Speaker 2>And maybe my explanation was confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1403
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:12.250
<v Speaker 2>You either wait a quarter or lose a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter.</v>

1404
01:25:12.810 --> 01:25:14.440
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1405
01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.770
<v Speaker 2>So the ratio of wins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two losses decreases over time</v>

1406
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:23.680
<v Speaker 2>and you should stop somewhere in the 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 50 range,</v>

1407
01:25:23.681 --> 01:25:24.514
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe a little after that because </v>

1408
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:27.070
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But somewhere around there,</v>

1409
01:25:27.071 --> 01:25:27.904
<v Speaker 2>when you're losing as often as you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>winning and you can see the numbers </v>

1410
01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:33.790
<v Speaker 2>total up on the screen and the quarters </v>
<v Speaker 2>appear or disappear.</v>

1411
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:36.790
<v Speaker 2>So you can tell when you hit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximum.</v>

1412
01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:41.680
<v Speaker 2>So then that seems to be complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the optimism variable</v>

1413
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:46.680
<v Speaker 2>because if somebody just thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm just kidding,</v>

1414
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:47.703
<v Speaker 2>keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1415
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:49.840
<v Speaker 2>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's conceivable.</v>

1416
01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.673
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a hard thing to factor out and </v>

1417
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:54.520
<v Speaker 2>it's conceivable if it's contaminated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimism,</v>

1418
01:25:54.521 --> 01:25:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I would say that I'm to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstance.</v>

1419
01:25:56.861 --> 01:26:00.880
<v Speaker 2>So the test optimism is unwarranted past</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain point.</v>

1420
01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:05.840
<v Speaker 2>So to be up and you'd have to assume </v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't stacked and therefore it came</v>

1421
01:26:05.841 --> 01:26:06.674
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But since the things that decreasing </v>

1422
01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:08.053
<v Speaker 2>incrementally one by one and when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to figure out pretty quickly that </v>

1423
01:26:10.071 --> 01:26:11.480
<v Speaker 2>it was set up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1424
01:26:11.481 --> 01:26:12.121
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

1425
01:26:12.121 --> 01:26:14.630
<v Speaker 2>that's the hope is you figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1426
01:26:14.730 --> 01:26:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Stop in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of things in life are like that.</v>

1427
01:26:17.241 --> 01:26:17.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1428
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:21.590
<v Speaker 2>to do something and it's working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's working and then it doesn't work so</v>

1429
01:26:21.591 --> 01:26:23.730
<v Speaker 2>well and then it works even less well </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you know.</v>

1430
01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Sooner or later you should quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously that can be contaminated,</v>

1431
01:26:27.381 --> 01:26:29.630
<v Speaker 2>that fight persistence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing we get,</v>

1432
01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.690
<v Speaker 2>and you have these people put their </v>
<v Speaker 2>finger in a pain device,</v>

1433
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:35.810
<v Speaker 2>minor league paid device you need is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a.</v>

1434
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:36.743
<v Speaker 2>it's just a lever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kinda about a sharp dull butter </v>

1435
01:26:40.611 --> 01:26:43.370
<v Speaker 2>knife and it sits on your finger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's weights on it.</v>

1436
01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.100
<v Speaker 2>When you first put your thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can take it off whenever you want,</v>

1437
01:26:46.101 --> 01:26:48.890
<v Speaker 2>when you first put your finger in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't hurt at all,</v>

1438
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.440
<v Speaker 2>but the pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1439
01:26:51.850 --> 01:26:54.980
<v Speaker 2>the pain detectors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the pain and all always say is,</v>

1440
01:26:54.981 --> 01:26:57.680
<v Speaker 2>well tell us when this hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people are looking at it.</v>

1441
01:26:58.220 --> 01:26:58.671
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts.</v>

1442
01:26:58.671 --> 01:26:59.504
<v Speaker 2>Now we also say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take your finger out when a reasonable </v>

1443
01:27:01.101 --> 01:27:02.950
<v Speaker 2>person would do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1444
01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.670
<v Speaker 2>they usually stayed there for about 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds or so and then they say,</v>

1445
01:27:05.671 --> 01:27:06.021
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1446
01:27:06.021 --> 01:27:08.480
<v Speaker 2>that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely harmless,</v>

1447
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:12.710
<v Speaker 2>but the high self esteem is stay in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there longer than the most up to now you</v>

1448
01:27:12.711 --> 01:27:14.660
<v Speaker 2>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're persistent.</v>

1449
01:27:14.890 --> 01:27:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Well they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are persistent and sometimes that's</v>

1450
01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:20.030
<v Speaker 2>good and it's hard to tell when it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

1451
01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.530
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's not good.</v>

1452
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:22.363
<v Speaker 2>And I would say leaving your finger in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory pain device longer than </v>

1453
01:27:25.131 --> 01:27:27.100
<v Speaker 2>average.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not good</v>

1454
01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:37.110
<v Speaker 2>at</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate behavioral.</v>

1455
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:42.440
<v Speaker 2>If you're optimistic and you have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>far reaching goals that can be healthy.</v>

1456
01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:47.180
<v Speaker 2>If you apply those in small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my immediate behavioral level,</v>

1457
01:27:47.181 --> 01:27:48.014
<v Speaker 2>things like this should have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral like you're not supposed to </v>

1458
01:27:49.851 --> 01:27:51.040
<v Speaker 2>figure out cognitively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1459
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:53.410
<v Speaker 2>It's incremental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1460
01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:58.100
<v Speaker 2>They will never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean by definition they're optimistic.</v>

1461
01:27:58.101 --> 01:27:58.934
<v Speaker 2>Sense is why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because unless you have the ability to </v>

1462
01:28:00.471 --> 01:28:03.990
<v Speaker 2>adapt to the everyday information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't learn and get.</v>

1463
01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the yes.</v>

1464
01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:06.333
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good explanation for the </v>

1465
01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:09.200
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The experiment.</v>

1466
01:28:10.050 --> 01:28:12.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not a definitive experiment by </v>
<v Speaker 2>means,</v>

1467
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:17.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting because it even </v>
<v Speaker 2>argues against the short term utility of</v>

1468
01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:18.463
<v Speaker 2>a failure to process the information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that indicates that you're in here and </v>

1469
01:28:21.771 --> 01:28:25.340
<v Speaker 2>it is linked to self deception since we </v>
<v Speaker 2>use this self deception questionnaire.</v>

1470
01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:27.000
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

1471
01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:30.770
<v Speaker 2>you're putting the psychopathology of </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism with psychopathy?</v>

1472
01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess so.</v>

1473
01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I should say though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having said that,</v>

1474
01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:42.793
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't mean that I don't believe </v>

1475
01:28:49.161 --> 01:28:49.994
<v Speaker 2>that there are genetic predispositions </v>
<v Speaker 2>to different forms of psychopathology </v>

1476
01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.690
<v Speaker 2>and it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also doesn't mean that I believe that</v>

1477
01:28:56.691 --> 01:28:59.270
<v Speaker 2>everyone plays on the same field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

1478
01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:00.493
<v Speaker 2>So it may be an if you say you have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extensive family history of </v>

1479
01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:05.513
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that means that it's going to take </v>

1480
01:29:08.731 --> 01:29:09.564
<v Speaker 2>a lot less to push you over the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it would a normal person and the </v>

1481
01:29:14.581 --> 01:29:16.650
<v Speaker 2>fact that you've gone over the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1482
01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:17.484
<v Speaker 2>is not any indication necessarily that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your moral character was any less than </v>

1483
01:29:21.121 --> 01:29:24.570
<v Speaker 2>the next person's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the parameters of the game shift with</v>

1484
01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:25.883
<v Speaker 2>genetic and environmental context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that I guess partly </v>

1485
01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.013
<v Speaker 2>different people have different </v>
<v Speaker 2>temptations and also different </v>

1486
01:29:32.731 --> 01:29:33.564
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that there's a moral </v>

1487
01:29:37.771 --> 01:29:41.210
<v Speaker 2>aspect to illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1488
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.980
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty troublesome.</v>

1489
01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before we leave the,</v>

1490
01:29:50.911 --> 01:29:53.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tailor for Shelley Taylor hardcore,</v>

1491
01:29:53.171 --> 01:29:54.004
<v Speaker 2>real quick thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to point out that what </v>

1492
01:29:55.231 --> 01:29:57.330
<v Speaker 2>she actually says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's been pointed out,</v>

1493
01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:58.233
<v Speaker 2>I called the block.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another critique is not the positive </v>

1494
01:30:00.151 --> 01:30:00.984
<v Speaker 2>illusions are correlated mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but positive illusions are correlated </v>

1495
01:30:03.711 --> 01:30:06.150
<v Speaker 2>with the absence of depression and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

1496
01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:08.490
<v Speaker 2>which is a very different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1497
01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:11.050
<v Speaker 2>she takes the argument farther than that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because look,</v>

1498
01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:11.963
<v Speaker 2>she wrote a self help book for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling them how to use positive self </v>

1499
01:30:15.221 --> 01:30:17.070
<v Speaker 2>illusions to enhance the mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

1500
01:30:17.970 --> 01:30:18.803
<v Speaker 2>So there she's extrapolating beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mere statement of absence of depression </v>

1501
01:30:24.811 --> 01:30:25.644
<v Speaker 2>and anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not a statement I have a </v>

1502
01:30:26.641 --> 01:30:29.220
<v Speaker 2>problem with because psychopaths for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1503
01:30:29.221 --> 01:30:32.850
<v Speaker 2>or low in depression and anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's taking the argument the next step.</v>

1504
01:30:32.851 --> 01:30:33.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1505
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:37.620
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I do think she goes beyond just,</v>

1506
01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:38.593
<v Speaker 2>well these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these restricted forms of </v>

1507
01:30:40.801 --> 01:30:45.000
<v Speaker 2>psychopathology are less frequent among </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are high in self deception.</v>

1508
01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.430
<v Speaker 2>That in itself is just an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon.</v>

1509
01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:50.760
<v Speaker 2>It's the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of disturbs me.</v>

1510
01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.470
<v Speaker 2>So is that so satisfying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1511
01:30:55.471 --> 01:30:56.670
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1512
01:30:56.671 --> 01:30:57.540
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1513
01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:58.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1514
01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.790
<v Speaker 2>I guess I misunderstood what you meant.</v>

1515
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:06.350
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it magical to have hope in the face?</v>

1516
01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Like almost like hope against hope?</v>

1517
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this argument gets more complicated.</v>

1518
01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.133
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that she's found is </v>

1519
01:31:14.171 --> 01:31:17.890
<v Speaker 2>that people who say if you're diagnosed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with intractable cancer,</v>

1520
01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:19.113
<v Speaker 2>well she's found that people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>overestimate their chance of survival </v>

1521
01:31:22.690 --> 01:31:25.840
<v Speaker 2>live longer now this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is tough.</v>

1522
01:31:25.841 --> 01:31:26.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1523
01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:29.800
<v Speaker 2>that's the piece of her evidence that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really compelling,</v>

1524
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:34.030
<v Speaker 2>but I would suggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully I can do more than suggest</v>

1525
01:31:34.031 --> 01:31:37.870
<v Speaker 2>at some point that that was because she </v>
<v Speaker 2>has optimism.</v>

1526
01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.093
<v Speaker 2>Her notion of self deception improperly </v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporates this sort of optimism that </v>

1527
01:31:44.711 --> 01:31:45.610
<v Speaker 2>we've been discussing.</v>

1528
01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.333
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That card there that I couldn't just be </v>

1529
01:31:49.351 --> 01:31:50.970
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be one of the,</v>

1530
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.863
<v Speaker 3>the psychopaths and play till the end </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I keep hoping that the next car </v>

1531
01:31:54.421 --> 01:31:56.490
<v Speaker 3>would be like the one that gives me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter.</v>

1532
01:31:57.330 --> 01:31:58.950
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm not pathological.</v>

1533
01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 2>You don't</v>

1534
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:02.310
<v Speaker 3>know how you behave in the task either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1535
01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.153
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't draw inferences about your </v>

1536
01:32:04.721 --> 01:32:07.000
<v Speaker 3>behavior in hypothetical because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know.</v>

1537
01:32:07.210 --> 01:32:08.380
<v Speaker 3>He might've stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1538
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do either.</v>

1539
01:32:09.341 --> 01:32:10.174
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you would play around with the Eq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also possible that some of the </v>

1540
01:32:13.601 --> 01:32:15.370
<v Speaker 3>people just didn't care about the damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>quarters.</v>

1541
01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Like the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks quarters to play the games at the</v>

1542
01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:21.270
<v Speaker 3>hurricane.</v>

1543
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a dog game.</v>

1544
01:32:23.290 --> 01:32:25.200
<v Speaker 2>We tell people you're supposed to win </v>
<v Speaker 2>the money.</v>

1545
01:32:25.201 --> 01:32:28.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like proper behavior during this </v>
<v Speaker 2>test is winning the money.</v>

1546
01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:30.270
<v Speaker 2>So the goal is set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mean,</v>

1547
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:31.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1548
01:32:31.531 --> 01:32:32.364
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1549
01:32:34.730 --> 01:32:38.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not a definitive cakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did you have,</v>

1550
01:32:38.221 --> 01:32:39.240
<v Speaker 2>did you have another college</v>

1551
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:43.650
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to ask?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about hope and,</v>

1552
01:32:43.670 --> 01:32:44.470
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1553
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:46.760
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The words pride,</v>

1554
01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:48.550
<v Speaker 3>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hatred and revenge.</v>

1555
01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.060
<v Speaker 3>What's the neuropsychological valence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like rape,</v>

1556
01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.180
<v Speaker 3>like fears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1557
01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.880
<v Speaker 3>activation of the right.</v>

1558
01:32:59.290 --> 01:33:01.450
<v Speaker 2>But what about pride in this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1559
01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1560
01:33:04.090 --> 01:33:05.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the negative emotions,</v>

1561
01:33:05.721 --> 01:33:06.830
<v Speaker 2>they tend to clump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1562
01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:09.110
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the neuroticism scale of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Neil,</v>

1563
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:13.940
<v Speaker 2>all negative emotional states are in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same subscale.</v>

1564
01:33:13.941 --> 01:33:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Egg Anger for example,</v>

1565
01:33:16.431 --> 01:33:19.190
<v Speaker 2>correlates very highly with fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1566
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:20.840
<v Speaker 2>but we know the name</v>

1567
01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:21.853
<v Speaker 3>anger is activation of the left cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was wondering if revenge might be </v>

1568
01:33:28.431 --> 01:33:29.420
<v Speaker 3>the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1569
01:33:29.421 --> 01:33:33.340
<v Speaker 3>it seems like there's an approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an approach aspect rather than,</v>

1570
01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:34.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than avoiding.</v>

1571
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1572
01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:39.580
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I don't know,</v>

1573
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:40.433
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what we haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't progressed very far in the </v>

1574
01:33:43.021 --> 01:33:48.021
<v Speaker 2>study of sorts of higher order emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the neuropsychological</v>

1575
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:51.840
<v Speaker 2>mean as you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anger is not necessarily proactive,</v>

1576
01:33:51.841 --> 01:33:54.540
<v Speaker 2>but active aggression certainly seems to</v>
<v Speaker 2>involve approach,</v>

1577
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:55.383
<v Speaker 2>but so</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it may be in response to the </v>

1578
01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:03.653
<v Speaker 2>become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the farther you go in terms of overt </v>

1579
01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:06.373
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more complex it has to be from the </v>

1580
01:34:08.001 --> 01:34:10.730
<v Speaker 2>original impression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1581
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:13.243
<v Speaker 2>Well this is just to say that fear is </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the fundamental responses that </v>

1582
01:34:19.581 --> 01:34:23.570
<v Speaker 2>happens that happens instantly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right frontal cortex,</v>

1583
01:34:23.571 --> 01:34:24.404
<v Speaker 2>but then as soon as you're getting into </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred and revenge or getting into </v>

1584
01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:26.783
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secrets is naturally going to be </v>

1585
01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.410
<v Speaker 2>excavating systems in different systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to though that's a really good.</v>

1586
01:34:33.411 --> 01:34:37.280
<v Speaker 2>That's an astute comment because when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say aggression for example,</v>

1587
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:38.203
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying is a word that </v>
<v Speaker 2>contains 40 different categories of </v>

1588
01:34:41.001 --> 01:34:43.400
<v Speaker 2>behavioral output because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive aggression,</v>

1589
01:34:43.730 --> 01:34:48.730
<v Speaker 2>there's instrumental aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger just been just for starters,</v>

1590
01:34:49.881 --> 01:34:52.800
<v Speaker 2>there's aggression that's socially </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate.</v>

1591
01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:54.650
<v Speaker 2>There's aggression that's socially </v>
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate.</v>

1592
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:57.470
<v Speaker 2>There's aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's punishment elicited aggression.</v>

1593
01:34:57.471 --> 01:34:58.304
<v Speaker 2>That's fear elicited a aggression as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to challenge to group identity </v>

1594
01:35:02.361 --> 01:35:04.910
<v Speaker 2>and all those different things are under</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rubric of one word,</v>

1595
01:35:04.911 --> 01:35:08.720
<v Speaker 2>but as you point out involve activation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of systems.</v>

1596
01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:12.350
<v Speaker 2>It may be in complete opposition to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>another at times.</v>

1597
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:17.640
<v Speaker 3>It seems to to be something that like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me,</v>

1598
01:35:17.641 --> 01:35:18.474
<v Speaker 3>if there's two totally different things </v>
<v Speaker 3>in everyday life we call hope and one </v>

1599
01:35:20.771 --> 01:35:24.010
<v Speaker 3>would be sort of equivalent to the hero </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other one would be equivalent to</v>

1600
01:35:24.011 --> 01:35:28.600
<v Speaker 3>like an over rigid identification with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>social structure because like if you say</v>

1601
01:35:29.170 --> 01:35:32.020
<v Speaker 3>you have hope in the future that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>look can be the kind of thing that keeps</v>

1602
01:35:32.021 --> 01:35:34.390
<v Speaker 3>you looking for other alternatives and </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps you find a way around.</v>

1603
01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Messaging sort of motivates you forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>into anomaly or whatever.</v>

1604
01:35:38.021 --> 01:35:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Like the hero to encounter the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1605
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:42.700
<v Speaker 3>Or you can have a kind of thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't distinguish.</v>

1606
01:35:42.701 --> 01:35:46.570
<v Speaker 3>We call it home too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the kind of thing where you say</v>

1607
01:35:46.630 --> 01:35:50.120
<v Speaker 3>it keeps you from finding a way around </v>
<v Speaker 3>things because you say this one though,</v>

1608
01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.093
<v Speaker 2>I felt like faith because hope I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually categorically defined </v>

1609
01:35:57.661 --> 01:35:58.494
<v Speaker 2>hope in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say hope is what you </v>

1610
01:36:00.781 --> 01:36:01.614
<v Speaker 2>experienced as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive valence of an anomalous </v>

1611
01:36:04.651 --> 01:36:07.860
<v Speaker 2>occurrence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that you experienced the</v>

1612
01:36:07.861 --> 01:36:08.694
<v Speaker 2>effect of hope when you're faced with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>acute or satisfaction with an incentive </v>

1613
01:36:12.631 --> 01:36:13.464
<v Speaker 2>reward and that accompanies activation </v>
<v Speaker 2>left from the cortex is I think what </v>

1614
01:36:16.801 --> 01:36:17.634
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about is this and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're making a distinction </v>

1615
01:36:19.771 --> 01:36:21.390
<v Speaker 2>between blind faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1616
01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.351
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's gonna.</v>

1617
01:36:22.351 --> 01:36:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Turn out wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1618
01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Even when the barbarians are at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gate,</v>

1619
01:36:25.531 --> 01:36:27.720
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the faith that says,</v>

1620
01:36:28.110 --> 01:36:28.943
<v Speaker 2>no matter what comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means I know that things will </v>

1621
01:36:31.231 --> 01:36:32.064
<v Speaker 2>transform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can deal with the transformations if </v>

1622
01:36:33.691 --> 01:36:37.350
<v Speaker 2>my attitude is proper and it's certainly</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case that those two things can be.</v>

1623
01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:40.280
<v Speaker 2>One is adolescent phase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>

1624
01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:41.233
<v Speaker 2>It's all my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't even faith in the sense its </v>

1625
01:36:43.891 --> 01:36:44.724
<v Speaker 2>reliance on the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I followed with a group of </v>

1626
01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:49.590
<v Speaker 2>maintained or protect me from those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things I can control.</v>

1627
01:36:49.630 --> 01:36:51.260
<v Speaker 2>The other one is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1628
01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I know the world is a dynamic place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something in me that can respond</v>

1629
01:36:55.171 --> 01:36:57.420
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like an absolutely.</v>

1630
01:36:57.540 --> 01:37:02.100
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the antithesis of the of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the position that motivates the lock.</v>

1631
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:03.383
<v Speaker 2>It's also the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what other questions are trying to </v>

1632
01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:09.870
<v Speaker 2>answer is we know the group has it </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected nature.</v>

1633
01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:16.220
<v Speaker 2>That's also necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that can be pathologist,</v>

1634
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:17.303
<v Speaker 2>so the question is given that the group </v>
<v Speaker 2>is necessary that it's maintenance is </v>

1635
01:37:19.951 --> 01:37:20.784
<v Speaker 2>necessary that people have to identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>with how is it that the pathological </v>

1636
01:37:24.331 --> 01:37:27.990
<v Speaker 2>aspect can be reduced and I would say to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the degree that you're able to move your</v>

1637
01:37:27.991 --> 01:37:28.824
<v Speaker 2>faith from blind reliance on the group </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have your own capacity to address </v>

1638
01:37:32.731 --> 01:37:35.940
<v Speaker 2>anomalous information and transform it </v>
<v Speaker 2>into unexplored territory.</v>

1639
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:39.810
<v Speaker 2>You're you to the degree that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do that.</v>

1640
01:37:39.811 --> 01:37:40.644
<v Speaker 2>You can civil status when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent ties on the group because you </v>

1641
01:37:44.011 --> 01:37:46.300
<v Speaker 2>have this alternative standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1642
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:49.050
<v Speaker 2>There's two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two modes of protection from the</v>

1643
01:37:49.051 --> 01:37:51.430
<v Speaker 2>great unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is well,</v>

1644
01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.313
<v Speaker 2>dad will do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of looking at the other </v>

1645
01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:58.440
<v Speaker 2>end as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No now saying can do everything,</v>

1646
01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.760
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm willing to meet whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens when it happens,</v>

1647
01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.120
<v Speaker 2>I can heighten the probability of </v>
<v Speaker 2>success to to its highest possible level</v>

1648
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.290
<v Speaker 2>that works out because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always practicing and that's.</v>

1649
01:38:13.291 --> 01:38:15.750
<v Speaker 2>That's psychological hygiene as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned.</v>

1650
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:16.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why so many religious </v>

1651
01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:23.360
<v Speaker 2>traditions concentrated on heightening </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to day to day processes,</v>

1652
01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:25.283
<v Speaker 2>so there's little bits of anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 2>information are always cropping up in </v>

1653
01:38:27.871 --> 01:38:28.704
<v Speaker 2>your interpersonal interaction to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional work and everything that </v>

1654
01:38:31.771 --> 01:38:33.300
<v Speaker 2>you do and if you.</v>

1655
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:34.853
<v Speaker 2>If you learn how to respond to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal occurrences that are relatively </v>

1656
01:38:38.581 --> 01:38:40.290
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're happening.</v>

1657
01:38:40.590 --> 01:38:42.060
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep your personality,</v>

1658
01:38:42.061 --> 01:38:42.894
<v Speaker 2>how you practice knowing how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you increase your confidence in </v>

1659
01:38:46.681 --> 01:38:47.514
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You decrease the amount of territory </v>

1660
01:38:50.011 --> 01:38:52.620
<v Speaker 2>around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this contaminated by the unknown,</v>

1661
01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.970
<v Speaker 2>and you increased the likelihood that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when something really catastrophic comes</v>

1662
01:38:56.971 --> 01:38:59.160
<v Speaker 2>along that you'll make the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>

1663
01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:00.810
<v Speaker 2>It's important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1664
01:39:00.811 --> 01:39:04.980
<v Speaker 2>because you see in places like Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1665
01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:05.963
<v Speaker 2>and certainly not uniquely all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who we might have hoped would </v>

1666
01:39:10.051 --> 01:39:10.884
<v Speaker 2>have been more resistant to the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology fell over like sheep when </v>

1667
01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:20.040
<v Speaker 2>paraded out the intellectual community </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to have no better record than the</v>

1668
01:39:20.251 --> 01:39:22.830
<v Speaker 2>community at large in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1669
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:28.350
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to me indicates that despite their</v>

1670
01:39:28.351 --> 01:39:32.220
<v Speaker 2>accumulation of facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no concentration whatsoever on</v>

1671
01:39:32.221 --> 01:39:33.054
<v Speaker 2>the development of character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can necessarily weakens the </v>

1672
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:36.833
<v Speaker 2>resistance of that.</v>

1673
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm trying to think about what,</v>

1674
01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:45.933
<v Speaker 3>how you can distinguish between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>optimist and the psychopath and your </v>

1675
01:39:48.121 --> 01:39:51.010
<v Speaker 3>experiments and what is used to be to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1676
01:39:51.011 --> 01:39:52.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my experience and my experience that,</v>

1677
01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:57.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe at least from requirements that</v>

1678
01:39:57.130 --> 01:40:02.130
<v Speaker 3>the psychopath goes on ignoring threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even while being punished,</v>

1679
01:40:03.610 --> 01:40:04.443
<v Speaker 3>I'm numb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to figure out if it's been </v>

1680
01:40:05.531 --> 01:40:07.600
<v Speaker 3>punished by the known or unknown unknown</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1681
01:40:07.601 --> 01:40:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Because when he sticks his finger in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1682
01:40:10.151 --> 01:40:11.830
<v Speaker 3>that's something that's known that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to hurt you.</v>

1683
01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:13.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stick it in longer.</v>

1684
01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm trying to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The optimist,</v>

1685
01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:21.780
<v Speaker 3>I think ignores the red but does not </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep going on when being punished</v>

1686
01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.760
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the known or the unknown.</v>

1687
01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.421
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1688
01:40:26.421 --> 01:40:27.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it breaks down,</v>

1689
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:30.440
<v Speaker 2>it breaks down that straightforwardly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Payne.</v>

1690
01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:31.813
<v Speaker 2>I'm the optimist is someone I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's willing to endure and voluntarily </v>

1691
01:40:36.801 --> 01:40:40.010
<v Speaker 2>meet threatening conditions in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>attain their hand,</v>

1692
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:43.480
<v Speaker 2>but who also modifies their behavior as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a consequence of encountered.</v>

1693
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:46.460
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the critical time is the optimist</v>

1694
01:40:46.461 --> 01:40:48.170
<v Speaker 2>is who's healthy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

1695
01:40:48.171 --> 01:40:50.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ideal that may even be impossible.</v>

1696
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:52.070
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in some ways,</v>

1697
01:40:52.071 --> 01:40:55.540
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have an impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your ideal is wrong.</v>

1698
01:40:55.630 --> 01:41:00.630
<v Speaker 2>It should always supersede your grass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole point of an ideal.</v>

1699
01:41:01.810 --> 01:41:05.350
<v Speaker 2>It's something that as you approach it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it receives but transforms you along the</v>

1700
01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:06.820
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>

1701
01:41:06.821 --> 01:41:08.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pathological fantasy consensus.</v>

1702
01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:11.500
<v Speaker 2>It can never be brought into existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a difference between</v>

1703
01:41:13.190 --> 01:41:14.023
<v Speaker 2>your conception of the future as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal place and your and your belief </v>

1704
01:41:17.511 --> 01:41:18.344
<v Speaker 2>that despite all evidence to the present</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that ideal place at least in so far </v>

1705
01:41:22.221 --> 01:41:23.480
<v Speaker 2>as it's composed of you</v>

1706
01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:27.090
<v Speaker 1>art from all these other horrible people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been surrounded.</v>

1707
01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:28.683
<v Speaker 1>So like the distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>persistence and stubbornness or </v>

1708
01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.520
<v Speaker 1>hardheadedness or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to understand the distinction</v>

1709
01:41:36.521 --> 01:41:37.354
<v Speaker 1>between a hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of hope necessarily report to risk </v>

1710
01:41:42.221 --> 01:41:44.440
<v Speaker 1>action and optimism.</v>

1711
01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:45.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1712
01:41:45.891 --> 01:41:46.724
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that I would say that's </v>

1713
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:48.583
<v Speaker 2>faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually Cornell West talks about leap </v>

1714
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:52.130
<v Speaker 2>of hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

1715
01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:53.003
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Required to sustain political activism </v>

1716
01:41:55.710 --> 01:41:56.880
<v Speaker 2>face of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1717
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:59.103
<v Speaker 2>In the face of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This face of evidence that all your </v>

1718
01:42:01.641 --> 01:42:03.470
<v Speaker 2>personal efforts are useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:42:03.710 --> 01:42:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1720
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:07.880
<v Speaker 2>So that's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends.</v>

1721
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very.</v>

1722
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:12.103
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous to try to identify a</v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of something that can be </v>

1723
01:42:15.861 --> 01:42:18.800
<v Speaker 2>defined as healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1724
01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:20.590
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see if I can address that.</v>

1725
01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Weren't particularly adaptive.</v>

1726
01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean our society is predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that despite all appearances,</v>

1727
01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.313
<v Speaker 2>something divine about the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what Cornell West is referring </v>

1728
01:42:38.601 --> 01:42:41.950
<v Speaker 2>to is the necessity of acting on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief even though it,</v>

1729
01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:44.480
<v Speaker 2>even though number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incomprehensible,</v>

1730
01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:47.210
<v Speaker 2>and number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to exist despite the evidence.</v>

1731
01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.231
<v Speaker 2>Now you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1732
01:42:48.231 --> 01:42:50.060
<v Speaker 2>what would separate that from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>delusion?</v>

1733
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is evidence to support the</v>

1734
01:42:52.791 --> 01:42:54.950
<v Speaker 2>notion that it's accurate because for </v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing,</v>

1735
01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:55.993
<v Speaker 2>those societies that make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>presupposition seemed to work much </v>

1736
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:59.623
<v Speaker 2>better than those who don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that strikes me as a form of </v>

1737
01:43:01.671 --> 01:43:02.504
<v Speaker 2>evidence plus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what we consider evidence that's </v>

1738
01:43:05.361 --> 01:43:07.640
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to to come to any </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement about.</v>

1739
01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:12.850
<v Speaker 2>But it also strikes me that if you look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at traditional wisdom in these myths,</v>

1740
01:43:13.161 --> 01:43:15.410
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's constantly pointed out is,</v>

1741
01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.920
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand the function of the</v>

1742
01:43:18.921 --> 01:43:19.754
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

1743
01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:20.683
<v Speaker 2>There's more to it than meets the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more to it being at the individual </v>

1744
01:43:24.201 --> 01:43:28.580
<v Speaker 2>is the phenomenon that creates order out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of chaos.</v>

1745
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:31.520
<v Speaker 2>So the incarnation of Martech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1746
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:32.683
<v Speaker 2>plus the force that rejuvenates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>archaic social system when it needs to </v>

1747
01:43:36.771 --> 01:43:39.320
<v Speaker 2>be rejuvenated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now those two things,</v>

1748
01:43:39.321 --> 01:43:41.040
<v Speaker 2>account for the divinity of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

1749
01:43:41.041 --> 01:43:42.470
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>

1750
01:43:42.471 --> 01:43:44.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it may not be evident to you</v>

1751
01:43:44.421 --> 01:43:47.750
<v Speaker 2>necessarily in your actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that is playing out,</v>

1752
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:50.570
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing it for the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>

1753
01:43:51.610 --> 01:43:53.690
<v Speaker 2>then it will play itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neat.</v>

1754
01:43:53.730 --> 01:43:56.300
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all revolutions start invisibly,</v>

1755
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:57.583
<v Speaker 2>which is his explicit recapitulation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hero myth because the hero's always </v>

1756
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:04.940
<v Speaker 2>born under know trivial and threatened </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>

1757
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:07.100
<v Speaker 2>So Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for examples,</v>

1758
01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:11.990
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna be he's threatened with death</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the Pharaoh and let go on a river and</v>

1759
01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:14.480
<v Speaker 2>in the Christian story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ is born in the stable,</v>

1760
01:44:14.481 --> 01:44:15.980
<v Speaker 2>inherited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatens him with Gaf.</v>

1761
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:20.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's just a sign that you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>terribly important things.</v>

1762
01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Many have the May have the outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>appearance,</v>

1763
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:24.703
<v Speaker 2>even a failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's no indication necessarily </v>

1764
01:44:26.811 --> 01:44:28.550
<v Speaker 2>that their failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you say,</v>

1765
01:44:28.551 --> 01:44:29.384
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the hell do you separate that from </v>

1766
01:44:30.021 --> 01:44:31.300
<v Speaker 2>delusion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1767
01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:36.410
<v Speaker 2>that ties into that's a good way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>closing and that ties into this book.</v>

1768
01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:39.300
<v Speaker 2>He can't tell using objective evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1769
01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:41.210
<v Speaker 2>if what you're doing is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>

1770
01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.220
<v Speaker 2>partly because you have the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeframe.</v>

1771
01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.410
<v Speaker 2>So maybe the thing you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely right.</v>

1772
01:44:45.411 --> 01:44:46.244
<v Speaker 2>No one knows for 300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to know it because </v>

1773
01:44:48.291 --> 01:44:50.330
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you know?</v>

1774
01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I can say,</v>

1775
01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:52.813
<v Speaker 2>the only way I can think of that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might know is by watching how your </v>

1776
01:44:55.551 --> 01:44:56.384
<v Speaker 2>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by watching how your belief in actions </v>

1777
01:45:00.490 --> 01:45:01.790
<v Speaker 2>slip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say it again.</v>

1778
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:04.010
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you want?</v>

1779
01:45:06.130 --> 01:45:06.963
<v Speaker 2>Let me just get this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that tends to turn people </v>

1780
01:45:11.751 --> 01:45:16.160
<v Speaker 2>against life is the fact that life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>full of inexplicably tragedies.</v>

1781
01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:17.473
<v Speaker 2>I would say that if you can develop a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motive of an attitude towards the world </v>

1782
01:45:21.651 --> 01:45:24.680
<v Speaker 2>that is characterized by an increase in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to bear,</v>

1783
01:45:24.681 --> 01:45:25.514
<v Speaker 2>it's tragic circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's evidence that your attitude </v>

1784
01:45:28.431 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 2>is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1785
01:45:29.571 --> 01:45:32.270
<v Speaker 2>the only person who's going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to determine that is you,</v>

1786
01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:35.570
<v Speaker 2>because it's not going to be evident </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily the people around you and it</v>

1787
01:45:35.571 --> 01:45:38.510
<v Speaker 2>may not play out the way you would want </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to in the external world.</v>

1788
01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:40.033
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is how is it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can come to the state where you can </v>

1789
01:45:42.741 --> 01:45:44.960
<v Speaker 2>trust your own judgment about your </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs?</v>

1790
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Given that people's beliefs get out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand all the time and they say,</v>

1791
01:45:48.351 --> 01:45:49.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this belief is right,</v>

1792
01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.940
<v Speaker 2>well that that ties back into this.</v>

1793
01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.313
<v Speaker 2>If you fill up your head with </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that you know to buy your </v>

1794
01:45:56.961 --> 01:45:57.794
<v Speaker 2>own definitions of truth to be false,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can ensure that you're not </v>

1795
01:46:01.761 --> 01:46:03.290
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to trust your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgment.</v>

1796
01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is there's going to be times</v>

1797
01:46:05.181 --> 01:46:06.014
<v Speaker 2>in your life where your judgment is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only judgment that can even possibly be </v>

1798
01:46:09.411 --> 01:46:10.244
<v Speaker 2>valid and it it better be the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in that circumstance that </v>

1799
01:46:13.971 --> 01:46:14.804
<v Speaker 2>your head is free enough of lives so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can be certain that the </v>

1800
01:46:17.481 --> 01:46:20.210
<v Speaker 2>decision you're making is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say,</v>

1801
01:46:20.211 --> 01:46:23.350
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thing that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlie the last lecture in the course,</v>

1802
01:46:23.351 --> 01:46:26.990
<v Speaker 2>is there's two poles of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two.</v>

1803
01:46:27.010 --> 01:46:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Paul's that underlie your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine if you're on the right path is</v>

1804
01:46:30.621 --> 01:46:31.454
<v Speaker 2>way one is you're doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're interested in that's meaningful </v>

1805
01:46:35.121 --> 01:46:38.240
<v Speaker 2>enough so that you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with all the tragedy of life,</v>

1806
01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:41.210
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I can do this makes it all</v>
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile.</v>

1807
01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:42.373
<v Speaker 2>And the second thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better make sure that you're not </v>

1808
01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:44.864
<v Speaker 2>diluted in what's making you interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and the only way you can be sure of </v>

1809
01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:48.043
<v Speaker 2>that is that you're not lying because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might end up developing an interest </v>

1810
01:46:50.401 --> 01:46:54.390
<v Speaker 2>in the expert because that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people or in slaughtering,</v>

1811
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:56.370
<v Speaker 2>and then their interest guides them </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

1812
01:46:56.371 --> 01:46:57.900
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't have gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>

1813
01:46:57.901 --> 01:46:58.734
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because they pathologize </v>

1814
01:46:59.551 --> 01:47:02.400
<v Speaker 2>themselves by filling their brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1815
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:05.320
<v Speaker 2>filling their mind because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information they know too,</v>

1816
01:47:05.850 --> 01:47:08.790
<v Speaker 2>they know is not vertical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's two poles.</v>

1817
01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:12.900
<v Speaker 2>One is where something meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself.</v>

1818
01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Follow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now people want to do that anyway.</v>

1819
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:19.590
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes your life interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is whenever you have the</v>

1820
01:47:19.591 --> 01:47:20.424
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that you tell yourself the </v>

1821
01:47:21.421 --> 01:47:22.650
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't,</v>

1822
01:47:23.130 --> 01:47:27.060
<v Speaker 2>your interest is going to become sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a lead you somewhere.</v>

1823
01:47:27.061 --> 01:47:28.050
<v Speaker 2>You do not want to do it</v>

1824
01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:36.733
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

1825
01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:39.580
<v Speaker 2>So our last classes next week,</v>

1826
01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:46.970
<v Speaker 1>hold everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have your assets.</v>

1827
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:48.783
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
