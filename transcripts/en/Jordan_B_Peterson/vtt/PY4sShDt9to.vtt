00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Dr richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher studies the neural basis of human</v>

2
00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:27.881
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He works with neuroimaging technologies </v>

3
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>to study individual differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental ability.</v>

4
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>He received his phd in psychology from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Johns Hopkins University in Nineteen</v>

5
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:39.191
<v Speaker 1>75 and has since held appointments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intramural research program at the </v>

6
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.640
<v Speaker 1>National Institute of Mental Health and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the medical school at Brown University </v>

7
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 1>and the University of California at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Irvine Irvine.</v>

8
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>He has served on the editorial board or </v>
<v Speaker 1>three journals,</v>

9
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>neuro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>image intelligence and psychiatry </v>

10
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.941
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also served as guest editor for a </v>

11
00:00:57.941 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>special issue on brain imaging research </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the journal intelligence.</v>

12
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>He provides neuroscience consultation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do university research groups,</v>

13
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations,</v>

14
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 1>and educational and legal professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a popular lecturer and has appeared</v>

15
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:13.931
<v Speaker 1>in numerous media outlets in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His research was featured on Nova </v>

16
00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:18.760
<v Speaker 1>science now and he received the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguished contributor award for the </v>

17
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.270
<v Speaker 1>International Society for intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

18
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.840
<v Speaker 1>In 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The teaching company invited Richard to </v>

19
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>create an 18 lecture course called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent rate.</v>

20
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to Dr Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Higher today and we're going to talk </v>

21
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>about the most controversy of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>topics.</v>

22
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I would say in social science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe we could start with a little </v>

24
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:47.381
<v Speaker 1>bit of historical information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know how you got </v>

25
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:50.090
<v Speaker 1>interested in Iq research or </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence research,</v>

26
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

27
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so let's start with that and then we</v>

28
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 1>can start diving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diving into the nitty gritty.</v>

29
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really it started in graduate school at </v>

30
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.191
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins when I really became most </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in personality research and I</v>

31
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:11.770
<v Speaker 2>started out studying individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences in personality,</v>

32
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 2>but just by happenstance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year I started graduate school in </v>

33
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 71 was the year one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>professors there,</v>

34
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:25.021
<v Speaker 2>Julian Stanley was study up </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematically precocious youth and I </v>

35
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 2>was one of the proctors at the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>first challenge search for </v>

36
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 2>mathematically precocious kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote my first couple of papers as</v>

37
00:02:37.661 --> 00:02:42.640
<v Speaker 2>book chapters in books that Stanley was </v>
<v Speaker 2>editing about this project.</v>

38
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 2>And I saw these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids age 10,</v>

39
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:50.521
<v Speaker 2>11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 when we're scoring higher on sat </v>

40
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 2>math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then hopkins freshmen.</v>

41
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 2>And the question was how does this </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>

42
00:02:57.401 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Where does this come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now it's kind of my earliest interest</v>

43
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.300
<v Speaker 2>and in graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I really completed my </v>

44
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>dissertation on personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

45
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.880
<v Speaker 2>I took my first job at the National </v>
<v Speaker 2>Institute of Mental Health in the </v>

46
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.060
<v Speaker 2>intramural research program in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory and psychology and </v>

47
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.021
<v Speaker 2>psychopathology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which at the time the lab director was </v>

48
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:30.331
<v Speaker 2>David Rosenthal who had just finished </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Denmark adoption studies of </v>

49
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia.</v>

50
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here is where I learned about </v>

51
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.991
<v Speaker 2>genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My office was next door to a fellow </v>

52
00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 2>named Monte bucks bond who was doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>both for initial search,</v>

53
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 2>very interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my,</v>

54
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 2>my early interest in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

55
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.790
<v Speaker 2>in individual differences slowly morphed</v>
<v Speaker 2>into an interest in individual </v>

56
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:59.300
<v Speaker 2>differences in intelligence and add nim </v>
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>

57
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.740
<v Speaker 2>They were just going through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition from kind of a </v>

58
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.011
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalytic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a orientation to a neuro science </v>

59
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 2>orientation and I was kind of caught up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that.</v>

60
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:18.031
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the origin of my interest </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the brain in technologies to make </v>

61
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 2>brain measurements and relate that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual differences.</v>

62
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

63
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you just wrote a book too,</v>

64
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 2>and the neuroscience of intelligence can</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a university press.</v>

65
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.640
<v Speaker 2>And so when did that come out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That came out really just about six </v>

66
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:40.651
<v Speaker 2>months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it came out I think in December of </v>

67
00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 2>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they tell me for publishing reasons,</v>

68
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 2>they call it a 2017 publication.</v>

69
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.030
<v Speaker 2>While I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason I was so excited to </v>

70
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 2>talk to you is that are done a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>large amount of research,</v>

71
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 2>especially not so much practical lab </v>
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>

72
00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 2>but investigation into the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and into its measurement.</v>

73
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 2>We designed back in [inaudible] 93 with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a student of mine,</v>

74
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Higgins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We designed,</v>

75
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was probably the first online battery</v>

76
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 2>purporting to measure the cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>abilities associated with dorsal lateral</v>

77
00:05:13.571 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

78
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:19.520
<v Speaker 2>So I had the highest order cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>functions in the brain and we found,</v>

79
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 2>much to our chagrin I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was very painful discovery,</v>

80
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:28.231
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of what we have been thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about as potentially separable </v>

81
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.300
<v Speaker 2>neuro-psychological functions were </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty easily collapsible,</v>

82
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 2>collapsible into good old general </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

83
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that killer is central factor that seems</v>

84
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 2>to cognitive abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was quite a shock,</v>

85
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 2>especially because the neuro </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists have the time and they </v>

86
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 2>still do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

87
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

88
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.510
<v Speaker 2>are as assiduous in investigators of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometric intelligence literature is </v>

89
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:58.861
<v Speaker 2>they should be intent to underestimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the central power of that in that </v>

90
00:05:58.861 --> 00:05:58.861
<v Speaker 2>initial factor.</v>

91
00:05:58.861 --> 00:06:03.420
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really interested into intelligence </v>

92
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>research partly from a practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective too,</v>

93
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:08.561
<v Speaker 1>because the industrial organizational </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology literature is crystal clear </v>

94
00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:12.731
<v Speaker 1>for complex jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best predictor of longterm success </v>

95
00:06:12.731 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>is intelligence and it's a predictor </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably</v>

96
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>say imagine you give it an r of point </v>
<v Speaker 1>four to point five,</v>

97
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty decent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say 25 percent of the variance,</v>

98
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:27.161
<v Speaker 1>the next best predictor is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and it's pushing it's </v>

99
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>limit at mopping up 10 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability in longterm performance.</v>

100
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.360
<v Speaker 1>So Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a killer man.</v>

101
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Speaker 1>And if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make sure my students assess </v>

102
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.241
<v Speaker 1>intelligence with everything they do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it always ends up being a major </v>

103
00:06:40.241 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 1>predictor of things that you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even expect.</v>

104
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Like disgust sensitivity for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your disgust sensitivity is higher if</v>

105
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 1>you have a lower Iq,</v>

106
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.430
<v Speaker 2>the g factor is powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just said something though that I </v>

107
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.060
<v Speaker 2>want to just make a distinction about </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

108
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.820
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the g factor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you kind of called it Iq.</v>

109
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 2>This is very common in everyday language</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about intelligence Iq in what we</v>

110
00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 2>call the g factor as one thing and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really isn't.</v>

111
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:15.641
<v Speaker 2>So an Iq score is a good estimate of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>g factor also includes other aspects of </v>

112
00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:22.791
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and intelligence in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although as a broad term is only a part </v>

113
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 2>of the universe of mental abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you are very good at calculating </v>

114
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 2>on what day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>January fifth was in the year,</v>

115
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.990
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>

116
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.230
<v Speaker 2>That's a mental ability that some people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

117
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.630
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

118
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.280
<v Speaker 2>With autistic survived so often and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're often but</v>

119
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.650
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently often they have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing calculus calculation abilities </v>

120
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.521
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't seem to be manifest in a </v>

121
00:07:56.521 --> 00:07:57.730
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly high overall intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

122
00:07:57.731 --> 00:07:59.710
<v Speaker 1>so what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to tell us about?</v>

123
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.290
<v Speaker 1>You want to start with the book and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk us through it.</v>

124
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that's interesting because the </v>

125
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.201
<v Speaker 2>book is kind of a culmination of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned mostly from my neuroimaging</v>

126
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.770
<v Speaker 2>work on intelligence and it kind of came</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a surprise,</v>

127
00:08:19.771 --> 00:08:24.060
<v Speaker 2>is the first book I've ever written.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now retired actually from academia,</v>

128
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.650
<v Speaker 2>never wrote a book while I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>academia is writing journal papers,</v>

129
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:34.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Cambridge University press called </v>

130
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.711
<v Speaker 2>and they have this series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals of neuroscience and they </v>

131
00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:42.141
<v Speaker 2>wanted to include intelligence and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>regarded that as a major step because </v>

132
00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:49.210
<v Speaker 2>intelligence research really has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>relegated almost to a,</v>

133
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:54.350
<v Speaker 2>the peripheral of mainstream psychology </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically to say the least.</v>

134
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

135
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.590
<v Speaker 2>the switch happened overnight from being</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mainstream to being really </v>

136
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.830
<v Speaker 2>peripheral in about 1969 before 1969.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

137
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 2>almost everyone who was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>education was concerned about the </v>

138
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:23.241
<v Speaker 2>achievement gaps and they felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>universally that once you equalized </v>

139
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 2>educational opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those achievement gaps would disappear.</v>

140
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the head start head start.</v>

141
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even before headstart,</v>

142
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.620
<v Speaker 2>headstart came to head start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even before headstart,</v>

143
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.840
<v Speaker 2>there were all these demonstration </v>
<v Speaker 2>projects.</v>

144
00:09:43.841 --> 00:09:46.030
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the miracle in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Milwaukee.</v>

145
00:09:46.031 --> 00:09:51.031
<v Speaker 2>And there were all these things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed that if you really intervened in </v>

146
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 2>early childhood education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

147
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.770
<v Speaker 2>which at that time was called </v>
<v Speaker 2>compensatory education.</v>

148
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.870
<v Speaker 2>The early childhood education term came </v>
<v Speaker 2>much later,</v>

149
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.320
<v Speaker 2>but this idea of compensatory education </v>
<v Speaker 2>really took off and then in 1969,</v>

150
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:14.020
<v Speaker 2>the harvard educational review asked one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the foremost educational </v>

151
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.271
<v Speaker 2>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arthur Jensen to write a review of the </v>

152
00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:21.841
<v Speaker 2>progress and this article in 1969 is </v>
<v Speaker 2>become infamous.</v>

153
00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:27.091
<v Speaker 2>The opening sentence was essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've tried compensatory education and </v>

154
00:10:27.131 --> 00:10:32.131
<v Speaker 2>it has failed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he had 100 pages of detailed </v>

155
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.690
<v Speaker 2>statistical analysis of why there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

156
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:40.190
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't demonstrate an increase in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iq score and any of these programs now </v>

157
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.780
<v Speaker 2>headstart had had just begun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So headstart wasn't included.</v>

158
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

159
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:49.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reviewed the literature on headstart </v>

160
00:10:49.811 --> 00:10:49.811
<v Speaker 1>to extensively and basically what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened was that the.</v>

161
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.580
<v Speaker 1>So that was for those viewers who don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

162
00:10:52.581 --> 00:10:57.581
<v Speaker 1>headstart was a nationwide attempt to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to add additional education to the lives</v>

163
00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:02.270
<v Speaker 1>of disadvantaged kids especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.910
<v Speaker 1>at the preschool level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically what happened was that </v>

165
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.450
<v Speaker 1>they actually did show improvements in </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic achievement initially.</v>

166
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.990
<v Speaker 1>So in grade one and grade two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were performing above their peers.</v>

167
00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:19.040
<v Speaker 1>But then the difference in improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference in performance started to</v>

168
00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:22.100
<v Speaker 1>decrease and then my grade grade five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grade six,</v>

169
00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:24.140
<v Speaker 1>that differences in disappeared </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>

170
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.420
<v Speaker 1>so there was no evidence whatsoever of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

171
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:31.510
<v Speaker 1>of that either have a stable one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm gain in cognitive ability or </v>

172
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:37.541
<v Speaker 1>what people were really hoping was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you intervene early enough you get </v>

173
00:11:37.541 --> 00:11:39.530
<v Speaker 1>something that would sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul would turn into a positive feedback</v>

174
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:42.680
<v Speaker 1>loop and the gains would actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance across time.</v>

175
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.680
<v Speaker 1>And what ended up happening with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>headstart research basically was the </v>

176
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.730
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that it produced no cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvements whatsoever.</v>

177
00:11:49.731 --> 00:11:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Although more kids who went through </v>
<v Speaker 1>headstart,</v>

178
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm graduated from high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer than were delinquent,</v>

179
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 1>more of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer of them became pregnant teenage in</v>

180
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:01.270
<v Speaker 1>the teenage years and more of them went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to colleges,</v>

181
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:06.271
<v Speaker 1>but that seemed to be because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>better socialized not because they were </v>

182
00:12:06.271 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 1>in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had been made smarter.</v>

183
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.940
<v Speaker 1>So that was a really tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment because it was a </v>

184
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>bipartisan attempt to come to grips with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental issues that sort of beat</v>

185
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:17.470
<v Speaker 1>deviled structural poverty in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

186
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 1>No one was happy about that outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you,</v>

187
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.510
<v Speaker 2>jetson published his article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also said that since I cue increases </v>

188
00:12:30.571 --> 00:12:35.571
<v Speaker 2>seemed not to be coming from these </v>
<v Speaker 2>intense environmental interventions,</v>

189
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.380
<v Speaker 2>we should consider the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these differences have a genetic </v>

190
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.431
<v Speaker 2>component and that really began the </v>
<v Speaker 2>incendiary descent of intelligent search</v>

191
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.910
<v Speaker 2>to the periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the reaction against that was </v>

192
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Speaker 2>universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

193
00:12:55.590 --> 00:13:00.270
<v Speaker 2>because it implied inferiority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you building teams for Icu,</v>

194
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 1>it's also something that's universally </v>
<v Speaker 1>hated,</v>

195
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 1>but on both sides of the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum,</v>

196
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.580
<v Speaker 1>because on the liberal end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 1>the idea fundamentally is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody's the same and that if </v>

198
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.531
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you distribute educational resources </v>

199
00:13:16.531 --> 00:13:19.261
<v Speaker 1>property than everyone can succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that didn't work out so well for </v>

200
00:13:19.261 --> 00:13:19.810
<v Speaker 1>liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the conservative side,</v>

201
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:21.190
<v Speaker 1>the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

202
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 1>if you could just get off your lazy ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get a job,</v>

203
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:27.820
<v Speaker 1>there is a job for you out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth of the matter is,</v>

204
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell me what you think about </v>

205
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.741
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was a statistic that just </v>

206
00:13:34.741 --> 00:13:36.451
<v Speaker 1>absolutely shocked and staggered me when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through the Intel intelligence </v>

207
00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:36.451
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

208
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.640
<v Speaker 1>it is illegal in the United States to </v>
<v Speaker 1>induct anybody who has an Iq of less </v>

209
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.200
<v Speaker 1>than 83 and the reason for that is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that the American armed forces have</v>

210
00:13:45.201 --> 00:13:50.201
<v Speaker 1>been conducting intelligence research </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like more than 100 years and that </v>

211
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:54.481
<v Speaker 1>was partly because they needed a way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorting people rapidly during times of </v>

212
00:13:54.481 --> 00:13:55.120
<v Speaker 1>military expansion during war time.</v>

213
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 1>But it was also because Iq tests and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the early part of the 20th</v>

214
00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:04.441
<v Speaker 1>century were used to identify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the deserving poor who could </v>

215
00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:08.521
<v Speaker 1>really benefit from additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational attainment and advancement </v>

216
00:14:08.521 --> 00:14:12.121
<v Speaker 1>and the unit and the military was hoping</v>
<v Speaker 1>to identify people from lower class </v>

217
00:14:12.121 --> 00:14:16.711
<v Speaker 1>strata that can be streamed into say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>officer training programs and so forth </v>

218
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:22.370
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even skills training programs to to </v>

219
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.030
<v Speaker 1>move people from the underclass into at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least the working class and maybe above.</v>

220
00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:29.230
<v Speaker 1>So they had a bloody stake in this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to find people,</v>

221
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:34.231
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to sort them properly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to do social good when they </v>

222
00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:34.810
<v Speaker 1>weren't just trying to win a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

223
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Which often also is a social good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was that by,</v>

224
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember when this legislation </v>
<v Speaker 1>was introduced,</v>

225
00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:46.411
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the later part of the 20th </v>

226
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:46.411
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are basic finding,</v>

227
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:50.641
<v Speaker 1>was that by say the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had determined that if you had an </v>

228
00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Iq of less than 83,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was not a damn thing that the unit</v>

229
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:58.330
<v Speaker 1>that the army could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the armed forces could do to transform </v>

230
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.721
<v Speaker 1>you into someone who could do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was more productive than </v>

231
00:15:01.721 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 1>nonproductive.</v>

232
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:07.750
<v Speaker 1>And the terrible thing about that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's about 10 percent of the </v>

233
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.721
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they look at a statistic like </v>

234
00:15:10.721 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 1>that and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

235
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:12.500
<v Speaker 1>you've got this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

236
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this enterprise,</v>

237
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 1>this massive enterprise that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronically hungry for people to write.</v>

238
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:20.300
<v Speaker 1>It's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always looking for people.</v>

239
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.480
<v Speaker 1>They're really oriented towards taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from the underclass and lower </v>

240
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.051
<v Speaker 1>working class and pushing them up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>societal strata and during war time </v>

241
00:15:29.051 --> 00:15:30.530
<v Speaker 1>there actually desperate to bring in </v>
<v Speaker 1>recruits,</v>

242
00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:35.531
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their conclusion is the 10 percent </v>

243
00:15:35.531 --> 00:15:36.470
<v Speaker 1>of the population can't be trained to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

244
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Anything sufficiently useful to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>them militarily operable.</v>

245
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read that my jaw just dropped.</v>

246
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:44.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

247
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.660
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the United States we have about 330 </v>

248
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.850
<v Speaker 2>million people and because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution,</v>

249
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.240
<v Speaker 2>the relatively normal distribution of Iq</v>
<v Speaker 2>scores,</v>

250
00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.480
<v Speaker 2>about 16 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have I accuse of 85 or means they're not</v>

251
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 2>going to graduate school?</v>

252
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.500
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that from,</v>

253
00:16:06.501 --> 00:16:11.501
<v Speaker 1>from what I've read practically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means the wonder this company has </v>

254
00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:14.861
<v Speaker 1>actually done a really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a nice Iq tents from the </v>

255
00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:14.861
<v Speaker 1>commercial perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:18.361
<v Speaker 1>it's actually psychometrically valid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've linked Iq levels to a job.</v>

257
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Specifically the job categories.</v>

258
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I know not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say they're not only not </v>

259
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.401
<v Speaker 2>going to graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to find a a stable job</v>

260
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:34.760
<v Speaker 2>that pays a livable wage.</v>

261
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially given that so many of the </v>

262
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.651
<v Speaker 1>service jobs now require fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high degree of computational savvy or a </v>

263
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:42.810
<v Speaker 1>built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

264
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not computation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ability to interact with complex </v>

265
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.081
<v Speaker 1>computational technology typical till </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder at a checkout market or or the </v>

266
00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:55.470
<v Speaker 1>till at a Mcdonald's because Mcdonald's </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually very complicated.</v>

267
00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Is often far beyond the ability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are on the low end of the </v>

268
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.770
<v Speaker 1>intelligence distribution and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>claimed,</v>

269
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it was wonderlic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it might know it might've been.</v>

270
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.550
<v Speaker 1>It might've been hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his name.</v>

271
00:17:07.551 --> 00:17:09.660
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a ICU researcher.</v>

272
00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:14.661
<v Speaker 1>Is it earl haunts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think possibly what he claimed that if</v>

273
00:17:14.911 --> 00:17:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you have an Iq of below 90 it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

274
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:23.180
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult for you to read well </v>

275
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.090
<v Speaker 1>enough to translate what you're reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>into action,</v>

276
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.940
<v Speaker 1>so you can't actually read instructions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and follow them.</v>

277
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that level of literacy.</v>

278
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say that in,</v>

279
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:37.121
<v Speaker 2>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this bottom 16 percent translates into </v>

280
00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:43.501
<v Speaker 2>51 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including $13 million children who are </v>

281
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:48.070
<v Speaker 2>in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very difficult problem now.</v>

282
00:17:48.071 --> 00:17:51.510
<v Speaker 2>I knew earl passed away when I knew him </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty well.</v>

283
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:56.690
<v Speaker 2>He also would say that there is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cognitive segregation in society.</v>

284
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:04.990
<v Speaker 2>This is a point that Charles Murray </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes and they often ask,</v>

285
00:18:04.991 --> 00:18:05.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:10.851
<v Speaker 2>when's the last time you had someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>over for dinner who wasn't a college </v>

287
00:18:10.851 --> 00:18:10.851
<v Speaker 2>Grad?</v>

288
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was something that Marie and her </v>

289
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 1>starting wrote about in their book the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bell curve,</v>

290
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:17.680
<v Speaker 1>which really struck me because I read </v>
<v Speaker 1>that book twice,</v>

291
00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:21.220
<v Speaker 1>unlike most of the people criticized it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

292
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.010
<v Speaker 1>we're one of the things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out in there,</v>

293
00:18:24.011 --> 00:18:24.490
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

294
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.080
<v Speaker 1>the typically a typical educated person </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks that someone isn't very bright if</v>

295
00:18:31.181 --> 00:18:36.170
<v Speaker 1>they have an Iq of 150.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how'd you at graduate level,</v>

296
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Phd Level Research Institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

297
00:18:38.681 --> 00:18:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Because 115,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

298
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.920
<v Speaker 1>there's as many people at 150 and above </v>
<v Speaker 1>as there are at 85 and below.</v>

299
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a minority of the population</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the top 15 percent.</v>

300
00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

301
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.560
<v Speaker 1>that's the dollar undergraduate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

302
00:18:53.561 --> 00:18:56.740
<v Speaker 1>So people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I'm a clinical psychologist and I've</v>

303
00:18:56.741 --> 00:19:01.741
<v Speaker 1>dealt with people who had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ranges in the low eighties and tried </v>

304
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:02.230
<v Speaker 1>to find them jobs and tried to train </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

305
00:19:02.231 --> 00:19:07.231
<v Speaker 1>And I have some real knowledge about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stunning gap between people at the low </v>

306
00:19:07.361 --> 00:19:09.370
<v Speaker 1>end of the ICU distribution in the high </v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

307
00:19:09.371 --> 00:19:10.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no bloody wonder.</v>

308
00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:15.961
<v Speaker 1>People hate Iq research and intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>research because it reveals a set of </v>

309
00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:16.240
<v Speaker 1>seriously</v>

310
00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.080
<v Speaker 2>a dismal</v>

311
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.290
<v Speaker 1>facts about the incredible range of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability among human beings.</v>

312
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

313
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.620
<v Speaker 2>this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And moreover I would add to this that </v>

314
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.000
<v Speaker 2>people in universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professors and graduate students have a </v>

315
00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 2>hard time understanding what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what everyday life is like.</v>

316
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.640
<v Speaker 2>If you have an Iq of 84,</v>
<v Speaker 2>85 and we're making your way,</v>

317
00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:51.831
<v Speaker 2>you're living independently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were making your way in the world </v>

318
00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:53.490
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a challenge.</v>

319
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

320
00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.100
<v Speaker 1>just barely begins to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

321
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I had a client who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably had an Iq of under 80 and </v>

322
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.120
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal portion of it anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

323
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.820
<v Speaker 1>he was indistinguishable and physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance from,</v>

324
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.690
<v Speaker 1>from let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to use the frame normal person,</v>

325
00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:18.691
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing more that marked him</v>
<v Speaker 1>out about particularly intellectually </v>

326
00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:18.691
<v Speaker 1>impaired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

327
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.130
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried at one point,</v>

328
00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.520
<v Speaker 1>this was so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so telling to me,</v>

329
00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I got him an inch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a volunteer job,</v>

330
00:20:28.241 --> 00:20:33.241
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder to get a volunteer job in a </v>

331
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:36.181
<v Speaker 1>real job because you have to do police </v>
<v Speaker 1>screening and all sorts of things and </v>

332
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:36.181
<v Speaker 1>the selection process is just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme,</v>

333
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:39.280
<v Speaker 1>but I eventually ended up getting a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a bike store,</v>

334
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.440
<v Speaker 1>bike slash bookstore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at that place couldn't hold him once</v>

335
00:20:44.441 --> 00:20:49.441
<v Speaker 1>the subsidy program had expired and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I him a job at a charity and his job was</v>

336
00:20:49.721 --> 00:20:54.721
<v Speaker 1>to fold letters into three so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be put into envelopes.</v>

337
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds easy except that he also had</v>

338
00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:03.751
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a motor tremor and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took me about 30 hours to train him </v>

339
00:21:03.751 --> 00:21:08.641
<v Speaker 1>to fold up a piece of paper with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient precision so that it can be </v>

340
00:21:08.641 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 1>put in an envelope rapidly so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>envelope wasn't so mangled that it would</v>

341
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:15.190
<v Speaker 1>get stuck in the automatic sorting </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

342
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.950
<v Speaker 1>And another is high performance demands </v>
<v Speaker 1>on him too.</v>

343
00:21:17.951 --> 00:21:22.951
<v Speaker 1>He had to whip through those letters </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty quickly and then sometimes the </v>

344
00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:27.751
<v Speaker 1>letters would have a photograph </v>
<v Speaker 1>appendant to them that was stapled on </v>

345
00:21:27.751 --> 00:21:29.560
<v Speaker 1>and they weren't always stapled on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same place.</v>

346
00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:34.561
<v Speaker 1>So then he had to calculate how to fold </v>
<v Speaker 1>the paper over the photograph without </v>

347
00:21:34.561 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 1>bending the photograph in precise third </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would still fit in the envelope.</v>

348
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And then he had to separate the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters from the English letters and </v>

349
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.370
<v Speaker 1>associate them with the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>envelopes.</v>

350
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:48.860
<v Speaker 1>And like that level of complexity just </v>
<v Speaker 1>did him in it.</v>

351
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

352
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:55.050
<v Speaker 2>let me say two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is I hope common sense and the other</v>

353
00:21:55.051 --> 00:21:58.470
<v Speaker 2>is pretty provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The common sense things.</v>

354
00:21:58.471 --> 00:22:03.471
<v Speaker 2>We had to be very careful when we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these discussions not to devalue the </v>

355
00:22:04.171 --> 00:22:08.760
<v Speaker 2>human dignity of people who are in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>upper end of the distribution.</v>

356
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:14.230
<v Speaker 2>And if there's one criticism that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fair is sometimes in these conversations</v>

357
00:22:15.151 --> 00:22:20.151
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like we're devaluing people at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lower end of the distribution and we</v>

358
00:22:21.541 --> 00:22:23.730
<v Speaker 2>have to be very careful that we don't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

359
00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:29.150
<v Speaker 2>A human life has dignity and Iq is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing that defines </v>

360
00:22:30.421 --> 00:22:32.730
<v Speaker 2>human beings even</v>

361
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.200
<v Speaker 1>associated with wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily associated with </v>

362
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.500
<v Speaker 1>truth or with courage or with many </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtues that that are how great your </v>

363
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.420
<v Speaker 1>identity at all with being likable or on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychometric psychometric </v>

364
00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:52.970
<v Speaker 1>relationship between intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is zero.</v>

365
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to make that point.</v>

366
00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

367
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make the point about how </v>

368
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:03.830
<v Speaker 1>difficult it is for people who are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the low end of the cognitive spectrum to</v>

369
00:23:03.831 --> 00:23:08.831
<v Speaker 1>survive in an increasingly complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitively sophisticated environment.</v>

370
00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your obs are just disappearing.</v>

371
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

372
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Now let's ask the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything that could be done </v>

373
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.990
<v Speaker 2>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

374
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Western society has tried very hard with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number of environmental </v>

375
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:29.820
<v Speaker 2>environmentally based interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early childhood education.</v>

376
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:35.150
<v Speaker 2>By the way that you said the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The literature in organizational </v>

377
00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:40.041
<v Speaker 2>psychology is very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The literature is equally clear in </v>

378
00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:41.460
<v Speaker 2>educational psychology.</v>

379
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

380
00:23:42.291 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between Iq and learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more powerful than the relationship</v>

381
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.890
<v Speaker 2>between Iq job performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's right.</v>

382
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of common sense or matches</v>
<v Speaker 2>are common sense,</v>

383
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:57.370
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you put a bunch of variables into a </v>

384
00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.701
<v Speaker 2>regression equation to predict academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>achievement and you have all these </v>

385
00:24:00.701 --> 00:24:05.201
<v Speaker 2>school quality variables and teacher </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality variables and cognitive </v>

386
00:24:05.201 --> 00:24:09.431
<v Speaker 2>variables of the students and what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>find is that teacher variables and the </v>

387
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:16.541
<v Speaker 2>quality of the school variables together</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely account for 10 percent.</v>

388
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

389
00:24:18.531 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

390
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Talk to the guy who ran it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admissions at Harvard.</v>

391
00:24:23.191 --> 00:24:28.191
<v Speaker 1>I taught at Harvard for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was dean with law and he a </v>

392
00:24:28.191 --> 00:24:28.770
<v Speaker 1>really smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the and you know,</v>

393
00:24:28.771 --> 00:24:33.771
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say he was on the right side of </v>

394
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:36.891
<v Speaker 1>the human race and he was really trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to run the admissions </v>

395
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:39.300
<v Speaker 1>policy at Harvard so that it did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best for everyone concerned.</v>

396
00:24:39.301 --> 00:24:44.301
<v Speaker 1>And he had run an interesting series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis that I don't believe he ever </v>

397
00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:45.090
<v Speaker 1>published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them was um,</v>

398
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:50.930
<v Speaker 1>well let's say you segregate the Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 1>population into the relatively low Iq </v>

399
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.160
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they only have an Iq of 130,</v>

400
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the relatively high Iq kids who were</v>

401
00:24:55.801 --> 00:24:57.750
<v Speaker 1>pushing up towards two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>160.</v>

402
00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.450
<v Speaker 1>So you are two competing hypotheses </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

403
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.480
<v Speaker 1>One would be that the lower Iq kids come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Harvard,</v>

404
00:25:05.821 --> 00:25:08.140
<v Speaker 1>this remarkable environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they and they,</v>

405
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

406
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:14.870
<v Speaker 1>they thrive because of the high </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational quality so well that they </v>

407
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.970
<v Speaker 1>close the gap between them and the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>60 kids.</v>

408
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's just completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely wrong.</v>

409
00:25:20.221 --> 00:25:22.620
<v Speaker 1>What happens is you put both those </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

410
00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:26.460
<v Speaker 1>they're both very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very highly selected,</v>

411
00:25:26.461 --> 00:25:27.610
<v Speaker 1>but some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

412
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.420
<v Speaker 1>in this sort of superman rage </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually,</v>

413
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 1>what happens is the gap just gets bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bigger as they progress through </v>

414
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.440
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a dreaded example of that,</v>

415
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>matthew principle that the economists </v>

416
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.991
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is no to those who have more will </v>

417
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:45.720
<v Speaker 1>be given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from those who have nothing,</v>

418
00:25:45.721 --> 00:25:47.880
<v Speaker 1>everything will be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

419
00:25:47.881 --> 00:25:52.881
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder people disliked this </v>

420
00:25:52.881 --> 00:25:52.881
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>

421
00:25:52.881 --> 00:25:56.130
<v Speaker 1>it's so anti egalitarianism and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential and it's essential structure.</v>

422
00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I wanted to make a second point </v>

423
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.540
<v Speaker 2>that I said would be provocative if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do something about this.</v>

424
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

425
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.970
<v Speaker 2>we tried a bunch of interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earnest,</v>

426
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.060
<v Speaker 2>well funded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long term interventions don't seem to </v>

427
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.611
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but neuro science has been excluded from</v>

428
00:26:15.981 --> 00:26:20.981
<v Speaker 2>discussions about what to do about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that neuroscience progress</v>

429
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:26.711
<v Speaker 2>in neuroscience research has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential to really dramatically </v>

430
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.010
<v Speaker 2>increase the g factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

431
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:37.090
<v Speaker 2>that's an optimistic statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure looking forward to some </v>

432
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.211
<v Speaker 2>support for that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's optimistic and reversal and you </v>

433
00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:42.470
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as a thought experiment,</v>

434
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 2>and I can tell you why I believe this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

435
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.520
<v Speaker 2>What will first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I tell you the thought </v>

436
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.361
<v Speaker 2>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason I'm optimistic is that it is </v>

437
00:26:53.361 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 2>because of the high heritability of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>g factor.</v>

438
00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 2>That means your genes are involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gene's work through biology,</v>

439
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 2>even if the environment interacts with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

440
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 2>But basically you have a neuro </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological system.</v>

441
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:11.100
<v Speaker 2>It's complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as you begin to understand it,</v>

442
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you can tweak it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what all medicine is doing now.</v>

443
00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:20.061
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to understand the neural </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology slash genetic basis of our </v>

444
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:25.050
<v Speaker 2>health and our diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why so they can fix it.</v>

445
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.090
<v Speaker 2>When you go to the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going because you were biology is</v>

446
00:27:30.091 --> 00:27:34.120
<v Speaker 2>broken and you love your biology fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

447
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:39.130
<v Speaker 2>let's think about the brain now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one conceptualized as low Iq as a </v>

448
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:44.541
<v Speaker 2>disease and it's a little dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to the extent to which low Iq has </v>

449
00:27:46.451 --> 00:27:51.451
<v Speaker 2>the genetic input or genetic influence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the extent to which you might be </v>

450
00:27:52.201 --> 00:27:55.300
<v Speaker 2>able to to find out how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that,</v>

451
00:27:55.410 --> 00:28:00.410
<v Speaker 2>what that system is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then figure out how to tweak that </v>

452
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:04.191
<v Speaker 2>system to increase Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not science fiction.</v>

453
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a plausible sequence of events.</v>

454
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.940
<v Speaker 2>What the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very complex sequence,</v>

455
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.400
<v Speaker 2>but I also think it's a finite set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

456
00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:20.700
<v Speaker 2>not an infinite set of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the physicists,</v>

457
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:26.630
<v Speaker 2>physicists configure out what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the first nanoseconds of the big </v>

458
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:32.301
<v Speaker 2>bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can certainly figure out what the </v>

459
00:28:32.301 --> 00:28:36.150
<v Speaker 2>neural biology of intellect and how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweak it.</v>

460
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.350
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now let's,</v>

461
00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 2>let's do a thought experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's imagine there's an icu pill and I </v>

462
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:48.280
<v Speaker 2>mean that metaphorically not really </v>
<v Speaker 2>appealing.</v>

463
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:53.330
<v Speaker 2>You could take like putting a floor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like having fluoridated water just </v>

464
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:59.541
<v Speaker 2>kind of raises the dental health of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody would be nice if we had that </v>

465
00:28:59.541 --> 00:29:04.220
<v Speaker 2>for Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just to imagine what it would be </v>

466
00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.041
<v Speaker 2>like if we shifted the distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iq 15 points into the high end so that </v>

467
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:15.171
<v Speaker 2>now the average Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand how it was computed and </v>

468
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:20.240
<v Speaker 2>norming and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is that no one would have </v>

469
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:20.760
<v Speaker 2>an Iq less than 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

470
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:26.420
<v Speaker 2>What would the world be like if everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>could reason sufficiently to get a </v>

471
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.750
<v Speaker 2>reasonable job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

472
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:32.400
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

473
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:33.450
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

474
00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:38.610
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call the perverse part of</v>

475
00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:41.260
<v Speaker 2>me as funny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking to one of my graduate</v>

476
00:29:41.261 --> 00:29:41.830
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>

477
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:47.790
<v Speaker 1>We'd be looking at the determinants of </v>
<v Speaker 1>male attractiveness by the personality </v>

478
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:51.090
<v Speaker 1>of female viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

479
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we found is that there are </v>

480
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:56.890
<v Speaker 1>some personality effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm extroverted,</v>

481
00:29:56.891 --> 00:30:01.891
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic women tend to rate men </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking as more attractive </v>

482
00:30:01.891 --> 00:30:03.990
<v Speaker 1>than introvert or introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less enthusiastic women.</v>

483
00:30:03.991 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

484
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:08.710
<v Speaker 1>so there are some just straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality effects,</v>

485
00:30:08.711 --> 00:30:11.710
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest effect by far we found </v>
<v Speaker 1>list the proclivity of,</v>

486
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:17.250
<v Speaker 1>of women in general to rape men as less </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive as the women's Iq increased.</v>

487
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.910
<v Speaker 1>And so the other thing that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know is what price we pay for,</v>

488
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:26.290
<v Speaker 1>for accelerated Iq from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a broader perspective,</v>

489
00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:31.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know that there is some </v>

490
00:30:31.291 --> 00:30:31.291
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell me what you think about</v>

491
00:30:31.291 --> 00:30:34.981
<v Speaker 1>this because I know that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable evidence that the average Iq </v>

492
00:30:34.991 --> 00:30:39.790
<v Speaker 1>of the Ashkenazi Jewish population is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 15 points higher than the standard</v>

493
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:44.791
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of makes it a thought </v>

494
00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:44.791
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

495
00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:44.791
<v Speaker 1>It's an experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real life experiment.</v>

496
00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:46.330
<v Speaker 1>It's equivalent to the one that you laid</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

497
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:51.630
<v Speaker 1>But aszkenazy Jews also tend to suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a host of neurological diseases </v>

498
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:53.650
<v Speaker 1>that seem to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased neuroplasticity.</v>

499
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:59.030
<v Speaker 1>And so to me it's often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often hard to gain on one front </v>

500
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 1>without losing on another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

501
00:31:00.101 --> 00:31:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the evolutionary conundrum</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

502
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:05.710
<v Speaker 1>but we call that the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

503
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.870
<v Speaker 1>If you started one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be bad and everything else </v>

504
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.040
<v Speaker 1>that kind of balanced it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably speaking,</v>

505
00:31:12.041 --> 00:31:14.860
<v Speaker 1>you do pay a price for your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your exceptionalism,</v>

506
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true because,</v>

507
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

508
00:31:18.191 --> 00:31:23.191
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Julian Stanley studies or the math </v>

509
00:31:23.191 --> 00:31:26.760
<v Speaker 1>coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids essentially found not only were </v>

510
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.100
<v Speaker 1>they smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were more mature than their age</v>

511
00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:29.140
<v Speaker 1>peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better looking,</v>

512
00:31:29.141 --> 00:31:31.420
<v Speaker 1>they were color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were physically more fit.</v>

513
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of the anti social.</v>

514
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I know that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

515
00:31:35.541 --> 00:31:40.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also might be true because one of </v>

516
00:31:40.541 --> 00:31:43.291
<v Speaker 1>the things that can interfere with Iq is</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor health and poor nutritional quality</v>

517
00:31:45.311 --> 00:31:46.070
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

518
00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:48.510
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look like it's that easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase Iq,</v>

519
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.590
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like it's pretty easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decrease it.</v>

520
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

521
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that those,</v>

522
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.570
<v Speaker 1>those things have to be pretty extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

523
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.960
<v Speaker 1>They have an effect and those effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>may not be permanent.</v>

524
00:32:01.961 --> 00:32:06.961
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some studies of deprivation of people </v>

525
00:32:06.961 --> 00:32:10.621
<v Speaker 1>who suffer suffered deprivation during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second world war that suggests that </v>

526
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Lowe's really severe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

527
00:32:14.621 --> 00:32:17.160
<v Speaker 1>deprivations didn't have lasting effects</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

528
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

529
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.400
<v Speaker 1>people were pretty tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm inclined to agree with that.</v>

530
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:24.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so have you seen any animal experiment,</v>

531
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 1>experimental work that you regard as </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling that shows something like the</v>

532
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:31.100
<v Speaker 1>transformation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of animal cognition into our,</v>

533
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.500
<v Speaker 1>into something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

534
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:37.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's higher order that you regard as </v>

535
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 1>compelling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not sure what you mean,</v>

536
00:32:37.841 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 1>but there are certainly animal that</v>

537
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:45.250
<v Speaker 2>shows you extract the g factor from </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive tests given to various </v>

538
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:45.740
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

539
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I was wondering is has there </v>

540
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.441
<v Speaker 1>been any evidence that you regard as </v>
<v Speaker 1>credible showing at that could be that </v>

541
00:32:53.441 --> 00:32:56.680
<v Speaker 1>that say so called animal g factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>extracted in the same.</v>

542
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.690
<v Speaker 1>We should tell our readers to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way you extract the g factor,</v>

543
00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say it very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly,</v>

544
00:33:01.671 --> 00:33:06.671
<v Speaker 1>is imagine you take a randomly set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randomly selected set of 200 questions </v>

545
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.670
<v Speaker 1>that require abstraction of one form or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another to solve.</v>

546
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.200
<v Speaker 1>And then can</v>

547
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:19.880
<v Speaker 2>you give those 200 questions to 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

548
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:22.370
<v Speaker 2>And you sum the scores and you rank </v>
<v Speaker 2>order them.</v>

549
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.760
<v Speaker 2>You get something that's roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent there to a g factor.</v>

550
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.810
<v Speaker 2>It's roughly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just say it a little bit differently.</v>

551
00:33:29.811 --> 00:33:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Just forever is on the same page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think of all the different mental</v>

552
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:39.731
<v Speaker 2>abilities and you devise a test for each</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them and you gave this test where</v>

553
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.230
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people across the range of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability,</v>

554
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:50.530
<v Speaker 2>what you'll find is the scores on all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those tests are positively correlated </v>

555
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:54.881
<v Speaker 2>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggesting that all tests have mental </v>

556
00:33:54.881 --> 00:33:58.391
<v Speaker 2>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have something in common that's a great </v>

557
00:33:58.391 --> 00:33:59.210
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This g factor,</v>

558
00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:04.220
<v Speaker 2>this general ability to reason and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual tests have more Gillotti men,</v>

559
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:10.690
<v Speaker 2>other individual tests and tests of </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract reasoning tend to be highly </v>

560
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.100
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said to you,</v>

561
00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.930
<v Speaker 2>repeat the following numbers back to me.</v>

562
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

563
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:21.800
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

564
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:23.360
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>

565
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:29.060
<v Speaker 2>That's not a very highly loaded mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to be able to do that.</v>

566
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.390
<v Speaker 2>But if I gave you a streamline that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

567
00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:36.410
<v Speaker 2>repeat them to me backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a g loaded ability because </v>

568
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.850
<v Speaker 2>the transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

569
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:44.020
<v Speaker 2>the other thing to say about that too is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a positive relationship between </v>

570
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.660
<v Speaker 2>that stems multiple assessments that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>described is actually quite high.</v>

571
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing is that that general </v>

572
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.320
<v Speaker 2>factor not only exists across domains of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive ability,</v>

573
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:57.210
<v Speaker 2>but it tends to account for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantial amount of the,</v>

574
00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.080
<v Speaker 2>have the ability in each of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>domains,</v>

575
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like Regina is kind of like</v>

576
00:35:02.481 --> 00:35:06.380
<v Speaker 2>a black hole for intelligence research </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything keeps falling into it.</v>

577
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's an interesting way to put it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because now we have these,</v>

578
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:15.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>junior association studies that are </v>

579
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.721
<v Speaker 2>finding these bits of DNA that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>related to either latent factor of </v>

580
00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:27.161
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the g factor or two what they </v>

581
00:35:27.161 --> 00:35:31.001
<v Speaker 2>call educational attainment variable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So school attainment is so highly </v>

582
00:35:31.001 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 2>correlated with Iq and that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially the same thing.</v>

583
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.180
<v Speaker 2>So we're really moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in graduate school,</v>

584
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:44.420
<v Speaker 2>the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a genetic component to </v>

585
00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:44.420
<v Speaker 2>intelligence or not?</v>

586
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:51.350
<v Speaker 2>This kind of DNA analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find bits of DNA that are </v>

587
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:57.460
<v Speaker 2>going to be related to what we call a </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence or Iq testing or,</v>

588
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the g factor,</v>

589
00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:03.290
<v Speaker 2>and they seem to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There seems to be hundreds of them.</v>

590
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.870
<v Speaker 2>A tiny effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

591
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:10.920
<v Speaker 2>which will make the ultimate story are </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely complicated.</v>

592
00:36:10.921 --> 00:36:15.921
<v Speaker 2>But as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a finite set of problems </v>

593
00:36:15.921 --> 00:36:19.480
<v Speaker 2>right at the end of that sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>solving those problems.</v>

594
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a good chance we'll know</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to increase Iq and I think it's a </v>

595
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 2>good thing to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

596
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I had said publicly that more </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence is better than less.</v>

597
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I get criticized because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>implies that people with less </v>

598
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.291
<v Speaker 2>intelligence aren't as worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I want to be very careful </v>

599
00:36:42.291 --> 00:36:46.401
<v Speaker 2>that I don't believe that is more of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate way of thinking about it and in</v>

600
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.540
<v Speaker 2>a narrow range of possibilities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities.</v>

601
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in my view,</v>

602
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:58.401
<v Speaker 2>my political biases there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments have a moral responsibility </v>

603
00:36:59.491 --> 00:37:01.380
<v Speaker 2>to help those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

604
00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.120
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

605
00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of government programs are,</v>

606
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:10.790
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to do it because your job </v>
<v Speaker 2>training requires a certain level of uh,</v>

607
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:12.040
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so</v>

608
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Iq clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to go to the government </v>

609
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:18.760
<v Speaker 1>agencies that were designed to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>people find employment and you know,</v>

610
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:23.770
<v Speaker 1>the typical response was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well just go home and type up your CV </v>

611
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:24.820
<v Speaker 1>and distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

612
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.040
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't use a computer.</v>

613
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to CV is,</v>

614
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nonstarter and all three </v>

615
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.000
<v Speaker 1>councils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

616
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.080
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the United States there are 51 </v>

617
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.690
<v Speaker 2>million people with iqs under 85 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there were about 43 million people </v>

618
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:47.271
<v Speaker 2>living in poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think those Venn diagrams </v>

619
00:37:47.271 --> 00:37:47.420
<v Speaker 2>intersect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

620
00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.840
<v Speaker 2>we should also be clear about that</v>

621
00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:53.710
<v Speaker 1>because it is so politically suspect is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not like it's,</v>

622
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

623
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.200
<v Speaker 1>it's self evident that people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>less cognitive capability are likely to </v>

624
00:38:05.141 --> 00:38:10.141
<v Speaker 1>end up poor because there a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex problems in life that beset them</v>

625
00:38:11.291 --> 00:38:14.800
<v Speaker 1>that they have a difficult time dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and they can't learn as quickly.</v>

626
00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And so the relationship between poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and intelligence is self evident if </v>

627
00:38:20.411 --> 00:38:22.840
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to think it through for </v>
<v Speaker 1>any length of time.</v>

628
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that everybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich that is.</v>

629
00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:30.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that everyone who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich is smart and it doesn't mean that </v>

630
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.480
<v Speaker 1>everyone who is poor is stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it took to be blunt.</v>

631
00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:36.730
<v Speaker 1>But what it mean is that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

632
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>financially successful.</v>

633
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:42.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was the Hertenstein </v>
<v Speaker 1>Herrnstein and Murray.</v>

634
00:38:42.011 --> 00:38:47.011
<v Speaker 1>I think the calculations back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bell curve that indicated that if you </v>

635
00:38:47.011 --> 00:38:51.990
<v Speaker 1>imagined that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a fairy godmother and you have </v>

636
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:56.580
<v Speaker 1>your newborn grandchild in front of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can grant them three standard </v>

637
00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.991
<v Speaker 1>deviations above the mean in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth at birth.</v>

638
00:39:01.061 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Or you can grant them three standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviations above the mean in terms of Iq</v>

639
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:10.501
<v Speaker 1>at birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you wanted to determine which </v>

640
00:39:10.501 --> 00:39:10.990
<v Speaker 1>would work better for them by the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were 40.</v>

641
00:39:10.991 --> 00:39:14.530
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that was quite clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that Iq trump's wealth,</v>

642
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:20.090
<v Speaker 1>terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's related to predict a positive </v>

643
00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:20.090
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

644
00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:24.040
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I'm so interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>concept of increasing Iq or increasing </v>

645
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.610
<v Speaker 2>the g factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just the Iq score,</v>

646
00:39:30.611 --> 00:39:33.130
<v Speaker 2>but really what Andre this reasoning </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability.</v>

647
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:38.460
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people have tried to teach college </v>

648
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.101
<v Speaker 2>students critical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good thing if you can </v>

649
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.160
<v Speaker 2>think critically so much the better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

650
00:39:45.161 --> 00:39:46.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

651
00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:49.360
<v Speaker 2>it may sound to your listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to take a moment out here.</v>

652
00:39:49.361 --> 00:39:54.361
<v Speaker 2>It may sound to your listeners like here</v>
<v Speaker 2>are these two guys pontificating about </v>

653
00:39:54.361 --> 00:39:56.230
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to be smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so smart.</v>

654
00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean the point of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point of neuroscience research,</v>

655
00:40:01.391 --> 00:40:06.391
<v Speaker 2>all intelligence and what I hope to </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve by writing the book was to show </v>

656
00:40:06.391 --> 00:40:09.940
<v Speaker 2>that that the genetic aspects are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>deterministic.</v>

657
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.440
<v Speaker 2>It's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So probabilistic,</v>

658
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:19.600
<v Speaker 2>so the extent to which something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence is genetic in my view,</v>

659
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:23.910
<v Speaker 2>is the extent to which we'll learn how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to change it for the better.</v>

660
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Well that's definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

661
00:40:24.971 --> 00:40:29.971
<v Speaker 1>because people do tend to think about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological factors as deterministic in </v>

662
00:40:29.971 --> 00:40:31.720
<v Speaker 1>that that's a mistake because they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be shifted.</v>

663
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

664
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.780
<v Speaker 2>with regards to the animal study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

665
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:38.260
<v Speaker 2>you pointed out that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can come up with an Iq like estimate</v>

666
00:40:38.261 --> 00:40:43.261
<v Speaker 2>for say a rat and have you seen anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that indicates I don't care how it's </v>

667
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:48.691
<v Speaker 2>done through training or or or </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurochemically or or or by promoting </v>

668
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.480
<v Speaker 2>brain function in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However you might do it.</v>

669
00:40:52.481 --> 00:40:57.481
<v Speaker 2>That's actually indicated to you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a way of biologically enhancing</v>

670
00:40:57.641 --> 00:41:02.641
<v Speaker 2>the general cognitive ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even have an animal has anything </v>

671
00:41:02.641 --> 00:41:06.510
<v Speaker 2>credible just by breeding mice in a maze</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster than other mice.</v>

672
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Together you get mice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed to be able to learn how to run</v>

673
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:17.761
<v Speaker 2>a maze faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's work from the 19 eighties or </v>

674
00:41:17.761 --> 00:41:21.610
<v Speaker 2>review this in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some interesting technologies </v>

675
00:41:23.861 --> 00:41:28.861
<v Speaker 2>that have been developed where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn parts of a rat brain on and off at </v>

676
00:41:31.601 --> 00:41:36.470
<v Speaker 2>will and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not yet been applied as far as I</v>

677
00:41:36.471 --> 00:41:41.471
<v Speaker 2>know to learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but interestingly there are human </v>

678
00:41:42.141 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 2>studies underway with things like that.</v>

679
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:51.120
<v Speaker 3>A trans cranial magnetic stimulation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>electrical</v>

680
00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:56.340
<v Speaker 2>ways to low voltage ways to stimulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the brain.</v>

681
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
<v Speaker 2>And there are some interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments now being done with humans </v>

682
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.130
<v Speaker 2>to see if you can improve learning or </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasoning ability benefactor,</v>

683
00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I edit this journal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the following colleges,</v>

684
00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of a prime spot for </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence researchers to publish on </v>

685
00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:19.310
<v Speaker 2>all aspects of intelligence and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just starting to put together a special </v>

686
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:24.051
<v Speaker 2>issue on human experiments to increase </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasoning ability using these,</v>

687
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.410
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

688
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 2>techniques of stimulating the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen some positive things with </v>

689
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.601
<v Speaker 2>regards to low level electrical </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulation because that's also been </v>

690
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:35.601
<v Speaker 2>used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more,</v>

691
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:38.160
<v Speaker 2>it's more anecdotal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a bit of research being used</v>

692
00:42:38.161 --> 00:42:39.870
<v Speaker 2>to treat depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

693
00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do cover in the book the studies </v>

694
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:48.891
<v Speaker 2>that were published up until the time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote the book and caution people that </v>

695
00:42:48.901 --> 00:42:51.140
<v Speaker 2>they hadn't been replicated yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

696
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:52.170
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

697
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.240
<v Speaker 2>But we're on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

698
00:42:54.241 --> 00:42:56.880
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an evolving area that's going to</v>

699
00:42:56.881 --> 00:42:58.360
<v Speaker 2>be very exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

700
00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:03.370
<v Speaker 2>if students are listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast and we're thinking about </v>

701
00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:04.410
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience or psychology,</v>

702
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.040
<v Speaker 3>this kind of experiment is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

703
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:12.070
<v Speaker 3>is really a new phase of intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>research where you can do experiments on</v>

704
00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:16.280
<v Speaker 3>human beings that are completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical,</v>

705
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and relatively non intrusive,</v>

706
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

707
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.730
<v Speaker 3>and this is really going to change </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything because it will shift</v>

708
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.180
<v Speaker 2>intelligence research firm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically psychometric correlations past</v>

709
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:36.250
<v Speaker 2>what neuro imaging has done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

710
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:41.990
<v Speaker 2>which really moved it away from just </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle metrics and then correlating </v>

711
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:46.661
<v Speaker 2>psychometric scores with measurable </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of the brain like coast </v>

712
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:52.211
<v Speaker 2>metabolic function or the amount of gray</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter or white matter or the number of </v>

713
00:43:52.211 --> 00:43:53.390
<v Speaker 2>white matter fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

714
00:43:53.391 --> 00:43:55.380
<v Speaker 2>we're all these fabulous connections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

715
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Was this new thing I got in early on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that things.</v>

716
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:05.050
<v Speaker 2>But that phase is now moving into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>new phase of actually stimulating the </v>

717
00:44:06.171 --> 00:44:11.171
<v Speaker 2>brain to improve learning and memory and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasoning and all the while doing it </v>

718
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.410
<v Speaker 2>with neuroimaging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

719
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:21.410
<v Speaker 2>See what happens and adding DNA to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

720
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.080
<v Speaker 2>come on now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a great time.</v>

721
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Entering the research in this area,</v>

722
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:27.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

723
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some optimism on the rise.</v>

724
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:30.880
<v Speaker 2>I looked for a</v>

725
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.030
<v Speaker 1>because I've been very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>improving human performance,</v>

726
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:41.031
<v Speaker 1>measuring it and improving it and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked and and doing that also in </v>

727
00:44:41.761 --> 00:44:46.761
<v Speaker 1>conjunction with businesses because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like things to have a practical end and </v>

728
00:44:46.761 --> 00:44:50.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked to find out what the research </v>

729
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.140
<v Speaker 1>indicated with regards to improvement of</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and mostly what I found was</v>

730
00:44:52.141 --> 00:44:57.141
<v Speaker 1>not so much improvement as conservation </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you exercise both aerobically</v>

731
00:44:58.231 --> 00:45:03.231
<v Speaker 1>and and with weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that can help you maintain your </v>

732
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.560
<v Speaker 1>fluid intelligence across for longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>across your lifespan because it tends to</v>

733
00:45:07.561 --> 00:45:12.561
<v Speaker 1>decline rather precipitously as you age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the more dismal things </v>

734
00:45:12.561 --> 00:45:16.611
<v Speaker 1>that you also discovered with Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>research and starts to decline when </v>

735
00:45:16.611 --> 00:45:20.091
<v Speaker 1>you're in your early twenties and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a linear downhill all the way </v>

736
00:45:20.091 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But exercise really helps</v>

737
00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:27.780
<v Speaker 2>it's preservation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty important that my </v>

738
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.270
<v Speaker 2>participation is a big deal man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But enhancement would be good,</v>

739
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:36.750
<v Speaker 2>but you know this thing about an icu </v>
<v Speaker 2>pill coming up with a way to manipulate </v>

740
00:45:37.781 --> 00:45:42.781
<v Speaker 2>your bio on the neurobiology of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain regarding intellect.</v>

741
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:49.110
<v Speaker 2>If there's a breakthrough in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will come either from Alzheimer's </v>

742
00:45:49.391 --> 00:45:52.570
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more hormonal aging research,</v>

743
00:45:52.571 --> 00:45:57.571
<v Speaker 2>trying to prevent the slow decline of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mental faculties as you age,</v>

744
00:45:57.611 --> 00:45:59.500
<v Speaker 2>especially fluid intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

745
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or trying to reverse the ravages of </v>

746
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:08.761
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are neurochemical problems right </v>

747
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:09.720
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

748
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Tightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly linked to,</v>

749
00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:18.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another thing we can talk about </v>

750
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:18.450
<v Speaker 1>because so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

751
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I know that there are certain biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>markers that Iq is loosely associated </v>

752
00:46:23.641 --> 00:46:24.630
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

753
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:28.440
<v Speaker 1>it's fragmented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It predicts in a fragmentary matters.</v>

754
00:46:28.441 --> 00:46:31.740
<v Speaker 1>So I know that even something as simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>as simple reaction time,</v>

755
00:46:31.741 --> 00:46:36.240
<v Speaker 1>how fast you can push a button when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>light comes on is correlated with Iq,</v>

756
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:38.580
<v Speaker 1>with fluid intelligence at about point </v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

757
00:46:38.581 --> 00:46:42.270
<v Speaker 1>and I'm having a bigger head is slightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlated,</v>

758
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:47.300
<v Speaker 1>especially when you correct for body </v>
<v Speaker 1>size and so his brain mass and so is </v>

759
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.570
<v Speaker 1>thickness of the Myelin Sheath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an individual neurons.</v>

760
00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:53.760
<v Speaker 1>So there are these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these micro markers of.</v>

761
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:59.060
<v Speaker 1>You might think about them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological integrity that seemed to </v>

762
00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.761
<v Speaker 1>predict Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've been doing neuroimaging and </v>

763
00:47:01.761 --> 00:47:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't looked at that for a couple of</v>

764
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:06.950
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what have the neuro imagers found </v>

765
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:10.100
<v Speaker 1>about brain structure and function in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to intelligence that you </v>

766
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.310
<v Speaker 1>think is compelling and interesting?</v>

767
00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:16.980
<v Speaker 2>Glad you asked this because as I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>finishing the manuscript for the book,</v>

768
00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.330
<v Speaker 2>literally</v>

769
00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:26.110
<v Speaker 3>after I turned it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to ask for it back because there </v>

770
00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:28.880
<v Speaker 3>was this very interesting study </v>
<v Speaker 3>published by a group at Yale that has,</v>

771
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:34.170
<v Speaker 3>that used a fairly sophisticated way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at white matter connection,</v>

772
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.440
<v Speaker 2>functional structural white matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections and functional connections </v>

773
00:47:42.541 --> 00:47:44.300
<v Speaker 2>in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

774
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:50.390
<v Speaker 2>and determining how one brain area is </v>
<v Speaker 2>functionally or structuring structurally</v>

775
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:57.800
<v Speaker 2>related to all other brain areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can put up a map of,</v>

776
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:04.410
<v Speaker 2>of a person's brain that shows from </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain imaging,</v>

777
00:48:04.411 --> 00:48:09.360
<v Speaker 2>from MRI technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how their brain is interconnected.</v>

778
00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:15.260
<v Speaker 2>This paper said these inner connections </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so reliable within a person that </v>

779
00:48:17.611 --> 00:48:21.990
<v Speaker 2>they're like fingerprints and not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

780
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.180
<v Speaker 2>but the fingerprints can predict Iq,</v>

781
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:30.180
<v Speaker 1>the density of connections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>density of interconnections or something</v>

782
00:48:30.181 --> 00:48:35.181
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is there something more specific </v>

783
00:48:35.181 --> 00:48:35.181
<v Speaker 1>going on?</v>

784
00:48:35.181 --> 00:48:36.960
<v Speaker 2>It can be the density of connections </v>
<v Speaker 2>structurally.</v>

785
00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:41.100
<v Speaker 2>How much white matter connects this area</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that area,</v>

786
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:46.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are certain brain areas where </v>

787
00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.921
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of white matter coming in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of white matter going out to </v>

788
00:48:48.921 --> 00:48:52.551
<v Speaker 2>other parts of the brain that are called</v>
<v Speaker 2>hubs and there are nodes that have </v>

789
00:48:53.191 --> 00:48:58.191
<v Speaker 2>lesser connections and so it makes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly makes sense that being able to</v>

790
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:05.030
<v Speaker 2>make measurements of brain activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be related to things like </v>

791
00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:07.220
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

792
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.580
<v Speaker 1>do you remember what some of the major </v>
<v Speaker 1>hubs we're like,</v>

793
00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:13.940
<v Speaker 1>are they identifiable as also as </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroanatomical areas with specific?</v>

794
00:49:13.941 --> 00:49:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

795
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Countries definitely neuro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no anatomical areas and they're white,</v>

796
00:49:23.611 --> 00:49:26.760
<v Speaker 2>you might expect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>

797
00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.730
<v Speaker 2>What was exciting to me is they mapped </v>
<v Speaker 2>on to a,</v>

798
00:49:30.731 --> 00:49:35.731
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a model of brain intelligence </v>

799
00:49:35.731 --> 00:49:39.201
<v Speaker 2>relationships that I had developed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my colleague rex young and published in </v>

800
00:49:39.871 --> 00:49:44.871
<v Speaker 2>2007 and it was called the parietal </v>
<v Speaker 2>frontal integration theory of </v>

801
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:53.060
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that the connections </v>

802
00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:56.511
<v Speaker 2>between the parietal lobe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is here and the frontal area,</v>

803
00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:00.750
<v Speaker 2>are the key connections for </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

804
00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell us why you derive that particular </v>

805
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:06.260
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

806
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:10.331
<v Speaker 1>people have suggested say alternatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the seat of higher order </v>

807
00:50:10.331 --> 00:50:14.861
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is basically let's say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or </v>

808
00:50:14.861 --> 00:50:17.300
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why specifically the connection,</v>

809
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:21.170
<v Speaker 1>the connection patterns between frontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Parietal area was.</v>

810
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this article in 2007 was a review </v>

811
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:30.141
<v Speaker 2>article where we took every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>imaging study we could find that </v>

812
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:34.940
<v Speaker 2>included a measure of intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there were 37 such studies at the time,</v>

813
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:40.630
<v Speaker 2>including some I had done as early as </v>
<v Speaker 2>1988 and others had done with much </v>

814
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:45.191
<v Speaker 2>larger samples and we just kinda </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualitatively analyze the results to see</v>

815
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:51.791
<v Speaker 2>what brain areas came up in common </v>
<v Speaker 2>across these studies using different </v>

816
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:54.710
<v Speaker 2>measures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different imaging techniques.</v>

817
00:50:55.100 --> 00:51:00.100
<v Speaker 2>And we found that there was not an that </v>
<v Speaker 2>not all brain areas were equally </v>

818
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:05.771
<v Speaker 2>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tended to be concentrated in the </v>

819
00:51:05.771 --> 00:51:08.510
<v Speaker 2>front and the parietal lobe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also we found areas in the occipital</v>

820
00:51:08.511 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 2>lobe and the temporal lobe that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>also related to intelligence.</v>

821
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:17.980
<v Speaker 2>And so we developed this model that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about how information would be </v>

822
00:51:18.021 --> 00:51:23.021
<v Speaker 2>processed and how information would flow</v>
<v Speaker 2>around this set of.</v>

823
00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I think there were 18 areas all </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesize,</v>

824
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:35.530
<v Speaker 2>scored high on intelligence tests would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have some combination of these areas.</v>

825
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.060
<v Speaker 2>You didn't need all of them kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>working together,</v>

826
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.820
<v Speaker 2>but some people would have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination,</v>

827
00:51:40.821 --> 00:51:45.821
<v Speaker 2>some people will have that combination </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you can make measurements of </v>

828
00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:50.850
<v Speaker 2>about the way information was flowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>around these areas with technology like </v>

829
00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:56.471
<v Speaker 2>there may be ground which shows changes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the brain millisecond by millisecond </v>

830
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:03.520
<v Speaker 2>that you might be able to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimate Iq from Brighton images.</v>

831
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Two Thousand and seven people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do this with multiple </v>

832
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.300
<v Speaker 2>regression equations that never really </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicated.</v>

833
00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:16.301
<v Speaker 2>Independent replications didn't go very </v>
<v Speaker 2>far because the sample sizes were </v>

834
00:52:16.301 --> 00:52:18.800
<v Speaker 2>relatively small and you have enormous </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual differences,</v>

835
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:24.430
<v Speaker 2>but these newer techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these mathematical techniques of </v>

836
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:28.571
<v Speaker 2>calculating brain conductivity really </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to have advanced this whole thing.</v>

837
00:52:29.151 --> 00:52:34.151
<v Speaker 2>Dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there a map between the nodes that </v>

838
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:37.781
<v Speaker 2>were identified in this more recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>research in the areas that you guys had </v>

839
00:52:37.781 --> 00:52:38.450
<v Speaker 2>identified with your overarching </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis?</v>

840
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to to the way,</v>

841
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:46.540
<v Speaker 2>and I looked at the data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like there was considerable </v>

842
00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:50.711
<v Speaker 2>overlap and some of the authors who we </v>
<v Speaker 2>did not know personally when they wrote </v>

843
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:56.021
<v Speaker 2>their papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>noted that the findings were consistent </v>

844
00:52:56.021 --> 00:52:59.060
<v Speaker 2>with our model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any hemispheric differences?</v>

845
00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.430
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

846
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:06.490
<v Speaker 2>there were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were more on the left than on the </v>

847
00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.681
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were also areas on the right </v>

848
00:53:08.681 --> 00:53:11.830
<v Speaker 2>as well and these areas tend to be areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are also related to a language and </v>

849
00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:21.581
<v Speaker 2>memory and attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More fundamental cognitive processes of </v>

850
00:53:24.351 --> 00:53:28.470
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory and attention seem to be the the,</v>

851
00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:31.020
<v Speaker 2>the architecture on which intelligence</v>

852
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:37.150
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question that I haven't been </v>

853
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:39.281
<v Speaker 1>able to figure out because I've looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the attention literature lot and the </v>

854
00:53:39.281 --> 00:53:43.361
<v Speaker 1>more I look at the attention literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more I find it difficult to </v>

855
00:53:43.361 --> 00:53:44.150
<v Speaker 1>distinguish it from the intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

856
00:53:44.151 --> 00:53:49.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean attention and intelligence seemed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be different things and we certainly </v>

857
00:53:49.151 --> 00:53:50.540
<v Speaker 1>use the words in common parlance as </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

858
00:53:50.541 --> 00:53:55.541
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't really been able to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you wanted to establish a </v>

859
00:53:55.541 --> 00:53:59.951
<v Speaker 1>battery of attention related tests that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were independent of Ge loaded a </v>

860
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:06.130
<v Speaker 1>cognitive abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen anybody manage that and </v>

861
00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:06.530
<v Speaker 1>so do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

862
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:10.460
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the difference is </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the capacity to pay attention,</v>

863
00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:13.760
<v Speaker 1>which also seems to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness by the way,</v>

864
00:54:13.761 --> 00:54:18.761
<v Speaker 1>which isn't associated with Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean what's the relationship </v>

865
00:54:18.761 --> 00:54:22.931
<v Speaker 1>between intention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and intelligence as far as </v>

866
00:54:22.931 --> 00:54:22.931
<v Speaker 1>you're concerned,</v>

867
00:54:22.931 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 2>so studies have been done where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>take cognitive variables,</v>

868
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 2>elemental cognitive tasks is what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>call them,</v>

869
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:33.150
<v Speaker 2>the real basic things that cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists like to study,</v>

870
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:38.910
<v Speaker 2>like the study reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they all studied wanting in memory,</v>

871
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:43.760
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want to address why some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people learn faster than other people or</v>

872
00:54:43.761 --> 00:54:46.410
<v Speaker 2>why some people can remember more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

873
00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 2>That's a cognitive psychologist study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They studied what's common to everybody,</v>

874
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:56.180
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at these elemental </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive tasks so you can extracted a </v>

875
00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:00.201
<v Speaker 2>Jew factor of cognition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is highly correlated with a </v>

876
00:55:00.201 --> 00:55:04.570
<v Speaker 2>psychometric sure abilities more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

877
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Memory aspects of memory are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlated to the gene factor.</v>

878
00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.210
<v Speaker 2>A processing speed is correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

879
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:19.600
<v Speaker 2>and the tension is also correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of have this idea from being a</v>

880
00:55:22.471 --> 00:55:27.471
<v Speaker 2>parent watching my kids grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people differ in their baseline of </v>

881
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 2>attention when they're not specifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying attention.</v>

882
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.230
<v Speaker 2>This might be called consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

883
00:55:38.231 --> 00:55:43.231
<v Speaker 2>you have two kids walking through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>museum for an hour and you come out and </v>

884
00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:44.340
<v Speaker 2>you're saying the kid one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why did you see?</v>

885
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:47.720
<v Speaker 2>And you get a whole long thing and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other kid.</v>

886
00:55:47.721 --> 00:55:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you see there?</v>

887
00:55:48.901 --> 00:55:53.340
<v Speaker 2>And you'd get a much was rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation.</v>

888
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of what I've always thought about that </v>

889
00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:00.360
<v Speaker 2>as a difference in resolution of worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

890
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:01.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call what you will,</v>

891
00:56:01.621 --> 00:56:04.170
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are these differences.</v>

892
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:05.420
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

893
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:10.430
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've actually studied consciousness </v>

894
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.430
<v Speaker 2>with brain imaging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

895
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:13.020
<v Speaker 2>with my friend Mike outlier who's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>anesthesiologist.</v>

896
00:56:13.021 --> 00:56:18.021
<v Speaker 2>We did the first imaging studies where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we brought normal volunteers in and Mike</v>

897
00:56:20.761 --> 00:56:25.761
<v Speaker 2>gave them a anesthetic drugs to knock </v>
<v Speaker 2>them out completely.</v>

898
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 2>They underwent brain imaging and we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>different levels of anesthesia.</v>

899
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:35.641
<v Speaker 2>We were trying to see what part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain is the last part of the brain to </v>

900
00:56:35.641 --> 00:56:36.830
<v Speaker 2>turn off when you lose consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're than</v>

901
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 1>did you find anything that you can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense out of from that?</v>

902
00:56:40.121 --> 00:56:45.121
<v Speaker 1>Because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's obviously an extraordinarily </v>

903
00:56:45.121 --> 00:56:47.521
<v Speaker 1>interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immediately the collapse of these </v>

904
00:56:47.521 --> 00:56:47.521
<v Speaker 1>networks is</v>

905
00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:52.660
<v Speaker 2>just the real expert on the whole series</v>
<v Speaker 2>of papers that the mechanism of </v>

906
00:56:52.691 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is still one of the Great </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobel prize winning.</v>

907
00:56:56.970 --> 00:56:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

908
00:56:57.490 --> 00:57:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my interpretation of literature </v>

909
00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:02.490
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

910
00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:02.490
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

911
00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:07.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a mystery that it seems </v>

912
00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:07.080
<v Speaker 1>uncrackable in some sense.</v>

913
00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was good about the imaging stuff?</v>

914
00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.840
<v Speaker 2>You could study this experimentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

915
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:12.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

916
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:17.050
<v Speaker 2>you could put people into different </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of consciousness and burning them</v>

917
00:57:17.051 --> 00:57:21.460
<v Speaker 2>out at will and seeing what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the brain reacted.</v>

918
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:24.700
<v Speaker 2>So the Thalamus seems to be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

919
00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:27.010
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found those connections,</v>

920
00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:29.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and each anesthetic,</v>

921
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:32.800
<v Speaker 2>there are categories of anesthetics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't.</v>

922
00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:35.740
<v Speaker 2>They have different mechanisms of action</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the brain,</v>

923
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:41.010
<v Speaker 2>yet they all produce the same a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence when you purchased this,</v>

924
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:46.830
<v Speaker 1>that's a very interesting thing to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does it,</v>

925
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:50.740
<v Speaker 1>cortical thalamic loops will mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named,</v>

926
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:53.680
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

927
00:57:53.681 --> 00:57:55.490
<v Speaker 1>it's close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid to.</v>

928
00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gotten it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He suggests that I'm one of the,</v>

929
00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:04.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the consequences of psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs is to decrease the gating of the </v>

930
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:11.130
<v Speaker 1>thalamic cortical circuitry and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that's one of the mechanisms </v>

931
00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:15.160
<v Speaker 1>whereby that expanded at least sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness emerges as a constantly,</v>

932
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:15.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

933
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.300
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of experimentation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

934
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 1>with the psychedelic end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical universe.</v>

935
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a section where I talk about </v>

936
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:30.540
<v Speaker 2>consciousness studies and try to relate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the concept that if you can turn </v>

937
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:36.841
<v Speaker 2>consciousness off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to turn it on.</v>

938
00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:42.590
<v Speaker 2>No anesthesiologists do this at will eop</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they don't understand what </v>

939
00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:43.650
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

940
00:58:43.651 --> 00:58:44.820
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

941
00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:47.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

942
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:52.390
<v Speaker 2>they can't tell you why it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then can you use if,</v>

943
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:58.070
<v Speaker 2>if anesthetic drugs had to dissociate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain and creativity seems to be </v>

944
00:59:02.221 --> 00:59:07.221
<v Speaker 2>related to a dissociation of the frontal</v>
<v Speaker 2>lobes can lower doses,</v>

945
00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:14.210
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very low doses of anesthetic drugs </v>

946
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:18.160
<v Speaker 2>caused just enough dis inhibition to </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase your creativity.</v>

947
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.370
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think this experiment has </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been done.</v>

948
00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:29.460
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see something similar in that </v>

949
00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:29.970
<v Speaker 1>sometimes reported with people who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed frontal temporal dementia at.</v>

950
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

951
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

952
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.220
<v Speaker 1>that's a very strange phenomenon where </v>
<v Speaker 1>as your brain deteriorates,</v>

953
00:59:36.221 --> 00:59:41.221
<v Speaker 1>your creativity increases because so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of brain function seems to be </v>

954
00:59:41.221 --> 00:59:41.221
<v Speaker 1>inhibitory.</v>

955
00:59:41.221 --> 00:59:46.080
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if a comparable disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>that produces increases in intelligence,</v>

956
00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

957
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:49.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of that.</v>

958
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that's been,</v>

959
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:52.910
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell me what you think about this.</v>

960
00:59:52.911 --> 00:59:57.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was curious for awhile about these </v>

961
00:59:57.911 --> 01:00:01.571
<v Speaker 1>companies like lumosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when we developed our original </v>

962
01:00:01.571 --> 01:00:03.080
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal tap tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't tests.</v>

963
01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of had a game like element,</v>

964
01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:06.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we kind of thought,</v>

965
01:00:06.531 --> 01:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>well maybe if you have people practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing them,</v>

966
01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would obviously get better at the </v>

967
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>specific task because that is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>

968
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.900
<v Speaker 1>But then if you had people practice a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of them,</v>

969
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe they would get better at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>

970
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>at the entirety of the tasks in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would generalize to other,</v>

971
01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>to other measures like the Raven's </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive matrices,</v>

972
01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:29.180
<v Speaker 1>which is a good measure of fluid </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

973
01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:34.181
<v Speaker 1>But that never works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the lumosity people </v>

974
01:00:34.181 --> 01:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>claimed that they were able to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancement in general intelligence,</v>

975
01:00:37.431 --> 01:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>but by all appearances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appearances,</v>

976
01:00:39.741 --> 01:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>that's been a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been a dismal failure as well.</v>

977
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

978
01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that general factor doesn't seem to be </v>

979
01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>something that you can actually improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>by practice.</v>

980
01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Not What the hell why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't.</v>

981
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I just don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>

982
01:00:56.901 --> 01:00:57.070
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

983
01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.400
<v Speaker 2>here's something you don't know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

984
01:00:59.401 --> 01:01:03.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I am in the Guinness Book of Records</v>

985
01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 2>to Gamers addition because of my study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain imaging study of Tetris and I </v>

986
01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:14.500
<v Speaker 2>did a brain imaging study of Tetris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was published in 1992.</v>

987
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:20.230
<v Speaker 2>I really want to do a study of warning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see what happened in the </v>

988
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:21.030
<v Speaker 2>brain before and after your one </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

989
01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.960
<v Speaker 2>And back in 1991 when I was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody had personal computers.</v>

990
01:01:27.001 --> 01:01:32.001
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had ever heard of tattooist </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer games were not what they are </v>

991
01:01:32.521 --> 01:01:37.170
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went to the egghead software store</v>

992
01:01:37.171 --> 01:01:42.171
<v Speaker 2>when they had software stores that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>just opened and I was talking to the </v>

993
01:01:42.171 --> 01:01:45.651
<v Speaker 2>guys there about I needed something </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I could study before and after </v>

994
01:01:45.651 --> 01:01:48.210
<v Speaker 2>they learned something relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple.</v>

995
01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed me this game,</v>

996
01:01:49.981 --> 01:01:51.240
<v Speaker 2>tetris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had just come in.</v>

997
01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:52.410
<v Speaker 2>They just had opened the box.</v>

998
01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:54.780
<v Speaker 2>They put it up on the computer there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

999
01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.100
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really perfect.</v>

1000
01:01:56.101 --> 01:01:59.220
<v Speaker 2>It's simple to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an enormous learning curve.</v>

1001
01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:02.530
<v Speaker 2>And we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We brought in a college students,</v>

1002
01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:07.020
<v Speaker 2>a small number of college students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we showed them how to play tetris.</v>

1003
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:12.950
<v Speaker 2>They practice for a few minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We injected the radioactive glucose for </v>

1004
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:17.841
<v Speaker 2>positron emission tomography and we did </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pet scan studies of them that very </v>

1005
01:02:18.451 --> 01:02:23.360
<v Speaker 2>first day played tetris for 32 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been practiced everyday.</v>

1006
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:26.610
<v Speaker 2>They had to come to my office because </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody had a pc at home.</v>

1007
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:30.570
<v Speaker 2>They came to my office five days a week </v>
<v Speaker 2>for about four weeks.</v>

1008
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.540
<v Speaker 2>They practice until they got so good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tetris.</v>

1009
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Game is moving faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how good people can get it.</v>

1010
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't even believe a human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do.</v>

1011
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I've watched people do that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1012
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:48.321
<v Speaker 2>It's just absolutely unbelievable how </v>
<v Speaker 2>good they can get out of it and when </v>

1013
01:02:48.321 --> 01:02:51.771
<v Speaker 2>they got really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we scanned on the second time and we </v>

1014
01:02:51.771 --> 01:02:54.120
<v Speaker 2>found that even though the game was </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster,</v>

1015
01:02:54.121 --> 01:02:56.670
<v Speaker 2>harder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they had learned how to do it,</v>

1016
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:58.950
<v Speaker 2>they used less glucose metabolic rate.</v>

1017
01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I knew that research.</v>

1018
01:03:02.541 --> 01:03:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I read that research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1019
01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.000
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

1020
01:03:08.001 --> 01:03:13.001
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember where this research </v>
<v Speaker 1>came from because I also read at </v>

1021
01:03:13.001 --> 01:03:16.091
<v Speaker 1>approximately the same time studies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>appeared to claim and I think this was </v>

1022
01:03:16.091 --> 01:03:21.011
<v Speaker 1>reviewed by Al Conan Goldberg and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>book on a on hemispheric specialization </v>

1023
01:03:21.011 --> 01:03:23.750
<v Speaker 1>for regionalization and novelty </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectively.</v>

1024
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>That as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first start to learn something </v>

1025
01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:30.050
<v Speaker 1>novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this was demonstrated,</v>

1026
01:03:30.051 --> 01:03:32.030
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in people who are listening,</v>

1027
01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>they were Danish native speakers who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to Danish in reverse and they </v>

1028
01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.950
<v Speaker 1>use very large part portions of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain when they were listening to Davish</v>

1029
01:03:39.951 --> 01:03:44.951
<v Speaker 1>and reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they were listening to Danish </v>

1030
01:03:44.951 --> 01:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>property spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use very small specified parts of </v>

1031
01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.160
<v Speaker 1>the brain that were located in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder or enough in the back part of the</v>

1032
01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>left hemisphere and there was another </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of researchers who were </v>

1033
01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.721
<v Speaker 1>demonstrating that as you learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree of activation decreased and </v>

1034
01:03:58.721 --> 01:04:03.641
<v Speaker 1>it shifted from the right to the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it shifted from the front to the </v>

1035
01:04:03.641 --> 01:04:06.671
<v Speaker 1>back and it got smaller and smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is that associated with that </v>

1036
01:04:06.671 --> 01:04:08.510
<v Speaker 1>decreased glucose utilization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the same phenomena?</v>

1037
01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:10.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it is</v>

1038
01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:13.450
<v Speaker 2>to show it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had done one,</v>

1039
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:18.620
<v Speaker 2>one imaging study before this tetris </v>
<v Speaker 2>study where we'll just correlated a </v>

1040
01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:23.500
<v Speaker 2>glucose metabolic rate with scores on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>test of abstract reasoning.</v>

1041
01:04:24.431 --> 01:04:29.431
<v Speaker 2>The hygiene load tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had taken the test during the </v>

1042
01:04:29.431 --> 01:04:33.751
<v Speaker 2>imaging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll see what brain areas we're </v>

1043
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:33.970
<v Speaker 2>involved and we did find some brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas,</v>

1044
01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:38.971
<v Speaker 2>but the really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprising thing was the correlation </v>

1045
01:04:38.971 --> 01:04:42.700
<v Speaker 2>between the scores and glucose metabolic</v>
<v Speaker 2>rate was always negative other than they</v>

1046
01:04:42.701 --> 01:04:45.610
<v Speaker 2>did on the test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lower their glucose metabolic rate,</v>

1047
01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.880
<v Speaker 2>and that was the first thing we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this idea of brain efficiency that</v>

1048
01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:56.610
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of research on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out to be a complicated thing </v>

1049
01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.120
<v Speaker 2>because nothing about the brain is </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple,</v>

1050
01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it</v>

1051
01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>does seem to make perfect sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>expert skill is associated with doing </v>

1052
01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.890
<v Speaker 1>more with less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense now,</v>

1053
01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>but I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody predicted it.</v>

1054
01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.610
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

1055
01:05:10.611 --> 01:05:15.611
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's research that research stood out </v>

1056
01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:15.611
<v Speaker 1>for me in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1057
01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:15.611
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1058
01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:17.180
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very striking manner.</v>

1059
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.440
<v Speaker 2>So this thing about that you raised </v>
<v Speaker 2>about practicing on different kinds of </v>

1060
01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:28.801
<v Speaker 2>tests because of the attractive things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about tetricks is visual spacial </v>

1061
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:34.170
<v Speaker 2>planning ahead to pension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of elemental cognitive </v>

1062
01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:38.010
<v Speaker 2>tasks necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1063
01:05:38.011 --> 01:05:43.011
<v Speaker 2>it was fine motor control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really necessary to do well on tech </v>

1064
01:05:43.011 --> 01:05:47.601
<v Speaker 2>person to run it really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the Tetris company found my </v>

1065
01:05:48.161 --> 01:05:53.161
<v Speaker 2>research some years later and asked if </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be willing to try to replicate it </v>

1066
01:05:54.191 --> 01:05:57.340
<v Speaker 2>with more modern imaging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course I was willing to do.</v>

1067
01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:03.110
<v Speaker 2>So they funded this and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found now instead of pet scanning,</v>

1068
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:07.270
<v Speaker 2>we use functional Mri and structural Mri</v>
<v Speaker 2>both.</v>

1069
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:12.190
<v Speaker 2>And we did find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found with the pet scanning for areas</v>

1070
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:17.520
<v Speaker 2>where after a teenage girls with very </v>
<v Speaker 2>limited gaming experience Tetris,</v>

1071
01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:25.020
<v Speaker 2>their brain activity decreased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we also found from the structural </v>

1072
01:06:28.301 --> 01:06:33.301
<v Speaker 2>MRI that there were increases in gray </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

1073
01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:38.650
<v Speaker 2>And the really interesting thing is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas where there were increases in gray</v>

1074
01:06:38.651 --> 01:06:43.651
<v Speaker 2>matter did not overlap at all with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas that functionally decreased.</v>

1075
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:50.430
<v Speaker 2>It would have been a terrific story that</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange things are always more </v>

1076
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:52.840
<v Speaker 2>complicated than you hope them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

1077
01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:57.370
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell you that every time I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>a brain imaging study,</v>

1078
01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:02.620
<v Speaker 2>we always found the exact opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we expected.</v>

1079
01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:03.160
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1080
01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:05.570
<v Speaker 1>that sounds to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1081
01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.020
<v Speaker 1>you might actually be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1082
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be operating as a real scientist.</v>

1083
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:15.390
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean things are so damn complicated </v>

1084
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.390
<v Speaker 1>that it's really difficult to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1085
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.390
<v Speaker 1>To begin with.</v>

1086
01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to one of my three laws based on </v>

1087
01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:24.980
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one is no story about the brain </v>

1088
01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:24.980
<v Speaker 2>is simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1089
01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:28.951
<v Speaker 2>number two is no one study is definitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and law number three is it takes a long </v>

1090
01:07:28.991 --> 01:07:33.991
<v Speaker 2>time to sort out all the various studies</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see what's consistent and what </v>

1091
01:07:33.991 --> 01:07:36.340
<v Speaker 2>establishes a reliable way to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

1092
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Let me put you on a different track </v>
<v Speaker 1>momentarily and maybe this won't work </v>

1093
01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:42.720
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1094
01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm always curious about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1095
01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:49.980
<v Speaker 1>let's say the practical implications of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific research both at a personal </v>

1096
01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:51.460
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar level,</v>

1097
01:07:51.461 --> 01:07:53.080
<v Speaker 1>social level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

1098
01:07:53.081 --> 01:07:54.430
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

1099
01:07:54.431 --> 01:07:59.431
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I'm planning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do in the near future is to launch a </v>

1100
01:07:59.431 --> 01:08:02.461
<v Speaker 1>website where that will enable people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assess themselves with what we've </v>

1101
01:08:02.461 --> 01:08:06.181
<v Speaker 1>developed a scale called the big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect scale that breaks the big five </v>

1102
01:08:06.181 --> 01:08:07.420
<v Speaker 1>down into 10 aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of which,</v>

1103
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:13.350
<v Speaker 1>which provides some additional high </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution and useful descriptions of </v>

1104
01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:17.761
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll be able to go there and find </v>

1105
01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.681
<v Speaker 1>out what your personality is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be able to compare yourself to </v>

1106
01:08:19.681 --> 01:08:19.681
<v Speaker 1>other people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1107
01:08:19.681 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 1>to find out where your similarities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences are.</v>

1108
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:27.100
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about doing as well is putting </v>

1109
01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.930
<v Speaker 1>up on the same side or real Iq tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely validated,</v>

1110
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:35.020
<v Speaker 1>probably focusing on fluid intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a little bit less </v>

1111
01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:39.280
<v Speaker 1>linguistically complex to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe measuring verbal intelligence </v>

1112
01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:44.170
<v Speaker 1>and then showing people the strata of </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupations in which they're likely to </v>

1113
01:08:44.271 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 1>find maximal success.</v>

1114
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Because you know from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1115
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:53.860
<v Speaker 1>given that I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people vary in their cognitive </v>

1116
01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:56.891
<v Speaker 1>abilities tremendously and that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually an important determinant of </v>

1117
01:08:56.891 --> 01:08:56.891
<v Speaker 1>their life outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me.</v>

1118
01:08:56.891 --> 01:09:00.250
<v Speaker 1>So let's say someone tests out in an Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>of around 150,</v>

1119
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:02.330
<v Speaker 1>and so you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1120
01:09:02.331 --> 01:09:03.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty damn smart.</v>

1121
01:09:03.861 --> 01:09:08.861
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're up above 85 percent of the </v>

1122
01:09:08.861 --> 01:09:08.861
<v Speaker 1>general population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

1123
01:09:08.861 --> 01:09:12.020
<v Speaker 1>you could probably do a pretty damn good</v>
<v Speaker 1>job as an undergraduate in university if</v>

1124
01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:13.850
<v Speaker 1>you're also disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1125
01:09:13.851 --> 01:09:15.740
<v Speaker 1>If you were conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit the books harder.</v>

1126
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:21.130
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna come out in the top core </v>

1127
01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:23.711
<v Speaker 1>tile of your class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you're not at a </v>

1128
01:09:23.711 --> 01:09:25.190
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spectacularly selective university,</v>

1129
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:30.260
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult time as a master's student and</v>

1130
01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:35.261
<v Speaker 1>phd level stuff is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be pushing your luck to </v>

1131
01:09:35.261 --> 01:09:35.261
<v Speaker 1>really master that.</v>

1132
01:09:35.261 --> 01:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be,</v>

1133
01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.020
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a domain of,</v>

1134
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.920
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1135
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:41.060
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1136
01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.180
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Industrial organizational activity where</v>

1137
01:09:44.181 --> 01:09:47.030
<v Speaker 1>you could really be in the top 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>

1138
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>

1139
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:53.110
<v Speaker 1>So if you have an Iq of 115,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you might make one bang up plumber </v>

1140
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.150
<v Speaker 1>and you could have a spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful career as a plumber.</v>

1141
01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:59.400
<v Speaker 1>And maybe as a manager of other plumbers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that and you know,</v>

1142
01:09:59.401 --> 01:10:04.401
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually happened to be a real </v>

1143
01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:06.521
<v Speaker 1>efficacy and of the trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I certainly don't think of that as </v>

1144
01:10:06.521 --> 01:10:09.371
<v Speaker 1>something that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a low quality or low status </v>

1145
01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:09.890
<v Speaker 1>occupation in the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we would,</v>

1146
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.370
<v Speaker 1>we would like to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay heres,</v>

1147
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:16.340
<v Speaker 1>heres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

1148
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:21.430
<v Speaker 1>here's an intellectual domain that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably too high for you to be </v>

1149
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:25.960
<v Speaker 1>successful without working insane hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1150
01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:27.000
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1151
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:30.320
<v Speaker 1>to close the gap because you can do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>within st work up to some,</v>

1152
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:31.550
<v Speaker 1>some limited degree.</v>

1153
01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.880
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me that the logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do at least in part is to give </v>

1154
01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.601
<v Speaker 1>people a sense of what their advantages </v>
<v Speaker 1>and limitations are and then say to </v>

1155
01:10:40.601 --> 01:10:40.601
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1156
01:10:40.601 --> 01:10:45.431
<v Speaker 1>well given that here's a place that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could go where you could be optimally </v>

1157
01:10:45.431 --> 01:10:47.300
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1158
01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda my take from a policy </v>

1159
01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:52.360
<v Speaker 1>perspective let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like what have you thought about,</v>

1160
01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:57.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the massive diversity and intellectual </v>

1161
01:10:57.221 --> 01:11:00.251
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean what are the implications from </v>

1162
01:11:00.251 --> 01:11:02.501
<v Speaker 1>a policy perspective as far as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned or location or guidance is </v>

1163
01:11:02.501 --> 01:11:06.731
<v Speaker 1>clearly one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually did some consulting and some </v>

1164
01:11:06.731 --> 01:11:09.350
<v Speaker 1>research for a nonprofit group called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Johnson O'connor Foundation,</v>

1165
01:11:09.351 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>which is a vocational testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not that big on ge,</v>

1166
01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.350
<v Speaker 2>but they have their own battery of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>

1167
01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:20.660
<v Speaker 2>They bring someone in and do a full day </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1168
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:25.700
<v Speaker 2>of cognitive tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from that they give some advice </v>

1169
01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:30.051
<v Speaker 2>about what kinds of professions match </v>
<v Speaker 2>their cognitive strengths and </v>

1170
01:11:30.061 --> 01:11:33.160
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually did some brain imaging,</v>

1171
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their tests and it was very,</v>

1172
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:37.140
<v Speaker 2>very interesting stuff.</v>

1173
01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's hard to do the </v>

1174
01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.031
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics properly with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocational guidance because we don't </v>

1175
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:52.221
<v Speaker 1>really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a good handle on how to </v>

1176
01:11:52.221 --> 01:11:52.380
<v Speaker 1>classify jobs into their various </v>
<v Speaker 1>subtypes.</v>

1177
01:11:52.381 --> 01:11:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Like John Holland has done some good </v>
<v Speaker 1>work doing that,</v>

1178
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:59.691
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many jobs and it's hard </v>

1179
01:11:59.691 --> 01:11:59.691
<v Speaker 1>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1180
01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:01.470
<v Speaker 1>what makes two jobs the same or similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1181
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:06.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at Hopkins when Holland was there </v>

1182
01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:07.260
<v Speaker 2>in some of my friends were graduate </v>
<v Speaker 2>students work for him.</v>

1183
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:10.160
<v Speaker 2>And I learned all about that vocational </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing.</v>

1184
01:12:10.161 --> 01:12:12.180
<v Speaker 2>That's very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you know,</v>

1185
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more of his,</v>

1186
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:18.150
<v Speaker 2>his scales have kind of morphed into </v>
<v Speaker 2>more personality.</v>

1187
01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:19.850
<v Speaker 2>White dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1188
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.270
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the nexus that we want to</v>

1189
01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:24.140
<v Speaker 1>play out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1190
01:12:24.141 --> 01:12:26.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is a reason.</v>

1191
01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I know people have been mapping Holland </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holland job categories onto the big five</v>

1192
01:12:31.011 --> 01:12:33.020
<v Speaker 1>and we have a fair bit of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1193
01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.860
<v Speaker 1>and we're hoping that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiation down to the 10 levels of</v>

1194
01:12:36.861 --> 01:12:39.050
<v Speaker 1>personality will provide even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>precision.</v>

1195
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:42.200
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with more general policy let.</v>

1196
01:12:42.201 --> 01:12:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>

1197
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.620
<v Speaker 1>so reasonable vocational counseling.</v>

1198
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:48.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When does it start?</v>

1199
01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Does it start in junior high?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do you do</v>

1200
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:54.150
<v Speaker 1>the Europeans do and start to attract </v>
<v Speaker 1>people into trades and,</v>

1201
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:57.750
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and higher education at that early age.</v>

1202
01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.440
<v Speaker 2>European seemed to have had great </v>
<v Speaker 2>success with that.</v>

1203
01:13:01.441 --> 01:13:03.760
<v Speaker 2>So it's certainly Germans in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1204
01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:07.830
<v Speaker 2>So reasonable to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem in the United States,</v>

1205
01:13:07.831 --> 01:13:12.831
<v Speaker 2>there were so many problems with the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>we conceptualize education and the whole</v>

1206
01:13:16.051 --> 01:13:19.200
<v Speaker 2>idea of tracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it is in Canada,</v>

1207
01:13:19.201 --> 01:13:24.201
<v Speaker 2>but in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea of tracking has a very </v>

1208
01:13:24.201 --> 01:13:24.330
<v Speaker 2>negative valance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it,</v>

1209
01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:27.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>segregating the smart kids into one,</v>

1210
01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:32.690
<v Speaker 2>one a set of classes and the less smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids in dollars and then there's </v>

1211
01:13:34.171 --> 01:13:37.950
<v Speaker 2>remedial education and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's been a tendency,</v>

1212
01:13:37.951 --> 01:13:42.951
<v Speaker 2>a strong tendency in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel that kids learn from each other.</v>

1213
01:13:43.081 --> 01:13:46.980
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want homogeneous groups </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on learning ability.</v>

1214
01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Your want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1215
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:54.590
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because people say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to two,</v>

1216
01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.950
<v Speaker 1>let's say academic achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they play exactly the opposite.</v>

1217
01:13:57.951 --> 01:14:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Stumped when it comes to such things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>has childhood sports,</v>

1218
01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:04.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you look at football for example,</v>

1219
01:14:04.281 --> 01:14:05.180
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well hey,</v>

1220
01:14:05.181 --> 01:14:10.181
<v Speaker 1>let's segregate like abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have the people who </v>

1221
01:14:10.181 --> 01:14:10.700
<v Speaker 1>stumble around on the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping the ball all the time,</v>

1222
01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:15.701
<v Speaker 1>playing the top end quarterbacks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody thinks there's a problem with </v>

1223
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:15.701
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't say,</v>

1224
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:20.371
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone learns from everyone else in </v>

1225
01:14:20.371 --> 01:14:22.321
<v Speaker 1>that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me it speaks more of a refusal to </v>

1226
01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:27.420
<v Speaker 1>admit to the stark reality that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are massive cognitive differences </v>

1227
01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:31.051
<v Speaker 1>between people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to try to actually start to address </v>

1228
01:14:31.051 --> 01:14:32.680
<v Speaker 1>that with some degree of seriousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the serious should be something like,</v>

1229
01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:34.780
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's look at the bottom 15 percent</v>

1230
01:14:34.781 --> 01:14:37.120
<v Speaker 1>of the population cognitively speaking.</v>

1231
01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:40.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell can we do for those people</v>

1232
01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:45.541
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be useful and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the guy that I was telling you </v>

1233
01:14:45.541 --> 01:14:48.841
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think of some way that </v>

1234
01:14:48.841 --> 01:14:51.151
<v Speaker 1>he could find a respectable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive and relatively stable </v>

1235
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:55.390
<v Speaker 1>position in society that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

1236
01:14:55.391 --> 01:14:57.280
<v Speaker 1>And I thought there was a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things he could do.</v>

1237
01:14:57.281 --> 01:15:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things he could've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he could have been encouraged,</v>

1238
01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.400
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1239
01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:09.210
<v Speaker 1>to collect trash in the downtown areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he could have been assigned a city </v>

1240
01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:11.440
<v Speaker 1>block and it could have been said to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1241
01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:14.560
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job is to keep this damn city block</v>

1242
01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:17.170
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the bag,</v>

1243
01:15:17.171 --> 01:15:18.790
<v Speaker 1>here's the stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get up in the morning,</v>

1244
01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:21.430
<v Speaker 1>you go do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it makes everybody's life more</v>

1245
01:15:21.431 --> 01:15:23.890
<v Speaker 1>pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a valuable contribution.</v>

1246
01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:27.060
<v Speaker 1>It's something you could do with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain degree of pride and it.</v>

1247
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:28.930
<v Speaker 1>And there's a socially valuable end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1248
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens in Toronto is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people drive around these vacuum cleaner</v>

1249
01:15:33.671 --> 01:15:38.671
<v Speaker 1>machines on sidewalks and pick up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrap paper and all of that.</v>

1250
01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:42.400
<v Speaker 1>That actually turns out to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitively demanding job because,</v>

1251
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:44.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay careful attention.</v>

1252
01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:47.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't run over people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have decent social skills.</v>

1253
01:15:47.441 --> 01:15:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>

1254
01:15:49.121 --> 01:15:54.121
<v Speaker 1>But it might be nice to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we were not mature enough to have a </v>

1255
01:15:54.121 --> 01:15:56.410
<v Speaker 1>discussion like this as a society we </v>
<v Speaker 1>might want to say is like,</v>

1256
01:15:56.411 --> 01:16:01.411
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a group of people who </v>

1257
01:16:01.411 --> 01:16:01.411
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to be able to compete in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1258
01:16:01.411 --> 01:16:05.890
<v Speaker 1>in the cognitive workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to do it.</v>

1259
01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:11.370
<v Speaker 1>And there's actually lots of them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to say they're lazy and </v>

1260
01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:11.380
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to say they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for work.</v>

1261
01:16:11.381 --> 01:16:12.760
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to say any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to say,</v>

1262
01:16:12.761 --> 01:16:17.761
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to find occupations that have </v>

1263
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:23.140
<v Speaker 1>public utility that aren't just make </v>
<v Speaker 1>work projects that people have.</v>

1264
01:16:23.141 --> 01:16:28.141
<v Speaker 1>That level of abstract capacity could </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually perform.</v>

1265
01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.390
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think we have the maturity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have that conversation.</v>

1266
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:36.950
<v Speaker 2>We don't have the economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would go even a little to the </v>

1267
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:39.180
<v Speaker 2>left of you and I would say there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing wrong with make work programs,</v>

1268
01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1269
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.340
<v Speaker 2>to allow people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1270
01:16:43.341 --> 01:16:47.530
<v Speaker 2>you have to work with dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you heard that option,</v>

1271
01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:52.510
<v Speaker 2>but you also have this interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment being proposed of the minimum</v>

1272
01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:53.500
<v Speaker 2>annual income.</v>

1273
01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that worries me because see if </v>

1274
01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:58.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it concerns me because,</v>

1275
01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:04.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're having a conversation here </v>

1276
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.430
<v Speaker 1>where we're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1277
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:08.400
<v Speaker 1>differences in Iq seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with a guaranteed annual</v>

1278
01:17:08.401 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 1>income issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the problems,</v>

1279
01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:14.540
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not denying its potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility,</v>

1280
01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:18.350
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I think that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be experimentally determined and</v>

1281
01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:21.680
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it could replace a plethora of</v>

1282
01:17:21.681 --> 01:17:24.470
<v Speaker 1>less efficient social welfare programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1283
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:29.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me.</v>

1284
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:35.110
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious to me that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial proportion of the </v>

1285
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:37.961
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say it's probably five </v>

1286
01:17:37.961 --> 01:17:39.911
<v Speaker 1>percent that would destroy themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly if you gave them a guaranteed </v>

1287
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:45.280
<v Speaker 1>annual income and they would do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're very low in </v>

1288
01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:45.280
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1289
01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.710
<v Speaker 1>and very impulsive and like I've worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>with many guys,</v>

1290
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:54.010
<v Speaker 1>often x cocaine addicts who were often </v>
<v Speaker 1>not all that high on the end of the </v>

1291
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:54.800
<v Speaker 1>cognitive distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>

1292
01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:57.560
<v Speaker 1>very low in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high and impulsivity.</v>

1293
01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.160
<v Speaker 1>And those guys were absolutely fine as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as they were flat broke.</v>

1294
01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:04.310
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you as soon as they had money,</v>

1295
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:07.490
<v Speaker 1>they were done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like three days in the bar,</v>

1296
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:11.690
<v Speaker 1>cocaine binge face down in a ditch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they were fine until they got money</v>

1297
01:18:11.691 --> 01:18:14.600
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't.</v>

1298
01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.960
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the garden teed annual </v>
<v Speaker 1>income solution is that man does not </v>

1299
01:18:20.631 --> 01:18:22.190
<v Speaker 1>live by bread alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

1300
01:18:22.191 --> 01:18:26.450
<v Speaker 1>And that if you have money and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to do,</v>

1301
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 1>then you have a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you just have money,</v>

1302
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:30.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a life.</v>

1303
01:18:32.210 --> 01:18:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1304
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I have a very narrow lens on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I know about the big social </v>

1305
01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:39.890
<v Speaker 2>policies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And No,</v>

1306
01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about that more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than anybody else.</v>

1307
01:18:42.321 --> 01:18:47.321
<v Speaker 2>I have opinions like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my narrow lens is through </v>

1308
01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:49.180
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1309
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I think more is better than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less.</v>

1310
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 2>More doesn't make you a better person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make you honest,</v>

1311
01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:58.190
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make you likable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make your conscience does.</v>

1312
01:18:58.191 --> 01:19:00.920
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't solve the problems of the world.</v>

1313
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:05.660
<v Speaker 2>But if we can do something to increase </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

1314
01:19:05.661 --> 01:19:10.661
<v Speaker 2>generally I think that would go in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure toward alleviating a lot of </v>

1315
01:19:12.441 --> 01:19:13.490
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1316
01:19:13.491 --> 01:19:16.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complex problems.</v>

1317
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:18.820
<v Speaker 2>So I'm managing the homelessness </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1318
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Some proportion of chronically homeless </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have schizophrenia.</v>

1319
01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Schizophrenia is a genetic disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows what the genes are or how </v>

1320
01:19:31.221 --> 01:19:36.221
<v Speaker 2>they work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty clear there's a genetic </v>

1321
01:19:36.221 --> 01:19:37.240
<v Speaker 2>component.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can find the genes,</v>

1322
01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 2>figure out what they do and come up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>real good treatments.</v>

1323
01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:46.991
<v Speaker 2>If chores for schizophrenia and possibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>preventions for schizophrenia,</v>

1324
01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.920
<v Speaker 2>that indirectly is going to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>alleviate the homeless problem.</v>

1325
01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what to do about the </v>

1326
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:58.151
<v Speaker 2>homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you can figure out what to do </v>

1327
01:19:58.151 --> 01:20:00.671
<v Speaker 2>about schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to have some impact on </v>

1328
01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:00.671
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1329
01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically,</v>

1330
01:20:01.561 --> 01:20:06.561
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll use your claim to some degree is </v>

1331
01:20:06.561 --> 01:20:09.171
<v Speaker 1>that these more complex social problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be into isolative or micro </v>

1332
01:20:09.301 --> 01:20:14.301
<v Speaker 1>problems and that specific solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be sought for them and now that </v>

1333
01:20:14.301 --> 01:20:14.301
<v Speaker 1>certainly strikes</v>

1334
01:20:14.301 --> 01:20:16.860
<v Speaker 2>me as an appropriate approach because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody is different.</v>

1335
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Not everyone's the same reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1336
01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:20.700
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's for sure.</v>

1337
01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:23.260
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not everyone's poor for the same route,</v>

1338
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.680
<v Speaker 2>for the same reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

1339
01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:27.660
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poverty is.</v>

1340
01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:32.661
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have one cause no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not nearly caused by lack of money </v>

1341
01:20:34.471 --> 01:20:37.920
<v Speaker 2>either because that would be a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier problem to solve unfortunately.</v>

1342
01:20:37.921 --> 01:20:42.921
<v Speaker 2>It's not so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the one thing that we're probably </v>

1343
01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:43.200
<v Speaker 2>getting towards the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one thing I would like to leave your</v>

1344
01:20:43.201 --> 01:20:48.201
<v Speaker 2>listeners with is really optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Dismal problems in perpetuity </v>

1345
01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:53.220
<v Speaker 2>because the genetic approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1346
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:55.530
<v Speaker 2>and I'm kind of out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1347
01:20:55.531 --> 01:20:58.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of out there on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a mainstream view,</v>

1348
01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:00.720
<v Speaker 2>but I think the more something is </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic,</v>

1349
01:21:00.721 --> 01:21:05.721
<v Speaker 2>the more lives we can change it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why we should study the genetics </v>

1350
01:21:06.751 --> 01:21:07.800
<v Speaker 2>of intelligence.</v>

1351
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:11.360
<v Speaker 2>That's why I hope genes have more to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>

1352
01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:13.530
<v Speaker 2>that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1353
01:21:13.531 --> 01:21:18.531
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not yet because I want to do something </v>

1354
01:21:18.531 --> 01:21:21.081
<v Speaker 2>nefarious with jeeps and I understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of this varies because I </v>

1355
01:21:22.531 --> 01:21:27.531
<v Speaker 2>think in neuroscience there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's optimism and to guard against </v>

1356
01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:31.890
<v Speaker 2>the negative aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the potential negative aspects of this.</v>

1357
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:37.100
<v Speaker 2>The only solution is to have public </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about this and we get </v>

1358
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.270
<v Speaker 2>people to understand Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

1359
01:21:39.271 --> 01:21:41.910
<v Speaker 2>g factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are not all the same things.</v>

1360
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:44.160
<v Speaker 2>They have different relationships to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>data,</v>

1361
01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:50.240
<v Speaker 2>the genetic data particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to understand these things </v>

1362
01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:54.350
<v Speaker 2>and once we have some sense of this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not paint people who believe in that </v>

1363
01:21:55.051 --> 01:22:00.051
<v Speaker 2>there's a genetic component is as our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as our a priori racists or malevolent </v>

1364
01:22:00.690 --> 01:22:02.310
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1365
01:22:02.311 --> 01:22:03.230
<v Speaker 2>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1366
01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:08.610
<v Speaker 2>we can come to a common understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how genes and environment interact</v>

1367
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:13.970
<v Speaker 2>and figure out how all that works and </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin to think how in the year 20,</v>

1368
01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:16.980
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 20,</v>

1369
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:22.090
<v Speaker 2>60 are going to help them resolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resolve some of these issues to </v>

1370
01:22:23.701 --> 01:22:26.760
<v Speaker 2>practical benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that is a good place.</v>

1371
01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:32.630
<v Speaker 1>We've had a very productive discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's probably a nice place </v>

1372
01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:32.660
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1373
01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:37.690
<v Speaker 1>to bring everything to a close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been speaking with Dr Richard Hire </v>

1374
01:22:37.690 --> 01:22:41.960
<v Speaker 1>who studies the neuro basis of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and cognition and who has </v>

1375
01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:46.000
<v Speaker 1>recently released a new book called and </v>
<v Speaker 1>real science of intelligence published </v>

1376
01:22:46.341 --> 01:22:48.890
<v Speaker 1>by Cambridge University press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an academic book,</v>

1377
01:22:48.891 --> 01:22:53.891
<v Speaker 1>but for people who are interested in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious discussion of the relationship </v>

1378
01:22:53.891 --> 01:22:58.100
<v Speaker 1>between biology and intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's a good Goto Tome and,</v>

1379
01:22:58.101 --> 01:22:58.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1380
01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:03.740
<v Speaker 1>it's an extraordinarily important topic </v>
<v Speaker 1>given the undeniable primacy of </v>

1381
01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.940
<v Speaker 1>intelligence as the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor of,</v>

1382
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of let's say,</v>

1383
01:23:08.501 --> 01:23:10.420
<v Speaker 1>success in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many domains in,</v>

1384
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:12.180
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the human lifespan.</v>

1385
01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:15.940
<v Speaker 1>So thank you very much for spending an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour or so with us today.</v>

1386
01:23:15.941 --> 01:23:16.490
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1387
01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:23.160
<v Speaker 1>and with any luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll talk to you again in the </v>

1388
01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.591
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to talk to you perhaps about </v>

1389
01:23:25.591 --> 01:23:25.591
<v Speaker 1>consciousness at some point that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be entertaining.</v>

1390
01:23:25.591 --> 01:23:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've listened to.</v>

1391
01:23:26.031 --> 01:23:31.031
<v Speaker 2>I've really enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate the chance of family more </v>

1392
01:23:31.031 --> 01:23:34.541
<v Speaker 2>than three sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three sentences are related to your </v>

1393
01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.840
<v Speaker 2>listeners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say one thing about the </v>

1394
01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.191
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is written for the lay public as </v>

1395
01:23:45.191 --> 01:23:45.191
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing to know.</v>

1396
01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Cambridge wouldn't let me call it the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience of intelligence called what</v>

1397
01:23:49.731 --> 01:23:54.731
<v Speaker 2>every parent and student needs to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the neuro science,</v>

1398
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:58.150
<v Speaker 2>but because they wanted to market it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a strictly academic God,</v>

1399
01:23:58.151 --> 01:24:00.280
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting quite a bit of attention.</v>

1400
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Just a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonacademic.</v>

1401
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1402
01:24:03.341 --> 01:24:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make sure that I.</v>

1403
01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned that in the description </v>
<v Speaker 1>which I will.</v>

1404
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:10.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll post the link to the book probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Amazon.</v>

1405
01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:16.300
<v Speaker 1>That's usually the most straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and also point out that it is in </v>

1406
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.170
<v Speaker 1>fact written for people who aren't only </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialists in the area.</v>

1407
01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.870
<v Speaker 2>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

1408
01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Thanks a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey listen,</v>

1409
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:25.090
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

1410
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.630
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pleasure talking with you too.</v>

1411
01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Good to meet you.</v>
