1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.860
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're 35 years old and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>never had a job,</v>

3
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.513
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that's stopping </v>
<v Speaker 2>you is that you're so damn nervous that </v>

4
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.253
<v Speaker 2>you can't pick up a phone and use it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if anything unexpected happens </v>

5
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:47.240
<v Speaker 2>while you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get scared so badly,</v>

6
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 2>you have to hang up and so that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic of somebody with a severe</v>

7
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 2>anxiety disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do with that person?</v>

8
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.580
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they afraid of the phone?</v>

9
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.563
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

10
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 2>What are they afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

11
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid of a normally is in human</v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction,</v>

12
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:02.384
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're afraid of something unexpected </v>

13
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:04.304
<v Speaker 2>happening while they're trying to impose</v>
<v Speaker 2>a structure and the reason they're </v>

14
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:07.304
<v Speaker 2>afraid of that is because they never </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned that they were capable of </v>

15
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 2>dealing with the emergence of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>new on an ongoing basis,</v>

16
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:17.900
<v Speaker 2>which meant that</v>
<v Speaker 2>while which meant in all likelihood,</v>

17
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:18.734
<v Speaker 2>that when they were children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were so sheltered from any contact </v>

18
00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:23.144
<v Speaker 2>with those aspects of being the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcend knowledge that they never </v>

19
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:27.194
<v Speaker 2>learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was something inside of them </v>

20
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:33.131
<v Speaker 2>that would reveal itself if they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed the opportunity to encounter the</v>

21
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 2>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to encounter fear them,</v>

22
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:36.734
<v Speaker 2>to master it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then to extract out something of value </v>

23
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 2>so they can't get a job because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't use the phone and it isn't because</v>

24
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 2>they can't use the phone.</v>

25
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a deeper story than not.</v>

26
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:46.274
<v Speaker 2>It's because they're terrified of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have no idea that they have </v>

27
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 2>some resource they could draw on to </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat it and you could say,</v>

28
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can teach them to use the phone,</v>

29
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:57.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

30
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.491
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:58.491 --> 00:01:59.324
<v Speaker 2>here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a repertoire of stock lines that </v>

32
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you might use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

33
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.713
<v Speaker 2>like small talk at a party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would increase what they know </v>

34
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 2>and enabled them to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>

35
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Or You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

36
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:11.204
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relax a little bit when the person says </v>

37
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.050
<v Speaker 2>something on the phone that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

38
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 2>pause a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about what they're saying.</v>

39
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Pay attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allow yourself the luxury of formulating</v>

40
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 2>a response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll do fine,</v>

41
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.940
<v Speaker 2>and even if you do it badly the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>half a dozen times,</v>

42
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 2>well you'll learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually the person derives from that.</v>

43
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.150
<v Speaker 2>The notion that not only can they cope </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the phone,</v>

44
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 2>but that possibly there's more to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>that originally met the eye.</v>

45
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.170
<v Speaker 2>We come into the world equipped with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>array of possibilities and limitations.</v>

46
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.103
<v Speaker 2>Those possibilities and limitations are </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressed most particularly in our </v>

47
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 2>physical form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we have a specific kind of</v>

48
00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 2>embodied form that us to do certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and that also doesn't allow us to</v>

49
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 2>do certain other things loud too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as pointed out that</v>

50
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 2>it's the space inside a part that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the part worthwhile.</v>

51
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.843
<v Speaker 2>And what he means by that is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things that limit you give you as </v>

52
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 2>much form and possibility as those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that enable you.</v>

53
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.003
<v Speaker 2>What that means more broadly is the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you come to a given circumstance </v>

54
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 2>with a set of possibilities and a set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations.</v>

55
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.873
<v Speaker 2>It's that that allows you to impose form</v>
<v Speaker 2>on what you encounter so that the whole </v>

56
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.374
<v Speaker 2>notion of forum is attendant in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>peculiar way that we don't really </v>

57
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 2>understand yet on the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitation.</v>

58
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.993
<v Speaker 2>And I think the best way to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that or to begin to understand that is </v>

59
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 2>to give some consideration to the notion</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a game.</v>

60
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're playing chess,</v>

61
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.650
<v Speaker 2>there's a virtually unlimited number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you can do and only a very narrow</v>

62
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 2>number of things that you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet when you're playing chess,</v>

63
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.723
<v Speaker 2>the arbitrary limitations that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>imposed on each piece don't seem to be </v>

64
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.803
<v Speaker 2>unfair in any sort of cosmic sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem to be part of the structure </v>

65
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:08.254
<v Speaker 2>that enables you to actually play the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game without the imposition of those </v>

66
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:12.934
<v Speaker 2>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are of course relatively </v>

67
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And their structure,</v>

68
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:19.711
<v Speaker 2>there wouldn't be a game at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's clear that for human beings,</v>

69
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:21.874
<v Speaker 2>games and fantasy for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shade up into reality so that the game </v>

70
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:26.884
<v Speaker 2>structures that we engage in and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasy structures that we use to </v>

71
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 2>undergird our stories and our pretend </v>
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

72
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 2>say when we're children shade </v>
<v Speaker 2>imperceptibly into real life,</v>

73
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.473
<v Speaker 2>we we play games because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about games that make them </v>

74
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:41.584
<v Speaker 2>deeply analogous to what we do in day to</v>
<v Speaker 2>day situations and that means the </v>

75
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:46.414
<v Speaker 2>observation that the rules of a game </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually make the game possible is an </v>

76
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 2>observation that's broadly applicable to</v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration of your own limitation.</v>

77
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.713
<v Speaker 2>Some of those limitations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities take the form of emotions </v>

78
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 2>and motivations and we know I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>incontrovertibly</v>

79
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.073
<v Speaker 2>regardless of the claims of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists who are more relativist in </v>

80
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:08.794
<v Speaker 2>their orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings come into the world </v>

81
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 2>with a standard set of biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>predispositions,</v>

82
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 2>emotions and motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And furthermore,</v>

83
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:19.830
<v Speaker 2>I think we know that it's the fact of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those shared emotions,</v>

84
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 2>emotions and motivations that allow us </v>
<v Speaker 2>to communicate at all.</v>

85
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.963
<v Speaker 2>And then imagine further that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that lengthy process of </v>

86
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.543
<v Speaker 2>interpersonal negotiation is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergence of a tremendously complicated </v>

87
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:38.624
<v Speaker 2>game and not one that's arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the game has to have certain </v>

88
00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:44.000
<v Speaker 2>rules in order for it to be played at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

89
00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that even with rats,</v>

90
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.733
<v Speaker 2>if rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like to engage in rough and tumble </v>

91
00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:52.280
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you put two rats together,</v>

92
00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:53.114
<v Speaker 2>juvenile routes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one route almost always dominates the </v>

93
00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:56.624
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It only takes about 10 percent gain in </v>

94
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:02.490
<v Speaker 2>weight on the part of one rap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For it to be pretty much stable,</v>

95
00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:03.324
<v Speaker 2>he dominant and it's always the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordinate rat that introduces play or </v>

96
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or asks for play.</v>

97
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.020
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out that even among rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the dominant rat pins or or,</v>

98
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 2>or obtains victory over the subordinate </v>
<v Speaker 2>route,</v>

99
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 2>more than 70 percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the subordinate rat will no longer play.</v>

100
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 2>So then you could imagine likewise that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to play a game with some</v>

101
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:26.174
<v Speaker 2>other person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a game of fantasy or the </v>

102
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 2>actual chance to engage in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperative real world activity,</v>

103
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 2>unless that person allows you a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of space for the manifestation of</v>

104
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 2>your own emotional and motivational </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs,</v>

105
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to play the game with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

106
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:41.924
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to look for another game </v>

107
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 2>and that means that there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>set of difficult to describe constraints</v>

108
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:48.374
<v Speaker 2>for all of you on games that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to play before you'll look for </v>

109
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:52.510
<v Speaker 2>another one</v>

110
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.343
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

111
00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.393
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can start to conceive of </v>

112
00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:02.560
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary tendencies in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

113
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.693
<v Speaker 2>Imagine the human society that Scott so </v>
<v Speaker 2>unstable that the vast majority of the </v>

114
00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:10.870
<v Speaker 2>citizens within that society are </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjugated to starvation,</v>

115
00:07:10.871 --> 00:07:15.700
<v Speaker 2>so the society never no longer provides </v>
<v Speaker 2>their basic needs and constant tyranny.</v>

116
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.360
<v Speaker 2>You could imagine as well that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be an innate tendency among the</v>

117
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:20.194
<v Speaker 2>members of that society to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesizing about what alternatives </v>

118
00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:24.610
<v Speaker 2>might be possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

119
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:25.444
<v Speaker 2>To start dreaming about alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies and then also to take action </v>

120
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:29.734
<v Speaker 2>if the situation becomes too extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is part of the reason </v>

121
00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:36.520
<v Speaker 2>why you see stable mythological motifs </v>
<v Speaker 2>across different cultures.</v>

122
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not so much like young sad that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have archetypes of what might constitute</v>

123
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:44.590
<v Speaker 2>social order deeply embedded in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>

124
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.693
<v Speaker 2>I think this situation is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>externalized in that in that what's </v>

125
00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:52.600
<v Speaker 2>biological is what we bring to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

126
00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 2>our hopes and our desires and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have hopes and desires.</v>

127
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:57.423
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what happens with stories is </v>

128
00:07:58.631 --> 00:07:59.464
<v Speaker 2>something like this is that as human </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies increasing complexity and </v>

129
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:04.444
<v Speaker 2>number so they become bigger and bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and more and more people engage in the </v>

130
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:08.014
<v Speaker 2>negotiating process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exchanging emotional and motivational </v>

131
00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:14.020
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pattern that the society takes,</v>

132
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:16.720
<v Speaker 2>if it's going to be stable across long </v>
<v Speaker 2>periods of time,</v>

133
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.773
<v Speaker 2>starts to become encoded in the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you've got your emotions on </v>

134
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 2>your motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make your case no one,</v>

135
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.173
<v Speaker 2>10,000 other people do that over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand years and structure starts to </v>

136
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:31.900
<v Speaker 2>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That satisfies more or less all of these</v>

137
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:36.190
<v Speaker 2>emotions and motivational states and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also recognizable as a pattern,</v>

138
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 2>so then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

139
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.450
<v Speaker 2>considering a story like Moses and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>imposition of the 10 commandments on the</v>

140
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 2>ancient Hebrews prior to isn't in </v>
<v Speaker 2>position of those 10 commandments,</v>

141
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:55.220
<v Speaker 2>and of course there were actually many </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 10 Moses,</v>

142
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>according to the mythological story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

143
00:08:57.781 --> 00:08:58.614
<v Speaker 2>Spent years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally years adjudicating conflict </v>

144
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 2>between the people that he was leading </v>
<v Speaker 2>18 hours a day.</v>

145
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 2>They'd come to him with their various </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems saying,</v>

146
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 2>we have a dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How should it be settled?</v>

147
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 2>And he'd satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well imagine doing that for 10 years,</v>

148
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:13.944
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Becoming an expert at evaluating what </v>

149
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 2>constitutes an appropriate solution to </v>
<v Speaker 2>an emotional problem between two people.</v>

150
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.503
<v Speaker 2>Imagine as well that as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that for such a long period of </v>

151
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:25.644
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to became becoming able to </v>

152
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:27.984
<v Speaker 2>abstract out lawful regularities in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner in which people have to interact </v>

153
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 2>in order for peace to be maintained.</v>

154
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Imagine further that those could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>codified in stories,</v>

155
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:39.024
<v Speaker 2>but even more codafide as law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually when consciousness became </v>

156
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 2>capable of grasping explicitly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of the interactions,</v>

157
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.363
<v Speaker 2>so my point is a point very much like </v>
<v Speaker 2>niches because Nisha said at the end of </v>

158
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:51.594
<v Speaker 2>the 19th century that it's a mistake to </v>
<v Speaker 2>presume that most of our philosophies </v>

159
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:56.424
<v Speaker 2>are rational in nature and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a mistake that characterizes </v>

160
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.473
<v Speaker 2>western philosophical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least at least since the </v>

161
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:03.714
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mistake to assume that there was </v>

162
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:07.014
<v Speaker 2>a chaotic social state upon which a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational order was imposed as a </v>

163
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:11.754
<v Speaker 2>consequence of rational action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much more reasonable to presuppose </v>

164
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.713
<v Speaker 2>that the order emerged naturally over </v>
<v Speaker 2>lengthy periods of time and then was </v>

165
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 2>interpreted and codified and given </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure in a secondary manner.</v>

166
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 2>And so when I'm trying to outline for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in in large part is the processes by</v>

167
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:29.760
<v Speaker 2>which that order comes to be.</v>

168
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first it's behavioral,</v>

169
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:32.754
<v Speaker 2>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational people and even animals </v>

170
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.083
<v Speaker 2>communicate in a way that makes their </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational and emotional needs known </v>

171
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:41.100
<v Speaker 2>to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even among wolves and chimpanzees and</v>

172
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.380
<v Speaker 2>and any kind of lower order social </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>

173
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.423
<v Speaker 2>you have the emergence of dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies fundamentally which are </v>

174
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 2>stable solutions to the entire set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional and motivational problems that</v>

175
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:52.843
<v Speaker 2>beset the group and no one would ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that the emergence of a chimpanzee </v>

176
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.060
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy is a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational deliberation.</v>

177
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.403
<v Speaker 2>So then imagine chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the power to watch what they're </v>

178
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:04.824
<v Speaker 2>doing and to start to represent it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then imagine furthermore that that </v>

179
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:08.604
<v Speaker 2>representation takes the form of stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then laws and then you have some </v>

180
00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:15.030
<v Speaker 2>idea about how human social order comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

181
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.480
<v Speaker 2>And this is an exciting possibility for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me because it offers,</v>

182
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.760
<v Speaker 2>it offers the potential solution to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>major question,</v>

183
00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 2>which is how is it that people should </v>
<v Speaker 2>act?</v>

184
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 2>And because we're essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationalist in our presuppositions,</v>

185
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:33.780
<v Speaker 2>we believe that there are rationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions to that,</v>

186
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:34.614
<v Speaker 2>but the solutions may be something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are much more akin to biological </v>

187
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:38.454
<v Speaker 2>solutions.</v>

188
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.543
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to consider the following </v>

189
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

190
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presupposition.</v>

191
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.320
<v Speaker 2>A couple of presuppositions that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think are unreasonable.</v>

192
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:53.154
<v Speaker 2>First is that we are essentially animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've evolved in a Darwinian </v>

193
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 2>fashion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and second,</v>

194
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 2>that the consequence of that evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of which was pre-cognitive,</v>

195
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:03.754
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did with it w we were around as </v>

196
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 2>creatures before we were capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking in words,</v>

197
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.463
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of that evolutionary history has </v>

198
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:11.950
<v Speaker 2>conditioned the manner in which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

199
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 2>So we think more like biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>entities.</v>

200
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:15.274
<v Speaker 2>Then we think like computers or we think</v>
<v Speaker 2>more like biological entities than we </v>

201
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:19.144
<v Speaker 2>think like rational machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course we already know that </v>

202
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.893
<v Speaker 2>rational machines cannot think very well</v>
<v Speaker 2>except in very boundaried environments </v>

203
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.033
<v Speaker 2>because they don't have access to and </v>
<v Speaker 2>embodied structure or to emotions and </v>

204
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:31.690
<v Speaker 2>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's.</v>

205
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 2>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

206
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.463
<v Speaker 2>why is it that like in the Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian creation myths are most </v>

207
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:41.314
<v Speaker 2>fundamental representations of the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to take story for him and that not </v>

208
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:47.014
<v Speaker 2>only do they take story form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they tend to utilize certain kinds </v>

209
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:51.274
<v Speaker 2>of categories.</v>

210
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've showed you this diagram before.</v>

211
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this represents what I think are the </v>

212
00:12:56.711 --> 00:12:57.544
<v Speaker 2>three cardinal categories of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the great mother who was </v>

213
00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:05.411
<v Speaker 2>holding the world in her hand here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside her subordinate in a sense is the</v>

214
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:06.544
<v Speaker 2>great father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a Christian representation </v>

215
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then this tragic son,</v>

216
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.243
<v Speaker 2>of course in the crowd here representing</v>
<v Speaker 2>society is adoring the figure of the </v>

217
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.033
<v Speaker 2>tragic hero here because they regard his</v>
<v Speaker 2>motive being as necessary to their own </v>

218
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 2>salvation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

219
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:26.680
<v Speaker 2>their own proper motive living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

220
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:27.514
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why these characters and I offer </v>

221
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:31.114
<v Speaker 2>you this possibility is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every human being that's ever lived has </v>

222
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:40.720
<v Speaker 2>lived in an environment characterized by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the presence of these three entities,</v>

223
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have mothers,</v>

224
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.980
<v Speaker 2>we have fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we exist as individuals.</v>

225
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.450
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

226
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 2>when you're a child and you begin to </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehend the world,</v>

227
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:50.853
<v Speaker 2>the outside world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything outside of the family is of </v>

228
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:54.520
<v Speaker 2>course vague and ill defined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

229
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.353
<v Speaker 2>Nonexistent in a sense and to all there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is for you to observe is the mother who </v>

230
00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:03.830
<v Speaker 2>for you really is the whole world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the father,</v>

231
00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:04.664
<v Speaker 2>a a secondary source of comfort and </v>
<v Speaker 2>troubled perhaps and the fact of your </v>

232
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 2>own individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you say,</v>

233
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 2>well that's true from the perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual development,</v>

234
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:16.180
<v Speaker 2>but then if you go way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back in history,</v>

235
00:14:16.181 --> 00:14:17.014
<v Speaker 2>maybe 500,000 years when our cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacities were first starting to </v>

236
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>develop and we were trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the world was really like,</v>

237
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.053
<v Speaker 2>what categories would we have at our </v>
<v Speaker 2>disposal to start to modify and change </v>

238
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:30.214
<v Speaker 2>in order to represent the outside world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you might think you can only </v>

239
00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:36.940
<v Speaker 2>talk about what you don't know in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know.</v>

240
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.630
<v Speaker 2>And since for the child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mother is the world.</v>

241
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.553
<v Speaker 2>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't observed to presume that for </v>

242
00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 2>the human being the world is the mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>first as a projection,</v>

243
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:49.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

244
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.380
<v Speaker 2>As a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

245
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an April are cognitive Schema.</v>

246
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:56.773
<v Speaker 2>The hypothesis being the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course does manifest itself in </v>

247
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:02.264
<v Speaker 2>truth in the mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partakes in many ways of the same </v>

248
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:05.834
<v Speaker 2>properties as the mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a working hypothesis just like you </v>

249
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:14.261
<v Speaker 2>might presume if you date a new woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she has aspects of your sister.</v>

250
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 2>All things considered aspects of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother given that they were also female.</v>

251
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.920
<v Speaker 2>You take what you know to represent what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know,</v>

252
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.343
<v Speaker 2>so we use our fundamental social </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive categories initially to </v>

253
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:31.940
<v Speaker 2>portray the world and the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature's pours,</v>

254
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 2>traded personified or metaphorical form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the question is what are the</v>

255
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:39.020
<v Speaker 2>primary categories?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

256
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:39.854
<v Speaker 2>we have three of them here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not the only three because </v>

257
00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 2>this is all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This category system,</v>

258
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 2>the benevolent mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benevolent father,</v>

259
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.383
<v Speaker 2>and the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While we know the world is not only </v>

260
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 2>benevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also malevolent,</v>

261
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:52.124
<v Speaker 2>or at least we can say that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're equipped with certain emotional </v>

262
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.610
<v Speaker 2>possibilities in certain motivational </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities,</v>

263
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

264
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.023
<v Speaker 2>the probability that we will encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>despair and frustration and </v>

265
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:05.624
<v Speaker 2>disappointment and anxiety is just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>real as the possibility that we will </v>

266
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:12.320
<v Speaker 2>encounter elation and hope and </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction.</v>

267
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 2>So for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is by Vaillant.</v>

268
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.640
<v Speaker 2>It takes with one hand and gives with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>

269
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:17.474
<v Speaker 2>and that's true for the natural world </v>
<v Speaker 2>which produces us and destroys us as it </v>

270
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:22.274
<v Speaker 2>is for the social world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which fosters our development and </v>

271
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:25.304
<v Speaker 2>crushes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our individuality and as well for the </v>

272
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:30.930
<v Speaker 2>individual who in many regards is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is admirable a creature.</v>

273
00:16:30.931 --> 00:16:31.764
<v Speaker 2>As you could hope ever to proposed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the same time someone who's </v>

274
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.090
<v Speaker 2>capable of unbelievable depths of </v>
<v Speaker 2>depravity,</v>

275
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.703
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>a world that's not only divided into </v>

276
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:43.544
<v Speaker 2>three fundamental categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but each category divided into a </v>

277
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:52.090
<v Speaker 2>structure that's essentially ambivalent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and its fundamental element,</v>

278
00:16:52.091 --> 00:16:56.900
<v Speaker 2>and of course that poses the central </v>
<v Speaker 2>existential problem for human existence,</v>

279
00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:57.734
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're faced with the vagaries of </v>

280
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:01.184
<v Speaker 2>the natural world and what we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the vagaries of the social </v>

281
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:04.634
<v Speaker 2>world and it's often arbitrary and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unreasonable demands on us and the fact </v>

282
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:08.534
<v Speaker 2>of our capacity for Tristan </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendence tied to our own </v>

283
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:11.654
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability and you could say </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly reasonably that regardless of </v>

284
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:15.884
<v Speaker 2>where you're situated in time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are basically your problems and </v>

285
00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:19.694
<v Speaker 2>your goal through life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your path through life is going to be </v>

286
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.143
<v Speaker 2>characterized by the solutions you </v>
<v Speaker 2>either come up with or don't come up </v>

287
00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 2>with to that set of problems.</v>

288
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:33.803
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's one more categorical element </v>

289
00:17:36.481 --> 00:17:37.314
<v Speaker 2>that complicates this picture and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think in many ways it's the most </v>

290
00:17:40.231 --> 00:17:44.260
<v Speaker 2>difficult thing there is to grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll take a shot at it first.</v>

291
00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:48.000
<v Speaker 2>And I've showed you this representation </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

292
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 2>This is the of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can think of the dragon of chaos</v>

293
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 2>as a symbol of totality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and furthermore,</v>

294
00:17:55.441 --> 00:18:00.441
<v Speaker 2>you can think of it in relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this structure</v>

295
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.400
<v Speaker 2>as the source of this structure</v>

296
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:07.643
<v Speaker 2>for even as the source of all structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see in the Sumerian creation </v>

297
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 2>myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

298
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:14.310
<v Speaker 2>the character of Thai amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

299
00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 2>and I told you that word tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt is associated with the later Hebrew</v>

300
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 2>word tail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means chaos,</v>

301
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:22.590
<v Speaker 2>and Tom is the chaos that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

302
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:24.800
<v Speaker 2>well makes order out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes the world out of.</v>

303
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:25.643
<v Speaker 2>So the idea lurking behind the Sumerian </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation myth and then later lurking </v>

304
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:34.230
<v Speaker 2>behind the entire edifice of Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity and Islam for that matter,</v>

305
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.243
<v Speaker 2>is that something that can be best </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented by this figure is best </v>

306
00:18:39.061 --> 00:18:42.240
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized as the ground of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that exists.</v>

307
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the world can that mean?</v>

308
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means something like this.</v>

309
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at the concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical representation.</v>

310
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.890
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a kind of totality here,</v>

311
00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:53.724
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a thing that can live by </v>

312
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.480
<v Speaker 2>devouring itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it has no need of anything outside of</v>

313
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

314
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.370
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is nothing outside of it.</v>

315
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:03.443
<v Speaker 2>It's a figure of absolute totality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's characterized by a strange </v>

316
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.580
<v Speaker 2>intermixture of metaphorical real </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations of matter,</v>

317
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.260
<v Speaker 2>because a snake is something that crawls</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground and spirit because a wayne</v>

318
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:17.094
<v Speaker 2>serpent is something that can fly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore partakes of the metaphorical </v>

319
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:22.440
<v Speaker 2>realm of Heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven and earth,</v>

320
00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:23.274
<v Speaker 2>right totality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yin and Yang from the Dallas </v>

321
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:26.454
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the entire world and it's also </v>

322
00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:29.724
<v Speaker 2>something that's characterized by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity for transformation because a </v>

323
00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:33.634
<v Speaker 2>snake can shed its skin and be reborn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's something that's constantly </v>

324
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.230
<v Speaker 2>renewing itself despite its absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>archaic age and it's also something that</v>

325
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.093
<v Speaker 2>presents a terrible danger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous opportunity because a dragon </v>

326
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:50.250
<v Speaker 2>is something that will burn you if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get anywhere near it,</v>

327
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.180
<v Speaker 2>but also hoards a treasure that's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable than anything else.</v>

328
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Eliana has pointed out that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional classic creation myths,</v>

329
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.160
<v Speaker 2>the Sumerian myth being one example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the hero,</v>

330
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:06.450
<v Speaker 2>whoever the hero is first encounters the</v>
<v Speaker 2>great dragon of chaos,</v>

331
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.880
<v Speaker 2>he either runs away or is paralyzed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>fright.</v>

332
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.133
<v Speaker 2>The world in itself is a complex array </v>
<v Speaker 2>of patterns and those patterns manifest </v>

333
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:19.614
<v Speaker 2>themselves in space and they manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves in time and I think the best </v>

334
00:20:23.101 --> 00:20:23.934
<v Speaker 2>way to get a grip on what those patterns</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be like is to think of them in </v>

335
00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:30.330
<v Speaker 2>terms of music and I think that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>music represents.</v>

336
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Music is this complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three dimensional structure,</v>

337
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.153
<v Speaker 2>full of interwoven patterns of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensions and and and length that </v>

338
00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:43.020
<v Speaker 2>expends itself over time and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to a piece of music,</v>

339
00:20:43.021 --> 00:20:43.854
<v Speaker 2>you can concentrate on one instrument or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another or you can concentrate on a </v>

340
00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:49.420
<v Speaker 2>phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can concentrate on the entire melody</v>

341
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:50.254
<v Speaker 2>or the voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can parse out different elements </v>

342
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:52.984
<v Speaker 2>from the complex background and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the case with very </v>

343
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:56.494
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated orchestral music rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is susceptible to multiple </v>

344
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Speaker 2>reinterpretations and multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounters because of its complexity.</v>

345
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.103
<v Speaker 2>And this is to say only that what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at is far more complicated than </v>

346
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:11.440
<v Speaker 2>what you see or to say.</v>

347
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.273
<v Speaker 2>Alternatively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's more information in </v>

348
00:21:14.591 --> 00:21:18.970
<v Speaker 2>anything you perceive than you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever get complete access to.</v>

349
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly because it's partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of your perceptual systems.</v>

350
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Delude you so we think you look with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your eyes or with your other senses,</v>

351
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 2>but that's only true when you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at what you already know what to look at</v>

352
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 2>right when you've already built </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual machinery that enables you to</v>

353
00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:37.324
<v Speaker 2>detect a particular object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're looking at what you </v>

354
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:44.020
<v Speaker 2>don't know what to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you look is by getting nervous,</v>

355
00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:44.854
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

356
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not precisely a perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

357
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Speaker 2>It's something much more deeper and </v>
<v Speaker 2>primordial than that and it's more like,</v>

358
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.413
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that I cannot categorize </v>

359
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:55.834
<v Speaker 2>either perceptually or cognitively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I do not know how to </v>

360
00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:02.350
<v Speaker 2>respond to has just occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the first categorization is this.</v>

361
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.500
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

362
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.710
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing under that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's merely</v>

363
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.163
<v Speaker 2>fear plus heightened attention and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepares the ground for constructing a </v>

364
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:16.831
<v Speaker 2>more detailed representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that first encounter,</v>

365
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.020
<v Speaker 2>that's the encounter with the dragon of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

366
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.530
<v Speaker 2>So then you take this figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the source of all things,</v>

367
00:22:28.531 --> 00:22:31.080
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dow in some ways,</v>

368
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.211
<v Speaker 2>and you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

369
00:22:33.211 --> 00:22:38.211
<v Speaker 2>how does it manifest itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is something like</v>

370
00:22:40.081 --> 00:22:40.914
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we see this both in the in the </v>

371
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian and the Egyptian myths that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I described to you.</v>

372
00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.740
<v Speaker 2>The first division of the great dragon </v>
<v Speaker 2>of chaos,</v>

373
00:22:52.741 --> 00:22:56.970
<v Speaker 2>or the primordial egg is always into to </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordinate elements.</v>

374
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.540
<v Speaker 2>The great father and the great mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

375
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.643
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's illustrative of a fundamental of </v>

376
00:23:04.591 --> 00:23:07.110
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental binary nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

377
00:23:07.111 --> 00:23:12.111
<v Speaker 2>I guess partly you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a cognizant being,</v>

378
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:17.530
<v Speaker 2>a defined delimited being what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive always has a binary structure.</v>

379
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.673
<v Speaker 2>There's the aspect of you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>structured enough to allow the </v>

380
00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:23.430
<v Speaker 2>perceiving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you know,</v>

381
00:23:23.431 --> 00:23:24.264
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the manner in which you are </v>

382
00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:27.250
<v Speaker 2>structured so that you can even see.</v>

383
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:28.803
<v Speaker 2>You can even formulate a perception </v>
<v Speaker 2>something a child builds up over time </v>

384
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.310
<v Speaker 2>from the primordial aspects say of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>visual system,</v>

385
00:23:35.311 --> 00:23:36.144
<v Speaker 2>has auditory system learns to parse up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world by generating machinery that </v>

386
00:23:40.231 --> 00:23:43.980
<v Speaker 2>allows the complex patterns that make up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world to be turned into objects.</v>

387
00:23:43.981 --> 00:23:44.814
<v Speaker 2>So there's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the structure that allows the </v>

388
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:47.594
<v Speaker 2>perceiving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the thing that's being </v>

389
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:54.641
<v Speaker 2>perceived or the thing behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very complicated distinction.</v>

390
00:23:55.251 --> 00:23:55.671
<v Speaker 2>You'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

391
00:23:55.671 --> 00:23:58.700
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference between the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 2>of chaos?</v>

392
00:23:58.701 --> 00:23:59.534
<v Speaker 2>Say either the representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmos as such and the great mother and </v>

393
00:24:06.081 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's something like this.</v>

394
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.633
<v Speaker 2>The unknown that appears in relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a perceiver is different than the </v>

395
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:17.840
<v Speaker 2>unknown as such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would say this,</v>

396
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:18.674
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are going to be things that </v>

397
00:24:19.851 --> 00:24:23.810
<v Speaker 2>surprise you that wouldn't surprise me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and vice versa,</v>

398
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.913
<v Speaker 2>and the things that would surprise you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be construed in relationship to </v>

399
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:28.964
<v Speaker 2>what you to what you already know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're only going to be </v>

400
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:34.970
<v Speaker 2>surprised by things you don't know and </v>
<v Speaker 2>likewise for me,</v>

401
00:24:34.971 --> 00:24:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm only going to be surprised by things</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

402
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.500
<v Speaker 2>but what we know is going to vary </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat.</v>

403
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.543
<v Speaker 2>So the unknown for you is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than the unknown for me and </v>

404
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:45.554
<v Speaker 2>the great mother is a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the unknown for you or the unknown for </v>

405
00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:52.820
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different for everyone in some sense,</v>

406
00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 2>because we're all going to</v>

407
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:55.283
<v Speaker 4>B,</v>

408
00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.383
<v Speaker 2>we're all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to be stymied and </v>

409
00:24:58.591 --> 00:25:02.160
<v Speaker 2>stopped by different aspects of being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the same as well.</v>

410
00:25:02.161 --> 00:25:02.994
<v Speaker 2>In that when you encounter things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand and you encounter </v>

411
00:25:05.881 --> 00:25:09.300
<v Speaker 2>things you don't understand in many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways,</v>

412
00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.360
<v Speaker 2>you're going to react to those different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things the same way,</v>

413
00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.373
<v Speaker 2>and I can give you a narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>illustration of this King Arthur's </v>

414
00:25:16.951 --> 00:25:19.410
<v Speaker 2>nights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sit around the round table.</v>

415
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.393
<v Speaker 2>They're all equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why they sit around a round </v>

416
00:25:21.601 --> 00:25:22.434
<v Speaker 2>table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

417
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.380
<v Speaker 2>They have a king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The king determines their destinies like</v>

418
00:25:25.381 --> 00:25:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Marta does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're still all equal.</v>

419
00:25:26.971 --> 00:25:29.340
<v Speaker 2>They determined they're going to go look</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the holy grail.</v>

420
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.150
<v Speaker 2>This is the symbol of redemption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're off to find the highest value</v>

421
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.360
<v Speaker 2>like Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wishing on a star,</v>

422
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:37.283
<v Speaker 2>highest value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they all enter the forest to begin </v>

423
00:25:39.691 --> 00:25:40.524
<v Speaker 2>the quest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they each entered at the place that </v>

424
00:25:41.611 --> 00:25:44.670
<v Speaker 2>appears dark as to each of the rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means they all go on different.</v>

425
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:45.773
<v Speaker 2>They all go in different directions even</v>
<v Speaker 2>though they're on the same quest and </v>

426
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.180
<v Speaker 2>theoretically they're inhabiting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same space,</v>

427
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.553
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

428
00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's only to say that every person </v>
<v Speaker 2>has their demons,</v>

429
00:25:56.811 --> 00:25:59.570
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that those demons differ from person</v>

430
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:02.240
<v Speaker 2>to person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though there are things you can say</v>

431
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:04.820
<v Speaker 2>about the demons that are common across </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

432
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:05.930
<v Speaker 2>so we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

433
00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:06.764
<v Speaker 2>from clinical work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from endless clinical work that if you </v>

434
00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 2>want to help someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you identify,</v>

435
00:26:11.001 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to do?</v>

436
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 2>They need to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

437
00:26:13.881 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 2>That's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to do?</v>

438
00:26:15.441 --> 00:26:16.274
<v Speaker 2>Where do you want to go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of structure do you want to </v>

439
00:26:17.961 --> 00:26:20.120
<v Speaker 2>impose on your world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you identify,</v>

440
00:26:20.121 --> 00:26:22.370
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what things are stopping you.</v>

441
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.300
<v Speaker 2>So then you look back at the Sumerian </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation myth and you think,</v>

442
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Appsu,</v>

443
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God of the known timeouts consort,</v>

444
00:26:30.681 --> 00:26:31.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Culture,</v>

445
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 2>but there's also Marta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marta is the power of the spirit,</v>

446
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:40.241
<v Speaker 2>the entity representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sumerian savior who goes out to confront</v>

447
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.120
<v Speaker 2>this and to make the world and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you teach people in behavior</v>

448
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:47.364
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You teach them not so much that you </v>

449
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:51.084
<v Speaker 2>don't teach them habituation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't teach them to get used to </v>

450
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:54.054
<v Speaker 2>things that they're afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You teach them that there's something </v>

451
00:26:55.801 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 2>within them that can respond to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that they're afraid of.</v>

452
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 2>That's as great a magnitude as the fears</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

453
00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
