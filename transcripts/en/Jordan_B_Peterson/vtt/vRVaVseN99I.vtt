1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.043
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked today and these lectures have </v>

4
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 2>now been watched by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been viewed a million times,</v>

5
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 2>so that's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

6
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

7
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.313
<v Speaker 2>Or they've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been glanced at a million times </v>

8
00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 2>that might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also possible.</v>

9
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

10
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 2>well let's get right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So last week,</v>

11
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.233
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think was mostly remarkable for the </v>

12
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 2>absolute dearth of content that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually biblically related.</v>

13
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:57.500
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

14
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.953
<v Speaker 2>I'll just recap what I laid out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that it sets the frame properly for </v>

15
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:07.730
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to discuss tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

16
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I presented you with an elaborated </v>
<v Speaker 2>description of,</v>

17
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.573
<v Speaker 2>of this diagram essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I spent quite a lot of time </v>

18
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:24.760
<v Speaker 2>formulating probably about 25 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

19
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 2>which kind of accounts for its graphic </v>
<v Speaker 2>primitiveness I suppose.</v>

20
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really pushing the limits of my </v>

21
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:34.210
<v Speaker 2>four 86 computer to produce that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you.</v>

22
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

23
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

24
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.913
<v Speaker 2>it's a description or representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the archetypal circumstances of life </v>

25
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.953
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the archetypical circumstances are </v>

26
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:51.361
<v Speaker 2>the circumstances that are true under </v>
<v Speaker 2>all conditions for all time.</v>

27
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.823
<v Speaker 2>And so you can think about them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>descriptively characteristic of the </v>

28
00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:57.274
<v Speaker 2>nature of human experience that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same as the nature of </v>

29
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

30
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.223
<v Speaker 2>because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can divide reality into it's </v>

31
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:11.770
<v Speaker 2>subjective and objective elements and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's utility in doing that,</v>

32
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:12.604
<v Speaker 2>but these sorts of representations don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>play that game that they consider human </v>

33
00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 2>experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>as con con,</v>

34
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 2>constant constituted constitutive of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

35
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 2>and that's how we experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we'll just go with that.</v>

36
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 2>The idea basically is that we always </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist inside a damage structure and that</v>

37
00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:39.241
<v Speaker 2>structure is partly biological and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's partly socio-cultural.</v>

38
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 2>It's partly what's been handed to us by </v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

39
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.623
<v Speaker 2>by our ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both practically in terms of </v>

40
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also psychologically in terms of the</v>

41
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.630
<v Speaker 2>active learning content of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our psyches,</v>

42
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.060
<v Speaker 2>and so that would include,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

43
00:02:58.061 --> 00:02:58.894
<v Speaker 2>our ability to utilize language and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>words that we use and the phrases that </v>

44
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.024
<v Speaker 2>we use and the mutual understanding that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we developed as a consequence of </v>

45
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 2>interacting with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Architecturally speaking,</v>

46
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 2>that structure is always.</v>

47
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.663
<v Speaker 2>It's always been corrupt and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dad is because it was made by </v>

48
00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:19.794
<v Speaker 2>people who are dead and the reason it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt is because things fall apart of </v>

49
00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:27.960
<v Speaker 2>their own accord and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't aim properly,</v>

50
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.590
<v Speaker 2>let's say speeds along that process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>degeneration.</v>

51
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.813
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is something worth </v>

52
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:36.174
<v Speaker 2>knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll try standing back here and </v>

53
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:42.140
<v Speaker 2>see if that problem goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

54
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.763
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that young people </v>
<v Speaker 2>always have a reason to be upset and </v>

55
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 2>cynical about the current state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>affairs and,</v>

56
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 2>and it's that way forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

57
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:57.270
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's useful,</v>

58
00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:58.104
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to consider such consideration sorts </v>

59
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 2>such conceptualizations as the pay of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

60
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.850
<v Speaker 2>as the patriarchy in that light because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an archetypal truth that the social</v>

61
00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:06.684
<v Speaker 2>structure is corrupt and incomplete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is that it's </v>

62
00:04:10.831 --> 00:04:14.610
<v Speaker 2>something that you have to contend with </v>
<v Speaker 2>every moment.</v>

63
00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 2>It's some sense of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an,</v>

64
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.260
<v Speaker 2>it's a permanent fact of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be upset that</v>

65
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.493
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

66
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 2>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social structures,</v>

67
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.053
<v Speaker 2>or even the biological structures within</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we live are incomplete and </v>

68
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 2>imperfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to not take that personally,</v>

69
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:35.944
<v Speaker 2>that that's the worst part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take that personnel personally is a </v>

70
00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:39.574
<v Speaker 2>misreading of the existential condition </v>
<v Speaker 2>of humankind because it's always the </v>

71
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:44.704
<v Speaker 2>case that what you have been given and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you live in is degenerate and </v>

72
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and in need of repair.</v>

73
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.663
<v Speaker 2>And it's easier just to accept that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's also a positive </v>

74
00:04:57.751 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 2>development and the pause development as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

75
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.170
<v Speaker 2>You've been granted something rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than nothing</v>

76
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:06.503
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you haven't been granted pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell because especially in a culture </v>

77
00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:12.510
<v Speaker 2>like ours where many things actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioned quite well.</v>

78
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.630
<v Speaker 2>So there's room for gratitude there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's a broken machine,</v>

79
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:16.464
<v Speaker 2>it's not one that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>devastated and it's not absolutely hell </v>

80
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:22.260
<v Speaker 2>bent on at every second on your misery </v>
<v Speaker 2>and destruction.</v>

81
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.650
<v Speaker 2>And it easily could be because many </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies are like that.</v>

82
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.873
<v Speaker 2>And so the fact that we happen to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in one that isn't corrupt beyond </v>

83
00:05:30.151 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 2>imagining is something to be eternally </v>
<v Speaker 2>grateful for.</v>

84
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.720
<v Speaker 2>While.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we live inside a damage structure and</v>

85
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.450
<v Speaker 2>we also bear responsibility for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage because</v>

86
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.360
<v Speaker 2>we don't do everything we can to </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly repair it.</v>

87
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.703
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's actually one of the </v>

88
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:51.960
<v Speaker 2>fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:52.651
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

90
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:53.484
<v Speaker 2>what's the meaning of life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they really mean is what's the </v>

91
00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:56.214
<v Speaker 2>positive meeting of light?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because as we've already discussed that </v>

92
00:05:57.761 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 2>negative meanings of life or more or </v>
<v Speaker 2>less self evident,</v>

93
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.273
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the positive meaning of life is to be </v>

94
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 2>found in noting the state of lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>repair,</v>

95
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the walled city that you inhabit,</v>

96
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 2>and then sally selling forth to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about that,</v>

97
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:17.981
<v Speaker 2>to repair the breaches and to fix up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>walls and to make the structure that you</v>

98
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:23.291
<v Speaker 2>inhabit as secure and as productive as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it possibly can be.</v>

99
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.533
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

100
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.030
<v Speaker 2>there's no shortage of opportunities to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

101
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.620
<v Speaker 2>You can do that in your own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do that in your own room.</v>

102
00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:37.840
<v Speaker 2>You can do that in your own household,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your local community,</v>

103
00:06:37.841 --> 00:06:41.160
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe if you get good at doing it at</v>

104
00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:43.680
<v Speaker 2>all those levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can start to look beyond that.</v>

105
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.903
<v Speaker 2>And so there's challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that's kind of </v>

106
00:06:46.651 --> 00:06:47.484
<v Speaker 2>interesting about this insufficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure is that it has a set of </v>

107
00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:50.754
<v Speaker 2>challenges built into it because of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>insufficiency and perhaps even because </v>

108
00:06:54.091 --> 00:06:54.924
<v Speaker 2>of its corrupt nature that calls forth </v>
<v Speaker 2>the potential response from you of </v>

109
00:07:00.571 --> 00:07:01.404
<v Speaker 2>heroic adventure and the heroic </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure is to man the barricades and </v>

110
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.930
<v Speaker 2>repair the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can always do that.</v>

111
00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:13.050
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what's your personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances are.</v>

112
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.590
<v Speaker 2>There's always something that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>right near you,</v>

113
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.810
<v Speaker 2>isn't correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't laid out properly,</v>

114
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.030
<v Speaker 2>that you could just fix if you want it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

115
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.160
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about tonight is the idea that</v>

116
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.870
<v Speaker 2>if you adopt the attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an attitude that's like that,</v>

117
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.880
<v Speaker 2>that the rule that you should play is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make things better wherever you are.</v>

118
00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:40.510
<v Speaker 2>However you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That what would actually happen would be</v>

119
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:44.140
<v Speaker 2>that things would get better wherever </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are in all sorts of ways.</v>

120
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:47.470
<v Speaker 2>And that we've really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a species you might say,</v>

121
00:07:47.471 --> 00:07:50.680
<v Speaker 2>or maybe even as singular individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

122
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.150
<v Speaker 2>we've explored that rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't something that's put forth as a</v>

123
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:55.984
<v Speaker 2>proposition that often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's quite surprising to me and you </v>

124
00:07:58.631 --> 00:07:59.464
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an interesting experience the </v>

125
00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:02.470
<v Speaker 2>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the keg,</v>

126
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.430
<v Speaker 2>I go there because I have food allergies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're very careful with people who</v>

127
00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:07.264
<v Speaker 2>have food allergies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the waiter took me to the table and </v>

128
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:11.044
<v Speaker 2>he said that he had been watching my </v>
<v Speaker 2>lectures and that's a very common </v>

129
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:19.531
<v Speaker 2>experience and he was happy about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said that he'd had two promotions</v>

130
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:20.794
<v Speaker 2>at the keg in the last four months </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he'd been watching my lectures </v>

131
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:27.850
<v Speaker 2>and like I really found that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>affecting experience because,</v>

132
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:28.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

133
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:29.554
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's working as a waiter at the keg and </v>

134
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:32.800
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing particularly heroic </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

135
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.653
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I disagree with that actually </v>

136
00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:38.050
<v Speaker 2>because I don't care where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>located,</v>

137
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:38.884
<v Speaker 2>you can do a hell of a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that literally at whatever </v>

138
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:42.850
<v Speaker 2>job you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

139
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.450
<v Speaker 2>you can take whatever job you have and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make it a real nice little piece</v>

140
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:49.750
<v Speaker 2>of absolute misery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you can do.</v>

141
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.820
<v Speaker 2>You can act like a civilized human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

142
00:08:51.821 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 2>And notice that no matter where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

143
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a richness</v>

144
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 4>and a complexity that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>inexhaustible,</v>

145
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 4>right at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you can take that seriously and</v>

146
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 4>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

147
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 4>I happened to be a waiter at the keg and</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps that's not what I expected.</v>

148
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.414
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's a young guy and perhaps that </v>

149
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 4>isn't where I want to end up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not nothing,</v>

150
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 4>it's a rich environment and I can make </v>
<v Speaker 4>it a lot better if I want to.</v>

151
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:18.114
<v Speaker 4>I can get along properly with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>coworkers and not gossip behind their </v>

152
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:21.264
<v Speaker 4>back and I can treat my customers </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly and if an opportunity comes my </v>

153
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 4>way I can take it and I can see what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

154
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.933
<v Speaker 4>And so he said that's what he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>started doing and that things were </v>

155
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:32.784
<v Speaker 4>working out much better for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was in a much better job than he was </v>

156
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 4>three months ago in three months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nothing,</v>

157
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

158
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.693
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a nice trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an uphill trajectory and that's </v>

159
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:42.894
<v Speaker 4>what you want really an uphill </v>
<v Speaker 4>trajectory is actually even better than </v>

160
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 4>being somewhere good as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned because one of the things that</v>

161
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.154
<v Speaker 4>really makes your life meaningful is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>clear realization that you're headed </v>

162
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:53.754
<v Speaker 4>somewhere better than you are now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it's even better if you also </v>

163
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:57.324
<v Speaker 4>understand that there's a direct causal </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship between the things that </v>

164
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:02.580
<v Speaker 4>you're doing and the steepness of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>inclined.</v>

165
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 4>And so I get a lot of letters from </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like that and they're more,</v>

166
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 4>most frequently young men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although not always.</v>

167
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 4>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

168
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:10.674
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been listening to these lectures </v>

169
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 4>and I decided that I'm going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take responsibility for my life.</v>

170
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:16.164
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've started to stop doing all the </v>

171
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:20.710
<v Speaker 4>stupid things that I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

172
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 4>that are stupid that I know I shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>be doing.</v>

173
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.113
<v Speaker 4>And I've started doing some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that aren't stupid that I know I </v>

174
00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Speaker 4>should be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which seems pretty obvious really if you</v>

175
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:29.364
<v Speaker 4>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it obvious though it may be that </v>

176
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:34.290
<v Speaker 4>isn't necessarily what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they write and say,</v>

177
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.930
<v Speaker 4>you can't believe what difference that </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes.</v>

178
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:37.883
<v Speaker 4>And they're thrilled about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm thrilled about it when I get </v>

179
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:40.644
<v Speaker 4>letters like that because I really don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience anything as better than a </v>

180
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:46.224
<v Speaker 4>letter like that or a message like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's so good to see things that </v>

181
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 4>aren't so good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>replaced by something better.</v>

182
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 4>And I really do think it's an open </v>
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>

183
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:56.694
<v Speaker 4>I truly believe it's an open question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To what degree we could make things </v>

184
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 4>better if that's what we actually aimed </v>
<v Speaker 4>at doing.</v>

185
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some of the stories that we've,</v>

186
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:05.783
<v Speaker 4>we've covered already the story of Cain </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Abel in particular is really an </v>

187
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 4>analysis of that problem which is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>remarkable that it occurs so,</v>

188
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.310
<v Speaker 4>so early in this document.</v>

189
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 4>It's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such a foundational story.</v>

190
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 4>And it basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

191
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 4>there's two modes of being in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

192
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:26.241
<v Speaker 4>There's one where you adopt the </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility for living properly,</v>

193
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 4>for being properly and you make the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifices necessary for doing that.</v>

194
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:34.710
<v Speaker 4>And then everything will flourish </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>

195
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:35.723
<v Speaker 4>And the other one is a pathway of </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentment and bitterness and rejection </v>

196
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 4>and murder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And genocide,</v>

197
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:46.251
<v Speaker 4>and that just seems exactly right to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if the positive path beckons,</v>

198
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:50.010
<v Speaker 4>if you can actually see what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can,</v>

199
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.500
<v Speaker 4>if you can lower yourself enough to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is.</v>

200
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.363
<v Speaker 4>Young Carl Young said once that modern </v>
<v Speaker 4>people didn't see God because they </v>

201
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:59.320
<v Speaker 4>didn't look low enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a phrase I really,</v>

202
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 4>really like because people denigrate the</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities that are right in front of</v>

203
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:04.204
<v Speaker 4>them and there's no reason to do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what's right in front of you is </v>

204
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 4>the majesty of being.</v>

205
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.993
<v Speaker 4>That's what's right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's inexhaustibly complex and full of </v>

206
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:13.954
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's no reason to assume that </v>

207
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 4>wherever you happen to be isn't as good </v>
<v Speaker 4>as starting place as anywhere else.</v>

208
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:20.981
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

209
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 4>I know some people have terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible lives.</v>

210
00:12:23.381 --> 00:12:26.050
<v Speaker 4>They're in situations that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely unbearable and,</v>

211
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.153
<v Speaker 4>but I also do know that even situations </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that can be made a hell of a lot </v>

212
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 4>worse by the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

213
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.820
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the worst kind of attitude.</v>

214
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 4>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

215
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.240
<v Speaker 4>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's where you are,</v>

216
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 4>you're in a damaged structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a damaged structure,</v>

217
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:40.534
<v Speaker 4>you're in a damaged structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know at least it's got some </v>

218
00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:45.094
<v Speaker 4>walls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you're not being fed to the </v>

219
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 4>lions on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a good thing and you can,</v>

220
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.780
<v Speaker 4>you can emerge forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

221
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:52.683
<v Speaker 4>heroically magically to confront the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos that constantly threatens the </v>

222
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:58.204
<v Speaker 4>structure within which you live and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can free something as a consequence of </v>

223
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

224
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 4>You can learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can strengthen yourself.</v>

225
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:04.984
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the way what you're actually </v>

226
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 4>made of in many ways that what informs </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

227
00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 4>what you're made of is what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounter when you voluntarily encounter</v>

228
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:15.094
<v Speaker 4>the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the more you voluntarily </v>

229
00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:17.404
<v Speaker 4>encountered the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you get made of and the more </v>

230
00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:21.130
<v Speaker 4>you get made of the more there is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

231
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:21.964
<v Speaker 4>And then the more you're good at </v>
<v Speaker 4>encountering the unknown and </v>

232
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:25.114
<v Speaker 4>restructuring order and calling forth </v>
<v Speaker 4>proper order out of the potential of </v>

233
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And God,</v>

234
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 4>you got to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't you do that?</v>

235
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 4>Since you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's an endless mystery.</v>

236
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:38.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think part of it is that people,</v>

237
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.933
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also encapsulated to stumped some </v>

238
00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:42.514
<v Speaker 4>degree in the story of Adam and Eve </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what happens to Adam is when he </v>

239
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:46.360
<v Speaker 4>becomes self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

240
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.353
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he becomes ashamed of his self in </v>

241
00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:52.690
<v Speaker 4>regards himself as a lowly sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>creature and there's endless reasons why</v>

242
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:53.524
<v Speaker 4>people would do that because of course </v>
<v Speaker 4>were rife with imperfection and so he </v>

243
00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:57.454
<v Speaker 4>hides from God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's actually the answer </v>

244
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:03.640
<v Speaker 4>to the conundrum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that people don't aspire to the</v>

245
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:04.474
<v Speaker 4>highest good because they're deeply </v>
<v Speaker 4>ashamed of themselves and their </v>

246
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:12.190
<v Speaker 4>weaknesses and their insufficiencies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's,</v>

247
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 4>it's not the only reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

248
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.073
<v Speaker 4>there's the desire to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility and there's all the </v>

249
00:14:17.951 --> 00:14:18.784
<v Speaker 4>negative motivations as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like resentment and hatred and the </v>

250
00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:25.270
<v Speaker 4>desire to make things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>

251
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.363
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give us,</v>

252
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 4>given us too much of a break,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

253
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.463
<v Speaker 4>but it's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's okay to not be in a very good </v>

254
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:35.314
<v Speaker 4>place if what you're trying to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that not very good place is make it </v>

255
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:37.960
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

256
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.793
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things I really have </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned as a clinical psychologist is </v>

257
00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:45.380
<v Speaker 4>that you just cannot believe how </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful incremental progress is you.</v>

258
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 4>You can do the calculations like it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like compound interest,</v>

259
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:49.414
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you make your life a 10th of a </v>

260
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:53.950
<v Speaker 4>percent a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man in two or three years years,</v>

261
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.940
<v Speaker 4>you're in such a better place than you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>

262
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:56.774
<v Speaker 4>that it isn't even like the same domain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you keep that up for 10 years or </v>

263
00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:02.181
<v Speaker 4>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

264
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're young and you start</v>
<v Speaker 4>early,</v>

265
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 4>you start to straighten yourself out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fix the things that you can fix.</v>

266
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.110
<v Speaker 4>You can transform your lives in ways </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are completely unimaginable.</v>

267
00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:12.944
<v Speaker 4>And God only knows what the upper limit </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that is in terms of human </v>

268
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 4>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we are amazing creatures,</v>

269
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:19.964
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we really get our act together and </v>

270
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.720
<v Speaker 4>stop running at 10 percent of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>capacity.</v>

271
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.300
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

272
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.860
<v Speaker 4>so that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got,</v>

273
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:28.723
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that things aren't exactly the </v>

274
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:32.780
<v Speaker 4>way they should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least gives you something to do.</v>

275
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.340
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

276
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.031
<v Speaker 4>that's and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

277
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:35.864
<v Speaker 4>and maybe something great to do because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no shortage of suffering and </v>

278
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:43.211
<v Speaker 4>trouble that besets the world that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could conceivably ameliorate in some way</v>

279
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:44.684
<v Speaker 4>and the utility and meaning the utility </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that and the intrinsic meaning of </v>

280
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:50.084
<v Speaker 4>that is self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it also makes me curious about </v>

281
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 4>nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

282
00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:55.724
<v Speaker 4>in despair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I mean I understand those </v>

283
00:15:57.711 --> 00:16:01.250
<v Speaker 4>emotions and understand them deeply and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the intellectual mindset that goes along</v>

284
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 4>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they just see beside the point to me</v>

285
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:04.604
<v Speaker 4>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there are so many things that </v>

286
00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:07.154
<v Speaker 4>need doing that all you really have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do is open your eyes and look at them </v>

287
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 4>and then decide that you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to do something about them.</v>

288
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 4>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

289
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.700
<v Speaker 4>what's within my scope of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

290
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 4>of is so trivial that it's not worth </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

291
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:23.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like it won't stay trivial for long</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do it not at all.</v>

292
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:25.670
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think it's trivial to begin </v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

293
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:26.563
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't believe that anything </v>

294
00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:28.964
<v Speaker 4>done right is trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my experience in my life has been </v>

295
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:32.684
<v Speaker 4>that anything I actually did paid off it</v>
<v Speaker 4>did didn't pay off necessarily in the </v>

296
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 4>way that I expected it to pay off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole different story.</v>

297
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.090
<v Speaker 4>But if it was genuine commitment to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

298
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.133
<v Speaker 4>even if it went sideways and the outcome</v>
<v Speaker 4>was really something other than what I </v>

299
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:48.344
<v Speaker 4>expected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the net consequence over time was </v>

300
00:16:50.151 --> 00:16:50.984
<v Speaker 4>nothing but good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So every new frontier that can be </v>

301
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:55.934
<v Speaker 4>conquered is an advance forward and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no shortage of frontier because </v>

302
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.130
<v Speaker 4>we're surrounded by the unknown.</v>

303
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:01.963
<v Speaker 4>We're surrounded by our own ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we can continually move into that </v>

304
00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 4>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the domain of chaos,</v>

305
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 4>or we can restructure pathological order</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

306
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 4>that's the secret to proper being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you encounter chaos.</v>

307
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:17.474
<v Speaker 4>That way you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you can regard yourself as the </v>

308
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:21.530
<v Speaker 4>sort of entity that despite its </v>
<v Speaker 4>insufficiency,</v>

309
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.270
<v Speaker 4>has the capability to conquer chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Despite the danger of that.</v>

310
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:27.104
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the fact that you're fragile is </v>

311
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:31.280
<v Speaker 4>actually a precondition for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>heroism.</v>

312
00:17:31.281 --> 00:17:32.114
<v Speaker 4>Because if you weren't fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there'd be nothing heroic about </v>

313
00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:35.180
<v Speaker 4>doing something difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

314
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:36.014
<v Speaker 4>Because if you couldn't be hurt or </v>
<v Speaker 4>damaged or defeated or or end up in </v>

315
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.360
<v Speaker 4>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then where's the.</v>

316
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Where's the moral courage in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>endeavor it has.</v>

317
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 4>It has to be that the fragility is built</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the courage and so it's not a.</v>

318
00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 4>it's not a reason not to engage in it at</v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

319
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quite the contrary and so</v>

320
00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:01.640
<v Speaker 4>well and so then you know what do you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>while you put the city back together and</v>

321
00:18:01.641 --> 00:18:02.474
<v Speaker 4>maybe the way you want it so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>functional and efficient and beautiful </v>

322
00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:07.124
<v Speaker 4>and so the people can flourish there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>and and flourish in a manner that makes </v>

323
00:18:10.851 --> 00:18:14.430
<v Speaker 4>them like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes them what w?</v>

324
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.293
<v Speaker 4>W,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say that makes them feel </v>

325
00:18:17.181 --> 00:18:22.181
<v Speaker 4>that the unbearable catastrophe of being</v>
<v Speaker 4>is worth it for the experience.</v>

326
00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:26.060
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're aiming at and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not an impossibility.</v>

327
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.360
<v Speaker 4>It's not an impossibility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then not only that,</v>

328
00:18:29.361 --> 00:18:31.580
<v Speaker 4>not only do you repair the city when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>

329
00:18:31.581 --> 00:18:32.414
<v Speaker 4>but you make yourself the sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that continually repairs the city and </v>

330
00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:39.560
<v Speaker 4>that's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the end goal because it's not the</v>

331
00:18:39.561 --> 00:18:41.180
<v Speaker 4>repair of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the goal.</v>

332
00:18:41.181 --> 00:18:42.014
<v Speaker 4>It's the transformation of yourself into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that continually repairs the </v>

333
00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:46.424
<v Speaker 4>city and so there's just no reason for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that not to happen and the more it can </v>

334
00:18:53.151 --> 00:18:53.990
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the better.</v>

335
00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.393
<v Speaker 4>Well there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an under current to this story </v>

336
00:19:00.711 --> 00:19:01.544
<v Speaker 4>and that is also the story of the flood </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the fact that you know the </v>

337
00:19:05.241 --> 00:19:06.074
<v Speaker 4>city can become corrupt because people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't engage in heroic endeavor perhaps </v>

338
00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:11.900
<v Speaker 4>because they engage in precisely the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposite of that,</v>

339
00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:12.734
<v Speaker 4>which is outright destructive behavior </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is also something that's worth </v>

340
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.950
<v Speaker 4>considering too because if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

341
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.340
<v Speaker 4>if you consider your your own manner of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

342
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.303
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

343
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 4>you can say things to people like tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell the truth and be good,</v>

344
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.020
<v Speaker 4>and those are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are cliches obviously,</v>

345
00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 4>and so they lack power because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>cliches,</v>

346
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:37.344
<v Speaker 4>but you can take them apart and utilize </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in a manner that stops being a </v>

347
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:45.750
<v Speaker 4>cliche and you do that by being more </v>
<v Speaker 4>humble about them.</v>

348
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.643
<v Speaker 4>I would say because maybe you can't tell</v>
<v Speaker 4>the truth because you don't know what </v>

349
00:19:49.081 --> 00:19:49.914
<v Speaker 4>the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one thing you can do is you can </v>

350
00:19:51.631 --> 00:19:54.750
<v Speaker 4>start saying things that you know to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>untrue and you might say,</v>

351
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:56.550
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do I know that they're untrue?</v>

352
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.470
<v Speaker 4>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

353
00:19:58.471 --> 00:19:59.304
<v Speaker 4>you need a whole philosophy of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The elaboration of an entire philosophy </v>

354
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 4>of truth to answer that question and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to bother answering that</v>

355
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:06.960
<v Speaker 4>question because in some sense at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>

356
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:09.000
<v Speaker 4>it's beside the point that isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>

357
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.043
<v Speaker 4>The issue is there are times in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life where you know that the thing that </v>

358
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:14.910
<v Speaker 4>you're saying is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a deception.</v>

359
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.773
<v Speaker 4>It's a lie of some sort and you're using</v>
<v Speaker 4>it to manipulate yourself or another </v>

360
00:20:19.021 --> 00:20:21.510
<v Speaker 4>person or the world and you're also </v>
<v Speaker 4>possessed,</v>

361
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:22.344
<v Speaker 4>fully possessed of the idea that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>get away with it and there's a satanic </v>

362
00:20:25.381 --> 00:20:26.214
<v Speaker 4>arrogance about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If in fact that is the archetypal </v>

363
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.860
<v Speaker 4>arrogance that's portrayed in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mythological character of Satan.</v>

364
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:36.861
<v Speaker 4>Because Satan is precisely the archetype</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the element of the mind that believes</v>

365
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:39.930
<v Speaker 4>that it can twist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

366
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 4>and banned the structure of reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>without paying the price for that.</v>

367
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.830
<v Speaker 4>And you can't imagine anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>more arrogant than not because really do</v>

368
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:48.664
<v Speaker 4>you really think that you can twist the </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of a reality and that that's </v>

369
00:20:51.881 --> 00:20:54.400
<v Speaker 4>going to work out for you without it </v>
<v Speaker 4>snapping back.</v>

370
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 4>It's so obvious that that can't work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

371
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 4>that everyone knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but anyways,</v>

372
00:20:58.661 --> 00:21:01.480
<v Speaker 4>back to the initial point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

373
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.440
<v Speaker 4>buy it by the rules of the game that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

374
00:21:04.441 --> 00:21:05.274
<v Speaker 4>yourself are playing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that some of the Times you're violating </v>

375
00:21:08.131 --> 00:21:10.530
<v Speaker 4>the rules of the game that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing.</v>

376
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.903
<v Speaker 4>And the first issue with regards to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stating the truth or behaving in a </v>

377
00:21:16.741 --> 00:21:17.574
<v Speaker 4>responsible manner would be merely </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped cheating at whatever game it is </v>

378
00:21:22.171 --> 00:21:23.004
<v Speaker 4>that you've chosen to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good start and that'll </v>

379
00:21:26.011 --> 00:21:28.230
<v Speaker 4>straightened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'll straighten out your life.</v>

380
00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:30.600
<v Speaker 4>It'll start in the street and start to </v>
<v Speaker 4>straighten out your life.</v>

381
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.093
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

382
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.610
<v Speaker 4>well the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

383
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.590
<v Speaker 4>How does the flood tie into this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

384
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:38.483
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we live in a corrupt structure were </v>

385
00:21:39.541 --> 00:21:42.030
<v Speaker 4>corrupt as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live in a corrupt structure,</v>

386
00:21:42.031 --> 00:21:44.460
<v Speaker 4>and part of that corruption has just </v>
<v Speaker 4>happenstance.</v>

387
00:21:44.461 --> 00:21:45.294
<v Speaker 4>It's the way things fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the other part of it is that not </v>

388
00:21:47.701 --> 00:21:51.840
<v Speaker 4>only are we not aiming up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're actually aiming down and the flood</v>

389
00:21:51.841 --> 00:21:52.674
<v Speaker 4>story is a warning and it's a very clear</v>
<v Speaker 4>warning and the warning is if you aim </v>

390
00:21:56.491 --> 00:22:01.230
<v Speaker 4>down enough and then if enough of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>aim down at the same time,</v>

391
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.340
<v Speaker 4>everything will degenerate into </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's</v>

392
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:11.220
<v Speaker 4>indistinguishable from the chaos from </v>
<v Speaker 4>which things emerged at the beginning of</v>

393
00:22:11.221 --> 00:22:13.160
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that because the,</v>

394
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.103
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cosmos that's presented in in </v>

395
00:22:15.721 --> 00:22:18.690
<v Speaker 4>mythological representations is chaos </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus order.</v>

396
00:22:18.691 --> 00:22:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The order is on top.</v>

397
00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:20.814
<v Speaker 4>You might say in the chaos is always </v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath and the chaos can break </v>

398
00:22:23.281 --> 00:22:24.114
<v Speaker 4>through or the order can crumble and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can fall into the chaos and that chaos </v>

399
00:22:26.521 --> 00:22:28.860
<v Speaker 4>is intermingled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intermingled potential,</v>

400
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:34.100
<v Speaker 4>and the way that you destroy the order </v>
<v Speaker 4>and let the chaos rise back up,</v>

401
00:22:34.531 --> 00:22:36.840
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly how it's portrayed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the flood story,</v>

402
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.943
<v Speaker 4>is by</v>

403
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by inhabiting the corpse of your father.</v>

404
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:42.694
<v Speaker 4>That's one mythological motif and </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding on the remains and with no </v>

405
00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:51.451
<v Speaker 4>gratitude and no attempt to replenish </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is that you're taking from.</v>

406
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:53.643
<v Speaker 4>And the warning and the flood story is </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do that for very long because </v>

407
00:22:57.581 --> 00:23:00.880
<v Speaker 4>things will happen that are so awful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cannot possibly imagine it,</v>

408
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.043
<v Speaker 4>and that'll happen to you personally and</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened to your family and it'll </v>

409
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:04.774
<v Speaker 4>happen to your community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's happened to people over and </v>

410
00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:07.430
<v Speaker 4>over throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's.</v>

411
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.070
<v Speaker 4>It's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know it's.</v>

412
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.650
<v Speaker 4>It's very soon after the story of Cain </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Abel.</v>

413
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.580
<v Speaker 4>When you see evil enter the world in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>story of Adam and Eve,</v>

414
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.780
<v Speaker 4>along with self consciousness and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is the ability.</v>

415
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.500
<v Speaker 4>That's the knowledge of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the ability to hurt other people,</v>

416
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.540
<v Speaker 4>self-consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to know what you're doing.</v>

417
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.530
<v Speaker 4>And then of course instantly cane takes </v>
<v Speaker 4>that to the absolute extreme and he uses</v>

418
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:33.820
<v Speaker 4>that capacity to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to destroy really what he loves best.</v>

419
00:23:33.821 --> 00:23:37.120
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets as close as a human being can to</v>

420
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:40.120
<v Speaker 4>destroying the divine ideal because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course his brother is able,</v>

421
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:43.090
<v Speaker 4>enable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is favored by God and and destroys them.</v>

422
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 4>Which cane tells God at the end of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>episode that his punishment is more than</v>

423
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 4>he can bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think the reason for that is where</v>

424
00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:54.320
<v Speaker 4>are you once you destroy your own ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's left for you?</v>

425
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 4>There's nowhere to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no APP,</v>

426
00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.693
<v Speaker 4>and when there's no APP,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of down and you know </v>

427
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:06.140
<v Speaker 4>there's an idea that was put forth very </v>
<v Speaker 4>nicely in Milton's paradise lost when he</v>

428
00:24:06.141 --> 00:24:09.290
<v Speaker 4>was describing from a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

429
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:14.620
<v Speaker 4>Essentially what hell is hell is your </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhale to the degree that you're distant</v>

430
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:16.934
<v Speaker 4>from the good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that might be a good way of </v>

431
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it.</v>

432
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.323
<v Speaker 4>And if you destroy your own ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you do with jealousy and </v>

433
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 4>resentment and and the desire to pull </v>
<v Speaker 4>down people who you would like to be,</v>

434
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:28.424
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you end up in a situation that's </v>

435
00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:33.590
<v Speaker 4>indistinguishable from hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the way the story,</v>

436
00:24:33.591 --> 00:24:35.460
<v Speaker 4>the biblical story unfolds as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

437
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.810
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Cain and then it's the flood.</v>

438
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.730
<v Speaker 4>And so kane adopts this mode of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's antithetical to being itself,</v>

439
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:46.110
<v Speaker 4>at least a positive being itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does it voluntarily,</v>

440
00:24:46.111 --> 00:24:48.830
<v Speaker 4>he does it knowing full well what he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

441
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.083
<v Speaker 4>And the net consequence of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that as it ripples through the entire </v>

442
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Speaker 4>social structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that God stands back and says,</v>

443
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.223
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing has got so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing we can do is wipe it to </v>

444
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:01.700
<v Speaker 4>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is,</v>

445
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.300
<v Speaker 4>that is no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly how things work.</v>

446
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.433
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily terrifying about that </v>

447
00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:10.910
<v Speaker 4>sequence of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I believe this to be true,</v>

448
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:11.803
<v Speaker 4>I think I realized this independently of</v>
<v Speaker 4>any of the analysis that I was doing of </v>

449
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:17.084
<v Speaker 4>mythological stories because I looked at</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened in places like the Soviet </v>

450
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.223
<v Speaker 4>Union and in Mao's China and in Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany and the most penetrating </v>

451
00:25:24.801 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 4>observers of those societies.</v>

452
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:27.523
<v Speaker 4>The people who are most interested in </v>
<v Speaker 4>how it was that those absolute </v>

453
00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 4>catastrophes came about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all said the same thing.</v>

454
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.660
<v Speaker 4>It was rooted in the degeneration of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals who made up the society.</v>

455
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hear well,</v>

456
00:25:40.161 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 4>people will fault were following orders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

457
00:25:42.231 --> 00:25:42.811
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

458
00:25:42.811 --> 00:25:46.640
<v Speaker 4>that explanation doesn't hold water or </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you'd be punished if you resisted.</v>

459
00:25:46.641 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some truth in that,</v>

460
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:49.580
<v Speaker 4>but nowhere near as much as people might</v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

461
00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:50.414
<v Speaker 4>especially at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>process more it was that people decided </v>

462
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:54.794
<v Speaker 4>each and every one of them to turn a </v>
<v Speaker 4>blind eye to the catastrophes and to </v>

463
00:25:57.621 --> 00:26:01.760
<v Speaker 4>participate in the lies and that worked </v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire societies and they went,</v>

464
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:02.594
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

465
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:03.643
<v Speaker 4>they veered their way downward to </v>
<v Speaker 4>something as closely approximating hell </v>

466
00:26:07.281 --> 00:26:08.114
<v Speaker 4>as you could hope to manage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in places like Nazi Germany </v>

467
00:26:10.581 --> 00:26:13.520
<v Speaker 4>and well in all three of those places </v>
<v Speaker 4>and in Mao's,</v>

468
00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:14.354
<v Speaker 4>China and the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the thing that's so frightening </v>

469
00:26:17.181 --> 00:26:18.014
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's so frightening </v>

470
00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:22.580
<v Speaker 4>about the stories in genesis is they say</v>
<v Speaker 4>something very clear,</v>

471
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:23.414
<v Speaker 4>which is that your moral degeneration </v>
<v Speaker 4>contributes in no small way to the </v>

472
00:26:27.951 --> 00:26:31.910
<v Speaker 4>degeneration of the entire cosmos and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>

473
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:35.090
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like my life to be meaningful.</v>

474
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.850
<v Speaker 4>People say that really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you really?</v>

475
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 4>You really would like your life to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful.</v>

476
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:43.100
<v Speaker 4>You think maybe people would trade a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little nihilism to not have to face that</v>

477
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 4>realization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think people do that all the time.</v>

478
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.080
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrible wait to to to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we are networked together in that.</v>

479
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 4>That's the price of or let's say that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the vulnerability that's associated with</v>

480
00:26:58.141 --> 00:26:58.974
<v Speaker 4>our intense capacity to communicate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is certainly possible that the </v>

481
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:05.363
<v Speaker 4>ripples of our individual actions have </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences that are far beyond the </v>

482
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:14.370
<v Speaker 4>limits of our immediate consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I also think people know that too.</v>

483
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 4>They know that in the way that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>know things when they don't want to know</v>

484
00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means they know them,</v>

485
00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:22.110
<v Speaker 4>embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can feel them,</v>

486
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:24.510
<v Speaker 4>they can sense them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have an emotional response to them,</v>

487
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.493
<v Speaker 4>but there's no damn way they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>let them become articulate because they </v>

488
00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:28.374
<v Speaker 4>don't want to know and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling guilty and ashamed about the </v>

489
00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:32.244
<v Speaker 4>things you've done or not done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know that can get out of hand as </v>

490
00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:35.310
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

491
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.143
<v Speaker 4>It's often because there is a crooked </v>
<v Speaker 4>little part of you that's aiming at the </v>

492
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:41.610
<v Speaker 4>worst possible outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

493
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.800
<v Speaker 4>one of the things you said about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shadow,</v>

494
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:44.634
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that famous idea that everyone has a </v>

495
00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 4>dark side and that that dark side needs </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be incorporated and made conscious.</v>

496
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:54.660
<v Speaker 4>Young said to the shadow of the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

497
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.780
<v Speaker 4>reaches all the way to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he actually,</v>

498
00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:58.763
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing that's so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>about interesting about reading Carl </v>

499
00:28:00.781 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 4>young is he actually means what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a metaphor.</v>

500
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:05.334
<v Speaker 4>It's like the part of you that's twisted</v>
<v Speaker 4>against being is aligned with the part </v>

501
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.173
<v Speaker 4>of the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say the conscious cosmos that's </v>

502
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:19.500
<v Speaker 4>aiming at making everything as terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>as it can possibly be and you know,</v>

503
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:20.334
<v Speaker 4>it's a terrible shock to realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's partly why people don't realize </v>

504
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:26.700
<v Speaker 4>that it's something that people keep at </v>
<v Speaker 4>an arm's length.</v>

505
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.040
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same as recognizing yourself as</v>

506
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:29.874
<v Speaker 4>a Nazi concentration camp guard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a very useful exercise because </v>

507
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:38.330
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely no reason why you </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't have been or still could be one</v>

508
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.160
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you think otherwise,</v>

509
00:28:41.161 --> 00:28:41.994
<v Speaker 4>then all the more reason for assuming </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you would be unable to resist the </v>

510
00:28:45.821 --> 00:28:48.250
<v Speaker 4>temptation if it wasn't in fact offered </v>
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>

511
00:28:48.251 --> 00:28:49.840
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>temptation,</v>

512
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.943
<v Speaker 4>then</v>

513
00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.093
<v Speaker 4>the then there's so much that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know about human beings that you're not </v>

514
00:28:54.831 --> 00:28:57.650
<v Speaker 4>even in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if it wasn't a temptation,</v>

515
00:28:57.651 --> 00:28:59.420
<v Speaker 4>then people bloody well wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>done it.</v>

516
00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.240
<v Speaker 4>And plenty of people did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's no wonder.</v>

517
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.750
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So things get serious in genesis very,</v>

518
00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:11.310
<v Speaker 4>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

519
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.710
<v Speaker 4>and the depth of the seriousness is </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate archetipal.</v>

520
00:29:15.711 --> 00:29:18.650
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets as serious as it can get.</v>

521
00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:27.570
<v Speaker 4>The story of Noah and the flood opens in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fragmentary manner.</v>

522
00:29:28.391 --> 00:29:32.290
<v Speaker 4>And I believe that these passages are </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of a longer story,</v>

523
00:29:32.291 --> 00:29:37.291
<v Speaker 4>that we only have bits and pieces of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also one that's fragmented in its in</v>

524
00:29:37.481 --> 00:29:38.314
<v Speaker 4>its,</v>

525
00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.103
<v Speaker 4>it's parts of than one story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it starts like this and it came to </v>

526
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:45.424
<v Speaker 4>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When men began to multiply on the face </v>

527
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:47.314
<v Speaker 4>of the earth and daughters were born </v>
<v Speaker 4>unto them that the sons of God saw the </v>

528
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:52.384
<v Speaker 4>daughters of men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they were fair and they took them </v>

529
00:29:54.791 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 4>wives of all which they chose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's an idea there.</v>

530
00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.733
<v Speaker 4>There's two ways of looking at the past </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can kind of see that in in the </v>

531
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:05.644
<v Speaker 4>political landscape that we inhabit now </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the more conservative end of the </v>

532
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:09.424
<v Speaker 4>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people regard the past as the land of </v>

533
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:12.190
<v Speaker 4>giants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

534
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:13.063
<v Speaker 4>They were the heroes of the past who </v>
<v Speaker 4>established the current conditions that </v>

535
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:16.984
<v Speaker 4>we exist and then the people on the left</v>
<v Speaker 4>are more concerned perhaps with the </v>

536
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.830
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it,</v>

537
00:30:23.831 --> 00:30:24.664
<v Speaker 4>with a lineage of corruption that's come</v>
<v Speaker 4>down through the centuries and both of </v>

538
00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:29.230
<v Speaker 4>those perspectives are are are accurate.</v>

539
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.063
<v Speaker 4>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

540
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.053
<v Speaker 4>there were there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were the great heroes of the past </v>

541
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:34.774
<v Speaker 4>who established our modes of being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can think of them as competent </v>

542
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 4>beings if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>

543
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:40.330
<v Speaker 4>That's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it,</v>

544
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:45.370
<v Speaker 4>and you can also think of the of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>accumulation of corruption and evil.</v>

545
00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:46.204
<v Speaker 4>That's come along the centuries as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you see both of those reflected </v>

546
00:30:49.121 --> 00:30:52.210
<v Speaker 4>in these initial few lines that the sons</v>
<v Speaker 4>of gods,</v>

547
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.210
<v Speaker 4>so those are the heroes saw the </v>
<v Speaker 4>daughters of men that they were fair and</v>

548
00:30:55.211 --> 00:30:57.670
<v Speaker 4>they took them wives of all of which </v>
<v Speaker 4>they chose.</v>

549
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 4>Then this</v>
<v Speaker 4>statement</v>

550
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.790
<v Speaker 4>comes in as somewhat of a non sequitur </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Lord said,</v>

551
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:10.480
<v Speaker 4>my spirit shall not always strive with </v>
<v Speaker 4>man for that he is also flesh,</v>

552
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:11.643
<v Speaker 4>yet his days shall be 120 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I looked at a variety of </v>

553
00:31:15.191 --> 00:31:16.024
<v Speaker 4>interpretations of that line because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't seem to follow so clearly from </v>

554
00:31:18.671 --> 00:31:22.300
<v Speaker 4>the previous line and and exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 4>it means isn't obvious,</v>

555
00:31:22.301 --> 00:31:23.134
<v Speaker 4>but it seems to be the first line talks </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the heroes of the past and and </v>

556
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.090
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

557
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.370
<v Speaker 4>The second line says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

558
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.253
<v Speaker 4>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something corrupt about the </v>

559
00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.324
<v Speaker 4>human mode of being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the consequences of that as </v>

560
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 4>far as God is concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that there are conditions under which</v>

561
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 4>the divine spirit will not strive with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

562
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:46.743
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What that means is there are conditions </v>

563
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:49.084
<v Speaker 4>under which let's say the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's any other way of </v>

564
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.723
<v Speaker 4>putting it is the divine impulse towards</v>
<v Speaker 4>the good will abandon you because of </v>

565
00:31:58.331 --> 00:31:59.164
<v Speaker 4>things that you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the secondary consideration </v>

566
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:06.340
<v Speaker 4>here is that perhaps because of the disc</v>
<v Speaker 4>degeneration of people,</v>

567
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:09.100
<v Speaker 4>it's not so obvious here that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifespans are limited,</v>

568
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:09.973
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the spirit that inhabits us will </v>

569
00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:13.144
<v Speaker 4>only do so for a limited amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's tangled in a strange way in </v>

570
00:32:17.051 --> 00:32:17.884
<v Speaker 4>with the idea of human moral culpability</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's posed against the notion of </v>

571
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:22.684
<v Speaker 4>the giants of the past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it returns to the giant idea </v>

572
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:28.000
<v Speaker 4>that narrative returns to the giant idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>and reads.</v>

573
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.780
<v Speaker 4>There were giants in the earth in those </v>
<v Speaker 4>days and also after that,</v>

574
00:32:31.781 --> 00:32:32.614
<v Speaker 4>when the sons of men came in unto the </v>
<v Speaker 4>daughters of men and they bare children </v>

575
00:32:35.051 --> 00:32:37.690
<v Speaker 4>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same became mighty men which were of</v>

576
00:32:37.691 --> 00:32:39.470
<v Speaker 4>old men of renown.</v>

577
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.410
<v Speaker 4>And that that's the end of that sequence</v>
<v Speaker 4>of fragments.</v>

578
00:32:43.411 --> 00:32:46.760
<v Speaker 4>It's very</v>
<v Speaker 4>broken,</v>

579
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 4>but you can see a dual narrative </v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath it.</v>

580
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.073
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the narratives is that </v>

581
00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.510
<v Speaker 4>there's the kind of corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 4>despite the giant,</v>

582
00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:58.643
<v Speaker 4>the nature of the giants of the past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the kind of corruption lurking </v>

583
00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:07.740
<v Speaker 4>that would cause God to withhold his </v>
<v Speaker 4>grace and allow men to deteriorate.</v>

584
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.030
<v Speaker 4>And that sets the stage for Noah and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>flood.</v>

585
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.960
<v Speaker 4>And God saw that the wickedness of man </v>
<v Speaker 4>was great in the earth and that the,</v>

586
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.853
<v Speaker 4>and that every imagination of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts of his heart was only evil </v>

587
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:26.530
<v Speaker 4>continually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

588
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.420
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I really didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>about going to church when I was a kid,</v>

589
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.390
<v Speaker 4>I went to a pretty moderate church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the United Church,</v>

590
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.340
<v Speaker 4>which has hardly even become a church </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

591
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:37.190
<v Speaker 4>It's so moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>

592
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:39.883
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I didn't like was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>constant harping by the ministry on the </v>

593
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.430
<v Speaker 4>sinful nature of human beings like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't speak to me properly,</v>

594
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:51.440
<v Speaker 4>partly because I really didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what it meant.</v>

595
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.140
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and partly because it seemed</v>

596
00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:00.970
<v Speaker 4>well sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say was self-flagellating</v>

597
00:34:00.971 --> 00:34:01.804
<v Speaker 4>in an attractive way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there is an attractive </v>

598
00:34:04.451 --> 00:34:06.690
<v Speaker 4>way to be self-flagellating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was.</v>

599
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.713
<v Speaker 4>It was and there was something about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was also wrote and fake that I </v>

600
00:34:12.401 --> 00:34:14.050
<v Speaker 4>didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

601
00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:15.363
<v Speaker 4>in later years I thought about that more</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I started to understand that there </v>

602
00:34:18.731 --> 00:34:23.731
<v Speaker 4>was some real utility in asking people </v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep the evil that they're doing</v>

603
00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.730
<v Speaker 4>clear and conscious in the forefront of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their imagination.</v>

604
00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:30.923
<v Speaker 4>I think I mentioned to you guys last </v>
<v Speaker 4>week that this little episode from what </v>

605
00:34:34.981 --> 00:34:38.610
<v Speaker 4>we know of Mesopotamian culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounding the emperor,</v>

606
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.653
<v Speaker 4>the New Year's festival,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would take the emperor outside of </v>

607
00:34:41.881 --> 00:34:44.550
<v Speaker 4>the walled city and strip him of his</v>

608
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.863
<v Speaker 4>garb so that he was reduced to just an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ordinary man and then humiliate them </v>

609
00:34:51.041 --> 00:34:51.874
<v Speaker 4>richly and then ask him how it was over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the last year that he wasn't a </v>

610
00:34:56.951 --> 00:34:57.784
<v Speaker 4>spectacular embodiment of Marduk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marduk was the Mesopotamian daddy who </v>

611
00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:01.893
<v Speaker 4>made order out of chaos essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the emperor is supposed to sit and </v>

612
00:35:04.421 --> 00:35:05.141
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

613
00:35:05.141 --> 00:35:06.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

614
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm emperor and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should be doing a good job.</v>

615
00:35:08.831 --> 00:35:09.664
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I should even be doing a great job</v>
<v Speaker 4>and probably I'm coming up short and a </v>

616
00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:13.744
<v Speaker 4>bunch of ways and that actually happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be important since I'm running the </v>

617
00:35:15.821 --> 00:35:17.950
<v Speaker 4>entire show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should be very,</v>

618
00:35:17.951 --> 00:35:18.784
<v Speaker 4>very cognizant of how I'm failing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>live up to the ideal and that is what </v>

619
00:35:24.221 --> 00:35:28.000
<v Speaker 4>that call that constant clarion call </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's degenerated,</v>

620
00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:30.040
<v Speaker 4>I would say an institutional </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity.</v>

621
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.320
<v Speaker 4>That was actually the idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

622
00:35:32.321 --> 00:35:33.154
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of ways that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>being everything you could be and it is </v>

623
00:35:36.251 --> 00:35:39.270
<v Speaker 4>not supposed to be a to to to knock you </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

624
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Although maybe it's a whip to knock down</v>
<v Speaker 4>your pride.</v>

625
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 4>The pride that stops you from being </v>
<v Speaker 4>aware of your insufficiencies.</v>

626
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 4>It's more like a call to the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

627
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.673
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should stop doing those things </v>

628
00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 4>because you could be so much more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are and that would be so much better</v>

629
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:55.830
<v Speaker 4>for you and everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is just.</v>

630
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 4>It's just not good that you continue </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing these things.</v>

631
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Continue Breaking your own rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

632
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 4>because we could certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>

633
00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:05.574
<v Speaker 4>we could start this game by assuming </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you should at least play the game </v>

634
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:08.364
<v Speaker 4>that you're playing straight and so and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is the case that if you watch </v>

635
00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:16.080
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a terrifying thing to do.</v>

636
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.250
<v Speaker 4>But if you watch yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see you lie a lot.</v>

637
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 4>Like when I learned this to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in my twenties and I was.</v>

638
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:25.403
<v Speaker 4>I'm a smart person and I was very proud </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that because I was also a small </v>

639
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:33.120
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was moved ahead one year in school and</v>

640
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.800
<v Speaker 4>I was a small person</v>

641
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:36.583
<v Speaker 4>to begin with and so as a very small </v>
<v Speaker 4>person in my classes and also very </v>

642
00:36:40.101 --> 00:36:40.934
<v Speaker 4>mouthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which might not come as much of a </v>

643
00:36:42.171 --> 00:36:45.470
<v Speaker 4>surprise and somewhat provocative and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

644
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.890
<v Speaker 4>and I got pushed around a fair bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>because everybody gets pushed around and</v>

645
00:36:48.891 --> 00:36:51.530
<v Speaker 4>my weapon was to be mouthy and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fairly effective weapon.</v>

646
00:36:51.531 --> 00:36:53.820
<v Speaker 4>Although it tended to backfire because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

647
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:57.080
<v Speaker 4>if you're really effectively mouthy with</v>
<v Speaker 4>large,</v>

648
00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:57.914
<v Speaker 4>obnoxious people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they tend to respond in a </v>

649
00:37:00.231 --> 00:37:01.064
<v Speaker 4>relatively negative physical way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that sort of thing was happening </v>

650
00:37:03.741 --> 00:37:04.574
<v Speaker 4>to me a fair bit and but I was quite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was quite proud of the fact that I </v>

651
00:37:08.361 --> 00:37:10.190
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I,</v>

652
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had some intellectual power</v>

653
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:14.563
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

654
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.233
<v Speaker 4>Darren,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was then in my twenties when I </v>

655
00:37:18.261 --> 00:37:19.094
<v Speaker 4>learned about some of the danger of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I started to read partly </v>

656
00:37:22.791 --> 00:37:25.880
<v Speaker 4>Milton's paradise lost and I started to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand the,</v>

657
00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.123
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the danger of the intellect and the </v>

658
00:37:29.151 --> 00:37:29.984
<v Speaker 4>danger of the intellect as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell is that it tends towards pride and </v>

659
00:37:32.721 --> 00:37:36.110
<v Speaker 4>arrogance and it also tends to fall in </v>
<v Speaker 4>love with its own productions.</v>

660
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.180
<v Speaker 4>And so that's actually Lucifer in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

661
00:37:38.181 --> 00:37:39.320
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in paradise lost.</v>

662
00:37:39.321 --> 00:37:40.154
<v Speaker 4>That's Lucifer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lucifer is the intellect that falls in </v>

663
00:37:41.841 --> 00:37:42.674
<v Speaker 4>love with its own productions and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>assumes that there's nothing outside of </v>

664
00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:48.830
<v Speaker 4>what it thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the totalitarian mentality,</v>

665
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.693
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like we have a total system and we </v>

666
00:37:51.201 --> 00:37:52.034
<v Speaker 4>know how everything works and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna implement it and that'll bring </v>

667
00:37:54.681 --> 00:37:55.820
<v Speaker 4>about heaven on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

668
00:37:55.821 --> 00:37:56.654
<v Speaker 4>That's that say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the totalitarian mindset and </v>

669
00:37:59.391 --> 00:38:03.410
<v Speaker 4>that's associated with intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrogance and</v>

670
00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.900
<v Speaker 4>another at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another thing that was happening to me,</v>

671
00:38:08.901 --> 00:38:09.734
<v Speaker 4>so I was noticing that I started to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what that meant and I also </v>

672
00:38:13.701 --> 00:38:16.910
<v Speaker 4>started to understand that there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>more to life than the intellect,</v>

673
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:17.923
<v Speaker 4>much more because I smoked too much and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I drank too much and I weighed like 130 </v>

674
00:38:21.201 --> 00:38:23.670
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't in good physical shape and like</v>

675
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:24.703
<v Speaker 4>I had a lot of things to do when I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>to graduate school to put myself </v>

676
00:38:27.021 --> 00:38:27.854
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at the same time I was trying to </v>

677
00:38:28.911 --> 00:38:32.990
<v Speaker 4>understand why things had gone so </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazily wrong with the world.</v>

678
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:37.240
<v Speaker 4>It's encapsulation in the cold and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>role I might be playing in that,</v>

679
00:38:37.241 --> 00:38:38.074
<v Speaker 4>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or what role any of us were playing in </v>

680
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:40.640
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

681
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:48.510
<v Speaker 4>at the same time I was working at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>prison only a little bit.</v>

682
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I worked with this crazy psychologist.</v>

683
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

684
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.050
<v Speaker 4>he used to put jokes on is multiple </v>
<v Speaker 4>choice tests.</v>

685
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.300
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a really eccentric guy,</v>

686
00:38:58.301 --> 00:38:59.134
<v Speaker 4>but I really liked his courses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He and he taught a course on creativity </v>

687
00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:03.604
<v Speaker 4>and he was also a prison psychologist </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was an eccentric guy and he for </v>

688
00:39:06.731 --> 00:39:10.840
<v Speaker 4>some reason liked me and maybe because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was eccentric to and he invited me to go</v>

689
00:39:10.841 --> 00:39:13.600
<v Speaker 4>out to the Edmonton maximum security </v>
<v Speaker 4>prison with them a couple of times,</v>

690
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:14.434
<v Speaker 4>which I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was a very interesting </v>

691
00:39:15.761 --> 00:39:17.770
<v Speaker 4>experience because I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out</v>

692
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:21.843
<v Speaker 4>what role each individual's behavior </v>
<v Speaker 4>bore to the pathology of the group with </v>

693
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:28.234
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I went out there and I met a little </v>

694
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:36.400
<v Speaker 4>guy smaller than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a little bigger by then and he was</v>

695
00:39:36.401 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 4>a pretty innocuous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

696
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.250
<v Speaker 4>what had happened was I was out in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>gymnasium,</v>

697
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.080
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the prison,</v>

698
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:46.210
<v Speaker 4>which is really quite telling in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>estimation,</v>

699
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:47.044
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there were all these like monsters </v>

700
00:39:49.061 --> 00:39:51.130
<v Speaker 4>in their weight lifting and like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were monsters.</v>

701
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:51.963
<v Speaker 4>I remember one guy who was tattooed </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere and he had like a huge scar </v>

702
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:54.934
<v Speaker 4>running down the middle of his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like someone had to hit them </v>

703
00:39:56.341 --> 00:39:58.110
<v Speaker 4>with an ax and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

704
00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.013
<v Speaker 4>and I was in there and I had this Weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cape that I used to wear that I bought </v>

705
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:04.040
<v Speaker 4>in Portugal and some boots that went </v>
<v Speaker 4>along with it and</v>

706
00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.850
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like an 1890 sherlock Holmes Cape</v>

707
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:10.684
<v Speaker 4>and it was really like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was from the eighties and nineties </v>

708
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.080
<v Speaker 4>because this little village was up on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hill.</v>

709
00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.480
<v Speaker 4>It was a walled city on a hill and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>sold these things and I don't think they</v>

710
00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:18.314
<v Speaker 4>changed the style since 1890.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought they were really cool </v>

711
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:23.560
<v Speaker 4>and so I was wearing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which wasn't perhaps the most</v>

712
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:30.150
<v Speaker 4>conservative garb</v>
<v Speaker 4>to dawn if you're going to wear,</v>

713
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:32.590
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to go to a maximum </v>
<v Speaker 4>security prison.</v>

714
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.423
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in the gymnasium and the </v>

715
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.303
<v Speaker 4>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychologist left and God only </v>

716
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 4>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what he was like.</v>

717
00:40:40.451 --> 00:40:43.900
<v Speaker 4>And all these guys came or all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys came around me,</v>

718
00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:44.734
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were offering to trade their </v>

719
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:51.300
<v Speaker 4>prison clothes for my cape and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

720
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:54.010
<v Speaker 4>I was being made an offer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't refuse,</v>

721
00:40:54.011 --> 00:40:54.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I didn't,</v>

722
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.073
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really know what to do and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>this little guy said something like </v>

723
00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.293
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychologist sent me to come and </v>

724
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:04.060
<v Speaker 4>take you away or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought,</v>

725
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:08.110
<v Speaker 4>well better this little guy then all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these monsters.</v>

726
00:41:08.111 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 4>So we went outside the gym through some </v>
<v Speaker 4>doors,</v>

727
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.420
<v Speaker 4>like school doors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had outside the gym into the exercise</v>

728
00:41:16.421 --> 00:41:17.254
<v Speaker 4>yard I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're wandering along and he was </v>

729
00:41:18.461 --> 00:41:20.710
<v Speaker 4>talking to me and he seemed like a kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of an innocuous guy.</v>

730
00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:25.000
<v Speaker 4>And then the psychologist showed up at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the door and motioned us back and so,</v>

731
00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.163
<v Speaker 4>which was kind of a relief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I went into his office and he </v>

732
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:29.291
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

733
00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Speaker 4>that guy that you walked out in the yard</v>
<v Speaker 4>with?</v>

734
00:41:31.001 --> 00:41:31.661
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

735
00:41:31.661 --> 00:41:33.130
<v Speaker 4>He said he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

736
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:34.663
<v Speaker 4>he took two cops one night and he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>them kneel down and while they were </v>

737
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:38.354
<v Speaker 4>begging for their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he shot them both in the back of the </v>

738
00:41:40.221 --> 00:41:41.054
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

739
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hmm.</v>

740
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.313
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

741
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.873
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that was so interesting was </v>

742
00:41:48.781 --> 00:41:51.150
<v Speaker 4>that he was so innocuous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

743
00:41:51.151 --> 00:41:54.960
<v Speaker 4>Because what you'd hope is that someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that would be very much unlike you,</v>

744
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.823
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and certainly wouldn't be like somewhat </v>

745
00:41:57.661 --> 00:42:00.840
<v Speaker 4>innocuous that you'd met.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you'd want is that the guy would be</v>

746
00:42:00.841 --> 00:42:01.440
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

747
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.220
<v Speaker 4>half war wolf and half vampire so you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could just tell right away that he was a</v>

748
00:42:05.221 --> 00:42:06.960
<v Speaker 4>cold blooded killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

749
00:42:06.961 --> 00:42:11.961
<v Speaker 4>he was this sort of ineffectual little </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who was certainly not ineffectual if</v>

750
00:42:12.031 --> 00:42:13.890
<v Speaker 4>you gave him a revolver and the upper </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>

751
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.820
<v Speaker 4>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that made me think that made me think</v>

752
00:42:17.821 --> 00:42:22.560
<v Speaker 4>a lot about the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 4>being innocuous and being dangerous.</v>

753
00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:23.394
<v Speaker 4>And then another thing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met another guy out there and then a </v>

754
00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:31.050
<v Speaker 4>week or two later I heard that he and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend of his head held another guy down</v>

755
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:34.950
<v Speaker 4>and pulverized his left leg with a lead </v>
<v Speaker 4>pipe,</v>

756
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.800
<v Speaker 4>like just pulverized it.</v>

757
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:38.843
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that was that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought that he was a snitch and maybe </v>

758
00:42:41.071 --> 00:42:41.904
<v Speaker 4>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that that time I did something </v>

759
00:42:44.701 --> 00:42:47.310
<v Speaker 4>different instead of being shocked and </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrified by that.</v>

760
00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.290
<v Speaker 4>Although I certainly was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

761
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.130
<v Speaker 4>how in the world could you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I didn't think I could do that,</v>

762
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.450
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think that.</v>

763
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:55.403
<v Speaker 4>I thought that there was a qualitative </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinction between me and those people </v>

764
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.233
<v Speaker 4>and so I spent about two weeks trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>see if I could figure out under what </v>

765
00:43:05.131 --> 00:43:05.964
<v Speaker 4>conditions I could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what kind of psychological </v>

766
00:43:08.401 --> 00:43:11.370
<v Speaker 4>transformation I would have to undergo </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to do that.</v>

767
00:43:11.371 --> 00:43:14.280
<v Speaker 4>And so that was a meditative exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

768
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:19.290
<v Speaker 4>and it only took about 10 days for me to</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that not only could I do that,</v>

769
00:43:19.291 --> 00:43:21.510
<v Speaker 4>that it would be a hell of a lot easier </v>
<v Speaker 4>than I thought it would be.</v>

770
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.823
<v Speaker 4>And that sort of where that wall between</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and what you describe is the shadow </v>

771
00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.920
<v Speaker 4>started to fall apart and that also was </v>
<v Speaker 4>very useful because I started to read.</v>

772
00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.153
<v Speaker 4>I started to treat myself as somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 4>different entity because I hadn't been </v>

773
00:43:35.341 --> 00:43:36.960
<v Speaker 4>aware up to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

774
00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:37.794
<v Speaker 4>because I thought I was a good guy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason for me to think that </v>

775
00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:43.680
<v Speaker 4>because you're not a good guy unless you</v>
<v Speaker 4>really made a bloody effort to be a good</v>

776
00:43:43.681 --> 00:43:44.880
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just not.</v>

777
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:45.953
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy and so you're probably a </v>
<v Speaker 4>moderately bad guy and that's a long </v>

778
00:43:50.311 --> 00:43:52.650
<v Speaker 4>ways from being an absolutely horrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>

779
00:43:52.651 --> 00:43:55.680
<v Speaker 4>but it's also a long ways from being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good guy and so,</v>

780
00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:56.723
<v Speaker 4>but I had a little more respect for </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself after that because I also </v>

781
00:43:59.161 --> 00:44:04.161
<v Speaker 4>understood that through is a monstrous </v>
<v Speaker 4>element to the human psyche that re that</v>

782
00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:06.323
<v Speaker 4>you needed to respect and that was part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of you that you should regard yourself </v>

783
00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:11.514
<v Speaker 4>in some sense as a loaded weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very useful around children to </v>

784
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.430
<v Speaker 4>regard yourself as a loaded weapon </v>
<v Speaker 4>because around children you are a loaded</v>

785
00:44:17.431 --> 00:44:18.264
<v Speaker 4>weapon and the terrible experiences that</v>
<v Speaker 4>many children have with their parents </v>

786
00:44:22.201 --> 00:44:23.190
<v Speaker 4>are testament to that.</v>

787
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:26.953
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

788
00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.593
<v Speaker 4>about the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't exactly know how these </v>

789
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:32.274
<v Speaker 4>things were causally related.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it was because I was trying to </v>

790
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:39.650
<v Speaker 4>figure out</v>
<v Speaker 4>who I was and how that could be fixed.</v>

791
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.673
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started to pay very careful attention </v>

792
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:44.124
<v Speaker 4>to what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that happened </v>

793
00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:47.754
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily or involuntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I could feel it sort of split </v>

794
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:50.664
<v Speaker 4>developing in my psyche and the split </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've actually had students tell me </v>

795
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:54.474
<v Speaker 4>the same thing has happened to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>after they've listened to some of the </v>

796
00:44:58.201 --> 00:45:01.140
<v Speaker 4>material that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I've been describing to all of you,</v>

797
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:05.940
<v Speaker 4>but split into two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

798
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.613
<v Speaker 4>And one part was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say the old me that was talking a </v>

799
00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:11.754
<v Speaker 4>lot and that liked to argue in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>liked ideas and there was another part </v>

800
00:45:16.861 --> 00:45:17.694
<v Speaker 4>that was watching that part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just with it's eyes open and </v>

801
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.313
<v Speaker 4>neutrally judging and the part that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>neutrally judging was watching the part </v>

802
00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:29.850
<v Speaker 4>that was talking and going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't your idea.</v>

803
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.500
<v Speaker 4>You don't really believe that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really know what you're talking about.</v>

804
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.440
<v Speaker 4>That isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

805
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.700
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really interesting.</v>

806
00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:39.534
<v Speaker 4>So now I've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was happening to like 95 </v>

807
00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:43.470
<v Speaker 4>percent of what I was saying and so then</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really know what to do.</v>

808
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:44.161
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

809
00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:47.550
<v Speaker 4>this is strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so maybe I've fragmented and that's just</v>

810
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:49.200
<v Speaker 4>not a good thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

811
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.760
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like I was hearing voices or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything like that.</v>

812
00:45:51.761 --> 00:45:53.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like that.</v>

813
00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:55.110
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

814
00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:57.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have multiple parts,</v>

815
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 4>so then I had a weird conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

816
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which of those two things are me?</v>

817
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:06.240
<v Speaker 4>Is it the part that's listening and </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

818
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's rubbish.</v>

819
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:09.083
<v Speaker 4>That's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's you're doing that to impress </v>

820
00:46:11.431 --> 00:46:13.410
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just trying to win the argument,</v>

821
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:14.244
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that me or was the part that was </v>

822
00:46:16.261 --> 00:46:18.750
<v Speaker 4>going about my normal verbal business?</v>

823
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Me and I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I decided I would go with the critic</v>

824
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:27.560
<v Speaker 4>and then what I tried to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I learned to do I think was to stop</v>

825
00:46:27.571 --> 00:46:28.404
<v Speaker 4>saying things that made me weak and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I mean I'm still trying to do that </v>

826
00:46:33.241 --> 00:46:38.241
<v Speaker 4>because I'm always feeling when I talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not the words that I'm saying</v>

827
00:46:38.761 --> 00:46:41.850
<v Speaker 4>are either making me align or making me </v>
<v Speaker 4>come apart,</v>

828
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.690
<v Speaker 4>and I think the alignment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do think the alignment is.</v>

829
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:46.763
<v Speaker 4>I think alignment is the right way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptualizing it because I think if </v>

830
00:46:48.691 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 4>you say things that are as true as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can say them,</v>

831
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:55.560
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they come up,</v>

832
00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:57.023
<v Speaker 4>they come out of the depths inside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you because we don't know where it </v>

833
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:02.470
<v Speaker 4>thoughts come from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know how far down into your sub</v>

834
00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thoughts emerge.</v>

835
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:04.913
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what processes have </v>
<v Speaker 4>physiological alignment are necessary </v>

836
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 4>for you to speak from the core of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

837
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.080
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't even conceptualize that,</v>

838
00:47:13.081 --> 00:47:16.680
<v Speaker 4>but I believe that you can feel that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned some of that from reading Carl</v>

839
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.071
<v Speaker 4>Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

840
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:17.904
<v Speaker 4>who's a great clinician because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about mental health in part as a </v>

841
00:47:21.451 --> 00:47:23.470
<v Speaker 4>coherence between the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

842
00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.453
<v Speaker 4>the spiritual or the or the abstract and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the physical that the two things were </v>

843
00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:28.644
<v Speaker 4>aligned and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a lot of idea of alignment </v>

844
00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.360
<v Speaker 4>in psychoanalytic and clinical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

845
00:47:34.361 --> 00:47:35.194
<v Speaker 4>I decided that I would start practicing </v>
<v Speaker 4>not saying things that would make me </v>

846
00:47:39.491 --> 00:47:42.310
<v Speaker 4>weak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what happened was that I had to stop</v>

847
00:47:42.311 --> 00:47:44.910
<v Speaker 4>saying almost everything that I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>sick.</v>

848
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:48.820
<v Speaker 4>I would say 95 percent of it as a hell </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a shock to wake up,</v>

849
00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:49.673
<v Speaker 4>and this was over a few months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a hell of a shock to wake up </v>

850
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:55.540
<v Speaker 4>and realize that you're mostly dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>wood.</v>

851
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a shock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

852
00:47:58.421 --> 00:47:59.171
<v Speaker 4>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

853
00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 4>do you really want all of that to burn </v>
<v Speaker 4>off?</v>

854
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.301
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

855
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a little husk,</v>

856
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 4>five percent of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

857
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:07.870
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that five percent is solid,</v>

858
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.010
<v Speaker 4>then maybe that's exactly what you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have happen.</v>

859
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.713
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I told you that story is an </v>

860
00:48:14.831 --> 00:48:15.664
<v Speaker 4>elaboration of this line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and God saw that the wickedness of man </v>

861
00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:18.454
<v Speaker 4>was great in the earth and that every </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine have the imagination of the </v>

862
00:48:20.681 --> 00:48:21.514
<v Speaker 4>thoughts of his heart was only evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>continually to question worth asking </v>

863
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:29.290
<v Speaker 4>just exactly what are your motives?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

864
00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.213
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they're purer than mine were and </v>

865
00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:32.614
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that I'm naturally a </v>

866
00:48:34.721 --> 00:48:37.900
<v Speaker 4>particularly good person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I have to work at it very,</v>

867
00:48:37.901 --> 00:48:41.800
<v Speaker 4>very hard and I don't necessarily think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that everyone is like that,</v>

868
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:48.700
<v Speaker 4>but some people are worse than that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's like that to some degree.</v>

869
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:54.580
<v Speaker 4>So it's worth thinking about just how </v>
<v Speaker 4>much trouble are you trying to cause,</v>

870
00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.443
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the other thing you might think </v>

871
00:48:56.891 --> 00:48:57.724
<v Speaker 4>about is that if you're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something important with your life by </v>

872
00:48:59.891 --> 00:49:00.724
<v Speaker 4>your own definition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's the game that we're </v>

873
00:49:02.441 --> 00:49:03.274
<v Speaker 4>playing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to define the terms at least </v>

874
00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:07.900
<v Speaker 4>initially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you're prone to cause trouble just</v>

875
00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:08.734
<v Speaker 4>because you don't have anything better </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do because at least it's trouble is </v>

876
00:49:11.711 --> 00:49:14.110
<v Speaker 4>more interesting than boring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

877
00:49:14.111 --> 00:49:16.120
<v Speaker 4>that's something you learn if you read </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky.</v>

878
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:18.250
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky knew that extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

879
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.473
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're not doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not pushing yourself to the </v>

880
00:49:21.311 --> 00:49:24.790
<v Speaker 4>limits of your capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have plenty of leftover.</v>

881
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>

882
00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.193
<v Speaker 4>Willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>energy and resources to devote to </v>

883
00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.310
<v Speaker 4>causing interesting trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so well.</v>

884
00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:36.910
<v Speaker 4>So I would say this is also an </v>
<v Speaker 4>archetypal scenario.</v>

885
00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:38.043
<v Speaker 4>God saw that the wickedness of man was </v>
<v Speaker 4>great in the earth and that every </v>

886
00:49:40.241 --> 00:49:43.360
<v Speaker 4>imagination of the thoughts of his heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>was only evil continually.</v>

887
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:45.363
<v Speaker 4>That's something to meditate on</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not self destructive because </v>

888
00:49:49.691 --> 00:49:53.080
<v Speaker 4>what it is is an attempt to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the diagnosis of an illness.</v>

889
00:49:53.081 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like if that does happen to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>case for you or to some degree,</v>

890
00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:58.390
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's only 10 percent of you or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

891
00:49:58.391 --> 00:49:59.224
<v Speaker 4>or maybe it's 90 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then coming to terms with that is </v>

892
00:50:02.021 --> 00:50:02.854
<v Speaker 4>excellent because then maybe you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop doing it and what would be the </v>

893
00:50:06.011 --> 00:50:09.700
<v Speaker 4>downside to that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to give up your resentment,</v>

894
00:50:09.701 --> 00:50:11.380
<v Speaker 4>obviously in your hatred and all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

895
00:50:11.381 --> 00:50:13.870
<v Speaker 4>and that's really annoying because those</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotions are very.</v>

896
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:14.963
<v Speaker 4>They're easy to engage in in there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're engaging and they have this </v>

897
00:50:18.521 --> 00:50:22.270
<v Speaker 4>feeling of self righteousness with them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that goes along with them.</v>

898
00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.253
<v Speaker 4>But</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not doing this in order to put </v>

899
00:50:25.511 --> 00:50:26.344
<v Speaker 4>yourself down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're doing this in order to separate </v>

900
00:50:28.371 --> 00:50:29.204
<v Speaker 4>the wheat from the chaff and to leave </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that you don't have to be </v>

901
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:32.923
<v Speaker 4>behind</v>

902
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.750
<v Speaker 4>and it repented the Lord that he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>made.</v>

903
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Man on the earth and it grieved him at </v>
<v Speaker 4>his heart,</v>

904
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.100
<v Speaker 4>and the Lord said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will destroy man,</v>

905
00:50:46.101 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 4>whom I've created from the face of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>

906
00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.393
<v Speaker 4>both man and beast and the creeping </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and the fowls of the air for </v>

907
00:50:51.531 --> 00:50:53.330
<v Speaker 4>repentance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me That I've made them.</v>

908
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.550
<v Speaker 4>What's the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

909
00:50:55.551 --> 00:50:59.330
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that the cosmos that God </v>
<v Speaker 4>created had become corrupt.</v>

910
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:00.643
<v Speaker 4>And that's a funny thing because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know this is the other thing about </v>

911
00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:07.460
<v Speaker 4>genesis that always hits me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that that's also true.</v>

912
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:11.450
<v Speaker 4>I told you that the Mesopotamians </v>
<v Speaker 4>believed that human beings were made out</v>

913
00:51:11.451 --> 00:51:14.900
<v Speaker 4>of the blood of king,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knew who was the worst monster monster.</v>

914
00:51:14.901 --> 00:51:19.100
<v Speaker 4>That the dragon of chaos could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty harsh diagnosis,</v>

915
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:19.934
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reason the Mesopotamians </v>

916
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:25.340
<v Speaker 4>believed that is because they knew as </v>
<v Speaker 4>did the authors of Genesis,</v>

917
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:30.290
<v Speaker 4>that human beings are the only creatures</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the cosmos.</v>

918
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.880
<v Speaker 4>Let's say the cosmos of being who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually capable of deceit,</v>

919
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:36.860
<v Speaker 4>conscious deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and malevolence.</v>

920
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.653
<v Speaker 4>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to what degree does the expression of </v>

921
00:51:41.391 --> 00:51:46.391
<v Speaker 4>that conscious deceit and malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrupt things so badly that it would be</v>

922
00:51:46.491 --> 00:51:48.740
<v Speaker 4>better that they didn't exist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>At all,</v>

923
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see stories,</v>

924
00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:56.500
<v Speaker 4>there's a story associated with this in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the epic of Gilgamesh,</v>

925
00:51:56.501 --> 00:51:57.334
<v Speaker 4>associated with the flood that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same underlying narrative </v>

926
00:52:00.011 --> 00:52:00.761
<v Speaker 4>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

927
00:52:00.761 --> 00:52:02.860
<v Speaker 4>some people think the story of Noah was </v>
<v Speaker 4>derived from it,</v>

928
00:52:02.861 --> 00:52:03.694
<v Speaker 4>where the gods who created repented of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their creation and determined that </v>

929
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.233
<v Speaker 4>erasing it would be better than allowing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it to propagate and you see the same </v>

930
00:52:13.331 --> 00:52:18.331
<v Speaker 4>thing in the Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Enuma elish because the early gods,</v>

931
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:22.330
<v Speaker 4>so they're representatives of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the giants of humanity,</v>

932
00:52:22.331 --> 00:52:27.331
<v Speaker 4>I would say make so much noise in are so</v>
<v Speaker 4>careless that the original creator God,</v>

933
00:52:28.301 --> 00:52:29.134
<v Speaker 4>time out in her concert tie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matt decides to wipe them from the face </v>

934
00:52:32.471 --> 00:52:34.390
<v Speaker 4>of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

935
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:39.943
<v Speaker 4>when you read something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you read it from an informed </v>

936
00:52:42.831 --> 00:52:43.664
<v Speaker 4>historical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts to have a depth that makes it </v>

937
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:52.630
<v Speaker 4>transcend the sort of archaic and fairy </v>
<v Speaker 4>tale like element of the story.</v>

938
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:54.104
<v Speaker 4>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read some very terrible things </v>

939
00:52:56.811 --> 00:52:57.644
<v Speaker 4>about what happened in Nazi Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened when the Japanese invaded </v>

940
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:05.450
<v Speaker 4>China on just what happened generally in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the history of mankind and</v>

941
00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:08.283
<v Speaker 4>things can get so bad that it takes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagination of a very bad person to </v>

942
00:53:12.551 --> 00:53:17.530
<v Speaker 4>conceptualize them and when they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>that bad,</v>

943
00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.230
<v Speaker 4>this is the only kind of language that </v>
<v Speaker 4>works to describe them.</v>

944
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:21.683
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing that I've </v>

945
00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:23.733
<v Speaker 4>discovered working with my clinical </v>
<v Speaker 4>clients is when their lives are really </v>

946
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.640
<v Speaker 4>not going well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

947
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.493
<v Speaker 4>when they're close to suicide or when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're close to homicide or when there </v>

948
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:36.504
<v Speaker 4>are things going on in the family that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are so corrupt and terrible that they </v>

949
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:39.864
<v Speaker 4>reached back generations and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>aimed at nothing but misery and </v>

950
00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:43.074
<v Speaker 4>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only language that suffices has a </v>

951
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:50.640
<v Speaker 4>religious tone because there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>else that's available to describe what's</v>

952
00:53:50.641 --> 00:53:53.010
<v Speaker 4>happening with the proper level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>seriousness,</v>

953
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:54.143
<v Speaker 4>and it might be that you've never </v>
<v Speaker 4>encountered a situation that required </v>

954
00:53:57.211 --> 00:53:58.044
<v Speaker 4>that level of seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that those </v>

955
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.160
<v Speaker 4>situations don't exist.</v>

956
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:02.993
<v Speaker 4>They exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You generally do everything you can to </v>

957
00:54:05.941 --> 00:54:06.774
<v Speaker 4>avoid being ensconced in them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they certainly do exist in the </v>

958
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:12.720
<v Speaker 4>probability that you'll encounter a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation like that or two,</v>

959
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 4>at some point in your life is </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily high.</v>

960
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:16.343
<v Speaker 4>You'll tangle with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>malevolent right to the core and maybe </v>

961
00:54:19.921 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 4>it'll be you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

962
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 4>and that'll be a big shock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then these sorts of things.</v>

963
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:29.010
<v Speaker 4>These sorts of poetic descriptors start </v>
<v Speaker 4>to become much more real,</v>

964
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Speaker 4>but noah found grace in the eyes of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord.</v>

965
00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:35.003
<v Speaker 4>These are the generations of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Noah was a just man and perfect in his </v>

966
00:54:39.331 --> 00:54:40.164
<v Speaker 4>generations and Noah walked with God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting line because if </v>

967
00:54:43.771 --> 00:54:45.960
<v Speaker 4>you remember back in the story of Adam </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Eve,</v>

968
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.520
<v Speaker 4>what happens to Adam once he eats the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fruit of the tree,</v>

969
00:54:50.521 --> 00:54:54.150
<v Speaker 4>of the knowledge of good and evil and </v>
<v Speaker 4>wakes up the scales fall from his eyes,</v>

970
00:54:54.151 --> 00:54:54.984
<v Speaker 4>become self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>develops the knowledge of good and evil </v>

971
00:54:56.761 --> 00:54:57.594
<v Speaker 4>is he won't walk with God when God calls</v>
<v Speaker 4>him in the garden and so noah is Adam </v>

972
00:55:02.611 --> 00:55:05.970
<v Speaker 4>without the fall essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's something that Noah is doing</v>

973
00:55:05.971 --> 00:55:06.804
<v Speaker 4>right that</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivates God to spare him or maybe to </v>

974
00:55:12.981 --> 00:55:15.470
<v Speaker 4>show him a pathway through the emergent </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos,</v>

975
00:55:15.471 --> 00:55:16.304
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's worth thinking about a lot </v>

976
00:55:18.861 --> 00:55:23.690
<v Speaker 4>because there will be situations in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life where what you face is the emergent</v>

977
00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:24.553
<v Speaker 4>chaos and maybe that'll be some terrible</v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe inside your family or maybe </v>

978
00:55:28.881 --> 00:55:31.670
<v Speaker 4>it'll be something that's occurring on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>much broader social level,</v>

979
00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:32.773
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

980
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:36.590
<v Speaker 4>the chaos is coming and what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to want to know,</v>

981
00:55:36.591 --> 00:55:37.424
<v Speaker 4>unless you want to be a dentist in of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the chaos or even a contributor to it </v>

982
00:55:39.981 --> 00:55:40.814
<v Speaker 4>and perhaps that is what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because many people under those </v>

983
00:55:42.651 --> 00:55:47.651
<v Speaker 4>circumstances choose that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you want is to know</v>

984
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:55.340
<v Speaker 4>how you build an Ark and get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you,</v>

985
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:59.180
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're interested in life,</v>

986
00:55:59.181 --> 00:56:00.014
<v Speaker 4>if you're interested in proper being and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're disinclined to produce any more </v>

987
00:56:05.421 --> 00:56:06.650
<v Speaker 4>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the necessary,</v>

988
00:56:06.651 --> 00:56:07.484
<v Speaker 4>then you want to know how to conduct </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself when the catastrophe comes so </v>

989
00:56:10.851 --> 00:56:12.920
<v Speaker 4>that you have a reasonable possibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>of</v>

990
00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.560
<v Speaker 4>of moving through it and and starting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>new.</v>

991
00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.090
<v Speaker 4>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when this old story says,</v>

992
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:23.873
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God's not happy and he's going to wipe </v>

993
00:56:24.721 --> 00:56:26.340
<v Speaker 4>everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

994
00:56:26.341 --> 00:56:28.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might want to take that seriously</v>

995
00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.473
<v Speaker 4>and then when it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's one person who had a motive </v>

996
00:56:35.001 --> 00:56:35.834
<v Speaker 4>being that protected him from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's also something you might want to </v>

997
00:56:38.181 --> 00:56:39.014
<v Speaker 4>take seriously because you might want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>know what that mode of being is because </v>

998
00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:42.733
<v Speaker 4>you might need to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so these sorts of things are </v>

999
00:56:44.751 --> 00:56:45.584
<v Speaker 4>practical in the deepest possible sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're real in the deepest possible </v>

1000
00:56:48.981 --> 00:56:51.710
<v Speaker 4>sense and practical in the deepest </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible sense.</v>

1001
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.140
<v Speaker 4>So Noah walked with God.</v>

1002
00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:58.920
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm going to switch way ahead here </v>
<v Speaker 4>because</v>

1003
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.510
<v Speaker 4>I said at the beginning of the lecture </v>
<v Speaker 4>series that</v>

1004
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:09.900
<v Speaker 4>the Bible is a hyperlinked text and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything refers to everything else and</v>

1005
00:57:09.901 --> 00:57:13.560
<v Speaker 4>so there's utility in reading it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>linear order,</v>

1006
00:57:13.561 --> 00:57:16.100
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a linear document.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a document that</v>

1007
00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:20.390
<v Speaker 4>that you can move through in an infinite</v>
<v Speaker 4>number of.</v>

1008
00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:22.393
<v Speaker 4>There's an infinite number of pathways </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can use to walk through it and </v>

1009
00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:27.133
<v Speaker 4>all of the document expands upon and </v>
<v Speaker 4>refers to all of the rest of the </v>

1010
00:57:31.071 --> 00:57:34.940
<v Speaker 4>document and so I'm going to search </v>
<v Speaker 4>switch to the sermon on the mount,</v>

1011
00:57:34.941 --> 00:57:35.774
<v Speaker 4>which I think is probably the key </v>
<v Speaker 4>document in the New Testament and I'm </v>

1012
00:57:39.321 --> 00:57:40.154
<v Speaker 4>going to switch to it because I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the closest thing we have to a </v>

1013
00:57:44.481 --> 00:57:45.314
<v Speaker 4>fully articulated description of what it</v>
<v Speaker 4>would mean to walk with God so that </v>

1014
00:57:50.421 --> 00:57:52.850
<v Speaker 4>you're in the Ark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the flood comes.</v>

1015
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:56.150
<v Speaker 4>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the most fully articulated</v>

1016
00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:00.930
<v Speaker 4>realization of that idea that that leaps</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the metaphorical.</v>

1017
00:58:00.931 --> 00:58:02.220
<v Speaker 4>Because if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1018
00:58:02.221 --> 00:58:05.520
<v Speaker 4>you should conduct yourself like Noah </v>
<v Speaker 4>and walk with God and build an Ark.</v>

1019
00:58:05.521 --> 00:58:06.354
<v Speaker 4>Obviously those are poetic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>metaphorical suggestions and it's not </v>

1020
00:58:11.131 --> 00:58:13.350
<v Speaker 4>that easy to bring them into practice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1021
00:58:13.351 --> 00:58:14.184
<v Speaker 4>It's the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a big distance between you and </v>

1022
00:58:16.501 --> 00:58:17.334
<v Speaker 4>the archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't obvious how to manifest it in </v>

1023
00:58:19.081 --> 00:58:19.914
<v Speaker 4>your own life and what has to happen is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the archetype has to be differentiated </v>

1024
00:58:23.641 --> 00:58:24.474
<v Speaker 4>in articulated so that it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 4>sufficiently practical and personal so </v>

1025
00:58:28.531 --> 00:58:29.364
<v Speaker 4>that you can actually implement it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to take apart some of the </v>

1026
00:58:31.381 --> 00:58:32.214
<v Speaker 4>sermon on the mount.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It starts in Matthew five and I'm not </v>

1027
00:58:34.921 --> 00:58:35.754
<v Speaker 4>going to talk about Matthew Five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to talk about the end of </v>

1028
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:42.681
<v Speaker 4>Matthew six and most of matthew seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Consider the lilies of the field,</v>

1029
00:58:43.591 --> 00:58:45.300
<v Speaker 4>how they grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They toil.</v>

1030
00:58:45.301 --> 00:58:50.301
<v Speaker 4>Not Neither do they spin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yet I say unto you that even Solomon</v>

1031
00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:53.940
<v Speaker 4>in all his glory was not arrayed like </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of these.</v>

1032
00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.553
<v Speaker 4>Wherefore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if God so clothes the grass of the </v>

1033
00:58:58.091 --> 00:59:00.730
<v Speaker 4>field,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which today is and tomorrow is cast into</v>

1034
00:59:00.731 --> 00:59:03.730
<v Speaker 4>the oven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shall he not much more clothe you.</v>

1035
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh Ye of little faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Therefore,</v>

1036
00:59:05.801 --> 00:59:06.634
<v Speaker 4>take no thought saying what shall we eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>or what shall we drink or wherewithal </v>

1037
00:59:09.941 --> 00:59:10.774
<v Speaker 4>shall we be closed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are famous lines and that sort of </v>

1038
00:59:13.991 --> 00:59:16.090
<v Speaker 4>Christ the Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1039
00:59:16.091 --> 00:59:17.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1040
00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:21.350
<v Speaker 4>let it all hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an old phrase,</v>

1041
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 4>doing your</v>

1042
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:27.160
<v Speaker 2>thing and everything will come to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and these lines have been interpreted in</v>

1043
00:59:28.551 --> 00:59:29.384
<v Speaker 2>that manner many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's seriously not the proper </v>

1044
00:59:34.881 --> 00:59:35.714
<v Speaker 2>interpretation because there's a kicker </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this injunction and the kicker is </v>

1045
00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:45.670
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your heavenly father,</v>

1046
00:59:45.671 --> 00:59:47.920
<v Speaker 2>know that you have need of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1047
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.863
<v Speaker 2>but seek ye first the Kingdom of God and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his righteousness and all these things </v>

1048
00:59:52.631 --> 00:59:53.464
<v Speaker 2>shall be added unto you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot different than the hippie </v>

1049
00:59:55.541 --> 00:59:57.250
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1050
00:59:57.310 --> 00:59:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1051
00:59:58.931 --> 00:59:59.764
<v Speaker 2>very interesting idea here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly one of the most profound </v>

1052
01:00:02.531 --> 01:00:07.360
<v Speaker 2>ideas that I've ever encountered</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea is this,</v>

1053
01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:08.283
<v Speaker 2>is that if you configure your life so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that what you are genuinely doing is </v>

1054
01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:18.720
<v Speaker 2>aiming at the highest possible good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the things that you need to</v>

1055
01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:25.850
<v Speaker 2>to survive and to thrive on a day to day</v>
<v Speaker 2>basis will deliver themselves to you.</v>

1056
01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:32.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a hypothesis and it's not some </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple hypothesis,</v>

1057
01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:34.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what it basically says is if you</v>

1058
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:37.290
<v Speaker 2>dare to do the most difficult thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can conceptualize,</v>

1059
01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.840
<v Speaker 2>your life will work out better than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>

1060
01:00:39.841 --> 01:00:42.060
<v Speaker 2>If you do anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1061
01:00:42.061 --> 01:00:43.470
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to find out if that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>true?</v>

1062
01:00:43.471 --> 01:00:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kierkegaardian leap of faith.</v>

1063
01:00:45.751 --> 01:00:48.240
<v Speaker 2>There is no way you're going to find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not that's true unless you do</v>

1064
01:00:48.241 --> 01:00:49.074
<v Speaker 2>it so no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one can tell you either because just </v>

1065
01:00:52.951 --> 01:00:56.670
<v Speaker 2>because it works for someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's interesting and all that,</v>

1066
01:00:56.671 --> 01:00:58.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's no proof that it'll work for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1067
01:00:58.381 --> 01:01:03.381
<v Speaker 2>You have to be all in in this game and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is seek ye first the Kingdom</v>

1068
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.033
<v Speaker 2>of God and his righteousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's actually a fairly </v>

1069
01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:08.064
<v Speaker 2>important caution when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about not having to pay attention to </v>

1070
01:01:12.811 --> 01:01:13.644
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to eat or what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to where it's like what it's </v>

1071
01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:17.214
<v Speaker 2>essentially saying is that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems are trivial in comparison and </v>

1072
01:01:20.251 --> 01:01:24.180
<v Speaker 2>the probability is that if you manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself properly in the world,</v>

1073
01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:28.710
<v Speaker 2>that those things will come your way is </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily high and I believe,</v>

1074
01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I believe that that's exactly right.</v>

1075
01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:31.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1076
01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched people operate in the world</v>

1077
01:01:33.631 --> 01:01:34.464
<v Speaker 2>and I would say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no more effective way of </v>

1078
01:01:39.271 --> 01:01:40.104
<v Speaker 2>operating in the world than to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize the highest good that you </v>

1079
01:01:42.871 --> 01:01:47.871
<v Speaker 2>can and then strive to attain it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no more practical pathway to the</v>

1080
01:01:50.401 --> 01:01:55.050
<v Speaker 2>kind of success that you could have if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually knew what success was.</v>

1081
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:57.263
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what this sermon is attempting </v>

1082
01:02:00.541 --> 01:02:04.430
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pause it.</v>

1083
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:07.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the story of Pinocchio.</v>

1084
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:08.343
<v Speaker 2>You know what happens at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the story of Pinocchio is that Japan </v>

1085
01:02:10.861 --> 01:02:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Eto wishes on a star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about that a little bit and so</v>

1086
01:02:14.091 --> 01:02:14.924
<v Speaker 2>what you pedal does is align himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the metaphorical manifestation of </v>

1087
01:02:19.171 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 2>the highest good</v>

1088
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.993
<v Speaker 4>he can conceptualize and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says he makes sure he makes a </v>

1089
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:26.303
<v Speaker 4>commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say he aims at the star and for </v>

1090
01:02:29.851 --> 01:02:33.570
<v Speaker 4>him the star is the possibility that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>can take his creation,</v>

1091
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.613
<v Speaker 4>a puppet whose strings are being pulled </v>
<v Speaker 4>by unseen forces and have it transform </v>

1092
01:02:39.431 --> 01:02:42.660
<v Speaker 4>into something that's autonomist and </v>
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

1093
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1094
01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.713
<v Speaker 4>well that's a hell of an ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when we're wise enough to put </v>

1095
01:02:47.481 --> 01:02:48.314
<v Speaker 4>that into children's movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but too foolish to understand what it </v>

1096
01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:52.184
<v Speaker 4>means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such an interesting juxtaposition </v>

1097
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:56.630
<v Speaker 4>that that we can both know that and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>know it.</v>

1098
01:02:56.631 --> 01:02:58.670
<v Speaker 4>At the same time you can go to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>

1099
01:02:58.671 --> 01:02:59.504
<v Speaker 4>you can watch it and it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that you can go </v>

1100
01:03:01.821 --> 01:03:02.601
<v Speaker 4>home and think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1101
01:03:02.601 --> 01:03:05.360
<v Speaker 4>I know what that meant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While people are complicated,</v>

1102
01:03:05.361 --> 01:03:07.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We exist at different levels and all the</v>

1103
01:03:07.161 --> 01:03:08.750
<v Speaker 4>levels don't communicate with one </v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

1104
01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:09.584
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the movie is a hypothesis and the </v>

1105
01:03:12.471 --> 01:03:13.304
<v Speaker 4>hypothesis is there's no better pathway </v>
<v Speaker 4>to self realization and the enablement </v>

1106
01:03:18.501 --> 01:03:19.334
<v Speaker 4>of being than to pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The highest good that you can conceive </v>

1107
01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:26.510
<v Speaker 4>of and commit yourself to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you might also ask yourself,</v>

1108
01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:30.320
<v Speaker 4>and this is definitely worth asking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is do you really have anything better to</v>

1109
01:03:30.321 --> 01:03:32.090
<v Speaker 4>do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't,</v>

1110
01:03:32.091 --> 01:03:32.924
<v Speaker 4>well why would you do anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Therefore take no thought for the </v>

1111
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:38.664
<v Speaker 4>morrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the morrow shall take thought for </v>

1112
01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:42.780
<v Speaker 4>the things of itself sufficient unto the</v>
<v Speaker 4>day is the evil thereof.</v>

1113
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:44.963
<v Speaker 4>I spent a long time trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that too because it's another one </v>

1114
01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:48.174
<v Speaker 4>of those lines that</v>

1115
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:55.150
<v Speaker 4>can easily be read as</v>
<v Speaker 4>pro grasshopper and anti amped.</v>

1116
01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:57.203
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you remember the old fable of the </v>

1117
01:03:58.171 --> 01:04:00.930
<v Speaker 4>grasshopper and the and maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to tell it,</v>

1118
01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:01.803
<v Speaker 4>but</v>
<v Speaker 4>band works and the grasshopper fiddles </v>

1119
01:04:05.891 --> 01:04:09.280
<v Speaker 4>and the aunt has a pretty good time in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the winter and the grasshopper dies.</v>

1120
01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:10.563
<v Speaker 4>And so this is like a grasshopper line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not because it says something </v>

1121
01:04:14.021 --> 01:04:14.854
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says that if you orient yourself </v>

1122
01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:18.154
<v Speaker 4>properly</v>

1123
01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.380
<v Speaker 4>and then pay attention to what you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>every day that works and it.</v>

1124
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:25.303
<v Speaker 4>I actually think that that's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>accordance with what with what we have </v>

1125
01:04:27.441 --> 01:04:28.274
<v Speaker 4>come to understand about human </v>
<v Speaker 4>perception because what happens is that </v>

1126
01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.260
<v Speaker 4>the world shifts itself around your aim </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're a.</v>

1127
01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:37.103
<v Speaker 4>you're a creature that has an aim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have an ame in order to do </v>

1128
01:04:39.411 --> 01:04:41.120
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in aiming creature.</v>

1129
01:04:41.121 --> 01:04:44.030
<v Speaker 4>You look at a point and you move towards</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1130
01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:47.210
<v Speaker 4>It's built right into you and so you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have an aim.</v>

1131
01:04:47.211 --> 01:04:48.044
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say your aim is the highest </v>

1132
01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:49.484
<v Speaker 4>possible ame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then so that sets up the world </v>

1133
01:04:52.071 --> 01:04:53.200
<v Speaker 4>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

1134
01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:54.123
<v Speaker 4>it organizes all of your perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It organizes what you see and you don't </v>

1135
01:04:57.171 --> 01:04:58.004
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It organizes your emotions and your </v>

1136
01:04:58.971 --> 01:05:02.360
<v Speaker 4>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you organize yourself around that aim</v>

1137
01:05:02.361 --> 01:05:03.194
<v Speaker 4>and then what happens is the day </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifests itself as a set of challenges </v>

1138
01:05:07.011 --> 01:05:09.620
<v Speaker 4>and problems and if you solve them </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>

1139
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:10.723
<v Speaker 4>then you stay on the pathway towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>that eighth and you can concentrate on </v>

1140
01:05:13.581 --> 01:05:14.414
<v Speaker 4>the on the on the day and so that way </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to have your cake and eat it </v>

1141
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 4>because you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can point into the distance,</v>

1142
01:05:20.471 --> 01:05:23.530
<v Speaker 4>the far distance and you can live in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>day</v>

1143
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:26.463
<v Speaker 4>and it seems to me that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes every moment of the day </v>

1144
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:31.300
<v Speaker 4>supercharged with meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that's how.</v>

1145
01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:32.183
<v Speaker 4>Because if everything that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyday is related to the highest </v>

1146
01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:37.870
<v Speaker 4>possible aim that you can conceptualize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1147
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:38.704
<v Speaker 4>that's the very definition of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning that would sustain you in your </v>

1148
01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:41.920
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1149
01:05:41.921 --> 01:05:42.754
<v Speaker 4>and then the issue is well back to noah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well all hell is about to break loose </v>

1150
01:05:45.761 --> 01:05:46.594
<v Speaker 4>and chaos is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when that's happening in your </v>

1151
01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:48.814
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might want to be doing something </v>

1152
01:05:50.051 --> 01:05:50.884
<v Speaker 4>that you regard as truly worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's what will keep you </v>

1153
01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:54.784
<v Speaker 4>afloat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When when everything is flooded and you </v>

1154
01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:02.890
<v Speaker 4>don't want to wait until the flood comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>to start doing that,</v>

1155
01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:07.150
<v Speaker 4>because if you're arcs half built and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know how to captain it,</v>

1156
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.620
<v Speaker 4>the probability is very high that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll drown.</v>

1157
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:17.733
<v Speaker 4>Take therefore no thought for the moral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for the morrow shall take thought </v>

1158
01:06:20.501 --> 01:06:21.334
<v Speaker 4>for the things of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sufficient unto the day is the evil </v>

1159
01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:25.114
<v Speaker 4>thereof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a particularly optimistic </v>

1160
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:33.240
<v Speaker 4>formulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>judge.</v>

1161
01:06:33.241 --> 01:06:37.230
<v Speaker 4>Not that you be not judged for with what</v>
<v Speaker 4>judgment you judge.</v>

1162
01:06:37.231 --> 01:06:39.360
<v Speaker 4>You shall be judged and with what </v>
<v Speaker 4>measure you meet.</v>

1163
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.890
<v Speaker 4>It shall be measured to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again</v>

1164
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:48.340
<v Speaker 4>to sensible piece of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a sensible description.</v>

1165
01:06:48.341 --> 01:06:49.174
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't call it a piece of advice </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't think that any of this </v>

1166
01:06:50.981 --> 01:06:51.814
<v Speaker 4>is advice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a description of the structure of </v>

1167
01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:53.884
<v Speaker 4>reality that's not the same as advice </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it basically says that you'll be </v>

1168
01:06:57.971 --> 01:07:01.600
<v Speaker 4>held accountable by the rules of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game that you choose to play</v>

1169
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.353
<v Speaker 4>and that I also think is perfectly in </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping with what we understand about </v>

1170
01:07:07.331 --> 01:07:09.930
<v Speaker 4>human psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you,</v>

1171
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:10.803
<v Speaker 4>you are playing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to play a game that other </v>

1172
01:07:12.251 --> 01:07:13.084
<v Speaker 4>people will allow you to play and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>will cooperate with you while you're </v>

1173
01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:17.170
<v Speaker 4>playing and it will compete with you </v>
<v Speaker 4>while you're playing it,</v>

1174
01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.213
<v Speaker 4>but you have a fair bit of flexibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>in setting up the parameters of the </v>

1175
01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:21.874
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have any choice about </v>

1176
01:07:22.991 --> 01:07:24.490
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you're going to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

1177
01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:26.013
<v Speaker 4>You're in a game and you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>held accountable by the rules of the </v>

1178
01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:30.094
<v Speaker 4>game because that's how the game works </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you might want to pick a game by </v>

1179
01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:39.370
<v Speaker 4>whose rules you would be willing to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>held accountable</v>

1180
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:44.320
<v Speaker 4>and why be hold us Dow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moat that isn't my brother's eye,</v>

1181
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:49.321
<v Speaker 4>but consider us not the beam that is in </v>
<v Speaker 4>diagnosis or how will you say to that?</v>

1182
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:50.463
<v Speaker 4>My brother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me pull out the most of out of the </v>

1183
01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:54.070
<v Speaker 4>NIH and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a beam is in nine Onei.</v>

1184
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:55.243
<v Speaker 4>What you might be wondering what a beam </v>
<v Speaker 4>is in a moat is the dust speck and a </v>

1185
01:08:00.541 --> 01:08:05.541
<v Speaker 4>beam is a very large piece of lumber and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the issue is</v>

1186
01:08:07.210 --> 01:08:08.043
<v Speaker 4>not so much the blindness of others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though there's as much blindness </v>

1187
01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:17.610
<v Speaker 4>among others as there is</v>
<v Speaker 4>as there is for you,</v>

1188
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.210
<v Speaker 4>but the issue here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the advice here,</v>

1189
01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:21.044
<v Speaker 4>the description here is you should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned about what's interfering with </v>

1190
01:08:24.051 --> 01:08:24.884
<v Speaker 4>your own vision first and you should </v>
<v Speaker 4>leave other people the hell alone in </v>

1191
01:08:28.761 --> 01:08:29.594
<v Speaker 4>relationship to that and so if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mode of being in the world is if you </v>

1192
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:36.440
<v Speaker 4>would just act better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things would improve for me.</v>

1193
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:37.723
<v Speaker 4>Or if you identify the evil and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe is something that's outside </v>

1194
01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.153
<v Speaker 4>that someone else needs to fix or that </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's responded someone else's </v>

1195
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.330
<v Speaker 4>responsible for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then</v>

1196
01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:55.803
<v Speaker 4>then you're not going to fix that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to remain blind to the </v>

1197
01:08:59.231 --> 01:09:03.550
<v Speaker 4>things that you're doing and not doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that make things not go well and so it's</v>

1198
01:09:03.551 --> 01:09:05.650
<v Speaker 4>just better to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1199
01:09:05.651 --> 01:09:06.484
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably blind in many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many ways and maybe there are some ways </v>

1200
01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:10.893
<v Speaker 4>that I could rectify that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>highly probable that you're blind and </v>

1201
01:09:13.271 --> 01:09:14.800
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1202
01:09:14.801 --> 01:09:15.790
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in fact,</v>

1203
01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:20.230
<v Speaker 4>it's virtually certain and so it's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>more useful to think,</v>

1204
01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:24.120
<v Speaker 4>how is it that I'm wrong in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation?</v>

1205
01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.990
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you something that I learned </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do when I was arguing with my wife,</v>

1206
01:09:27.991 --> 01:09:28.824
<v Speaker 4>which happened quite frequently because </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you actually communicate with </v>

1207
01:09:33.151 --> 01:09:33.984
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find out that there's many things </v>

1208
01:09:34.951 --> 01:09:35.784
<v Speaker 4>that you don't agree on and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you are actually different </v>

1209
01:09:37.801 --> 01:09:41.640
<v Speaker 4>creatures and so if you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have a truthful conversation,</v>

1210
01:09:41.641 --> 01:09:42.474
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to find out that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't see things the same way and then </v>

1211
01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:49.930
<v Speaker 4>you can either pretend that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>the case in gloss over it and then ended</v>

1212
01:09:49.931 --> 01:09:50.764
<v Speaker 4>up in a 30 year silent war or you can or</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can have the damn fight when you </v>

1213
01:09:56.671 --> 01:09:58.830
<v Speaker 4>need to have it and see if you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>straighten it out.</v>

1214
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:03.530
<v Speaker 4>So now and then we'd get into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation where we were at loggerheads.</v>

1215
01:10:03.531 --> 01:10:08.420
<v Speaker 4>We couldn't move and it would spiral up </v>
<v Speaker 4>into hate speech,</v>

1216
01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:10.300
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because yeah,</v>

1217
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.353
<v Speaker 4>everyone laughs because they know they </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest plenty of hate speech towards </v>

1218
01:10:14.061 --> 01:10:14.894
<v Speaker 4>those they love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things we learned to do </v>

1219
01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:18.464
<v Speaker 4>was when we hit an impasse was to </v>
<v Speaker 4>separate and to go our own ways and to </v>

1220
01:10:24.111 --> 01:10:25.370
<v Speaker 4>go sit and think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1221
01:10:25.371 --> 01:10:26.840
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're at this</v>

1222
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.010
<v Speaker 4>unpleasant situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't figure out how to move forward.</v>

1223
01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I'd always think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course it's her fault.</v>

1224
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Obviously it's her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Least 95 percent,</v>

1225
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:44.500
<v Speaker 4>but maybe there was something I did that</v>
<v Speaker 4>contributed like five percent to it.</v>

1226
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:50.920
<v Speaker 4>And so I would sit and think and ask </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself a question which was,</v>

1227
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:52.303
<v Speaker 4>is there anything I did in the last six </v>
<v Speaker 4>months that increase the probability </v>

1228
01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:59.000
<v Speaker 4>that this impasse would manifest itself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'll tell you,</v>

1229
01:10:59.001 --> 01:10:59.834
<v Speaker 4>you have no idea how fast your mind will</v>
<v Speaker 4>generate an answer to a question like </v>

1230
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:07.010
<v Speaker 4>that because there's undoubtedly some </v>
<v Speaker 4>idiotic thing that you did that you know</v>

1231
01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:07.844
<v Speaker 4>that you remember that increased the </v>
<v Speaker 4>probability that you're going to have </v>

1232
01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:12.800
<v Speaker 4>your hands around the throat of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>person that you love.</v>

1233
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.160
<v Speaker 4>And then you can go tell them that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can have a conversation.</v>

1234
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:18.990
<v Speaker 4>Especially if they do the same thing.</v>

1235
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:19.771
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1236
01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:20.604
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's how I'm an idiot in this </v>

1237
01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:24.780
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the person says,</v>

1238
01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:25.614
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1239
01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:27.020
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's how I'm an idiot,</v>

1240
01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:29.730
<v Speaker 4>and then your two idiots and then maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can have a conversation.</v>

1241
01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:35.130
<v Speaker 4>So thou hypocrite first cast out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beam of light out of I and I,</v>

1242
01:11:35.131 --> 01:11:38.790
<v Speaker 4>and then shalt thou see clearly to cast </v>
<v Speaker 4>out the mote of my brothers.</v>

1243
01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:39.624
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's pay hard to argue with that ask </v>

1244
01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:44.363
<v Speaker 4>and it shall be given you seek and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>shall find knock and it shall be opened </v>

1245
01:11:46.861 --> 01:11:47.694
<v Speaker 4>unto you for everyone that Asketh </v>
<v Speaker 4>receive it and he that seeketh findeth </v>

1246
01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:55.770
<v Speaker 4>and to him that hath it shall be opened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty optimistic again,</v>

1247
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.170
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

1248
01:11:58.171 --> 01:12:01.410
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a description of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of existential reality.</v>

1249
01:12:01.411 --> 01:12:02.970
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and by,</v>

1250
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.050
<v Speaker 4>by which I mean</v>

1251
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:09.430
<v Speaker 4>when I'm in my clinical practice and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>observe,</v>

1252
01:12:09.431 --> 01:12:11.100
<v Speaker 4>and this is also the case with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>students,</v>

1253
01:12:11.101 --> 01:12:15.270
<v Speaker 4>is let's say people's lives aren't what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would like them to be.</v>

1254
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.570
<v Speaker 4>And so then you ask why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1255
01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.433
<v Speaker 4>forget about tragedy and catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's self evident and we're </v>

1256
01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:23.904
<v Speaker 4>not going to discuss that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although the degree to which you bring </v>

1257
01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:29.190
<v Speaker 4>about your own tragedy is always </v>
<v Speaker 4>indeterminant.</v>

1258
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.233
<v Speaker 4>But I would never say that every </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible thing that is visited on a </v>

1259
01:12:33.841 --> 01:12:34.674
<v Speaker 4>person is something they deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's a very dangerous </v>

1260
01:12:38.371 --> 01:12:39.204
<v Speaker 4>presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially because everyone gets sick </v>

1261
01:12:41.371 --> 01:12:42.204
<v Speaker 4>and everyone dies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the main reasons that people </v>

1262
01:12:48.991 --> 01:12:53.991
<v Speaker 4>don't get what they want is because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't actually figure out what it is and</v>

1263
01:12:54.171 --> 01:12:55.970
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>

1264
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.410
<v Speaker 4>What would be good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1265
01:12:57.411 --> 01:12:59.210
<v Speaker 4>which would even be better than what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want,</v>

1266
01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>

1267
01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:03.320
<v Speaker 4>you might be wrong about what you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>easily,</v>

1268
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:06.290
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you could get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would really be good for you?</v>

1269
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:09.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you.</v>

1270
01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you don't try.</v>

1271
01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.380
<v Speaker 4>You don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1272
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:16.750
<v Speaker 4>here's what I would like if I could have</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1273
01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:17.643
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean I don't mean in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you manipulate the world to force </v>

1274
01:13:21.941 --> 01:13:25.630
<v Speaker 4>it to deliver you good for status or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1275
01:13:25.631 --> 01:13:26.464
<v Speaker 4>That isn't what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean something like imagine that you </v>

1276
01:13:29.241 --> 01:13:30.074
<v Speaker 4>were taking care of yourself like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were someone you actually cared for and </v>

1277
01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:33.880
<v Speaker 4>then you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1278
01:13:33.881 --> 01:13:34.714
<v Speaker 4>I am caring for this person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like things to go as well for </v>

1279
01:13:37.271 --> 01:13:40.600
<v Speaker 4>them as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would their life have to be like in</v>

1280
01:13:40.601 --> 01:13:43.960
<v Speaker 4>order for that to be the case where </v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't do that?</v>

1281
01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:45.410
<v Speaker 4>They don't sit down and think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1282
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:46.750
<v Speaker 4>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's figure it out.</v>

1283
01:13:46.751 --> 01:13:47.650
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a life.</v>

1284
01:13:47.651 --> 01:13:49.180
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously.</v>

1285
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:52.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like three years from now you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>have what you need.</v>

1286
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.690
<v Speaker 4>You got to be careful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have everything.</v>

1287
01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:57.973
<v Speaker 4>You can have what would be good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to figure out what it is </v>

1288
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:02.180
<v Speaker 4>and then you have to aim at it.</v>

1289
01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:06.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my experience with people as being as if</v>

1290
01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:09.890
<v Speaker 4>they figure out what it is that would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>good for them and then they aim at it,</v>

1291
01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.250
<v Speaker 4>then they get it and it's strange </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they don't know.</v>

1292
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.433
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not quite that simple because you </v>

1293
01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:17.693
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may formulate an idea about what </v>

1294
01:14:18.671 --> 01:14:19.504
<v Speaker 4>would be good for you and then you take </v>
<v Speaker 4>10 steps towards that and you find out </v>

1295
01:14:21.881 --> 01:14:25.210
<v Speaker 4>that your formulation was a bit off and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to reformulate your goal.</v>

1296
01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:29.290
<v Speaker 4>So you're kind of going like this as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>move towards the goal,</v>

1297
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:30.423
<v Speaker 4>but a huge part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people fail is because they don't ever </v>

1298
01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:34.563
<v Speaker 4>set up the criteria for success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so since success is a very narrow </v>

1299
01:14:38.351 --> 01:14:39.184
<v Speaker 4>line in very unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you're going to </v>

1300
01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:45.841
<v Speaker 4>stumble on it randomly is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there's a proposition here in the</v>

1301
01:14:46.031 --> 01:14:49.870
<v Speaker 4>proposition is if you actually want </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1302
01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.100
<v Speaker 4>you can have it.</v>

1303
01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.840
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question then would be,</v>

1304
01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.360
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean by actually want?</v>

1305
01:14:57.970 --> 01:14:58.803
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is that you reorient your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life in every possible way to make the </v>

1306
01:15:04.741 --> 01:15:08.490
<v Speaker 4>probability that that will occur as </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain as possible.</v>

1307
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:10.290
<v Speaker 4>And that's a sacrificial idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1308
01:15:10.291 --> 01:15:15.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't get everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously you obviously,</v>

1309
01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:16.733
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you can have what you need and</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe all you have to do to get it is </v>

1310
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.400
<v Speaker 4>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but asking isn't a whim or today's wish.</v>

1311
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.910
<v Speaker 4>It's like you have to be deadly serious </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1312
01:15:29.911 --> 01:15:30.960
<v Speaker 4>You have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1313
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:31.833
<v Speaker 4>like I'm taking stock of myself and if I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going to live properly in the world </v>

1314
01:15:35.551 --> 01:15:36.384
<v Speaker 4>and I was going to set myself up such </v>
<v Speaker 4>that being would justify itself in my </v>

1315
01:15:41.731 --> 01:15:42.564
<v Speaker 4>estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't mean as a harsh judge </v>

1316
01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.240
<v Speaker 4>exactly what is it that I would aim at?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1317
01:15:48.241 --> 01:15:52.640
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've found is that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>test of this theory,</v>

1318
01:15:52.641 --> 01:15:56.860
<v Speaker 4>let's say</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could try this.</v>

1319
01:15:57.850 --> 01:15:58.683
<v Speaker 4>This is a form of prayer knocking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sit on your bed one day and ask </v>

1320
01:16:02.501 --> 01:16:03.580
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1321
01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:09.570
<v Speaker 4>what's what remarkably stupid things am </v>
<v Speaker 4>I doing on a regular basis to absolutely</v>

1322
01:16:10.451 --> 01:16:14.380
<v Speaker 4>screw up my life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you actually asked that question,</v>

1323
01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.940
<v Speaker 4>but you have to want to know the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1324
01:16:15.941 --> 01:16:18.040
<v Speaker 4>Because that's actually what asking the </v>
<v Speaker 4>question means.</v>

1325
01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:18.963
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean just mouthing the words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means you have to decide that you </v>

1326
01:16:21.881 --> 01:16:24.730
<v Speaker 4>want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll figure that out so fast.</v>

1327
01:16:24.731 --> 01:16:25.870
<v Speaker 4>It'll make your hair curl,</v>

1328
01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.920
<v Speaker 4>you'll you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's as if young thought about this,</v>

1329
01:16:30.921 --> 01:16:31.754
<v Speaker 4>he saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought that people had two poles of </v>

1330
01:16:33.261 --> 01:16:34.094
<v Speaker 4>consciousness in one was the individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness that we each identify </v>

1331
01:16:37.011 --> 01:16:37.844
<v Speaker 4>within.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other was something he called the </v>

1332
01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:39.344
<v Speaker 4>self and the self is the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might think about it as the divine </v>

1333
01:16:41.961 --> 01:16:44.330
<v Speaker 4>within.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's close enough approximation.</v>

1334
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:47.180
<v Speaker 4>It's the universal part of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>

1335
01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.150
<v Speaker 4>It's your conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

1336
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:54.020
<v Speaker 4>Whatever your conscience is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's something that you can consult.</v>

1337
01:16:54.021 --> 01:16:54.854
<v Speaker 4>It's like the Socratic Damon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Socrates said that the thing that made </v>

1338
01:16:58.041 --> 01:17:02.360
<v Speaker 4>him different than everyone else in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Greece was that he consulted his demon,</v>

1339
01:17:02.361 --> 01:17:03.194
<v Speaker 4>his genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He asked himself how it was that he </v>

1340
01:17:06.051 --> 01:17:08.960
<v Speaker 4>should conduct himself in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he did that.</v>

1341
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:12.080
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't try to force a solution.</v>

1342
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:14.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't try to force a solution.</v>

1343
01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 4>Selfishly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he asked,</v>

1344
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to manifest myself in the best</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible manner in the world.</v>

1345
01:17:19.521 --> 01:17:22.400
<v Speaker 4>I would like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would that be?</v>

1346
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:25.280
<v Speaker 4>While you're perfectly capable of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

1347
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:26.443
<v Speaker 4>God only knows how you're perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 4>capable of immense feats of imagination </v>

1348
01:17:31.491 --> 01:17:35.270
<v Speaker 4>and dreams and fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God only knows how you do all of that.</v>

1349
01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.690
<v Speaker 4>What would happen if you consulted </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself about the best possible outcome</v>

1350
01:17:38.691 --> 01:17:41.150
<v Speaker 4>for you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might get an answer.</v>

1351
01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:43.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what this proposition is</v>

1352
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:52.910
<v Speaker 4>or what man is the review,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who if his son asks for bread,</v>

1353
01:17:52.911 --> 01:17:55.040
<v Speaker 4>will give him a stone or if he asks for </v>
<v Speaker 4>a fish,</v>

1354
01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:58.730
<v Speaker 4>will give him a serpent if he then being</v>
<v Speaker 4>evil,</v>

1355
01:17:58.731 --> 01:18:00.740
<v Speaker 4>know how to give good gifts unto your </v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

1356
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:01.723
<v Speaker 4>How much more shall your father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is in heaven give good things to </v>

1357
01:18:04.131 --> 01:18:06.740
<v Speaker 4>them that ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1358
01:18:06.741 --> 01:18:09.380
<v Speaker 4>this is a question about the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature of being,</v>

1359
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:15.100
<v Speaker 4>I suppose and one of the hypotheses in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the new testament which is different.</v>

1360
01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:18.563
<v Speaker 4>It's a different hypothesis in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense than the one that structures the </v>

1361
01:18:20.631 --> 01:18:25.631
<v Speaker 4>old testament is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>faith bakes being good.</v>

1362
01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:32.050
<v Speaker 4>It's a very interesting proposition and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so the notion would be,</v>

1363
01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:34.810
<v Speaker 4>and it it's an action oriented issue as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1364
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:39.400
<v Speaker 4>You act out the proposition that if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>act properly in the world,</v>

1365
01:18:39.401 --> 01:18:41.710
<v Speaker 4>that being will reveal itself to you as </v>
<v Speaker 4>benevolent,</v>

1366
01:18:42.610 --> 01:18:45.460
<v Speaker 4>but you will not know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll never know unless you do it.</v>

1367
01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.013
<v Speaker 4>So this is a call to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Act out the proposition that if you act </v>

1368
01:18:51.161 --> 01:18:54.100
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that being itself is benevolent.</v>

1369
01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.320
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason to assume the </v>
<v Speaker 4>contrary.</v>

1370
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:04.423
<v Speaker 4>I mean to assume the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be to be as cynical and bitter </v>

1371
01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:09.860
<v Speaker 4>as possible and it's not like we don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have reason for that.</v>

1372
01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.710
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I don't understand why </v>
<v Speaker 4>that happens to people.</v>

1373
01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:19.620
<v Speaker 4>Therefore all things whatsoever you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would that men should do to you,</v>

1374
01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:20.483
<v Speaker 4>do you even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to them for this as the law and the </v>

1375
01:19:23.341 --> 01:19:26.640
<v Speaker 4>prophets and that's a reciprocity issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1376
01:19:26.641 --> 01:19:27.474
<v Speaker 4>It's like while imagine what would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is another thing I learned from </v>

1377
01:19:30.601 --> 01:19:34.080
<v Speaker 4>young because young reverse this because</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is often read,</v>

1378
01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:37.950
<v Speaker 4>it's the golden rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's often read is be nice to be nice to</v>

1379
01:19:37.951 --> 01:19:38.784
<v Speaker 4>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that is not what this rule </v>

1380
01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:40.734
<v Speaker 4>means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that even a little bit </v>

1381
01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.373
<v Speaker 4>it means something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'll reverse it so that will </v>

1382
01:19:47.211 --> 01:19:50.060
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on you rather than the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>person to begin with.</v>

1383
01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.073
<v Speaker 4>It means something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptualize how things could be great </v>

1384
01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:58.453
<v Speaker 4>if they were great for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were taking care of yourself and </v>

1385
01:20:01.071 --> 01:20:03.290
<v Speaker 4>then work to make that the case for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone else.</v>

1386
01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:05.603
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that in Buddhism because Buddha </v>

1387
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.430
<v Speaker 4>reached Nirvana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1388
01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:09.683
<v Speaker 4>That's the theory and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was tempted with offer to stay there </v>

1389
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.233
<v Speaker 4>and he rejected that offer and came back</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the profane world because he felt </v>

1390
01:20:19.321 --> 01:20:24.210
<v Speaker 4>that the attainment of nirvana was </v>
<v Speaker 4>insufficient unless everyone attained it</v>

1391
01:20:24.211 --> 01:20:27.000
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously and so it's something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

1392
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:32.390
<v Speaker 4>but it's treat yourself properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a hard thing to do because you're</v>

1393
01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:36.720
<v Speaker 4>a fallen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shameful,</v>

1394
01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.030
<v Speaker 4>cowardly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deceitful,</v>

1395
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.200
<v Speaker 4>malevolent,</v>

1396
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:42.663
<v Speaker 4>mortal creature and so it's not easy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it and it's not easy to treat </v>

1397
01:20:46.871 --> 01:20:47.704
<v Speaker 4>something like that properly and and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it isn't obvious that people treat </v>

1398
01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:54.130
<v Speaker 4>themselves better than they treat other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1399
01:20:54.131 --> 01:20:54.964
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's obvious at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you could start with yourself </v>

1400
01:20:57.221 --> 01:20:57.821
<v Speaker 4>and think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1401
01:20:57.821 --> 01:21:00.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take care of myself as if I</v>
<v Speaker 4>have value.</v>

1402
01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:02.373
<v Speaker 4>What would that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I'm going to work to extend </v>

1403
01:21:04.241 --> 01:21:07.000
<v Speaker 4>that courtesy to everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's.</v>

1404
01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:07.893
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hypothesis here is that if you take </v>

1405
01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:15.640
<v Speaker 4>all of the moral wisdom that mankind has</v>
<v Speaker 4>generated over,</v>

1406
01:21:15.641 --> 01:21:20.641
<v Speaker 4>it's millennia of struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolved and then manifested metaphors,</v>

1407
01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:26.520
<v Speaker 4>story and then codified into law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>articulated law,</v>

1408
01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:30.390
<v Speaker 4>and you pick one principle that </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominated all of that.</v>

1409
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.860
<v Speaker 4>This would be the principal</v>

1410
01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:37.293
<v Speaker 4>and it's interesting too because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the law and the prophets and the law is </v>

1411
01:21:40.781 --> 01:21:41.614
<v Speaker 4>the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the profits or the process by which </v>

1412
01:21:43.061 --> 01:21:45.020
<v Speaker 4>the rules are being updated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1413
01:21:45.021 --> 01:21:45.854
<v Speaker 4>and so the profits are a superordinate </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sense to the law and the </v>

1414
01:21:49.031 --> 01:21:49.864
<v Speaker 4>proposition that's set forth in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular statement is that this maxim </v>

1415
01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:54.933
<v Speaker 4>which is optimize your own mode of being</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then work to do the same for </v>

1416
01:21:58.541 --> 01:22:02.170
<v Speaker 4>everyone around you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not only the thing that's at the core</v>

1417
01:22:02.171 --> 01:22:04.360
<v Speaker 4>of the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's at the core of the process that</v>

1418
01:22:04.361 --> 01:22:06.130
<v Speaker 4>generates it updates the law</v>

1419
01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:10.323
<v Speaker 4>hell of a thing for someone to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enter Ye in at the narrow gate because </v>

1420
01:22:14.981 --> 01:22:15.814
<v Speaker 4>that's what straight means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Enter ye in at the straight gate for </v>

1421
01:22:18.011 --> 01:22:20.920
<v Speaker 4>wide is the gate and broad is the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that leads to destruction.</v>

1422
01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:21.963
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who in the world could possibly argue </v>

1423
01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:25.300
<v Speaker 4>with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every one in their right mind knows that</v>

1424
01:22:25.301 --> 01:22:26.134
<v Speaker 4>there's a million ways of doing things </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong and one way if you're lucky to do </v>

1425
01:22:28.871 --> 01:22:32.080
<v Speaker 4>things right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the notion that it's a very,</v>

1426
01:22:32.081 --> 01:22:35.770
<v Speaker 4>very narrow pathway that you tread upon </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're doing things right,</v>

1427
01:22:35.771 --> 01:22:37.780
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's wisdom,</v>

1428
01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:40.323
<v Speaker 4>that's the line between chaos and order </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're supposed to be on </v>

1429
01:22:42.641 --> 01:22:43.600
<v Speaker 4>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1430
01:22:43.601 --> 01:22:44.434
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very thin line because if you're a </v>

1431
01:22:45.521 --> 01:22:46.354
<v Speaker 4>little bit too far in one direction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's too much chaos that if you're </v>

1432
01:22:48.791 --> 01:22:49.624
<v Speaker 4>a little too far in the other direction </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's too much order and both of </v>

1433
01:22:51.731 --> 01:22:52.480
<v Speaker 4>those aren't good.</v>

1434
01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.313
<v Speaker 4>It has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Balance has to be exactly right and you </v>

1435
01:22:55.091 --> 01:22:55.924
<v Speaker 4>can feel that and I truly believe you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can feel that and I think it's your </v>

1436
01:22:58.541 --> 01:22:59.374
<v Speaker 4>deepest instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's your deepest instinct and I mean </v>

1437
01:23:01.571 --> 01:23:03.520
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that biologically.</v>

1438
01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:04.533
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean that metaphorically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that your psyche is arranged to </v>

1439
01:23:07.961 --> 01:23:12.010
<v Speaker 4>exist in a cosmos that's composed of </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos and order.</v>

1440
01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:12.963
<v Speaker 4>I think that's why you have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hemispheric structure that you have </v>

1441
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:15.663
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is deeper than metaphor and then </v>

1442
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:22.120
<v Speaker 4>when you feel as if you're meaningfully </v>
<v Speaker 4>engaged in the world,</v>

1443
01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:23.343
<v Speaker 4>when the terror of your mortality strips</v>
<v Speaker 4>away and you're engaged and it's </v>

1444
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.113
<v Speaker 4>timeless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the deepest instinct you have </v>

1445
01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:31.953
<v Speaker 4>telling you that you're in the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>place at the right time and then what </v>

1446
01:23:35.381 --> 01:23:39.250
<v Speaker 4>you do is practice being their practice </v>
<v Speaker 4>being there and that's that,</v>

1447
01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:41.620
<v Speaker 4>that narrow spot that's so difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 4>find.</v>

1448
01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.420
<v Speaker 4>You wander around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if you're lucky,</v>

1449
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.130
<v Speaker 4>you can watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can watch.</v>

1450
01:23:45.131 --> 01:23:45.964
<v Speaker 4>This is an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch yourself for two weeks like you </v>

1451
01:23:48.551 --> 01:23:50.340
<v Speaker 4>don't know who you are because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

1452
01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.273
<v Speaker 4>So watch yourself for two weeks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>notice there's gonna be times when </v>

1453
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:56.170
<v Speaker 4>things are proper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their raid properly for you,</v>

1454
01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:57.253
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy to notice because when </v>

1455
01:23:58.661 --> 01:24:00.220
<v Speaker 4>they're arrayed like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're so engaged.</v>

1456
01:24:00.221 --> 01:24:02.050
<v Speaker 4>You don't exactly notice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1457
01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.161
<v Speaker 4>but you'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1458
01:24:03.161 --> 01:24:04.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1459
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:06.250
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how'd I get here?</v>

1460
01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.940
<v Speaker 4>What am I doing right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1461
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:11.170
<v Speaker 4>how is it that this could happen more </v>
<v Speaker 4>often?</v>

1462
01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.033
<v Speaker 4>I'd like this to happen more often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would I have to conduct myself in </v>

1463
01:24:13.961 --> 01:24:14.794
<v Speaker 4>order for that to happen more often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you practice that and then </v>

1464
01:24:17.231 --> 01:24:20.290
<v Speaker 4>maybe instead of 10 minutes a month or </v>
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes a week,</v>

1465
01:24:20.291 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 4>it's like 15 minutes a day and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>half an hour a day and then it's an hour</v>

1466
01:24:23.861 --> 01:24:26.470
<v Speaker 4>a day and then it's four hours a day and</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe if you're.</v>

1467
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.513
<v Speaker 4>If you're extraordinarily careful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you get to a point where you're </v>

1468
01:24:29.801 --> 01:24:30.634
<v Speaker 4>like that a good proportion of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because straight is the gate and narrow </v>

1469
01:24:37.141 --> 01:24:39.450
<v Speaker 4>is the way which leads to life and few </v>
<v Speaker 4>there be that,</v>

1470
01:24:39.451 --> 01:24:40.284
<v Speaker 4>find it.</v>

1471
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:46.020
<v Speaker 4>You were a false prophets which come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you in sheep's clothing,</v>

1472
01:24:46.021 --> 01:24:46.854
<v Speaker 4>but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's particularly good advice for </v>

1473
01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:52.080
<v Speaker 4>today's political situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you,</v>

1474
01:24:54.570 --> 01:24:58.290
<v Speaker 4>you shall know them by their fruits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do men gather grapes,</v>

1475
01:24:58.291 --> 01:24:59.124
<v Speaker 4>have thorns or figs of thistles even so </v>
<v Speaker 4>every good tree bringeth forth good </v>

1476
01:25:03.451 --> 01:25:04.284
<v Speaker 4>fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil </v>

1477
01:25:05.911 --> 01:25:08.270
<v Speaker 4>fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1478
01:25:08.271 --> 01:25:09.104
<v Speaker 4>that's what I learned from studying the </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of totalitarianism in the 20th </v>

1479
01:25:12.291 --> 01:25:15.590
<v Speaker 4>century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that a corrupt tree brings forth evil</v>

1480
01:25:15.591 --> 01:25:18.170
<v Speaker 4>fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's for sure.</v>

1481
01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:21.630
<v Speaker 4>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1482
01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.353
<v Speaker 4>people who think when they're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about their relationship with divinity </v>

1483
01:25:27.291 --> 01:25:31.700
<v Speaker 4>or their relationship with God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think it's a primitive and childish</v>

1484
01:25:31.701 --> 01:25:34.190
<v Speaker 4>way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if a miracle just manifest?</v>

1485
01:25:34.191 --> 01:25:37.370
<v Speaker 4>Why kind of miracle just manifest itself</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I would be convinced,</v>

1486
01:25:37.371 --> 01:25:39.800
<v Speaker 4>and the funny thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is first of all actually you wouldn't be</v>

1487
01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:40.634
<v Speaker 4>if a miracle actually happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would actually forget about it and </v>

1488
01:25:42.891 --> 01:25:43.724
<v Speaker 4>about six months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's I mean you'd think that's not </v>

1489
01:25:45.531 --> 01:25:46.341
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's true.</v>

1490
01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:48.950
<v Speaker 4>You would actually forget about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's what people are like,</v>

1491
01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.370
<v Speaker 4>but there are negative miracles that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening all the time,</v>

1492
01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.273
<v Speaker 4>which actually lends some credence to my</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposition and we don't pay any </v>

1493
01:25:55.611 --> 01:25:56.444
<v Speaker 4>attention to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we can't learn from what happened in </v>

1494
01:25:58.311 --> 01:25:59.144
<v Speaker 4>the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we are absolutely incapable of </v>

1495
01:26:01.131 --> 01:26:01.964
<v Speaker 4>learning because what in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 4>century was as bitter as set of lessons </v>

1496
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:11.270
<v Speaker 4>as you could possibly imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's associated precisely with this.</v>

1497
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:13.940
<v Speaker 4>A corrupt tree bringeth forth evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>fruit.</v>

1498
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:16.100
<v Speaker 4>A good tree cannot bring forth evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>fruit.</v>

1499
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.590
<v Speaker 4>Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth </v>
<v Speaker 4>good fruit.</v>

1500
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:23.823
<v Speaker 4>Every tree that bringeth forth that </v>
<v Speaker 4>bring us not forth good fruit is hewn </v>

1501
01:26:27.701 --> 01:26:29.510
<v Speaker 4>down and cast into the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1502
01:26:29.511 --> 01:26:34.511
<v Speaker 4>that's a flood motif right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're constantly the archetype</v>

1503
01:26:34.961 --> 01:26:37.090
<v Speaker 4>of the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the archetype of being.</v>

1504
01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:39.110
<v Speaker 4>It's it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the archetype of the self.</v>

1505
01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:39.993
<v Speaker 4>Often.</v>

1506
01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.040
<v Speaker 4>What's the warning here is that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're mostly dead wood,</v>

1507
01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:48.473
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to burn up and you can </v>

1508
01:26:50.911 --> 01:26:52.470
<v Speaker 4>think about that metaphysical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>

1509
01:26:52.530 --> 01:26:53.363
<v Speaker 4>You can project that into eternity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can think about that as a form of </v>

1510
01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:57.174
<v Speaker 4>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the funny thing is is that when </v>

1511
01:26:58.501 --> 01:27:03.501
<v Speaker 4>that's happening to you in real time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is like an eternity in hell.</v>

1512
01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:05.970
<v Speaker 4>It's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it,</v>

1513
01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:09.000
<v Speaker 4>but you can strip the metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 4>elements off and you can say,</v>

1514
01:27:09.001 --> 01:27:11.670
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're mostly dead wood,</v>

1515
01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:16.650
<v Speaker 4>then a spark will light you on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's also very much worth thinking</v>

1516
01:27:16.651 --> 01:27:18.900
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wherefore by their fruits,</v>

1517
01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:22.410
<v Speaker 4>shall you know them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not everyone that say a thumb to me,</v>

1518
01:27:22.411 --> 01:27:27.030
<v Speaker 4>Lord shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he that doeth the will of my father,</v>

1519
01:27:27.031 --> 01:27:32.031
<v Speaker 4>which is in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting light and I think,</v>

1520
01:27:32.670 --> 01:27:36.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean one of the proper critiques of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Traditional Christianity,</v>

1521
01:27:36.901 --> 01:27:39.120
<v Speaker 4>maybe this is the sort of critique that </v>
<v Speaker 4>needs you to put forth,</v>

1522
01:27:39.121 --> 01:27:39.954
<v Speaker 4>was that</v>

1523
01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.230
<v Speaker 4>Christianity had degenerated and its </v>
<v Speaker 4>moral mission.</v>

1524
01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.620
<v Speaker 4>Young was a little bit more sympathetic </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll tell you why in a minute,</v>

1525
01:27:47.621 --> 01:27:48.454
<v Speaker 4>but niches idea was that Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 4>had lost its way when it generated the </v>

1526
01:27:53.921 --> 01:27:58.921
<v Speaker 4>presupposition that humanity was saved </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some final sense,</v>

1527
01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:00.483
<v Speaker 4>by the sacrifice of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It meant that the work was already done </v>

1528
01:28:04.330 --> 01:28:05.700
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm,</v>

1529
01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:07.293
<v Speaker 4>I'm being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm being harsh in my judgment for the </v>

1530
01:28:10.841 --> 01:28:11.674
<v Speaker 4>purpose of rhetorical simplification,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the idea was that if you just </v>

1531
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:18.160
<v Speaker 4>professed faith that that had already </v>
<v Speaker 4>occurred,</v>

1532
01:28:18.161 --> 01:28:21.610
<v Speaker 4>then you were</v>
<v Speaker 4>granted eternal salvation.</v>

1533
01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:23.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1534
01:28:23.801 --> 01:28:24.634
<v Speaker 4>it's not so straightforward and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's what this line actually </v>

1535
01:28:26.831 --> 01:28:27.910
<v Speaker 4>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says,</v>

1536
01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.200
<v Speaker 4>how do you enter into the Kingdom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Heaven?</v>

1537
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:33.833
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can think about that under the </v>

1538
01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.353
<v Speaker 4>aspect of eternity or you can think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it as a psychological statement </v>

1539
01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.980
<v Speaker 4>and the answer is quite straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that</v>

1540
01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:43.953
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

1541
01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:49.410
<v Speaker 4>do what Noah did to make him immune from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the flood.</v>

1542
01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:54.150
<v Speaker 4>And that's to walk with God and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what this sermon is about.</v>

1543
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:59.880
<v Speaker 4>It's laying out the practical elements </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that and the practical elements are</v>

1544
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.540
<v Speaker 4>aim at the highest possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good and play that out in the world.</v>

1545
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:07.643
<v Speaker 4>And then</v>

1546
01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.393
<v Speaker 4>you may have the opportunity to inhabit </v>
<v Speaker 4>the highest possible good that you're </v>

1547
01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:16.270
<v Speaker 4>positing into existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps not,</v>

1548
01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:19.870
<v Speaker 4>but you can't think of any more </v>
<v Speaker 4>practical way of going about that.</v>

1549
01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:20.943
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you build a house that maybe you can </v>

1550
01:29:21.821 --> 01:29:23.170
<v Speaker 4>live in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't build a house,</v>

1551
01:29:23.171 --> 01:29:24.430
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be able to live in </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1552
01:29:24.431 --> 01:29:25.264
<v Speaker 4>If you build a good house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you'll be able to live in a good </v>

1553
01:29:26.890 --> 01:29:28.870
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you build a perfect house,</v>

1554
01:29:28.871 --> 01:29:30.370
<v Speaker 4>then maybe you can live in a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>

1555
01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:31.443
<v Speaker 4>But if you just say that the house has </v>
<v Speaker 4>already been built for you and that you </v>

1556
01:29:35.501 --> 01:29:38.320
<v Speaker 4>can just say that the house is being </v>
<v Speaker 4>built for you,</v>

1557
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:39.423
<v Speaker 4>well then the probability that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be able to live where you need </v>

1558
01:29:42.221 --> 01:29:43.054
<v Speaker 4>to live is there's no probability that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be able to live where </v>

1559
01:29:45.491 --> 01:29:48.310
<v Speaker 4>you need to live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many will say to me in that day,</v>

1560
01:29:48.311 --> 01:29:49.750
<v Speaker 4>that's the Judgment Day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord,</v>

1561
01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:52.270
<v Speaker 4>have we not prophesied in thy name and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the name,</v>

1562
01:29:52.271 --> 01:29:53.104
<v Speaker 4>have cast out devils and in [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 4>name done many wonderful works and then </v>

1563
01:29:56.171 --> 01:29:58.750
<v Speaker 4>I will profess unto them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never knew you,</v>

1564
01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:02.020
<v Speaker 4>depart from me you that work iniquity.</v>

1565
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:05.660
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's judgment day.</v>

1566
01:30:05.661 --> 01:30:06.494
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an architectural idea and partly </v>

1567
01:30:10.631 --> 01:30:15.010
<v Speaker 4>it's archetipal because everyday is </v>
<v Speaker 4>judgment day and the part of you that</v>

1568
01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.070
<v Speaker 4>the part of you that's equivalent to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>logo,</v>

1569
01:30:19.071 --> 01:30:21.620
<v Speaker 4>say the part of you that's your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideal,</v>

1570
01:30:22.190 --> 01:30:27.190
<v Speaker 4>sits in eternal judgment on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>iniquity and that's the.</v>

1571
01:30:28.130 --> 01:30:28.963
<v Speaker 4>That's the source of guilt and shame and</v>
<v Speaker 4>and and withdrawal and then resentment </v>

1572
01:30:34.371 --> 01:30:37.890
<v Speaker 4>and then murderousness and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>genocide.</v>

1573
01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.033
<v Speaker 4>It's because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can intuit the ideal and the problem </v>

1574
01:30:44.111 --> 01:30:44.944
<v Speaker 4>with intuiting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ideal is that an ideal is always a </v>

1575
01:30:46.961 --> 01:30:47.794
<v Speaker 4>judge.</v>

1576
01:30:48.630 --> 01:30:49.463
<v Speaker 4>There are no difference between an ideal</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the judge and so you're eternally </v>

1577
01:30:51.631 --> 01:30:53.790
<v Speaker 4>judged by your own ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have no idea,</v>

1578
01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:56.370
<v Speaker 4>well then you've got no direction and no</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning in your life,</v>

1579
01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:59.280
<v Speaker 4>and then of course the more extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ideal,</v>

1580
01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:03.690
<v Speaker 4>the harsher the judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's actually why young young was very</v>

1581
01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:04.524
<v Speaker 4>curious about why the book of revelation</v>
<v Speaker 4>was tacked onto the Bible because the </v>

1582
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:11.910
<v Speaker 4>book of revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a very weird book and you know in</v>

1583
01:31:11.911 --> 01:31:12.930
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Gospels,</v>

1584
01:31:12.931 --> 01:31:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Christ is I would say perhaps primarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>merciful.</v>

1585
01:31:15.931 --> 01:31:16.764
<v Speaker 4>There,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a maybe a war in his character </v>

1586
01:31:19.201 --> 01:31:20.034
<v Speaker 4>between truth and mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of the two perhaps mercy </v>

1587
01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:23.573
<v Speaker 4>and Young's observation was the gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ was to merciful and that's why </v>

1588
01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:31.800
<v Speaker 4>the book of revelation was tapped on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tacked onto the new testament because in</v>

1589
01:31:31.801 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 4>the book of revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ,</v>

1590
01:31:33.541 --> 01:31:35.790
<v Speaker 4>who's the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's above the pyramid,</v>

1591
01:31:35.791 --> 01:31:36.624
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The transcendent ideal is nothing but a </v>

1592
01:31:38.521 --> 01:31:39.354
<v Speaker 4>judge and everyone fails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course the ultimate ideal is the </v>

1593
01:31:43.261 --> 01:31:44.094
<v Speaker 4>ultimate judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the archetypical reality </v>

1594
01:31:46.081 --> 01:31:46.711
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can say,</v>

1595
01:31:46.711 --> 01:31:47.544
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be judged and so I'll </v>

1596
01:31:48.451 --> 01:31:50.730
<v Speaker 4>dispense with the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then your cane,</v>

1597
01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:54.000
<v Speaker 4>because cane is exactly the person who </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispenses with the ideal.</v>

1598
01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:55.493
<v Speaker 4>And so there's no escaping from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no escaping from eternal </v>

1599
01:31:58.411 --> 01:32:01.090
<v Speaker 4>judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the architectural story.</v>

1600
01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:04.133
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people put a lot of work into these </v>

1601
01:32:05.101 --> 01:32:06.360
<v Speaker 4>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1602
01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:09.630
<v Speaker 4>and there's thousands of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't messing around.</v>

1603
01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:13.020
<v Speaker 4>These are serious pieces of work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1604
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.943
<v Speaker 4>we don't understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that the people </v>

1605
01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:17.910
<v Speaker 4>who created them didn't know what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were doing.</v>

1606
01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:20.820
<v Speaker 4>These were geniuses who created these </v>
<v Speaker 4>pieces of work.</v>

1607
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:21.833
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they understood in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>articulated manner exactly what they </v>

1608
01:32:24.241 --> 01:32:27.270
<v Speaker 4>were trying to represent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what they were representing,</v>

1609
01:32:27.271 --> 01:32:30.030
<v Speaker 4>where the metaphor is at the core of our</v>
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>

1610
01:32:30.031 --> 01:32:32.850
<v Speaker 4>to the degree that our culture is </v>
<v Speaker 4>functional and good.</v>

1611
01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:36.270
<v Speaker 4>These are the metaphors upon which it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>founded</v>

1612
01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:39.940
<v Speaker 4>and they're not for the faint of heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1613
01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:42.580
<v Speaker 4>you say religion is the opiate of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>masses.</v>

1614
01:32:42.581 --> 01:32:43.151
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1615
01:32:43.151 --> 01:32:45.550
<v Speaker 4>Then how do you explain this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1616
01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:47.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if it was opiates,</v>

1617
01:32:47.171 --> 01:32:49.690
<v Speaker 4>you're after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might just get rid of that panel.</v>

1618
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:55.383
<v Speaker 4>Especially when.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing that's so interesting </v>

1619
01:32:56.711 --> 01:32:59.830
<v Speaker 4>about the proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at revelations in revelation</v>

1620
01:32:59.831 --> 01:33:00.664
<v Speaker 4>and you look at the judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost everyone ends up on the right </v>

1621
01:33:04.961 --> 01:33:05.794
<v Speaker 4>side of this panel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you were just conjuring up some </v>

1622
01:33:08.501 --> 01:33:09.334
<v Speaker 4>sort of pathetic wish fulfillment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why in the world would you tilt the </v>

1623
01:33:13.601 --> 01:33:18.370
<v Speaker 4>scales in that manner you think that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to make people feel good?</v>

1624
01:33:18.490 --> 01:33:19.323
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's almost nothing about this </v>

1625
01:33:21.131 --> 01:33:24.280
<v Speaker 4>picture that should make people feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1626
01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.593
<v Speaker 4>It should if you understand it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should terrify you to the depths of </v>

1627
01:33:28.331 --> 01:33:30.700
<v Speaker 4>your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the picture is for.</v>

1628
01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.433
<v Speaker 4>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whosoever heareth these sayings of mine </v>

1629
01:33:34.791 --> 01:33:35.624
<v Speaker 4>and do with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will liken him unto a wise man which </v>

1630
01:33:37.581 --> 01:33:38.414
<v Speaker 4>built his house upon a rock and the rain</v>
<v Speaker 4>descended and the winds blew and the </v>

1631
01:33:41.961 --> 01:33:42.794
<v Speaker 4>floods came and beat upon the house and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it fell not for it was founded upon a </v>

1632
01:33:46.461 --> 01:33:51.280
<v Speaker 4>rock</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone that hears these sayings of</v>

1633
01:33:51.281 --> 01:33:52.114
<v Speaker 4>mine and do with them not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'll be likened unto a foolish man </v>

1634
01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:54.963
<v Speaker 4>which built his house upon the sand and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rain descended and the floods came </v>

1635
01:33:57.610 --> 01:34:00.700
<v Speaker 4>and the winds blew and beat upon that </v>
<v Speaker 4>house and it,</v>

1636
01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:02.860
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1637
01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:06.310
<v Speaker 4>I made a mistake and it fell for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was founded upon the sand</v>

1638
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:11.960
<v Speaker 4>and it came to pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a very interesting line.</v>

1639
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:14.360
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really know now,</v>

1640
01:34:14.361 --> 01:34:15.194
<v Speaker 4>and then you run across lines in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly happens in biblical </v>

1641
01:34:19.941 --> 01:34:20.774
<v Speaker 4>settings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You run across lines that you cannot </v>

1642
01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:23.203
<v Speaker 4>believe actually exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot imagine how someone could </v>

1643
01:34:26.331 --> 01:34:27.164
<v Speaker 4>have imagined up and conjured up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>line and these two lines are like that </v>

1644
01:34:30.201 --> 01:34:31.034
<v Speaker 4>as far as I'm concerned and it came to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pass when Jesus had ended these sayings </v>

1645
01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:34.633
<v Speaker 4>that people were astonished at his </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctrine for he taught them as one </v>

1646
01:34:37.101 --> 01:34:37.934
<v Speaker 4>having authority and not as the scribes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's something so interesting </v>

1647
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:42.763
<v Speaker 4>because that was another thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>really I didn't really appreciate about </v>

1648
01:34:44.991 --> 01:34:49.460
<v Speaker 4>the churches that I attended to and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be that the lessons were taught by</v>

1649
01:34:49.461 --> 01:34:54.461
<v Speaker 4>scribes and the words were mouthed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was no power in them.</v>

1650
01:34:54.710 --> 01:34:56.180
<v Speaker 4>There was no meaning in them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

1651
01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.193
<v Speaker 4>It was as if while it was like when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was 20 years old and I was saying all </v>

1652
01:35:00.771 --> 01:35:01.940
<v Speaker 4>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't mean,</v>

1653
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:03.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were words that sounded good.</v>

1654
01:35:03.681 --> 01:35:06.320
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like gilded cloth.</v>

1655
01:35:06.321 --> 01:35:08.810
<v Speaker 4>I suppose that you can that you can wrap</v>
<v Speaker 4>around yourself,</v>

1656
01:35:08.811 --> 01:35:09.644
<v Speaker 4>but there is no substance to them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a big difference between </v>

1657
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:13.423
<v Speaker 4>listening to something that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>substance and listening to something </v>

1658
01:35:16.521 --> 01:35:17.354
<v Speaker 4>that is spoken because it sounds like it</v>
<v Speaker 4>should sound good and this line says </v>

1659
01:35:22.311 --> 01:35:23.144
<v Speaker 4>that whoever spoke the lines that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>just described with someone who sounded </v>

1660
01:35:28.311 --> 01:35:29.144
<v Speaker 4>like he knew what he was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not someone who is just repeating </v>

1661
01:35:32.721 --> 01:35:33.554
<v Speaker 4>something for the sake of sounding good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it certainly seems to me that the </v>

1662
01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:41.981
<v Speaker 4>lines that we just reviewed have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome impact of authority</v>

1663
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:48.980
<v Speaker 3>act to noah,</v>

1664
01:35:49.730 --> 01:35:51.710
<v Speaker 4>but Noah found grace in the eyes of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord.</v>

1665
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:52.993
<v Speaker 4>These are the generations of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Noah was a just man and perfect in his </v>

1666
01:35:56.121 --> 01:35:56.954
<v Speaker 4>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Noah walked with God and Noah began </v>

1667
01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.080
<v Speaker 4>three sons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shem,</v>

1668
01:36:00.081 --> 01:36:01.610
<v Speaker 4>Ham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Japheth.</v>

1669
01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:05.840
<v Speaker 4>The Earth was also corrupt before God </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the earth was full of violence,</v>

1670
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:10.220
<v Speaker 4>filled with violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any of you see the new NRA ad?</v>

1671
01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:14.570
<v Speaker 4>You might want to look that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's the most</v>

1672
01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:17.923
<v Speaker 4>shocking manifestation of political </v>
<v Speaker 4>polarization in the United States that </v>

1673
01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:23.120
<v Speaker 4>I've yet seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of it.</v>

1674
01:36:23.121 --> 01:36:24.720
<v Speaker 4>I've seen on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1675
01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:27.320
<v Speaker 4>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's shocked me mostly has been on the</v>

1676
01:36:27.321 --> 01:36:29.540
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the new NRA ad,</v>

1677
01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:30.913
<v Speaker 4>that's a whole new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's this attractive woman and doing </v>

1678
01:36:34.941 --> 01:36:35.774
<v Speaker 4>a voiceover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She kind of looks like Demi Moore </v>

1679
01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:38.240
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's kind of tough looking.</v>

1680
01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:39.253
<v Speaker 4>I guess Demi Moore could look tough now </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then and she has contempt on her </v>

1681
01:36:42.711 --> 01:36:43.544
<v Speaker 4>face</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a dangerous thing and in the </v>

1682
01:36:48.561 --> 01:36:53.561
<v Speaker 4>background there's nothing but images of</v>
<v Speaker 4>antifa riots and Berkeley riots and fire</v>

1683
01:36:55.581 --> 01:37:00.581
<v Speaker 4>and protest and she's describing that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a conspiracy.</v>

1684
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:03.283
<v Speaker 4>Essentially a conspiracy that involves </v>
<v Speaker 4>the intellectual elite including </v>

1685
01:37:06.801 --> 01:37:08.690
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is named by name.</v>

1686
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:15.910
<v Speaker 4>The accusation is that there is a cabal </v>
<v Speaker 4>of corrupt intellectuals,</v>

1687
01:37:17.301 --> 01:37:18.134
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are bringing the country to its </v>

1688
01:37:21.381 --> 01:37:22.214
<v Speaker 4>knees and that it's time to get your God</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn guns and so look up that and see </v>

1689
01:37:28.131 --> 01:37:28.964
<v Speaker 4>what you think because</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of people who would be </v>

1690
01:37:34.151 --> 01:37:34.984
<v Speaker 4>perfectly happy if that was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction in which we were headed and </v>

1691
01:37:37.811 --> 01:37:38.644
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I'm hoping is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we might be able to talk our way </v>

1692
01:37:41.051 --> 01:37:46.051
<v Speaker 4>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're in a situation where every act</v>

1693
01:37:46.241 --> 01:37:51.241
<v Speaker 4>of individually individual idiocy will </v>
<v Speaker 4>push us one iota closer to the break and</v>

1694
01:37:54.041 --> 01:37:56.610
<v Speaker 4>that'll make the 15 of the population</v>

1695
01:37:56.610 --> 01:38:01.000
<v Speaker 2>or 30 percent of the population who </v>
<v Speaker 2>would love to see everything degenerated</v>

1696
01:38:01.001 --> 01:38:01.834
<v Speaker 2>into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfectly happy because that's their </v>

1697
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:06.970
<v Speaker 2>aim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Theorists,</v>

1698
01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:07.953
<v Speaker 2>Salsa was corrupt before God and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth was filled with violence and God </v>

1699
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:11.640
<v Speaker 2>looked upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And behold,</v>

1700
01:38:11.641 --> 01:38:15.240
<v Speaker 2>it was corrupt for all flesh is </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupted his way upon the earth.</v>

1701
01:38:15.241 --> 01:38:17.220
<v Speaker 2>And Noah said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and God said unto Noah,</v>

1702
01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.233
<v Speaker 2>the end of all flesh has come before me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the earth is filled with violence </v>

1703
01:38:20.821 --> 01:38:21.720
<v Speaker 2>through them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And behold,</v>

1704
01:38:21.721 --> 01:38:26.721
<v Speaker 2>I will destroy them with the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the an ark of gopher wood rooms,</v>

1705
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:31.140
<v Speaker 2>shall thou,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making the arch and then pitch it within</v>

1706
01:38:31.141 --> 01:38:34.110
<v Speaker 2>and without with pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the fashion which thou shalt</v>

1707
01:38:34.111 --> 01:38:34.944
<v Speaker 2>make of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The length of the art shell be 300 </v>

1708
01:38:36.361 --> 01:38:37.380
<v Speaker 2>cubits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the breadth of it,</v>

1709
01:38:37.381 --> 01:38:38.214
<v Speaker 2>50 cubits and the height of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 cubits window shelf they'll make to </v>

1710
01:38:41.461 --> 01:38:42.294
<v Speaker 2>the arc in a cubit shelldale finishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>above and the door of the Ark shelters </v>

1711
01:38:45.170 --> 01:38:47.880
<v Speaker 2>set in the side there of with lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>second and third stories.</v>

1712
01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Shallow Banket and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even I do bring a flood of waters upon</v>

1713
01:38:54.091 --> 01:38:57.840
<v Speaker 2>the earth to destroy all flesh wherein </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the breath of life from under heaven.</v>

1714
01:38:58.110 --> 01:39:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Everything that is in the earth shall </v>
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>

1715
01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.420
<v Speaker 2>but with the I will establish my </v>
<v Speaker 2>covenant.</v>

1716
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:04.583
<v Speaker 2>And now she'll come into the ark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thou and thy sons and my wife and they </v>

1717
01:39:06.901 --> 01:39:07.734
<v Speaker 2>sons wives with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fairly optimistic twist on the </v>

1718
01:39:10.621 --> 01:39:15.240
<v Speaker 2>story because not only is it noah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he gets to save his whole family and</v>

1719
01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:16.074
<v Speaker 2>down a couple of generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a good thing to think </v>

1720
01:39:18.151 --> 01:39:21.030
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like as things you know,</v>

1721
01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:26.330
<v Speaker 2>I had this client</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she had a very hard upbringing,</v>

1722
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.823
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of encouragement to say the </v>

1723
01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:31.464
<v Speaker 2>least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a fair bit of discouragement </v>

1724
01:39:33.630 --> 01:39:38.630
<v Speaker 2>and she had a son and what was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about her in relationship to</v>

1725
01:39:40.591 --> 01:39:41.424
<v Speaker 2>her son is that all the things that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have learned to do to him given </v>

1726
01:39:45.151 --> 01:39:45.984
<v Speaker 2>her extensive experience with being made</v>
<v Speaker 2>as miserable as possible by someone who </v>

1727
01:39:49.951 --> 01:39:51.900
<v Speaker 2>was hell bent on bringing her to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees.</v>

1728
01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:54.390
<v Speaker 2>She refused to do to recent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1729
01:39:54.391 --> 01:39:58.290
<v Speaker 2>She learned the opposite lesson from all</v>
<v Speaker 2>her misery and torment,</v>

1730
01:39:58.291 --> 01:40:00.900
<v Speaker 2>which was not to move that forward down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the generations.</v>

1731
01:40:00.901 --> 01:40:01.734
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea here is that if you walk</v>
<v Speaker 2>properly and improperly and act </v>

1732
01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:10.170
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you walk with God in this manner that</v>

1733
01:40:10.171 --> 01:40:13.080
<v Speaker 2>we've been discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that perhaps that isn't only good for</v>

1734
01:40:13.081 --> 01:40:13.914
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps it's also the thing that will </v>

1735
01:40:15.001 --> 01:40:15.834
<v Speaker 2>save your family and then by implication</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps save society because that's </v>

1736
01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:21.660
<v Speaker 2>exactly what happens with Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1737
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:24.690
<v Speaker 2>First attempt and then it's his family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everything else goes.</v>

1738
01:40:25.110 --> 01:40:25.943
<v Speaker 2>And so by saving himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by acting properly and by saving his </v>

1739
01:40:29.401 --> 01:40:31.800
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually saves the world.</v>

1740
01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:34.110
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1741
01:40:34.111 --> 01:40:34.944
<v Speaker 2>like the most profound people that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>read who've meditated deeply on the </v>

1742
01:40:39.061 --> 01:40:41.400
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say of totalitarian catastrophe.</v>

1743
01:40:41.401 --> 01:40:44.100
<v Speaker 2>And I would put Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the top of that list,</v>

1744
01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit the,</v>

1745
01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:50.580
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his entire Corpus three volume 700 pages</v>

1746
01:40:50.581 --> 01:40:55.090
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each in tiny type is a long scream about</v>

1747
01:40:55.091 --> 01:40:55.924
<v Speaker 2>the absolute necessity of individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the absolute necessity of individual </v>

1748
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.673
<v Speaker 2>honesty and ethical behavior as the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>bulwark against totalitarian </v>

1749
01:41:09.421 --> 01:41:11.130
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

1750
01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:12.293
<v Speaker 2>and I've read many writers who've </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempted to diagnose the problems of </v>

1751
01:41:16.081 --> 01:41:19.710
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think Solzhenitsyn,</v>

1752
01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:22.523
<v Speaker 2>he came to the same conclusions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Victor Frankel came to as a consequence </v>

1753
01:41:25.831 --> 01:41:29.740
<v Speaker 2>of his experiences in the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camps and Frankel.</v>

1754
01:41:30.190 --> 01:41:31.023
<v Speaker 2>I'm also an admirer of Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but social units and takes it to an </v>

1755
01:41:33.451 --> 01:41:37.410
<v Speaker 2>entire different level of profundity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them extraordinarily strong.</v>

1756
01:41:37.411 --> 01:41:38.244
<v Speaker 2>Case that not only do societies </v>
<v Speaker 2>deteriorate because the people within </v>

1757
01:41:43.171 --> 01:41:45.300
<v Speaker 2>the societies become individually </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt,</v>

1758
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:46.343
<v Speaker 2>but that the only way to stave that off </v>
<v Speaker 2>is for the individuals within that </v>

1759
01:41:49.561 --> 01:41:50.394
<v Speaker 2>society to reject that corruption in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the confines of their own personal </v>

1760
01:41:53.671 --> 01:41:58.470
<v Speaker 2>lives and he tells endless stories of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that he met in the Gulag,</v>

1761
01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.480
<v Speaker 2>in the work camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the death camps,</v>

1762
01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:03.000
<v Speaker 2>in the Soviet Union of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what he learned.</v>

1763
01:42:03.001 --> 01:42:03.834
<v Speaker 2>If people who are so incredibly tough </v>
<v Speaker 2>that even under conditions the most </v>

1764
01:42:08.761 --> 01:42:09.594
<v Speaker 2>possible extreme conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a chance that they were </v>

1765
01:42:12.931 --> 01:42:15.060
<v Speaker 2>going to step off that straight narrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>

1766
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:16.223
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing the authorities could </v>
<v Speaker 2>do to move them and just watching that </v>

1767
01:42:21.331 --> 01:42:22.164
<v Speaker 2>was enough to transform soldier knits </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of course one of the things </v>

1768
01:42:24.301 --> 01:42:25.134
<v Speaker 2>he wondered was after spending a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of time in the work camps was </v>

1769
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:33.780
<v Speaker 2>well just exactly how did I get here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't.</v>

1770
01:42:33.781 --> 01:42:34.614
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Hitler's fault and it was </v>

1771
01:42:35.431 --> 01:42:36.264
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it was definitely the fault of </v>

1772
01:42:37.471 --> 01:42:40.050
<v Speaker 2>both of them for social incident was </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1773
01:42:40.051 --> 01:42:43.380
<v Speaker 2>it was also his fault because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the same game.</v>

1774
01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:48.390
<v Speaker 2>He just wasn't as good at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of every living thing of all flesh,</v>

1775
01:42:48.391 --> 01:42:49.224
<v Speaker 2>two of every sort shall they'll bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the ark to keep them alive with </v>

1776
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:53.400
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shall be male and female,</v>

1777
01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:55.640
<v Speaker 2>and so the they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

1778
01:42:55.690 --> 01:43:00.690
<v Speaker 2>There's another message in this story </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that it isn't only Noah and his</v>

1779
01:43:00.861 --> 01:43:01.694
<v Speaker 2>family and human society that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent on Noah's appropriate actions </v>

1780
01:43:06.591 --> 01:43:10.220
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the entire living planet</v>

1781
01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:16.720
<v Speaker 2>and in an era of excessive and extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>and genuinely disingenuous environmental</v>

1782
01:43:19.881 --> 01:43:20.714
<v Speaker 2>catastrophizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something to consider very </v>

1783
01:43:23.811 --> 01:43:26.000
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think</v>

1784
01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:35.090
<v Speaker 2>perhaps there's nothing better that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do for everything.</v>

1785
01:43:35.091 --> 01:43:35.924
<v Speaker 2>All things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including those things that are outside </v>

1786
01:43:38.031 --> 01:43:42.980
<v Speaker 2>the confines of human society than to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get your act together and align yourself</v>

1787
01:43:42.981 --> 01:43:46.490
<v Speaker 2>properly along all of the dimensions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your being,</v>

1788
01:43:46.491 --> 01:43:47.600
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1789
01:43:47.630 --> 01:43:52.400
<v Speaker 2>from the tiniest microcosm to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the macrocosm,</v>

1790
01:43:52.401 --> 01:43:55.160
<v Speaker 2>and that's the way that all of being is </v>
<v Speaker 2>redeemed.</v>

1791
01:43:56.650 --> 01:44:01.130
<v Speaker 2>That's what the story suggests</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we read it.</v>

1792
01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:03.380
<v Speaker 2>You know a cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern people,</v>

1793
01:44:03.381 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 2>we read it as if it was written by </v>
<v Speaker 2>primitive people who thought that it was</v>

1794
01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:12.300
<v Speaker 2>really the case that someone could build</v>
<v Speaker 2>a boat and put two of every kind into it</v>

1795
01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.090
<v Speaker 2>and thereby save the world.</v>

1796
01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:21.140
<v Speaker 2>It's embarrassing to see things </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpreted in a manner that shallow,</v>

1797
01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:25.400
<v Speaker 2>especially by people who don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorance as a justification.</v>

1798
01:44:25.610 --> 01:44:27.710
<v Speaker 2>You know these stories have to appeal to</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

1799
01:44:27.711 --> 01:44:28.544
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's lots of people in the world </v>

1800
01:44:29.661 --> 01:44:30.494
<v Speaker 2>who aren't very bright and so they tend </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take things concretely like a child </v>

1801
01:44:34.191 --> 01:44:37.640
<v Speaker 2>would take things concretely if you read</v>
<v Speaker 2>them a story and this story can be taken</v>

1802
01:44:37.641 --> 01:44:38.474
<v Speaker 2>concretely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has to be because the stories </v>

1803
01:44:40.311 --> 01:44:42.500
<v Speaker 2>have to be for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a sophisticated,</v>

1804
01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:43.543
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>dismiss it as if it's written for a </v>

1805
01:44:46.431 --> 01:44:47.264
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's maybe you have the obligation to </v>

1806
01:44:48.381 --> 01:44:49.214
<v Speaker 2>look a bit deeper and think for a moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it wouldn't been conserved for </v>

1807
01:44:51.591 --> 01:44:52.424
<v Speaker 2>these many thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there wasn't something more to it </v>

1808
01:44:54.651 --> 01:44:57.830
<v Speaker 2>than a casual intellectual dismissal </v>
<v Speaker 2>would indicate</v>

1809
01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.240
<v Speaker 2>and take the onto the of all food that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is eaten and thou shalt gather it to the</v>

1810
01:45:03.241 --> 01:45:06.140
<v Speaker 2>end shall be food for the end for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thus did noah.</v>

1811
01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:10.580
<v Speaker 2>According to all that God commanded him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did he,</v>

1812
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:14.900
<v Speaker 2>and the Lord said unto Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come down and all the house into the arc</v>

1813
01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:19.400
<v Speaker 2>for the I've seen righteous before me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this generation of every clean beast</v>

1814
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:21.343
<v Speaker 2>thou shalt take to the by sevens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the male and female and obese that are </v>

1815
01:45:23.601 --> 01:45:24.434
<v Speaker 2>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not clean by to the male and who's </v>

1816
01:45:25.851 --> 01:45:26.684
<v Speaker 2>female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1817
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:28.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follows also of the air by sevens,</v>

1818
01:45:28.581 --> 01:45:29.414
<v Speaker 2>the male and the female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep seed alive upon the face of all </v>

1819
01:45:31.770 --> 01:45:36.470
<v Speaker 2>the earth for yet seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will cause it to rain upon the earth.</v>

1820
01:45:36.471 --> 01:45:37.304
<v Speaker 2>Forty days and 40 nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every living substance that I've </v>

1821
01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:41.360
<v Speaker 2>made will I destroy from off the face of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth.</v>

1822
01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:44.960
<v Speaker 2>And Noah did according unto all that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord commanded him.</v>

1823
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:50.150
<v Speaker 2>And Noah was 600 years old when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flood of waters was upon the earth.</v>

1824
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.823
<v Speaker 2>And Noah went in and his sons and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife and his sons wives with them into </v>

1825
01:45:54.141 --> 01:45:58.070
<v Speaker 2>the arc because of the waters of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flood of clean beasts and obese that are</v>

1826
01:45:58.071 --> 01:46:00.890
<v Speaker 2>not cleaning the fouls and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that creepeth upon the earth.</v>

1827
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:03.770
<v Speaker 2>They went in to and to and to know into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the arc,</v>

1828
01:46:03.771 --> 01:46:05.930
<v Speaker 2>the male and the female as God had </v>
<v Speaker 2>commanded Noah.</v>

1829
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:07.123
<v Speaker 2>And it came to pass after seven days </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the waters of the flood were upon </v>

1830
01:46:10.641 --> 01:46:13.580
<v Speaker 2>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the 600th year of Noah's life.</v>

1831
01:46:13.581 --> 01:46:16.040
<v Speaker 2>In the second month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 17th day of the month,</v>

1832
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.903
<v Speaker 2>the same day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all the fountains of the great </v>

1833
01:46:18.771 --> 01:46:19.604
<v Speaker 2>deep broken up and the windows of Heaven</v>
<v Speaker 2>were opened and the rain was upon the </v>

1834
01:46:23.121 --> 01:46:24.920
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty days and 40 nights.</v>

1835
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:27.980
<v Speaker 2>And the selfsame day entered Noah and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chairman,</v>

1836
01:46:27.981 --> 01:46:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Ham and Japheth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sons of Noah and Noah,</v>

1837
01:46:30.711 --> 01:46:33.320
<v Speaker 2>his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the three wives of his sons with him</v>

1838
01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:34.813
<v Speaker 2>into the arc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They in every beast after his kind and </v>

1839
01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:38.453
<v Speaker 2>all of the cattle after their kind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>every creeping thing that creepeth upon </v>

1840
01:46:40.651 --> 01:46:43.440
<v Speaker 2>the earth after his kind and every fowl </v>
<v Speaker 2>after his kind,</v>

1841
01:46:43.441 --> 01:46:45.450
<v Speaker 2>every bird of every sort of they went </v>
<v Speaker 2>into noah,</v>

1842
01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:47.010
<v Speaker 2>unto Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the Ark,</v>

1843
01:46:47.011 --> 01:46:50.340
<v Speaker 2>to and to have all flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in is the breath of life</v>

1844
01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:00.400
<v Speaker 2>that makes no the ultimate shepherd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right shepherd of all things</v>

1845
01:47:05.050 --> 01:47:07.720
<v Speaker 2>tender of the garden and shepherd of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1846
01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a hell of a role</v>

1847
01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:15.190
<v Speaker 2>and maybe that's the one that keeps you </v>
<v Speaker 2>afloat during the flood</v>

1848
01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.690
<v Speaker 2>and the that went in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went in,</v>

1849
01:47:18.691 --> 01:47:19.524
<v Speaker 2>male and female of all flesh is God had </v>
<v Speaker 2>commanded him and the Lord shut him in </v>

1850
01:47:22.130 --> 01:47:25.760
<v Speaker 2>and the flood was 40 days upon the earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the waters increased and bear up the</v>

1851
01:47:25.761 --> 01:47:26.594
<v Speaker 2>ark and it was lifted up above the earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the waters prevailed and were </v>

1852
01:47:29.151 --> 01:47:29.984
<v Speaker 2>increased greatly upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 cubits upward did the waters prevail </v>

1853
01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:39.281
<v Speaker 2>and the mountains were covered</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all flesh died.</v>

1854
01:47:40.861 --> 01:47:43.830
<v Speaker 2>That moved upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both have fallen of cattle and the beast</v>

1855
01:47:43.831 --> 01:47:45.900
<v Speaker 2>and over every creeping thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>creepeth upon the earth.</v>

1856
01:47:45.901 --> 01:47:46.734
<v Speaker 2>And every man and all in whose nostrils </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the breath of life of all that was </v>

1857
01:47:50.731 --> 01:47:52.620
<v Speaker 2>in the dry land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>died</v>

1858
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:57.860
<v Speaker 2>in every living substance was destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was upon the face of the earth,</v>

1859
01:47:58.460 --> 01:47:59.293
<v Speaker 2>both man and cattle and the creeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in the fall of the heaven and </v>

1860
01:48:01.911 --> 01:48:02.744
<v Speaker 2>they were destroyed from the earth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>no only remained alive and they that </v>

1861
01:48:05.631 --> 01:48:08.840
<v Speaker 2>were with him in the Ark and the water's</v>
<v Speaker 2>prevailed upon the earth.</v>

1862
01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.430
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 50 days</v>

1863
01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:13.293
<v Speaker 2>and God remembered no on every living </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and all the capital that was with </v>

1864
01:48:15.371 --> 01:48:16.204
<v Speaker 2>him in the Ark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And God made a wind to pass over the </v>

1865
01:48:18.161 --> 01:48:18.994
<v Speaker 2>earth and the waters receded the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fountains also of the deep and the </v>

1866
01:48:23.141 --> 01:48:23.974
<v Speaker 2>windows of heaven were stopped in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rain from heaven was restrained and </v>

1867
01:48:25.901 --> 01:48:28.120
<v Speaker 2>the water's returned from off the earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually.</v>

1868
01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:31.330
<v Speaker 2>And after the end of 150 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the waters were abated.</v>

1869
01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:35.860
<v Speaker 2>And the Ark rested in the seventh month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the Seventeenth Day of the month upon</v>

1870
01:48:35.861 --> 01:48:36.694
<v Speaker 2>the mountains of error rat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the water's decreased continually </v>

1871
01:48:38.711 --> 01:48:40.960
<v Speaker 2>until the 10th month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the 10th month,</v>

1872
01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.900
<v Speaker 2>on the first day of the month where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tops of the mountain scene</v>

1873
01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:46.333
<v Speaker 2>and it came to pass at the end of 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>days that Noah opened the window of the </v>

1874
01:48:48.621 --> 01:48:49.454
<v Speaker 2>Ark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he had made and he sent forth a </v>

1875
01:48:50.241 --> 01:48:54.440
<v Speaker 2>raven which went to and fro until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>waters were dried up from off the earth,</v>

1876
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:56.203
<v Speaker 2>and he also sent forth a dove from him </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see if the waters were abated from </v>

1877
01:48:58.641 --> 01:48:59.474
<v Speaker 2>off the face of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the dove found no rest for the sole </v>

1878
01:49:01.551 --> 01:49:04.550
<v Speaker 2>of her foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she returned onto him in the Ark for</v>

1879
01:49:04.551 --> 01:49:06.560
<v Speaker 2>the waters were on the face of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

1880
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:10.610
<v Speaker 2>That he put forth his hand and took her </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pulled her in unto him into the Ark.</v>

1881
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:11.623
<v Speaker 2>And he stayed yet another seven days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again he sent forth the dove out of </v>

1882
01:49:14.481 --> 01:49:15.314
<v Speaker 2>the Ark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the devil came into him in the </v>

1883
01:49:17.301 --> 01:49:20.120
<v Speaker 2>evening and low in her mouth was an all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of leaf plucked off.</v>

1884
01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:23.060
<v Speaker 2>So no one knew that the waters were </v>
<v Speaker 2>abated from off the earth.</v>

1885
01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.020
<v Speaker 2>And he stayed there yet another seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>days and sent forth the dove.</v>

1886
01:49:27.021 --> 01:49:27.854
<v Speaker 2>Which returned not again onto him any </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and it came to pass in the 600th </v>

1887
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:34.190
<v Speaker 2>and first year in the first month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first day of the month,</v>

1888
01:49:34.191 --> 01:49:35.024
<v Speaker 2>the waters were dried up from off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth and Noah removed the covering of </v>

1889
01:49:38.481 --> 01:49:40.160
<v Speaker 2>the orchid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked up and behold,</v>

1890
01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:41.930
<v Speaker 2>the face of the ground was dry</v>

1891
01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:47.710
<v Speaker 2>and in the second month on the seventh </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 20th day of the month was the dried.</v>

1892
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:51.310
<v Speaker 2>And God spake unto Noah saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go forth of the arc,</v>

1893
01:49:51.311 --> 01:49:52.144
<v Speaker 2>thou and thy wife and they sons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their sons waves with the bring forth </v>

1894
01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.260
<v Speaker 2>with the every living thing that is with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the of all flesh,</v>

1895
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:00.333
<v Speaker 2>both of fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of cattle and over every creeping </v>

1896
01:50:01.841 --> 01:50:02.674
<v Speaker 2>thing that creepeth upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they may breed abundantly in the </v>

1897
01:50:05.831 --> 01:50:08.050
<v Speaker 2>earth and be fruitful and multiply upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth.</v>

1898
01:50:08.051 --> 01:50:11.230
<v Speaker 2>And Noah went forth and his sons and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife and his sons wives with him.</v>

1899
01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Every beast creeping thing every fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth.</v>

1900
01:50:15.461 --> 01:50:17.590
<v Speaker 2>After their kinds went forth out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ark.</v>

1901
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:22.690
<v Speaker 2>And Noah built an altar unto the Lord </v>
<v Speaker 2>and took of every clean beast.</v>

1902
01:50:22.691 --> 01:50:26.380
<v Speaker 2>And of every clean foul and offered </v>
<v Speaker 2>burnt offerings on the altar,</v>

1903
01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:29.770
<v Speaker 2>immediate returns to the sacrificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>motif</v>

1904
01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:38.050
<v Speaker 2>and the Lord smelled a sweet savor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's known as proper sacrifice.</v>

1905
01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:39.633
<v Speaker 2>And the Lord said into his heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not again curse the ground </v>

1906
01:50:42.221 --> 01:50:43.054
<v Speaker 2>anymore for man's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the imagination of Man's heart is </v>

1907
01:50:46.001 --> 01:50:49.900
<v Speaker 2>evil from his youth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neither will I again smite anymore.</v>

1908
01:50:49.901 --> 01:50:50.734
<v Speaker 2>Every living thing has I have done while</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Earth remaineth seed time and </v>

1909
01:50:53.831 --> 01:50:55.960
<v Speaker 2>harvest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold and heat in summer and winter,</v>

1910
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:58.000
<v Speaker 2>day and night shall not cease.</v>

1911
01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:02.110
<v Speaker 2>And God blessed Noah and his sons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said unto them,</v>

1912
01:51:02.111 --> 01:51:02.944
<v Speaker 2>be fruitful and multiply and replenish </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth and the fear of you and the </v>

1913
01:51:06.821 --> 01:51:07.654
<v Speaker 2>dread of you shall be upon every beast </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the earth and upon every fowl of the </v>

1914
01:51:10.541 --> 01:51:15.541
<v Speaker 2>air upon all that Moveth upon the earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon all the fishes of the sea into your</v>

1915
01:51:15.761 --> 01:51:20.761
<v Speaker 2>hand or they delivered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1916
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.580
<v Speaker 2>I've heard commentators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Suzuki,</v>

1917
01:51:30.581 --> 01:51:31.414
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who claim that the substructure of </v>

1918
01:51:37.461 --> 01:51:42.461
<v Speaker 2>Western culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>in lines such as this</v>

1919
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:49.870
<v Speaker 2>deliver the earth over to human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>and justify our ravaging of the,</v>

1920
01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:52.330
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1921
01:51:52.730 --> 01:51:53.563
<v Speaker 2>of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think that that's a very </v>

1922
01:51:57.351 --> 01:51:58.184
<v Speaker 2>careful reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to me that given such </v>

1923
01:52:01.911 --> 01:52:02.744
<v Speaker 2>matters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given the importance of such matters </v>

1924
01:52:04.821 --> 01:52:07.010
<v Speaker 2>that are very close reading is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

1925
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:09.143
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the story of Adam and Eve when Adam </v>

1926
01:52:11.451 --> 01:52:12.284
<v Speaker 2>and eve are thrown out of the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God tells eve that she's going to be </v>

1927
01:52:16.281 --> 01:52:17.114
<v Speaker 2>subordinated to her husband.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't say that that's what should </v>

1928
01:52:19.731 --> 01:52:23.450
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says that's what's going to happen.</v>

1929
01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:24.733
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned is contained in lines like </v>

1930
01:52:27.441 --> 01:52:31.040
<v Speaker 2>this isn't necessarily that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that should happen.</v>

1931
01:52:31.041 --> 01:52:34.670
<v Speaker 2>It's something that did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite remarkable.</v>

1932
01:52:34.690 --> 01:52:35.523
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think about how long ago these lines </v>

1933
01:52:38.241 --> 01:52:39.074
<v Speaker 2>were penned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't obvious until perhaps the 19 </v>

1934
01:52:41.631 --> 01:52:45.830
<v Speaker 2>sixties that we had dominated the earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>so completely that it's very</v>

1935
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:47.143
<v Speaker 4>future existence was in our hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a prophetic element of this </v>

1936
01:52:51.291 --> 01:52:56.291
<v Speaker 4>tale</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the fear of you and the dread of you</v>

1937
01:52:56.601 --> 01:52:57.434
<v Speaker 4>shall be upon every beast of the earth </v>
<v Speaker 4>and upon every fowl of the air and upon </v>

1938
01:52:59.871 --> 01:53:00.704
<v Speaker 4>all that Moveth upon the earth and upon </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the fishes of the sea into your </v>

1939
01:53:04.251 --> 01:53:05.630
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they delivered?</v>

1940
01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:06.943
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every moving thing that lives shall be </v>

1941
01:53:11.101 --> 01:53:11.934
<v Speaker 4>meat for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even as the green herb I've given you </v>

1942
01:53:13.441 --> 01:53:14.274
<v Speaker 4>all things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have I given you all things but flesh </v>

1943
01:53:16.651 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 4>with the life therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the blood thereof,</v>

1944
01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:24.060
<v Speaker 4>shall you not eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>and surely your blood of your lives will</v>

1945
01:53:24.711 --> 01:53:28.040
<v Speaker 4>I require at the hand of every beast </v>
<v Speaker 4>will I required in at the hand of man at</v>

1946
01:53:28.041 --> 01:53:30.710
<v Speaker 4>the hand of every man's brother will I </v>
<v Speaker 4>require the life of man?</v>

1947
01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:31.933
<v Speaker 4>This is a hard section to interpret,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what it means is something like </v>

1948
01:53:34.851 --> 01:53:35.684
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God describes the dominion over the </v>

1949
01:53:39.381 --> 01:53:44.381
<v Speaker 4>planet that revivified humanity will </v>
<v Speaker 4>have and notes the power that goes along</v>

1950
01:53:47.091 --> 01:53:48.890
<v Speaker 4>with that and then puts a limitation on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1951
01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:50.173
<v Speaker 4>And the limitation is</v>
<v Speaker 4>maintain the sanctity of life despite </v>

1952
01:53:55.221 --> 01:53:56.054
<v Speaker 4>your power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And although it's not easy to extract </v>

1953
01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.270
<v Speaker 4>from the manner in which this has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>translated,</v>

1954
01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:06.650
<v Speaker 4>what God is telling Noah is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill yourself,</v>

1955
01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:10.430
<v Speaker 4>if you kill someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if any animal kills a human being,</v>

1956
01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.920
<v Speaker 4>that there will be a price to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1957
01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:14.240
<v Speaker 4>So there's a</v>

1958
01:54:15.210 --> 01:54:16.043
<v Speaker 4>an opportunity which is that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>descendants of Noah can dominate the </v>

1959
01:54:20.101 --> 01:54:23.160
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a moral limitation placed on</v>

1960
01:54:23.161 --> 01:54:23.994
<v Speaker 4>that which is nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life itself is to be regarded as </v>

1961
01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:33.740
<v Speaker 4>sanctified in sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoever shared with man's blood,</v>

1962
01:54:35.211 --> 01:54:36.044
<v Speaker 4>by man shall his blood be shed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for in the image of God made he man and </v>

1963
01:54:40.551 --> 01:54:41.384
<v Speaker 4>you be fruitful and multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bring forth abundantly in the earth and </v>

1964
01:54:44.391 --> 01:54:49.391
<v Speaker 4>multiply their in</v>
<v Speaker 4>and God speaking to Noah and to his sons</v>

1965
01:54:49.421 --> 01:54:50.254
<v Speaker 4>with him saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I behold I establish my covenant </v>

1966
01:54:52.631 --> 01:54:53.464
<v Speaker 4>with you and with your seat after you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and with every living creature that is </v>

1967
01:54:55.871 --> 01:54:57.790
<v Speaker 4>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have the fall in the cattle and to every</v>

1968
01:54:57.791 --> 01:55:00.570
<v Speaker 4>beast of earth that is with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For all that,</v>

1969
01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:02.620
<v Speaker 4>go out of the art to every beast of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>

1970
01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.550
<v Speaker 4>And I will establish my covenant with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1971
01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:12.120
<v Speaker 4>Neither shall all flesh be cut off </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore by the waters of the flood.</v>

1972
01:55:12.150 --> 01:55:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Neither shall there be any more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A flood to destroy the earth,</v>

1973
01:55:16.810 --> 01:55:17.643
<v Speaker 4>and God said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the token of the covenant which </v>

1974
01:55:18.941 --> 01:55:21.400
<v Speaker 4>I make between me and you and every </v>
<v Speaker 4>living creature that is with you.</v>

1975
01:55:21.401 --> 01:55:22.234
<v Speaker 4>For perpetual generations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do set my bow in the cloud and it </v>

1976
01:55:25.241 --> 01:55:26.074
<v Speaker 4>shall be for a token of a covenant </v>
<v Speaker 4>between me and the Earth and it shall </v>

1977
01:55:28.391 --> 01:55:32.080
<v Speaker 4>come to pass when I bring a cloud over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth that the bow bow shall be seen</v>

1978
01:55:32.081 --> 01:55:36.160
<v Speaker 4>in the cloud and I will remember my </v>
<v Speaker 4>covenant which is between me and you and</v>

1979
01:55:36.161 --> 01:55:39.400
<v Speaker 4>every living creature of all flesh and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the waters shall no more become a flood.</v>

1980
01:55:39.401 --> 01:55:40.234
<v Speaker 4>To destroy all flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a negotiated agreement there of </v>

1981
01:55:43.471 --> 01:55:44.304
<v Speaker 4>sorts</v>

1982
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:45.383
<v Speaker 2>and then negotiated agreement is</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell to the degree that </v>

1983
01:55:51.601 --> 01:55:55.200
<v Speaker 2>humanity agrees to act in the manner of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Noah.</v>

1984
01:55:55.860 --> 01:56:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Then the threat of catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction will remain at bay</v>

1985
01:56:10.110 --> 01:56:10.943
<v Speaker 2>and the bose shall be in the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I will look upon it that I may </v>

1986
01:56:12.571 --> 01:56:15.480
<v Speaker 2>remember the everlasting covenant </v>
<v Speaker 2>between God and every living creature of</v>

1987
01:56:15.481 --> 01:56:18.720
<v Speaker 2>all flesh that is upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And God said unto Noah,</v>

1988
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.823
<v Speaker 2>this is the token of the covenant which </v>
<v Speaker 2>I have established between me and all </v>

1989
01:56:22.621 --> 01:56:23.454
<v Speaker 2>flesh that is upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the token of the covenant which </v>

1990
01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:34.860
<v Speaker 2>I have established between me and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>flesh that is upon the earth.</v>

1991
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:39.343
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good place to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no lecture next week by the </v>

1992
01:56:43.941 --> 01:56:45.530
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the theater was booked.</v>

1993
01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:48.560
<v Speaker 2>So there'll be a one week break and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we get back,</v>

1994
01:56:48.561 --> 01:56:52.220
<v Speaker 2>we'll finish the story of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not much left of it.</v>

1995
01:56:53.050 --> 01:56:55.550
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about the tower of Babel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very short story,</v>

1996
01:56:55.551 --> 01:56:56.990
<v Speaker 2>but a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting one.</v>

1997
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:59.990
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll move on to the story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham.</v>

1998
01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:02.960
<v Speaker 2>And so thank you very much for coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1999
01:57:02.961 --> 01:57:03.460
<v Speaker 2>We'll see you again</v>

2000
01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:08.460
<v Speaker 3>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2001
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:24.183
<v Speaker 2>Now is the person who has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>notification for the meetup after this </v>

2002
01:57:27.550 --> 01:57:30.070
<v Speaker 2>here and do they have the notification?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2003
01:57:30.071 --> 01:57:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Because if you give that to me this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

2004
01:57:31.721 --> 01:57:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll remember to read it before everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaves.</v>

2005
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:38.410
<v Speaker 2>So do you want to start?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2006
01:57:38.411 --> 01:57:39.244
<v Speaker 2>So see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see if the mic is working because </v>

2007
01:57:42.911 --> 01:57:45.280
<v Speaker 2>lots of people will listen to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>question and so.</v>

2008
01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2009
01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:50.850
<v Speaker 6>So you said on a recent live stream that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you were two,</v>

2010
01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:52.800
<v Speaker 6>you didn't have enough energy to answer </v>
<v Speaker 6>this question,</v>

2011
01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:57.860
<v Speaker 6>but you said it was intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I was wondering if you had the energy</v>

2012
01:57:58.231 --> 01:58:03.231
<v Speaker 6>to answer how someone might help someone</v>
<v Speaker 6>that has borderline personality disorder</v>

2013
01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:11.360
<v Speaker 2>by example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by example.</v>

2014
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:15.350
<v Speaker 2>You have an example?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2015
01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:16.181
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2016
01:58:16.181 --> 01:58:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that precisely.</v>

2017
01:58:18.281 --> 01:58:19.114
<v Speaker 2>I mean that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not take borderline personality </v>

2018
01:58:22.391 --> 01:58:24.610
<v Speaker 2>disorder precisely as the example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2019
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:25.743
<v Speaker 2>I understand the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question to some degree is how do </v>

2020
01:58:28.961 --> 01:58:33.961
<v Speaker 2>you help someone that's lost and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer to that is if they aren't willing</v>

2021
01:58:34.331 --> 01:58:36.550
<v Speaker 2>to not be lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot help them.</v>

2022
01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:40.650
<v Speaker 2>And I would also say that as a clinician</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

2023
01:58:41.590 --> 01:58:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a statement that's informed,</v>

2024
01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:48.900
<v Speaker 2>I would say by mythological knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also by straight clinical wisdom,</v>

2025
01:58:50.450 --> 01:58:52.930
<v Speaker 2>not mine particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2026
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.863
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that Carl Rogers </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed out was that there were </v>

2027
01:58:55.271 --> 01:58:58.830
<v Speaker 2>necessary preconditions for entering </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a therapeutic relationship and that</v>

2028
01:58:58.831 --> 01:58:59.664
<v Speaker 2>that would be really any relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the mutual flourishing of the two </v>

2029
01:59:02.621 --> 01:59:03.454
<v Speaker 2>people involved was the paramount goal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the preconditions was that </v>

2030
01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:08.253
<v Speaker 2>both people have to want that to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Rogers believed he didn't know how </v>

2031
01:59:12.731 --> 01:59:17.050
<v Speaker 2>to get the horse to drink once you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought it to the water.</v>

2032
01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:21.310
<v Speaker 2>And I've thought about that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when people are really lost,</v>

2033
01:59:21.610 --> 01:59:26.610
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they're so lost that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't be found and I think the only</v>

2034
01:59:27.851 --> 01:59:28.684
<v Speaker 2>thing that you can do in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is get your life together and </v>

2035
01:59:33.191 --> 01:59:37.420
<v Speaker 2>she and manifest the reality of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative motive being.</v>

2036
01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:38.913
<v Speaker 2>That's what you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the only way I knew of to </v>

2037
01:59:43.511 --> 01:59:44.344
<v Speaker 2>solve an intractable problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say the reason that I went </v>

2038
01:59:49.331 --> 01:59:52.180
<v Speaker 2>down that direction with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>borderline personality disorders.</v>

2039
01:59:52.181 --> 01:59:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Because it's one of the most serious of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the personality disorders.</v>

2040
01:59:54.861 --> 01:59:55.694
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to treat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'll generalize from that to </v>

2041
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:03.760
<v Speaker 2>situations that are very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with.</v>

2042
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:05.980
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a statement too,</v>

2043
02:00:05.981 --> 02:00:09.250
<v Speaker 2>and this has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>borderline personality disorder per se.</v>

2044
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:12.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a statement in the new testament</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really vicious.</v>

2045
02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:13.450
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a number of them,</v>

2046
02:00:13.451 --> 02:00:14.284
<v Speaker 2>but this is a particularly vicious one </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is don't cast pearls before </v>

2047
02:00:18.371 --> 02:00:19.204
<v Speaker 2>swine.</v>

2048
02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:24.100
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is if you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to help and it doesn't work,</v>

2049
02:00:24.101 --> 02:00:28.030
<v Speaker 2>then stop helping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not helping,</v>

2050
02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:30.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be just wasting your time.</v>

2051
02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:32.980
<v Speaker 2>It might be making things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2052
02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:33.843
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're offering something and it's </v>

2053
02:00:35.111 --> 02:00:35.944
<v Speaker 2>not taken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then perhaps you should be offering it </v>

2054
02:00:38.171 --> 02:00:43.030
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes if you offer hand in,</v>

2055
02:00:43.031 --> 02:00:46.030
<v Speaker 2>the person won't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to stop offering the hand.</v>

2056
02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:50.440
<v Speaker 2>And then what you do is you go off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have your life.</v>

2057
02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:52.540
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes that means in people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>

2058
02:00:52.541 --> 02:00:53.374
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have to leave their family </v>

2059
02:00:54.191 --> 02:00:56.500
<v Speaker 2>members behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a scene in the new testament.</v>

2060
02:00:56.501 --> 02:00:59.950
<v Speaker 2>This is another very hard scene where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ is walking down the road with his</v>

2061
02:00:59.951 --> 02:01:02.710
<v Speaker 2>disciples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope I've got this story right,</v>

2062
02:01:02.711 --> 02:01:04.000
<v Speaker 2>but I've got it essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2063
02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:05.133
<v Speaker 2>and his mother calls to him and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that he's supposed to come </v>

2064
02:01:08.801 --> 02:01:09.634
<v Speaker 2>back to the home because his uncle has </v>
<v Speaker 2>died and that there's going to be a </v>

2065
02:01:14.171 --> 02:01:15.004
<v Speaker 2>funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he turns to his mother and says </v>

2066
02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:20.770
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let the dead bury their dead.</v>

2067
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm about my father's business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

2068
02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.530
<v Speaker 2>And you read that and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

2069
02:01:27.190 --> 02:01:29.640
<v Speaker 2>that should have been edited out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2070
02:01:29.770 --> 02:01:32.320
<v Speaker 2>but it shouldn't have been edited out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's exactly right,</v>

2071
02:01:32.321 --> 02:01:33.154
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes the thing you do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk away because there's no other </v>

2072
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:38.583
<v Speaker 2>solution and if you are trapped in </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathological relationships and you see </v>

2073
02:01:42.801 --> 02:01:43.790
<v Speaker 2>no way out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>

2074
02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:44.953
<v Speaker 2>If someone who is sinking has their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands around your neck and is pulling </v>

2075
02:01:47.871 --> 02:01:50.540
<v Speaker 2>you down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not obligated to drown with them.</v>

2076
02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:52.460
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a rule to.</v>

2077
02:01:52.461 --> 02:01:53.294
<v Speaker 2>If you're a lifeguard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know some of you have had lifeguard </v>

2078
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:56.143
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you approach someone who's </v>

2079
02:01:57.171 --> 02:02:00.800
<v Speaker 2>drowning and panicking in the water feed</v>
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>

2080
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this?</v>

2081
02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:04.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll save you,</v>

2082
02:02:04.190 --> 02:02:05.023
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean you get to drown </v>
<v Speaker 2>me while I'm doing it and if it's you </v>

2083
02:02:08.901 --> 02:02:12.350
<v Speaker 2>drown or both of us drown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you drown.</v>

2084
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>And that's wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not cruelty,</v>

2085
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:20.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Yep.</v>

2086
02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Couple of questions about dialogue and </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging in dialogue with people.</v>

2087
02:02:31.041 --> 02:02:36.041
<v Speaker 2>So the first issue that I face is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a very high need for intellectual</v>

2088
02:02:36.051 --> 02:02:40.070
<v Speaker 2>stimulation and I don't get that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people.</v>

2089
02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:41.590
<v Speaker 2>It's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2090
02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:44.300
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have a dialogue for a time,</v>

2091
02:02:44.301 --> 02:02:48.110
<v Speaker 2>but then it titrate openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2092
02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:49.853
<v Speaker 2>But then they started running out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas they can keep up and it sort of </v>

2093
02:02:53.310 --> 02:02:54.143
<v Speaker 2>falls apart and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem that intellectuals </v>

2094
02:02:56.081 --> 02:02:59.910
<v Speaker 2>have quite frequently is that they sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2095
02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>once they start treating difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>devoting stuff,</v>

2096
02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:03.393
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stopped wanting to talk to regular </v>

2097
02:03:06.011 --> 02:03:06.844
<v Speaker 2>people and I think that contributes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the disconnect that you see between the </v>

2098
02:03:08.970 --> 02:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals and working class people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>

2099
02:03:12.970 --> 02:03:15.110
<v Speaker 2>And the other question I had was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2100
02:03:15.111 --> 02:03:16.700
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the question.</v>

2101
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I believe there's a question in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>

2102
02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:21.530
<v Speaker 2>The question is how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

2103
02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:22.553
<v Speaker 2>how should we address that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how should I address it and is that </v>

2104
02:03:26.461 --> 02:03:27.720
<v Speaker 2>something that can be dressed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well?</v>

2105
02:03:27.721 --> 02:03:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Part of part of the answer to that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the universities were for.</v>

2106
02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2107
02:03:32.250 --> 02:03:33.083
<v Speaker 2>not everybody is equipped to or </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in engaging in high level </v>

2108
02:03:37.711 --> 02:03:39.840
<v Speaker 2>discussion of abstract and creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

2109
02:03:40.020 --> 02:03:40.853
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear this idea that everyone's </v>

2110
02:03:41.641 --> 02:03:43.500
<v Speaker 2>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lie.</v>

2111
02:03:44.370 --> 02:03:46.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that true?</v>

2112
02:03:46.261 --> 02:03:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Creativity is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rare and so,</v>

2113
02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:50.393
<v Speaker 2>and if you happen to be a creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>person or if you happen to be someone </v>

2114
02:03:52.771 --> 02:03:56.910
<v Speaker 2>who's profoundly interested in ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are in a pronounced minority.</v>

2115
02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:57.893
<v Speaker 2>Just as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you happen to be extremely </v>

2116
02:03:59.101 --> 02:04:02.340
<v Speaker 2>extroverted or extremely agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are extremely conscientious.</v>

2117
02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.230
<v Speaker 2>These are minority issues and what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is you find likeminded people who are</v>

2118
02:04:07.231 --> 02:04:08.064
<v Speaker 2>capable of engaging that we know a </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight heavyweight weightlifters </v>

2119
02:04:12.690 --> 02:04:13.523
<v Speaker 2>compete with heavyweight weightlifters </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a reason and everyone thinks that's </v>

2120
02:04:16.651 --> 02:04:17.484
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same thing applies to </v>

2121
02:04:18.691 --> 02:04:20.240
<v Speaker 2>intellectual and creative endeavors.</v>

2122
02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:25.050
<v Speaker 2>So what you do is you try to find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>community where that's,</v>

2123
02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:27.173
<v Speaker 2>that's the nature of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you likely have to find a </v>

2124
02:04:29.281 --> 02:04:31.800
<v Speaker 2>relationship like that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2125
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:32.663
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what contributes to the siloing </v>

2126
02:04:36.241 --> 02:04:39.330
<v Speaker 2>is the arrogance goes along with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you're,</v>

2127
02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:43.440
<v Speaker 2>you can be interested in ideas and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be creative.</v>

2128
02:04:44.090 --> 02:04:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the arrogance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellect,</v>

2129
02:04:45.751 --> 02:04:47.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing the Catholic Church had</v>

2130
02:04:47.431 --> 02:04:50.010
<v Speaker 2>warned about for centuries is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrogance of the intellect.</v>

2131
02:04:50.490 --> 02:04:51.323
<v Speaker 2>So because if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're wise as well as smart and </v>

2132
02:04:54.151 --> 02:04:56.910
<v Speaker 2>there is no relationship between being </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart and being wise,</v>

2133
02:04:56.911 --> 02:04:57.744
<v Speaker 2>they are not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no quick pathway from smart to </v>

2134
02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:01.434
<v Speaker 2>wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And many of the people who I've known </v>

2135
02:05:03.391 --> 02:05:04.224
<v Speaker 2>who were very wise were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them were intellectually </v>

2136
02:05:06.721 --> 02:05:11.580
<v Speaker 2>impaired and we're still wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the arrogance that brings up the</v>

2137
02:05:11.581 --> 02:05:12.030
<v Speaker 2>block.</v>

2138
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:13.560
<v Speaker 2>And I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2139
02:05:13.561 --> 02:05:14.394
<v Speaker 2>happening in the United States in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular because the last time I went </v>

2140
02:05:16.891 --> 02:05:17.940
<v Speaker 2>down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2141
02:05:17.941 --> 02:05:18.774
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had friends down there and some of </v>

2142
02:05:20.581 --> 02:05:21.414
<v Speaker 2>those friends are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart people and some of them were </v>

2143
02:05:23.701 --> 02:05:28.080
<v Speaker 2>talking about the trump voters and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about the trump voters with</v>

2144
02:05:28.081 --> 02:05:28.914
<v Speaker 2>contempt and I thought you better watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because that's 50 percent of the </v>

2145
02:05:32.821 --> 02:05:33.654
<v Speaker 2>dam population and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>convenient to think that they're stupid </v>

2146
02:05:36.871 --> 02:05:37.704
<v Speaker 2>and beneath you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not conducive to a civil state </v>

2147
02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:41.273
<v Speaker 2>and there's no evidence that it's true </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there isn't a straight line </v>

2148
02:05:45.061 --> 02:05:48.570
<v Speaker 2>between intelligent and wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that if your,</v>

2149
02:05:49.110 --> 02:05:52.410
<v Speaker 2>if your character is developed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're intelligent,</v>

2150
02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:55.620
<v Speaker 2>you can have your siloed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative community,</v>

2151
02:05:56.010 --> 02:05:56.843
<v Speaker 2>but you develop enough wisdom so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see all the things that people </v>

2152
02:05:59.701 --> 02:06:00.534
<v Speaker 2>can do that or have high ethical utility</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are outside the intellectual </v>

2153
02:06:03.871 --> 02:06:04.704
<v Speaker 2>domain.</v>

2154
02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:05.813
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why in the New </v>

2155
02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:08.273
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why Christ is a </v>

2156
02:06:08.551 --> 02:06:10.920
<v Speaker 2>carpenter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2157
02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2158
02:06:12.181 --> 02:06:17.130
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carpenter is one of those jobs that when</v>

2159
02:06:17.131 --> 02:06:17.964
<v Speaker 2>you're dishonest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it manifests itself immediately because </v>

2160
02:06:19.651 --> 02:06:22.920
<v Speaker 2>what you build falls down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you're known as carpenter,</v>

2161
02:06:22.921 --> 02:06:25.380
<v Speaker 2>you build a good house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a nice metaphor there,</v>

2162
02:06:25.381 --> 02:06:26.214
<v Speaker 2>but it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a warning in some sense </v>

2163
02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:34.640
<v Speaker 2>against the the equation of intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliance with moral superiority.</v>

2164
02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:38.213
<v Speaker 2>And so if the intellects would drop </v>
<v Speaker 2>their moral superiority and fat chance </v>

2165
02:06:41.641 --> 02:06:42.474
<v Speaker 2>there is of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that divide between the working </v>

2166
02:06:45.421 --> 02:06:50.421
<v Speaker 2>class say and the elite would would </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolve.</v>

2167
02:06:52.110 --> 02:06:56.460
<v Speaker 2>And there's every reason to have respect</v>
<v Speaker 2>for decent working class people.</v>

2168
02:06:57.010 --> 02:06:57.843
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's on their labor as the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>wingers at least hypothetically agree </v>

2169
02:07:03.570 --> 02:07:06.120
<v Speaker 2>that the entire edifice of the culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2170
02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:10.650
<v Speaker 2>is resting so you can have your cake and</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat it too.</v>

2171
02:07:10.650 --> 02:07:15.650
<v Speaker 2>But you have to not assume that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>niche makes you superior.</v>

2172
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 2>And it's very difficult for smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2173
02:07:18.721 --> 02:07:21.750
<v Speaker 2>especially smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this scene in niches.</v>

2174
02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Sins thus spake Zarathustra Zarathustra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The prophet comes down from the mountain</v>

2175
02:07:26.851 --> 02:07:27.684
<v Speaker 2>and he comes into a public square and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this crowd around this little </v>

2176
02:07:31.051 --> 02:07:31.884
<v Speaker 2>midget who is only about this high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has a gigantic ear and everyone is </v>

2177
02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:38.350
<v Speaker 2>marveling at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2178
02:07:38.351 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 2>that's what the modern intellect is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

2179
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:41.403
<v Speaker 2>It's a midget with a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well mouth generally not an ear and the </v>

2180
02:07:45.410 --> 02:07:50.350
<v Speaker 2>being is under developed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the intellect is hyper activated and</v>

2181
02:07:50.450 --> 02:07:54.790
<v Speaker 2>it makes the person extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbalanced and it's partly because a,</v>

2182
02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:55.624
<v Speaker 2>they can't compete outside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual realm and that makes them </v>

2183
02:07:57.851 --> 02:07:59.530
<v Speaker 2>very bitter because they tend to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2184
02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:00.371
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so smart.</v>

2185
02:08:00.371 --> 02:08:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Everything should just come to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2186
02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:02.643
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not how the world works and and </v>

2187
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:06.820
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also that,</v>

2188
02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:08.670
<v Speaker 2>that and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2189
02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:13.150
<v Speaker 2>that attitude is immediately evident to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that they're talking to when they</v>

2190
02:08:13.151 --> 02:08:13.984
<v Speaker 2>talk in the manner that they talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they are arrogant intellectuals of </v>

2191
02:08:16.241 --> 02:08:17.074
<v Speaker 2>that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that in the simpsons did a good </v>

2192
02:08:18.821 --> 02:08:21.120
<v Speaker 2>job of that with Comic Book Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2193
02:08:21.530 --> 02:08:22.363
<v Speaker 2>I mean he completely useless in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible dimension with an Iq of about </v>

2194
02:08:26.021 --> 02:08:26.854
<v Speaker 2>160 and it's very annoying to people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an Iq of 160 that they can also be </v>

2195
02:08:30.911 --> 02:08:33.550
<v Speaker 2>completely useless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it happens a lot.</v>

2196
02:08:33.730 --> 02:08:35.320
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

2197
02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2198
02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to have it a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2199
02:08:45.831 --> 02:08:47.360
<v Speaker 2>see how are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

2200
02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:51.770
<v Speaker 2>So I was at first going to ask about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts on a very popular TV show.</v>

2201
02:08:51.771 --> 02:08:52.604
<v Speaker 2>Rick and Morty just recommended that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and they said they thought I would </v>

2202
02:08:56.401 --> 02:08:57.234
<v Speaker 2>find it funny and that makes me nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I like the simpsons and I liked </v>

2203
02:09:00.571 --> 02:09:02.820
<v Speaker 2>the trailer park boys for actually liked</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trailer.</v>

2204
02:09:02.821 --> 02:09:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the trailer park boys and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if someone said,</v>

2205
02:09:06.510 --> 02:09:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I know it's so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2206
02:09:09.930 --> 02:09:12.990
<v Speaker 2>but they said that I would like rick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morty,</v>

2207
02:09:12.991 --> 02:09:17.991
<v Speaker 2>so I'm kind of afraid to even watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does have a nihilistic theme to it,</v>

2208
02:09:18.270 --> 02:09:19.103
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was quite telling of the young </v>

2209
02:09:21.361 --> 02:09:23.820
<v Speaker 2>population which say falling in love </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

2210
02:09:23.821 --> 02:09:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2211
02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:26.211
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2212
02:09:26.211 --> 02:09:29.330
<v Speaker 2>I'll definitely watch it because I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>been looking for something to watch when</v>

2213
02:09:29.331 --> 02:09:30.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm brain dead at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2214
02:09:32.010 --> 02:09:36.370
<v Speaker 2>but I just had to tell him my question </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a different angle if I,</v>

2215
02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:37.240
<v Speaker 2>if I may.</v>

2216
02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's about,</v>

2217
02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:41.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case that governments,</v>

2218
02:09:41.130 --> 02:09:43.890
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as Russia and Iran,</v>

2219
02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:46.590
<v Speaker 2>they are even more extreme cases like </v>
<v Speaker 2>isis.</v>

2220
02:09:46.710 --> 02:09:47.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do not want to confront a </v>

2221
02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:51.690
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic aspects of the west and as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>result,</v>

2222
02:09:51.691 --> 02:09:52.524
<v Speaker 2>they've taken an anti western approach </v>
<v Speaker 2>as someone with a Middle Eastern </v>

2223
02:09:55.501 --> 02:09:56.680
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2224
02:09:56.690 --> 02:10:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to figure out where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>origins of this hostility more precisely</v>

2225
02:10:02.011 --> 02:10:04.800
<v Speaker 2>comes from and why things are the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

2226
02:10:05.530 --> 02:10:06.363
<v Speaker 2>I recently found out that certain key </v>
<v Speaker 2>uranium philosophers and political </v>

2227
02:10:10.621 --> 02:10:11.454
<v Speaker 2>activist who were partially </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually responsible for the 1979 </v>

2228
02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:20.060
<v Speaker 2>revolution were highly influenced by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti western Heideggerian philosophy.</v>

2229
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:24.570
<v Speaker 2>And this is partially why they believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that an Islamic state,</v>

2230
02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:28.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be unnecessary counter position,</v>

2231
02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:29.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

2232
02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:32.310
<v Speaker 2>to the nihilistic western thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2233
02:10:32.311 --> 02:10:32.740
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2234
02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:37.740
<v Speaker 2>I know you also found there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexander Duke in a puddings advisor,</v>

2235
02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:41.570
<v Speaker 2>except Dougan doesn't really seem to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a coherent answer.</v>

2236
02:10:41.770 --> 02:10:42.603
<v Speaker 2>He says that an answer like that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary and that hypothetically it's </v>

2237
02:10:46.401 --> 02:10:48.080
<v Speaker 2>something that Russia might be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer,</v>

2238
02:10:48.081 --> 02:10:51.020
<v Speaker 2>but the details seem to me somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>obscure.</v>

2239
02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Russians may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russians are doing what Solzhenitsyn</v>

2240
02:10:55.641 --> 02:10:57.890
<v Speaker 2>suggested in returning to Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>

2241
02:10:57.891 --> 02:10:58.724
<v Speaker 2>although Russia's corrupt enough so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to tell from the </v>

2242
02:11:01.671 --> 02:11:02.504
<v Speaker 2>outside if that's mirror collusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>between a corrupt church and a corrupt </v>

2243
02:11:05.031 --> 02:11:07.130
<v Speaker 2>state or if there's something genuine </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on there.</v>

2244
02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:08.413
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2245
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:10.303
<v Speaker 2>I would say there's a question under </v>
<v Speaker 2>your question which is tyranny or </v>

2246
02:11:13.461 --> 02:11:15.190
<v Speaker 2>nihilism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2247
02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:17.720
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

2248
02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:19.393
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of people would pick tyranny </v>

2249
02:11:20.541 --> 02:11:24.690
<v Speaker 2>overnight and so if that's the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice that people are offered then.</v>

2250
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:25.663
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that tyranny is </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger than nihilism because of what </v>

2251
02:11:28.191 --> 02:11:30.710
<v Speaker 2>are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Organize nihilists hardly.</v>

2252
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>

2253
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:34.730
<v Speaker 2>look at what happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that thing in central park,</v>

2254
02:11:35.170 --> 02:11:36.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against the one percent.</v>

2255
02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:37.551
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2256
02:11:37.551 --> 02:11:42.140
<v Speaker 2>what a dismal affair that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd like things to be different.</v>

2257
02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:47.690
<v Speaker 2>How</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we don't know.</v>

2258
02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:48.793
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

2259
02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:53.520
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

2260
02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:54.573
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just run over that if you're a </v>

2261
02:11:56.891 --> 02:11:57.724
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical and organized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just run over that like there's </v>

2262
02:11:59.470 --> 02:12:00.303
<v Speaker 2>nothing there at all and that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a danger and I do think that </v>

2263
02:12:04.121 --> 02:12:04.954
<v Speaker 2>were enticing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The islamofascism let's say by our </v>

2264
02:12:09.071 --> 02:12:12.160
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic weakness and I think more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that,</v>

2265
02:12:12.161 --> 02:12:14.890
<v Speaker 2>I think that we're doing something more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that because one of the things that</v>

2266
02:12:14.891 --> 02:12:17.620
<v Speaker 2>I've been curious about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going way out on limb here,</v>

2267
02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:18.753
<v Speaker 2>is I've been really interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>alliance between the Neo Marxist </v>

2268
02:12:21.310 --> 02:12:23.980
<v Speaker 2>denialists or the Neo Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern,</v>

2269
02:12:23.981 --> 02:12:26.880
<v Speaker 2>especially the feminists and the Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascists.</v>

2270
02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I just don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's something very,</v>

2271
02:12:30.281 --> 02:12:34.270
<v Speaker 2>very interesting going on there and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think part of it is that when you,</v>

2272
02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:39.010
<v Speaker 2>when you drift too far into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic substructure,</v>

2273
02:12:39.190 --> 02:12:40.023
<v Speaker 2>there is a huge call for tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 2>order that manifests itself </v>

2274
02:12:42.731 --> 02:12:43.564
<v Speaker 2>unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the dynamic that I see </v>

2275
02:12:45.731 --> 02:12:46.564
<v Speaker 2>playing out in that peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the modern Neil </v>

2276
02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Marxist feminists in the Islam of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascists.</v>

2277
02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:58.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2278
02:12:58.271 --> 02:12:59.104
<v Speaker 2>That's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very interesting that that's a </v>

2279
02:13:01.391 --> 02:13:04.240
<v Speaker 2>very interesting idea that you brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>to mind.</v>

2280
02:13:04.241 --> 02:13:05.074
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between heidegger and what </v>

2281
02:13:07.931 --> 02:13:08.764
<v Speaker 2>happened in Iran in the 19 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could send me a citation about </v>

2282
02:13:12.761 --> 02:13:15.310
<v Speaker 2>that or something to read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be very interested in doing that.</v>

2283
02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:16.420
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2284
02:13:16.690 --> 02:13:17.523
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2285
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

2286
02:13:26.730 --> 02:13:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2287
02:13:30.570 --> 02:13:31.403
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the closest thing I think I'll </v>

2288
02:13:32.461 --> 02:13:35.970
<v Speaker 2>experience ta to Arnold Schwartzenegger </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually delivering that line.</v>

2289
02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:54.550
<v Speaker 7>April title,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the left one case for free speech</v>

2290
02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:02.800
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2291
02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Not Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

2292
02:14:07.090 --> 02:14:07.923
<v Speaker 7>Whereby I guess the square root of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>number of people involved in some sort </v>

2293
02:14:10.711 --> 02:14:12.220
<v Speaker 7>of a productive endeavor</v>

2294
02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:13.630
<v Speaker 2>do half the work</v>

2295
02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:15.890
<v Speaker 7>would result in half the production.</v>

2296
02:14:15.970 --> 02:14:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a nasty,</v>

2297
02:14:17.370 --> 02:14:18.390
<v Speaker 2>nasty law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2298
02:14:18.391 --> 02:14:19.890
<v Speaker 2>It was also known as price's law.</v>

2299
02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:24.630
<v Speaker 7>Four hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 7>500 people we've all cleaned up.</v>

2300
02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

2301
02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:29.233
<v Speaker 7>What you're saying is that if you say </v>
<v Speaker 7>that this perino distribution </v>

2302
02:14:32.570 --> 02:14:33.403
<v Speaker 7>approximates a natural law,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like we all understand the force of </v>

2303
02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:41.120
<v Speaker 7>gravity and there's no escaping the </v>
<v Speaker 7>influence of gravity,</v>

2304
02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:43.033
<v Speaker 7>that means that there's 20 people in </v>
<v Speaker 7>this room who are going to be a guess </v>

2305
02:14:47.850 --> 02:14:48.683
<v Speaker 7>candidates for accomplishing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess the goal of being the next </v>

2306
02:14:52.491 --> 02:14:53.510
<v Speaker 7>Jordan Peterson.</v>

2307
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully there's fewer of them.</v>

2308
02:15:01.710 --> 02:15:02.543
<v Speaker 2>The first is it isn't obvious what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population would be that you would </v>

2309
02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:10.480
<v Speaker 2>compare this population too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2310
02:15:10.530 --> 02:15:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Because you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2311
02:15:11.551 --> 02:15:13.470
<v Speaker 2>the boundary is the 400 people in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

2312
02:15:13.471 --> 02:15:17.580
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't necessarily the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 400 people in this room might be the</v>

2313
02:15:17.850 --> 02:15:20.940
<v Speaker 2>square root of the broader population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're interested in this sort of thing.</v>

2314
02:15:20.941 --> 02:15:23.980
<v Speaker 2>But with the prieto distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you also see is that it's,</v>

2315
02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:27.120
<v Speaker 2>it's self similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2316
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:28.263
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say there's 400 people doing </v>

2317
02:15:31.351 --> 02:15:33.180
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 of them are doing half the work,</v>

2318
02:15:33.181 --> 02:15:36.810
<v Speaker 2>but if you take 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those 24 of them are doing half the work</v>

2319
02:15:36.811 --> 02:15:39.750
<v Speaker 2>of the 20 and one of the four is doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>half the work of the four.</v>

2320
02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:41.153
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

2321
02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:42.843
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2322
02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:47.950
<v Speaker 2>So why am I telling you that it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2323
02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:48.991
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2324
02:15:48.991 --> 02:15:53.991
<v Speaker 2>it isn't that there isn't useful work to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be done at multiple slices of the prieto</v>

2325
02:15:54.271 --> 02:15:55.104
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing is it's also the </v>

2326
02:15:56.641 --> 02:15:58.710
<v Speaker 2>case that there's not only one prieto </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution,</v>

2327
02:15:59.610 --> 02:16:00.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he might say,</v>

2328
02:16:00.571 --> 02:16:01.404
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's just the square root of the </v>

2329
02:16:02.221 --> 02:16:04.500
<v Speaker 2>number of people in a domain that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing half the work,</v>

2330
02:16:04.510 --> 02:16:06.420
<v Speaker 2>then what do you do with the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

2331
02:16:06.421 --> 02:16:07.254
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that might be while </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in a pre a different prieto </v>

2332
02:16:09.961 --> 02:16:10.794
<v Speaker 2>distribution as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're doing something </v>

2333
02:16:12.241 --> 02:16:13.860
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2334
02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good question.</v>

2335
02:16:24.601 --> 02:16:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2336
02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:26.020
<v Speaker 2>we don't exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2337
02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:28.140
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the basic rule is the look,</v>

2338
02:16:28.141 --> 02:16:28.974
<v Speaker 2>the basic rule is example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take 100 scientists in a given </v>

2339
02:16:32.141 --> 02:16:32.974
<v Speaker 2>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 of them will have published half the </v>

2340
02:16:34.241 --> 02:16:37.360
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this works with everything.</v>

2341
02:16:37.361 --> 02:16:40.270
<v Speaker 2>It works with every creative domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rule applies.</v>

2342
02:16:40.810 --> 02:16:41.643
<v Speaker 2>So now the question is why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the answer to that seems to </v>

2343
02:16:44.771 --> 02:16:45.604
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've watched people who've become </v>

2344
02:16:46.301 --> 02:16:48.700
<v Speaker 2>spectacularly successful and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens is that</v>

2345
02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:53.290
<v Speaker 2>zero is a really bad place to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2346
02:16:53.291 --> 02:16:54.124
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to get out of zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's often why people are trapped </v>

2347
02:16:57.671 --> 02:16:58.504
<v Speaker 2>in poverty because if you have nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting to something is virtually </v>

2348
02:17:02.411 --> 02:17:04.270
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you have something,</v>

2349
02:17:04.271 --> 02:17:06.910
<v Speaker 2>getting to a little more of something is</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually quite a bit easier.</v>

2350
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:10.960
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>
<v Speaker 2>what seems to happen,</v>

2351
02:17:11.470 --> 02:17:13.750
<v Speaker 2>this is also called the matthew </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle,</v>

2352
02:17:14.110 --> 02:17:14.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2353
02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:18.340
<v Speaker 2>It's the same principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a new testament citation.</v>

2354
02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:19.233
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the matthew principle is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>those who have everything more will be </v>

2355
02:17:23.291 --> 02:17:27.580
<v Speaker 2>given from those who have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything will be taken.</v>

2356
02:17:27.730 --> 02:17:28.563
<v Speaker 2>That's another one of those lines in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>new testament that you'd think that a </v>

2357
02:17:30.461 --> 02:17:33.160
<v Speaker 2>good editor would have just got rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So but,</v>

2358
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:34.023
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think what it is is that every </v>

2359
02:17:35.411 --> 02:17:36.244
<v Speaker 2>time you make a step forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you'll be able to </v>

2360
02:17:39.161 --> 02:17:39.994
<v Speaker 2>take the next step forward increases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to increase in a nonlinear </v>

2361
02:17:42.761 --> 02:17:43.594
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the world that the matthew principal </v>

2362
02:17:47.141 --> 02:17:49.000
<v Speaker 2>describes is nonlinear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2363
02:17:49.001 --> 02:17:49.840
<v Speaker 2>so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2364
02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:52.180
<v Speaker 2>what's your trajectory if you're moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>upward?</v>

2365
02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not this,</v>

2366
02:17:53.890 --> 02:17:56.770
<v Speaker 2>it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your trajectory?</v>

2367
02:17:56.771 --> 02:17:59.620
<v Speaker 2>If you're moving downward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not this,</v>

2368
02:18:00.010 --> 02:18:01.450
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2369
02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:03.400
<v Speaker 2>You Fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fall,</v>

2370
02:18:03.430 --> 02:18:05.950
<v Speaker 2>you plummet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you rise,</v>

2371
02:18:05.951 --> 02:18:08.020
<v Speaker 2>you rise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you transcend.</v>

2372
02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:09.520
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2373
02:18:09.521 --> 02:18:10.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hell of a world,</v>

2374
02:18:10.661 --> 02:18:13.650
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be run by some principle.</v>

2375
02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:15.850
<v Speaker 2>That's the principle that it appears to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be run by.</v>

2376
02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:20.333
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2377
02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:25.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2378
02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:27.200
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that at all.</v>

2379
02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:31.040
<v Speaker 2>What it means is that every truth claim </v>
<v Speaker 2>you make,</v>

2380
02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:34.340
<v Speaker 2>including those that are implicit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your actions,</v>

2381
02:18:34.670 --> 02:18:39.670
<v Speaker 2>carries with it an ethic that justifies </v>
<v Speaker 2>or doesn't justify the action.</v>

2382
02:18:40.220 --> 02:18:41.053
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say I have a tool and I say it's </v>

2383
02:18:43.611 --> 02:18:46.880
<v Speaker 2>an ax and I go out in the forest and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut down.</v>

2384
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I tried to cut down a tree with it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work.</v>

2385
02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:52.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not an ax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something else.</v>

2386
02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:54.020
<v Speaker 2>And so what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the.</v>

2387
02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:58.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a good book on pragmatism called</v>
<v Speaker 2>the metaphysical club,</v>

2388
02:18:58.431 --> 02:18:59.264
<v Speaker 2>a history of American ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one I would really recommend and </v>

2389
02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:02.233
<v Speaker 2>what the pragmatists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't give you a full answer because </v>

2390
02:19:04.011 --> 02:19:04.844
<v Speaker 2>this is such a complicated issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the pragmatist we're wrestling </v>

2391
02:19:07.491 --> 02:19:11.930
<v Speaker 2>with back in the late 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the late 18 hundreds.</v>

2392
02:19:12.050 --> 02:19:14.960
<v Speaker 2>This was William James and his crew in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in in Boston,</v>

2393
02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:16.813
<v Speaker 2>including a philosopher named cs purse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is perhaps America's greatest </v>

2394
02:19:19.671 --> 02:19:20.504
<v Speaker 2>philosopher.</v>

2395
02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:22.573
<v Speaker 2>They were wrestling with the same issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the postmodernist would wrestle </v>

2396
02:19:24.561 --> 02:19:26.630
<v Speaker 2>with 100 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is</v>

2397
02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:31.190
<v Speaker 2>things are indefinitely complex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not very bright.</v>

2398
02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:36.520
<v Speaker 2>So how is it that we can make claims to </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth about anything and what they were?</v>

2399
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:41.210
<v Speaker 2>What their hypothesis essentially was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that with every action and with every</v>

2400
02:19:41.211 --> 02:19:44.480
<v Speaker 2>truth claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you simultaneously demarcate a territory</v>

2401
02:19:44.481 --> 02:19:47.960
<v Speaker 2>within which that claim is valid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2402
02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:48.863
<v Speaker 2>You determine whether the claim is valid</v>
<v Speaker 2>by noting whether your prediction about </v>

2403
02:19:52.281 --> 02:19:56.750
<v Speaker 2>the outcome of your action or your or </v>
<v Speaker 2>your belief is commensurate is,</v>

2404
02:19:56.770 --> 02:19:57.603
<v Speaker 2>is in keeping with if the outcome is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping with the prediction than what </v>

2405
02:20:03.291 --> 02:20:06.530
<v Speaker 2>you've said or done is true or good </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

2406
02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:10.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's as good as you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the pragmatic perspective.</v>

2407
02:20:10.641 --> 02:20:12.260
<v Speaker 2>And then when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2408
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:16.910
<v Speaker 2>when the pragmatists encountered Charles</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dark Charles Darwin's works works,</v>

2409
02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:18.163
<v Speaker 2>they immediately recognized that Darwin </v>
<v Speaker 2>had generated a pragmatic solution to </v>

2410
02:20:21.651 --> 02:20:24.060
<v Speaker 2>the problem of the impossibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

2411
02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:25.373
<v Speaker 2>The impossibility of being is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's way more cosmos than there is </v>

2412
02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:31.400
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are going to die.</v>

2413
02:20:31.430 --> 02:20:35.960
<v Speaker 2>You cannot generate a sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution to the problem of you're being.</v>

2414
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:38.180
<v Speaker 2>No one can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

2415
02:20:38.181 --> 02:20:39.014
<v Speaker 2>Cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the environment is a snake </v>

2416
02:20:40.851 --> 02:20:41.684
<v Speaker 2>that moves unpredictably across time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to stay on its back while </v>

2417
02:20:44.591 --> 02:20:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I was how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does the Darwinian process deal with</v>

2418
02:20:47.331 --> 02:20:48.164
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It produces infinite variance roughly </v>

2419
02:20:50.511 --> 02:20:53.180
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all of which die.</v>

2420
02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:57.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it solves a problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>across time and the things that exist,</v>

2421
02:20:57.730 --> 02:20:59.360
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that stay alive,</v>

2422
02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:02.510
<v Speaker 2>our true enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the best you get.</v>

2423
02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:03.373
<v Speaker 2>That's the argument I was trying to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Sam Harris because Harris doesn't </v>

2424
02:21:05.631 --> 02:21:08.780
<v Speaker 2>take his evolutionary psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary theory seriously enough,</v>

2425
02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:11.030
<v Speaker 2>but we get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kept getting bogged down.</v>

2426
02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2427
02:21:12.980 --> 02:21:17.900
<v Speaker 2>that's the best answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to agree with that,</v>

2428
02:21:17.901 --> 02:21:18.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's not true.</v>

2429
02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yup,</v>

2430
02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:32.100
<v Speaker 7>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

2431
02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:39.350
<v Speaker 7>True scientific.</v>

2432
02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:42.160
<v Speaker 2>You really do like to ask hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>

2433
02:21:42.161 --> 02:21:43.580
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2434
02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2435
02:21:45.581 --> 02:21:48.850
<v Speaker 2>this is also why like the pod and take </v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say on,</v>

2436
02:21:48.970 --> 02:21:49.803
<v Speaker 2>on pragmatism because I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatism as a philosophy has the </v>

2437
02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:58.510
<v Speaker 2>limitation that you just described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only if you think about the Games is</v>

2438
02:21:58.511 --> 02:21:59.344
<v Speaker 2>limited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have to play the game in an </v>

2439
02:22:01.181 --> 02:22:02.014
<v Speaker 2>iterative way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that issue resolves itself and the </v>

2440
02:22:05.411 --> 02:22:07.720
<v Speaker 2>game theorists have done a good job of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mapping that out.</v>

2441
02:22:07.930 --> 02:22:11.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say pragmatically speaking,</v>

2442
02:22:11.381 --> 02:22:13.150
<v Speaker 2>there is no reason I shouldn't deceive </v>
<v Speaker 2>you once.</v>

2443
02:22:13.151 --> 02:22:15.170
<v Speaker 2>If I can get what I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's yeah.</v>

2444
02:22:15.171 --> 02:22:16.004
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except that I'm probably not only going </v>

2445
02:22:17.681 --> 02:22:20.890
<v Speaker 2>to interact with you once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to interact with you a lot and</v>

2446
02:22:20.891 --> 02:22:22.990
<v Speaker 2>even if it isn't you that I interact </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2447
02:22:23.140 --> 02:22:23.973
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a bunch of beings that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so much you that it might as well </v>

2448
02:22:26.131 --> 02:22:27.900
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might as well be you.</v>

2449
02:22:28.530 --> 02:22:29.363
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be me if nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the pragmatic game stretched </v>

2450
02:22:33.451 --> 02:22:34.284
<v Speaker 2>across time would include the necessity </v>
<v Speaker 2>of interability in relationship to the </v>

2451
02:22:39.301 --> 02:22:41.880
<v Speaker 2>validations of the truth claims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2452
02:22:42.210 --> 02:22:46.520
<v Speaker 2>that's how it looks to me when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>

2453
02:22:46.530 --> 02:22:47.363
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

2454
02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:51.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop you say that again?</v>

2455
02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Denied on several occasions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2456
02:22:56.360 --> 02:22:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Like you're good at rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2457
02:22:59.340 --> 02:23:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2458
02:23:01.891 --> 02:23:03.180
<v Speaker 2>But that's not all I am.</v>

2459
02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:13.480
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so this is on behalf of somebody,</v>

2460
02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:14.693
<v Speaker 8>Dr Peterson having listened to your </v>
<v Speaker 8>expositions on the mythological </v>

2461
02:23:17.041 --> 02:23:17.874
<v Speaker 8>evolution and amalgamation of religion </v>
<v Speaker 8>and keeping in mind your working </v>

2462
02:23:20.821 --> 02:23:25.050
<v Speaker 8>definition of belief and truth and </v>
<v Speaker 8>despite the obvious reasons for somebody</v>

2463
02:23:25.051 --> 02:23:27.780
<v Speaker 8>of your background to identify most with</v>
<v Speaker 8>Christianity,</v>

2464
02:23:27.930 --> 02:23:31.470
<v Speaker 8>my understanding is that you believe </v>
<v Speaker 8>Christianity to be the most complete and</v>

2465
02:23:31.471 --> 02:23:35.340
<v Speaker 8>articulated form of many of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>metaphysical ideas that proceeded.</v>

2466
02:23:35.341 --> 02:23:37.710
<v Speaker 8>It led up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Keeping that in mind,</v>

2467
02:23:37.711 --> 02:23:38.544
<v Speaker 8>would it also be accurate to therefore </v>
<v Speaker 8>say that you're not only a believer in </v>

2468
02:23:41.011 --> 02:23:41.844
<v Speaker 8>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but also if to a lesser degree also </v>

2469
02:23:45.001 --> 02:23:46.470
<v Speaker 8>believer in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in Marta,</v>

2470
02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:47.693
<v Speaker 8>in the ancient Egyptian gods and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>subsequent gods that you've spoken of </v>

2471
02:23:49.891 --> 02:23:50.560
<v Speaker 8>here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2472
02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:51.393
<v Speaker 8>that lead up and contributed to the form</v>
<v Speaker 8>of Christianity that you're discussing </v>

2473
02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:55.500
<v Speaker 8>and that you identify with.</v>

2474
02:23:56.960 --> 02:23:57.793
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to take that one apart a little </v>

2475
02:23:58.791 --> 02:23:59.624
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bounded in my judgment with regards </v>

2476
02:24:03.561 --> 02:24:08.561
<v Speaker 2>to Christianity by my ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no student of Hinduism</v>

2477
02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:11.233
<v Speaker 2>so I can't make the claim forthrightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's something intrinsically </v>

2478
02:24:16.401 --> 02:24:21.260
<v Speaker 2>superior to the Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition because I don't know enough to</v>

2479
02:24:21.261 --> 02:24:22.094
<v Speaker 2>make that claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The claim I can make is that there's </v>

2480
02:24:24.860 --> 02:24:25.693
<v Speaker 2>something that's dreadfully right about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this core elements of the Judeo </v>

2481
02:24:29.151 --> 02:24:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Christian tradition and I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>analogs to that.</v>

2482
02:24:31.961 --> 02:24:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things I'd like to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2483
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:35.383
<v Speaker 2>is to do a a short series on the Tao Te </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ching because that is one remarkable </v>

2484
02:24:40.101 --> 02:24:41.570
<v Speaker 2>document.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you know,</v>

2485
02:24:41.571 --> 02:24:44.480
<v Speaker 2>especially you might want to read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go online and read.</v>

2486
02:24:44.481 --> 02:24:47.000
<v Speaker 2>It's very short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tao Te Ching t a n o,</v>

2487
02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:52.660
<v Speaker 2>t e h e c h I n g dot and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental texts of Taoism.</v>

2488
02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:57.670
<v Speaker 2>And once you know that the world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being is made of chaos and order and you</v>

2489
02:24:57.951 --> 02:25:00.170
<v Speaker 2>know that that's represented by the Yin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Yang,</v>

2490
02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:02.900
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you can understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tao te Ching and it's just.</v>

2491
02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:08.180
<v Speaker 2>It's brilliantly simple and </v>
<v Speaker 2>straightforward and did sex position.</v>

2492
02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:11.540
<v Speaker 2>But it also seems to me to be entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>commensurate with the line of,</v>

2493
02:25:11.930 --> 02:25:14.150
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it logic.</v>

2494
02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:15.570
<v Speaker 2>It's more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2495
02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:19.730
<v Speaker 2>the mode of description of being that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>encapsulated in these stories.</v>

2496
02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Now with regards to being a believer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people ask me all the time,</v>

2497
02:25:22.791 --> 02:25:23.624
<v Speaker 2>two thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2498
02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:24.250
<v Speaker 2>do you believe</v>

2499
02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:26.940
<v Speaker 4>in God and are you a Christian?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer to that,</v>

2500
02:25:26.980 --> 02:25:28.960
<v Speaker 4>both of those is actually there's two </v>
<v Speaker 4>answers.</v>

2501
02:25:28.961 --> 02:25:29.794
<v Speaker 4>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell makes you think it's any </v>

2502
02:25:30.911 --> 02:25:33.220
<v Speaker 4>of your business?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first answer.</v>

2503
02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:34.173
<v Speaker 4>And the second is why do you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mean the same thing with those </v>

2504
02:25:37.781 --> 02:25:39.760
<v Speaker 4>questions that I would mean with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>answer.</v>

2505
02:25:40.450 --> 02:25:41.283
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's such a funny thing because </v>

2506
02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:44.733
<v Speaker 4>I've spent like three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is no accusation with regards to </v>

2507
02:25:47.291 --> 02:25:48.600
<v Speaker 4>your questions in the least,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2508
02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:49.533
<v Speaker 9>I think it's more about trying to track </v>
<v Speaker 9>the development of these ideas and you </v>

2509
02:25:51.731 --> 02:25:53.280
<v Speaker 9>know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the residual truths and psych,</v>

2510
02:25:53.890 --> 02:25:56.380
<v Speaker 9>psychological significance of all these </v>
<v Speaker 9>other traditions.</v>

2511
02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:57.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2512
02:25:57.750 --> 02:26:02.750
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been floored by either mythological</v>

2513
02:26:03.171 --> 02:26:04.004
<v Speaker 4>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like when I first understood or </v>

2514
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:10.130
<v Speaker 4>thought I understood the meaning of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mesopotamian creation method,</v>

2515
02:26:10.131 --> 02:26:13.280
<v Speaker 4>just I've never recovered from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>

2516
02:26:13.430 --> 02:26:14.263
<v Speaker 4>And the same thing is true of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigations I did into the Egyptian </v>

2517
02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:21.050
<v Speaker 4>myths of Horace and Isis and Osiris and </v>
<v Speaker 4>seth.</v>

2518
02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:22.240
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2519
02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:26.960
<v Speaker 4>they're so relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're so unbelievably relevant.</v>

2520
02:26:26.961 --> 02:26:27.794
<v Speaker 4>And how do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do see this is a problem that none </v>

2521
02:26:31.161 --> 02:26:33.260
<v Speaker 4>of us really know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to solve.</v>

2522
02:26:33.261 --> 02:26:36.110
<v Speaker 4>It's like there are sources of wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 4>all over the world,</v>

2523
02:26:36.290 --> 02:26:37.123
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they need to be made commensurate </v>

2524
02:26:39.951 --> 02:26:40.784
<v Speaker 4>with one another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which isn't to say that they need to be </v>

2525
02:26:42.801 --> 02:26:45.650
<v Speaker 4>turned into a fast food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A mall,</v>

2526
02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:46.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2527
02:26:46.191 --> 02:26:47.720
<v Speaker 4>that's like multiculturalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2528
02:26:47.721 --> 02:26:48.554
<v Speaker 4>It's like all the food of the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>served in the most terrible possible </v>

2529
02:26:52.431 --> 02:26:55.070
<v Speaker 4>manner all in one place and something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2530
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.903
<v Speaker 4>And you don't want to do that with </v>
<v Speaker 4>comparative religion is just water </v>

2531
02:26:58.341 --> 02:27:00.380
<v Speaker 4>everything down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's all nice.</v>

2532
02:27:00.381 --> 02:27:00.861
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2533
02:27:00.861 --> 02:27:02.650
<v Speaker 4>it is not nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2534
02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:04.910
<v Speaker 4>Or that it's all the same because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not all the same.</v>

2535
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:06.343
<v Speaker 4>So the job of communicating between </v>
<v Speaker 4>those domains of wisdom is really </v>

2536
02:27:13.130 --> 02:27:13.881
<v Speaker 4>continuing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2537
02:27:13.881 --> 02:27:15.340
<v Speaker 4>It's been a problem ever since the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning of,</v>

2538
02:27:15.390 --> 02:27:16.223
<v Speaker 4>of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's continuing and I would say the </v>

2539
02:27:18.591 --> 02:27:22.310
<v Speaker 4>psychoanalysts too young in particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a huge,</v>

2540
02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:23.173
<v Speaker 4>huge steps in the direction of doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in an extraordinarily positive way </v>

2541
02:27:27.890 --> 02:27:31.430
<v Speaker 4>and not a simple minded way at all and </v>
<v Speaker 4>not just hand waving that.</v>

2542
02:27:31.431 --> 02:27:32.264
<v Speaker 4>Oh well it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone has one in all shall have </v>

2543
02:27:34.281 --> 02:27:35.840
<v Speaker 4>prizes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that.</v>

2544
02:27:36.470 --> 02:27:41.470
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Last question.</v>

2545
02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:46.483
<v Speaker 9>I choose a kind of in the same vein,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's in regards to another kind of </v>

2546
02:27:49.161 --> 02:27:49.994
<v Speaker 9>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So in terms of I guess Carl Jung's own </v>

2547
02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:54.950
<v Speaker 9>with us,</v>
<v Speaker 9>sorry I'm extremely tall,</v>

2548
02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:55.933
<v Speaker 9>but a lot of the.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I actually got found some kind of </v>

2549
02:27:59.330 --> 02:28:02.030
<v Speaker 9>archetypes like for example in my own </v>
<v Speaker 9>life,</v>

2550
02:28:02.031 --> 02:28:02.864
<v Speaker 9>but also I've noticed in European life.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So for example in regards to Odin and </v>

2551
02:28:07.611 --> 02:28:12.611
<v Speaker 9>norse mythology with colleagues essay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've only been able to touch you skim it</v>

2552
02:28:12.771 --> 02:28:14.970
<v Speaker 9>because I've been trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 9>something like.</v>

2553
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:15.833
<v Speaker 9>Because it felt like there's always this</v>
<v Speaker 9>kind of psyche that was almost </v>

2554
02:28:17.871 --> 02:28:19.700
<v Speaker 9>underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I guess,</v>

2555
02:28:19.701 --> 02:28:20.534
<v Speaker 9>Western civilization and we've see it </v>
<v Speaker 9>really like embodied in this specific </v>

2556
02:28:24.951 --> 02:28:25.850
<v Speaker 9>figure,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this deity,</v>

2557
02:28:25.851 --> 02:28:27.800
<v Speaker 9>the wanderer,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the knowledge,</v>

2558
02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:30.860
<v Speaker 9>gather the seeker,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but he's also a war.</v>

2559
02:28:30.861 --> 02:28:31.694
<v Speaker 9>God is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he is all these different aspects that </v>

2560
02:28:33.381 --> 02:28:38.270
<v Speaker 9>are an accumulation of what seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 9>something that's distinctly western.</v>

2561
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:43.070
<v Speaker 9>And I feel this is like almost like the </v>
<v Speaker 9>symbol in a way.</v>

2562
02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:45.100
<v Speaker 9>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's not always positive.</v>

2563
02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:48.890
<v Speaker 2>There seems to be something maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there seems to be something.</v>

2564
02:28:48.980 --> 02:28:49.813
<v Speaker 2>I do think that the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual has been articulated most </v>

2565
02:28:53.961 --> 02:28:56.870
<v Speaker 2>fully in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's really a,</v>

2566
02:28:57.140 --> 02:29:00.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a contentious claim</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

2567
02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:01.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that the latent </v>

2568
02:29:04.040 --> 02:29:04.873
<v Speaker 2>structures from which that idea might </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge weren't also many other places </v>

2569
02:29:08.811 --> 02:29:09.644
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing from let's say from </v>

2570
02:29:11.811 --> 02:29:12.644
<v Speaker 2>a biological perspective is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>only talking about differences of a few </v>

2571
02:29:15.291 --> 02:29:18.770
<v Speaker 2>hundred years in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of these ideas.</v>

2572
02:29:18.771 --> 02:29:19.604
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>From A,</v>

2573
02:29:19.610 --> 02:29:21.410
<v Speaker 2>from an evolutionary perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2574
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:23.270
<v Speaker 2>it's instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2575
02:29:23.271 --> 02:29:25.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new idea has to arise somewhere.</v>

2576
02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:28.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's going to be somewhere first and </v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

2577
02:29:28.341 --> 02:29:30.650
<v Speaker 2>it's spreading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity for example,</v>

2578
02:29:30.651 --> 02:29:31.484
<v Speaker 2>spreads so rapidly that it's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond belief and it is actually </v>

2579
02:29:33.741 --> 02:29:36.530
<v Speaker 2>spreading more rapidly in China now than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did in ancient Rome.</v>

2580
02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:37.700
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2581
02:29:37.700 --> 02:29:38.533
<v Speaker 9>Well in regards to that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's also been seen like almost in the </v>

2582
02:29:41.451 --> 02:29:42.284
<v Speaker 9>wake of a dying Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've noticed that like there's been a </v>

2583
02:29:44.481 --> 02:29:47.270
<v Speaker 9>tendency to go towards,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I guess paganism,</v>

2584
02:29:47.271 --> 02:29:48.130
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>

2585
02:29:48.410 --> 02:29:50.750
<v Speaker 9>I'm understand the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Some people love it off.</v>

2586
02:29:50.940 --> 02:29:52.480
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You Have Waco,</v>

2587
02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:53.323
<v Speaker 9>which was mainly a manifestation of all </v>
<v Speaker 9>the Alistair Crowley has works which </v>

2588
02:29:56.871 --> 02:29:57.704
<v Speaker 9>were then handed off to whoever actually</v>
<v Speaker 9>made the actual ideology and then next </v>

2589
02:30:01.791 --> 02:30:02.624
<v Speaker 9>thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we're finding something almost more </v>

2590
02:30:04.221 --> 02:30:05.054
<v Speaker 9>stable in I guess norse mythology and it</v>
<v Speaker 9>seems like it's acting almost as a </v>

2591
02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:12.170
<v Speaker 9>pendulum swing from something that.</v>

2592
02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are like.</v>

2593
02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:14.990
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is when,</v>

2594
02:30:14.991 --> 02:30:15.590
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2595
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:17.930
<v Speaker 2>when one mythological structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapses,</v>

2596
02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:22.160
<v Speaker 2>it's going to collapse into another </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological structure or another set of</v>

2597
02:30:22.161 --> 02:30:25.060
<v Speaker 2>mythological structures and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because you,</v>

2598
02:30:25.061 --> 02:30:27.530
<v Speaker 2>you can't get out of the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures,</v>

2599
02:30:27.531 --> 02:30:29.810
<v Speaker 2>there's no possible way of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2600
02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:30.913
<v Speaker 2>And so I wouldn't say necessarily that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that other belief systems </v>

2601
02:30:34.281 --> 02:30:37.880
<v Speaker 2>emerge in the aftermath of the collapse </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the overarching belief system,</v>

2602
02:30:37.881 --> 02:30:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that that's necessarily a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad idea.</v>

2603
02:30:40.220 --> 02:30:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that it has its attendant </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangers.</v>

2604
02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:44.533
<v Speaker 2>And so I should stop because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to get tired and I'm not going </v>

2605
02:30:47.931 --> 02:30:50.500
<v Speaker 2>to be able to formulate any clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>answers to that.</v>

2606
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:53.380
<v Speaker 2>And it's also 10:00.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we also do have to start.</v>

2607
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.823
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

2608
02:31:01.460 --> 02:31:02.293
<v Speaker 2>There is an unofficial meetup and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion group at Hemingway's </v>

2609
02:31:05.151 --> 02:31:06.650
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>
