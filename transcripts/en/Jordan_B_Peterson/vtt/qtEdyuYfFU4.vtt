2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:04.944
<v Speaker 1>and their leaders alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming to Holland next week for two </v>

3
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:09.804
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from the fact that I love Holland </v>

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and I'm always looking for an excuse to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go there.</v>

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>First on January 17th from 10:00 AM to </v>
<v Speaker 1>7:30 PM.</v>

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to corporate and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizational leaders in Amsterdam in a</v>

7
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:25.014
<v Speaker 1>session entitled envisioning the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the warehouse by wicked grounds in </v>

8
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:30.444
<v Speaker 1>Amsterdam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Details of the session can be found in </v>

9
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:33.774
<v Speaker 1>the description of this video as can </v>
<v Speaker 1>information about tickets which are </v>

10
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:37.374
<v Speaker 1>still available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to begin the day with a </v>

11
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>lecture on the psychology of motivation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and emotion.</v>

12
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.154
<v Speaker 1>I want to discuss deeply from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic level all the way down to the </v>

13
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.030
<v Speaker 1>level of of neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is that vision and motivation and</v>

14
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.354
<v Speaker 1>the regulation of emotion or deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>entwined in that the vision that we set </v>

15
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>for ourselves defines the framework </v>
<v Speaker 1>within which we operate in the world,</v>

16
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>perceive the world and react emotionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the world.</v>

17
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.283
<v Speaker 1>I want to help everyone who comes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>session understand exactly what that </v>

18
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>means in the most modern and uptodate </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological manner possible,</v>

19
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>and so all lecture for about 90 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>

20
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:20.274
<v Speaker 1>perhaps a bit longer after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>participants will have the opportunity </v>

21
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:26.274
<v Speaker 1>to complete the future authoring program</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least to begin the future </v>

22
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:29.994
<v Speaker 1>authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an online reading program that </v>

23
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.154
<v Speaker 1>I designed with my colleagues that </v>
<v Speaker 1>enables people to deeply conceptualize </v>

24
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>their lives three to five years down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road and to make a plan,</v>

25
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maximize the quality of their life.</v>

26
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>You began the future authoring program </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is available publicly by the way,</v>

27
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.493
<v Speaker 1>at cell faltering Dotcom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You begin the future authoring program </v>

28
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>by considering the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of your life,</v>

29
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

30
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.073
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitions for the future from an </v>

31
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:01.494
<v Speaker 1>economic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use of time outside of work and the </v>

32
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 1>regulation of temptations like drug and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol use,</v>

33
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>and imagine yourself three to five years</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road.</v>

34
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.203
<v Speaker 1>If you are living the life that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimal for you most meaningful and </v>

35
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>productive life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're asked to contemplate each of</v>

36
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>those dimensions to decide how you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimize your life,</v>

37
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:23.814
<v Speaker 1>specifically along those dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then to write for 15 minutes about what </v>

38
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:27.624
<v Speaker 1>your life could be like in three to five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years if you were really taking care of </v>

39
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>yourself like someone that you cared </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

40
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.713
<v Speaker 1>Then to write for 20 minutes about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life would be like if your bad </v>

41
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>habits and and inadequacies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterological flaws,</v>

42
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>got the upper hand and lead you into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

43
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Then to write out a detailed plan for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the attainment of your goals,</v>

44
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>your the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the realization of your vision,</v>

45
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.853

<v Speaker 1>good for you to undertake this </v>

46
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

47
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>and also why it would be good for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and the broader community,</v>

48
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>so to fully articulate a plan that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprise the contents of that day.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The second event on January 19th is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hosted by a Dutch organization.</v>

53
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:29.410

<v Speaker 1>Say Leo,</v>

54
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.753
<v Speaker 1>they've organized what they hope will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of a serious national </v>

55
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>conversation about Dutch and European </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity as well as immigration policy.</v>

56
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.063
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to begin the event which will </v>
<v Speaker 1>involve 2000 people and the number of </v>

57
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>well known speakers from a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds.</v>

58
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.503
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with a 45 minute discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the psychology of identity and </v>

59
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.020
<v Speaker 1>concentrate more specifically on on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

60
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Where are we in Europe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broadly speaking,</v>

61
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>how did we get here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have we done right and wrong?</v>

62
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.223
<v Speaker 1>Where are we going and why and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>should each of us conduct ourselves so </v>

63
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:06.724
<v Speaker 1>we get there.</v>

64
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.300
<v Speaker 1>How should each of us conduct ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that are stable and productive?</v>

65
00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Society state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable,</v>

66
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.533
<v Speaker 1>productive and free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't fall prey to the temptations </v>

67
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.560
<v Speaker 1>of radicalism either on the left or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

68
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I hope to initiate a process of deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought during this meeting,</v>

69
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.833
<v Speaker 1>the organizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're hoping to generate 25 </v>

70
00:04:28.371 --> 00:04:29.204
<v Speaker 1>recommendations as a consequence of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting for the future of Dutch and I </v>

71
