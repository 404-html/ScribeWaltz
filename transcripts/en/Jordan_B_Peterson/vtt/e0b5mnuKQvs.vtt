1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm talking to Jonathan Passagio </v>
<v Speaker 1>who I think is touched with more than a </v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.860
<v Speaker 1>little bit of genius and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebecois artists and a carver,</v>

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.910
<v Speaker 1>a sculptor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd like to start by letting </v>

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan tell us who he is and what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

6
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an icon carver,</v>

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 2>which means that I make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make carving for churches and for </v>

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.780
<v Speaker 2>people of traditional images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get commissions and I,</v>

9
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 2>and I work within a traditional language</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

10
00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Christian art.</v>

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing that for about five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years now,</v>

12
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:36.401
<v Speaker 2>full time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And before that I actually lived in </v>

13
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Africa for seven years working with </v>
<v Speaker 2>artisans.</v>

14
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to help them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.090
<v Speaker 2>in their business practices and their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their design skills.</v>

16
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 2>So I have a very kind of strange and </v>
<v Speaker 2>varied background.</v>

17
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:47.960
<v Speaker 2>I studied fine arts at Concordia </v>
<v Speaker 2>University here in Montreal.</v>

18
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.910
<v Speaker 2>In the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 2>in the late nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

20
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 2>full time icon carvers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you suppose there are in Canada and </v>

21
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 2>in Canada there the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only one we're about actually in</v>

22
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:03.641
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the entire world where we're very </v>

23
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:03.641
<v Speaker 2>few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually know most of them.</v>

24
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

25
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound like a very easy thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to monetize.</v>

26
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:12.531
<v Speaker 1>So how did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in the world did you go from being </v>

27
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:15.320
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an art student trained at Concordia to </v>

28
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>being a carver of icons?</v>

29
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.520
<v Speaker 2>I studied painting and drawing at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Concordia on the surface.</v>

30
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 2>I was doing really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually finished first in my,</v>

31
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 2>in my class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a malaise the whole time I</v>

32
00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:26.860
<v Speaker 2>was working there because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian.</v>

33
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:31.861
<v Speaker 2>I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up a Christian and I was trying </v>

34
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:32.560
<v Speaker 2>to figure out how that would connect to </v>
<v Speaker 2>my art practice.</v>

35
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I was,</v>

36
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:38.691
<v Speaker 2>I was looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out symbolic languages </v>

37
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 2>and in painting and trying to find ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about bigger,</v>

38
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 2>bigger questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical ideas in my paintings,</v>

39
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't have the language so I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really just groping around almost blind </v>

40
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

41
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of my time at Concordia,</v>

42
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.380
<v Speaker 2>the professor who was supervising me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

43
00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:56.170
<v Speaker 2>she basically said on the very last day </v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

44
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not,</v>

45
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.380
<v Speaker 2>this is not the place for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After that I,</v>

46
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 2>it kind of left me dangling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

47
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:04.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a questioning a lot of things.</v>

48
00:02:04.931 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 2>So what sort of education did you get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>concordia?</v>

49
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 2>All the fine arts programs now in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in I think pretty much almost 100 </v>

50
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.881
<v Speaker 2>percent are based on contemporary art </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices and so very few universities,</v>

51
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:23.581
<v Speaker 2>very few programs teach a technical </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills or teach you how to draw in a,</v>

52
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.040
<v Speaker 2>in a classical way so they actually not </v>
<v Speaker 2>really teaching anything.</v>

53
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.230
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to know exactly what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

54
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was ever since the 19 sixties</v>
<v Speaker 1>through speeding this idea in the art </v>

55
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.521
<v Speaker 1>world that technical skills and ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>just aren't that important and that the </v>

56
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 1>important thing is to find your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say your political voice,</v>

57
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:46.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's very strange to me that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>has occurred because it seems to me that</v>

58
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 1>before your voice is anything but a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an off color Croak,</v>

59
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to become a disciple of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline and an apprenticeship and </v>

60
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.390
<v Speaker 1>learn the tools and trades of craft and </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to be an artist because </v>

61
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a technical end to that.</v>

62
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really almost an image of the </v>

63
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.880
<v Speaker 2>world as it stands now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

64
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the purpose or the stated purpose of,</v>

65
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.610
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of modern efficient,</v>

66
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>postmodern art was to free the artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to break,</v>

67
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.830
<v Speaker 2>to break away all the things that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding the artist back in terms of </v>

68
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.220
<v Speaker 2>rules and in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

69
00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the way things were presented.</v>

70
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:27.391
<v Speaker 2>But when ended up happening is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there were no more legitimate </v>

71
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Speaker 2>legitimizing objective or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong legitimizing structures around </v>

72
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:36.211
<v Speaker 2>the art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing left was politics and </v>

73
00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 2>relationships and status basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our funders,</v>

74
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a big literature on creativity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's strongly,</v>

75
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>which I know very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My lab designed the creative achievement</v>

76
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:49.171
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire which is used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been used in hundreds of studies </v>

77
00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:52.111
<v Speaker 1>now to assess lifetime creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've spent a lot of time looking </v>

78
00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>at the measurement of creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also trying to understand creativity.</v>

79
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:59.611
<v Speaker 1>And the literature strongly suggest that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you impose restrictions on people,</v>

80
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>it actually makes them more creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than less.</v>

81
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Because part of what creativity is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcoming of obstacles.</v>

82
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine someone who writes poetry and </v>

83
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>the Haiku format,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

84
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

85
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>very restrictive and obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrarily sold,</v>

86
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.880
<v Speaker 1>but the fact of the restriction is </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly what makes the poetic form </v>

87
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing is true.</v>

88
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:23.990
<v Speaker 1>If you think about playing a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

89
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 1>there's far more things that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do when you play chess than there are </v>

90
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.481
<v Speaker 1>things that you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still an infinite number of </v>

91
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.901
<v Speaker 1>variations of chess games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this idea that there's a dichotomy </v>

92
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>between structure and rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity is,</v>

93
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>is pernicious Lee false and contradicted</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the evidence</v>

94
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.660
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start to explore the art world </v>

95
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.971
<v Speaker 2>and the way it works is there's an irony</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that it purports to not have </v>

96
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:52.530
<v Speaker 2>boundaries on creativity and structures </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Tina,</v>

97
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 2>but they're actually extremely strict </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're hidden.</v>

98
00:04:55.931 --> 00:05:00.931
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of this pernicious thing </v>

99
00:05:00.931 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 2>underneath where we're actually you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to present things in a very,</v>

100
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:07.531
<v Speaker 2>very precise way for it to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to enter into the legitimizing structure</v>

101
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the gallery,</v>

102
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.090
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

103
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like the message that I was trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work on.</v>

104
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

105
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.520
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

106
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 2>the structure of contemporary artists </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't fit together.</v>

107
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.390
<v Speaker 2>And so at some point I gave up on art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

108
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:19.560
<v Speaker 2>I had to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I had a studio and I closed it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just destroyed all my paintings.</v>

110
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually a moment of,</v>

111
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.530
<v Speaker 2>of kind of spiritual crisis for me.</v>

112
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.980
<v Speaker 2>And it's in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that moment that I discovered many </v>

113
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 2>medieval art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I discovered traditional Christian art.</v>

114
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 2>And when I discovered traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian art,</v>

115
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 2>it was exactly what you were saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

116
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.420
<v Speaker 2>the forms of Christian artwork kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed as a community would say as a,</v>

117
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.760
<v Speaker 2>the Christian community develop these </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms that were actually extremely </v>

118
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.660
<v Speaker 2>powerful and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

119
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 2>and created like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cosmic map basically.</v>

120
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.760
<v Speaker 2>And so you could use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could use these images as a type of </v>

121
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 2>Algebra to create a sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sacred language.</v>

122
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:59.880
<v Speaker 2>And so discovering that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

123
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

124
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:03.940
<v Speaker 2>it gave me so much possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

125
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 2>you're going back</v>

126
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.750
<v Speaker 1>like 800 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>900 years into the history,</v>

127
00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:12.751
<v Speaker 1>maybe even farther than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back into the history of traditional </v>

128
00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:15.991
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say you discovered Christian </v>

129
00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:17.080
<v Speaker 1>iconography and I also know that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

130
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.140
<v Speaker 1>you're an Orthodox Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a strange thing for a </v>

131
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.140
<v Speaker 1>quebecois.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know,</v>

132
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.950
<v Speaker 1>you're a pretty rare bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you could,</v>

133
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.270
<v Speaker 1>you could say a few words about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery of the iconography,</v>

134
00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:33.271
<v Speaker 1>how that came about and also how it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you converted to Orthodox </v>

135
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:33.271
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>

136
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those two things are very </v>

137
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.860
<v Speaker 2>intricately related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think during,</v>

138
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.720
<v Speaker 2>during university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a lot of people,</v>

139
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of got into an intellectual and </v>

140
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.100
<v Speaker 2>spiritual crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading data and,</v>

141
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.980
<v Speaker 2>and all the postmodern theorists trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to wrap my head around this,</v>

142
00:06:50.981 --> 00:06:52.600
<v Speaker 2>like what does this mean for me and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>

143
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 2>What is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

144
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's in that kind of crazy time that</v>

145
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.240
<v Speaker 2>I started reading the church fathers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

146
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.900
<v Speaker 2>and reading more traditional breeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more traditional authors,</v>

147
00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:06.880
<v Speaker 2>people who talk about traditions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

148
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.410
<v Speaker 2>different cultures and realizing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this was really the solution for,</v>

149
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.260
<v Speaker 2>for me at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a solution to kind of get out,</v>

150
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.580
<v Speaker 2>get out of the chaos that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

151
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.750
<v Speaker 2>that the modern world that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen into.</v>

152
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.580
<v Speaker 2>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it came with the art,</v>

153
00:07:21.581 --> 00:07:26.581
<v Speaker 2>so looking at the art and seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns emerge and seeing that those </v>

154
00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:30.991
<v Speaker 2>patterns in the art were the same as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>find in scripture and the same that you </v>

155
00:07:30.991 --> 00:07:33.790
<v Speaker 2>find in liturgy in the same that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>find in the stories that are around us,</v>

156
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.820
<v Speaker 2>even stories that aren't actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian to see those patterns emerge </v>

157
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.510
<v Speaker 2>is what really caught my attention.</v>

158
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.900
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

159
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:45.901
<v Speaker 2>and so I was looking at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't necessarily going to be </v>

160
00:07:45.901 --> 00:07:48.901
<v Speaker 2>Orthodox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see the patterns coming through </v>

161
00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:48.901
<v Speaker 2>and I was trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.610
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out and I couldn't find</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in my own meat,</v>

163
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.470
<v Speaker 2>which is which I grew up evangelical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

164
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.630
<v Speaker 2>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking for it,</v>

165
00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at Catholicism,</v>

166
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.300
<v Speaker 2>but finally I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt that I am looking at Orthodox.</v>

167
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I felt like Orthodoxy was the type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity that had preserved the most</v>

168
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.160
<v Speaker 2>of that ancient worldview and was still </v>
<v Speaker 2>living at today.</v>

169
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:10.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a living tradition.</v>

170
00:08:10.931 --> 00:08:11.380
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:08:11.381 --> 00:08:14.890
<v Speaker 2>when you say you went back 800 years in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a way that's true,</v>

172
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's not true for the Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they continue to perpetuate </v>

173
00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:22.300
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those forums until today.</v>

174
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that they didn't go through rocky </v>

175
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.981
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's been crazy for orthodoxy </v>

176
00:08:28.981 --> 00:08:29.260
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason they've been able to</v>

177
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 2>constantly revive their forums,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 2>and today it's a thriving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thriving part of Christianity.</v>

179
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 1>this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>

181
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.650
<v Speaker 1>of this return,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

182
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.160
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the continual revivification of </v>

183
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 1>traditional forms reminds me of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

184
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.560
<v Speaker 1>It reminds me of the old Egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about horace and Noah,</v>

185
00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:55.561
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus and Horus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptian God of vision and </v>

186
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:55.700
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's Egyptian,</v>

187
00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

188
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Falcon.</v>

189
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:03.350
<v Speaker 3>And after horace defeats Seth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's sort of Egyptian precursor to </v>

190
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:08.781
<v Speaker 3>Satan and reclaims his throne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes down into the underworld to </v>

191
00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 3>rescue his father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Cyrus,</v>

192
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who seth had chopped up into pieces.</v>

193
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's down in the underworld,</v>

194
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 3>he gives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

195
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 3>cyrus one of his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which seth has torn out.</v>

196
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:23.331
<v Speaker 3>He gives him one of his eyes and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>brings them back up to the surface and </v>

197
00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:27.141
<v Speaker 3>they rule Egypt together and the Union </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Osiris and Horus was like the </v>

198
00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Pharaoh's soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

199
00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:33.371
<v Speaker 3>there's this ancient idea and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressed in more places than in </v>

200
00:09:33.371 --> 00:09:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian mythology that it's the duty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the sacred obligation of someone </v>

201
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 3>who's awake to journey to the underworld</v>
<v Speaker 3>and revivified the corpse of his father.</v>

202
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 3>And that not unites the individual with </v>
<v Speaker 3>a living culture and also makes the </v>

203
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.571
<v Speaker 3>culture alive because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture in some sense because it's the </v>

204
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:53.901
<v Speaker 3>product of the dad is a dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a dead entity.</v>

205
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 3>It has to be continually revivified by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the living.</v>

206
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 3>And then you see that echoed in more </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern form,</v>

207
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 3>oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a Disney animated movie.</v>

208
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:08.211
<v Speaker 3>And Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Pinocchio is the story of the </v>

209
00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 3>struggle of a puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Marionette,</v>

210
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 3>whose strings are being pulled by forces</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he does not understand.</v>

211
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.370
<v Speaker 3>It's the story of his struggle towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuality and,</v>

212
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.640
<v Speaker 3>and rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a number of things happen to </v>

213
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to learn not to lie.</v>

214
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.320
<v Speaker 3>He asked to learn not to be a neurotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>victim because that's actually one of </v>

215
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.190
<v Speaker 3>the temptations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that it's,</v>

216
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.710
<v Speaker 3>it's his agreement that he's in neurotic</v>
<v Speaker 3>victim,</v>

217
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that places him on pleasure island,</v>

218
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:39.261
<v Speaker 3>where he virtually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he's in danger of becoming a </v>

219
00:10:39.261 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 3>jackass and a slave to totalitarians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interestingly enough,</v>

220
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 3>after he leaves pleasure island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes to find his father,</v>

221
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:49.761
<v Speaker 3>but he can't find him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a note from the Holy Ghost </v>

222
00:10:49.761 --> 00:10:51.150
<v Speaker 3>essentially tells them that his father </v>
<v Speaker 3>is at the bottom of the ocean,</v>

223
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 3>in the belly of a giant whale.</v>

224
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.340
<v Speaker 3>And the whale is also a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then Pinocchio has to go down to </v>

225
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.361
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of the ocean in his half </v>
<v Speaker 3>jackass form and rescue his father from </v>

226
00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:06.090
<v Speaker 3>the belly of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he does that by mastering fire.</v>

227
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.920
<v Speaker 3>And interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

228
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Pinocchio Video,</v>

229
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 3>he's assimilated to the Christian symbol</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the fish in the belly of the,</v>

230
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.900
<v Speaker 3>in the belly of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan,</v>

231
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:17.340
<v Speaker 3>no couches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of fish,</v>

232
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thinks to eat them in any couches,</v>

233
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:24.831
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio and confuses them with a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't realize that having caught </v>

234
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.820
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's caught his own salvation.</v>

235
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Then they work together to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whale's belly.</v>

236
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.670
<v Speaker 3>But there's this very old idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in chaotic times when </v>

237
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.691
<v Speaker 3>everyone's turned into a jackass and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tool of totalitarians that the way </v>

238
00:11:38.691 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 3>forward is to journey to the deepest </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible recesses of,</v>

239
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.440
<v Speaker 3>of reality and revivify the farther </v>
<v Speaker 3>something everyone needs to know.</v>

240
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:47.830
<v Speaker 3>And there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

241
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.060
<v Speaker 3>we'll see as our conversation continues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see how,</v>

242
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.380
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how for me at least this goes,</v>

243
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 3>is that for</v>

244
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.040
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back into the,</v>

245
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.680
<v Speaker 2>the Christian tradition and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

246
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.720
<v Speaker 2>and reconnecting with the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition has actually opened my eyes </v>

247
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.801
<v Speaker 2>also to the world around me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those patterns that I find in my </v>

248
00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:09.310
<v Speaker 2>own tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the patterns that are kind of feeding my</v>

249
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:13.330
<v Speaker 2>life once they're integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you look around you,</v>

250
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.270
<v Speaker 2>you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they appear everywhere.</v>

251
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 2>The world is actually made of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns and you can recognize,</v>

252
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
<v Speaker 2>you can recognize those patterns in </v>
<v Speaker 2>contemporary culture and you watch a </v>

253
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 2>movie and you can see that these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the same patterns,</v>

254
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's the best way is like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the danger is to,</v>

255
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:31.660
<v Speaker 2>is to do it in an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

256
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 2>in a simply in an intellectual way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

257
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:37.680
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of all our danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's connecting to a traditional,</v>

258
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming Orthodox and,</v>

259
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 2>and living it through liturgy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liturgy.</v>

260
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go to church and you </v>

261
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.400
<v Speaker 2>participate in the liturgy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're physically engaging in,</v>

262
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.120
<v Speaker 2>in the sacred patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

263
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a way to make it almost a bodily </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

264
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

265
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting,</v>

266
00:12:54.171 --> 00:12:54.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

267
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

268
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.490
<v Speaker 3>the Christian emphasis on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>resurrection of the body,</v>

269
00:12:58.491 --> 00:13:03.491
<v Speaker 3>which is of course something that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that modern people have very difficult </v>

270
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:03.491
<v Speaker 3>time with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

271
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.290
<v Speaker 3>people can perhaps swallowed the notion </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the soul is immortal,</v>

272
00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:10.220
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of the resurrection of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body is something that just seems beyond</v>

273
00:13:10.221 --> 00:13:11.620
<v Speaker 3>the Pale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's,</v>

274
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a logic to that insistence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the insistence is that there's something</v>

275
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:19.790
<v Speaker 3>sacred and necessary about the body and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it can't be forgotten,</v>

276
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

277
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:24.770
<v Speaker 3>when discussing both spiritual say on </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacred matters.</v>

278
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.850
<v Speaker 3>So it's definitely the loss of the body </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of what,</v>

279
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Speaker 3>what constitutes part of the rootless </v>
<v Speaker 3>nihilism that characterizes the modern </v>

280
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.920
<v Speaker 3>modern age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

281
00:13:36.921 --> 00:13:41.921
<v Speaker 3>learned that partly by reading Carl </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogers because one of the things that </v>

282
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:46.340
<v Speaker 3>Roger talked about was the necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young talked about this a lot as well.</v>

283
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.310
<v Speaker 3>The necessity of bringing the body into </v>
<v Speaker 3>alignment with,</v>

284
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.700
<v Speaker 3>with Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was more with the voice and he,</v>

285
00:13:52.701 --> 00:13:54.260
<v Speaker 3>he claimed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

286
00:13:54.261 --> 00:13:59.261
<v Speaker 3>that you could feel with your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially whether or not your words </v>

287
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:03.791
<v Speaker 3>were aligned properly with your being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And certainly I've certainly learned </v>

288
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Speaker 3>that that's true and that you can learn </v>
<v Speaker 3>to determine when your voice is making </v>

289
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.700
<v Speaker 3>you stronger physically and when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>making you weaker physically.</v>

290
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.970
<v Speaker 3>A very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very useful thing to pay attention to.</v>

291
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 3>One of the iconic figures that you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>carved and that you're interested in is </v>

292
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.021
<v Speaker 3>St George.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've been very interested in the </v>

293
00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:23.021
<v Speaker 3>figure of St George.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

294
00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:23.820
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

295
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:28.850
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story that's encapsulated in St </v>

296
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.320
<v Speaker 3>George is certainly one of the oldest </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories known to mankind.</v>

297
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:36.410
<v Speaker 3>It might be at the core of the oldest </v>
<v Speaker 3>story because basically what it does is </v>

298
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.550
<v Speaker 3>present human being the individual in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

299
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.760
<v Speaker 3>in a battle where the individual society</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the individual are being threatened </v>

300
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 3>by the reemergence emergence of are </v>
<v Speaker 3>carnivorous,</v>

301
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Reptilian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carnivorous Predator.</v>

302
00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.970
<v Speaker 3>And I think the roots of the Saint </v>
<v Speaker 3>George story go all the way back to the </v>

303
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.840
<v Speaker 3>time when the distant ancestors of human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

304
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 3>We're living in trees and being and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being preyed upon by predatory snakes.</v>

305
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's about $60 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back when there were dinosaurs.</v>

306
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:16.241
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an anthropologist named Lynn is bail at </v>

307
00:15:16.241 --> 00:15:16.241
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Ucla,</v>

308
00:15:16.241 --> 00:15:21.130
<v Speaker 3>has done a series of studies showing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the reason that human beings have </v>

309
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.401
<v Speaker 3>such amazing vision because we can see </v>
<v Speaker 3>better than any other animal except for </v>

310
00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:27.830
<v Speaker 3>birds of prey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because our vision evolved to help us</v>

311
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:32.831
<v Speaker 3>detect predatory snakes in particular as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they crept up on us through the </v>

312
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:38.021
<v Speaker 3>underbrush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she established that by noting that </v>

313
00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:42.131
<v Speaker 3>there was a powerful correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 3>the prevalence of predatory snake </v>

314
00:15:42.131 --> 00:15:46.931
<v Speaker 3>predation in primate populations across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and the acuity of primate </v>

315
00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:52.271
<v Speaker 3>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also the case that our vision </v>

316
00:15:52.271 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 3>evolved just as the story in genesis </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggests,</v>

317
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.990
<v Speaker 3>because of fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we see colors because we can </v>

318
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 3>detect to detect ripe fruit.</v>

319
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:05.140
<v Speaker 3>And so genesis insists that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 3>got their vision because of snakes and </v>

320
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:10.631
<v Speaker 3>fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that seems exactly right from an </v>

321
00:16:10.631 --> 00:16:12.521
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can imagine the idea in St </v>

322
00:16:12.521 --> 00:16:12.521
<v Speaker 3>George,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

323
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.720
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a dragon that reemerge is from,</v>

324
00:16:14.721 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a layer underground and it's a,</v>

325
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 3>it's an eternal dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Immortal Dragon.</v>

326
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.860
<v Speaker 3>And it threatens the community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And St George goes out to to fight the </v>

327
00:16:27.501 --> 00:16:30.470
<v Speaker 3>dragon in single combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a consequence,</v>

328
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:32.630
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he frees a virgin from,</v>

329
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:37.810
<v Speaker 3>from the snakes grasp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like Harry Potter does in the </v>

330
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.721
<v Speaker 3>Second Harry Potter volume when he goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>down underneath hogwarts to free Jenny,</v>

331
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:45.490
<v Speaker 3>who's the Virgin Virginia from the grips</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the basket lisc.</v>

332
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.280
<v Speaker 3>And the basket risk is the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>turns you to stone with a single glance.</v>

333
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.740
<v Speaker 3>And Harry Potter is revivified by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

334
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:56.741
<v Speaker 3>by the Phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His tears and the Phoenix produces a </v>

335
00:16:56.741 --> 00:16:56.741
<v Speaker 3>rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

336
00:16:56.741 --> 00:16:58.520
<v Speaker 3>Because this phoenix is a symbol of </v>
<v Speaker 3>death and rebirth.</v>

337
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 3>And so there's St George story is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is embedded right in the depths of of,</v>

338
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.190
<v Speaker 3>of the Harry Potter Story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's predicated on the idea </v>

339
00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.371
<v Speaker 3>that human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men in particular forever have been </v>

340
00:17:12.371 --> 00:17:15.830
<v Speaker 3>fighting off the predations of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural and the social world,</v>

341
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:21.310
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you free the virgin from </v>

342
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.560
<v Speaker 3>the grasp of the serpent is that women </v>
<v Speaker 3>have preferentially chosen to ally </v>

343
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:33.611
<v Speaker 3>themselves with and mate with men who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are capable of facing the Reptilian </v>

344
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.330
<v Speaker 3>Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's the basic evolutionary story</v>

345
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:43.331
<v Speaker 3>of mankind that human beings learn to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight back against predators maybe to </v>

346
00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:48.410
<v Speaker 3>even find them in their layer instead of</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting for them to attack.</v>

347
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.740
<v Speaker 3>And that women in their gratitude for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in their gratitude for the </v>

348
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:58.131
<v Speaker 3>protection of infants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's often images of Mary </v>

349
00:17:58.131 --> 00:17:58.131
<v Speaker 3>raising Christ</v>

350
00:17:58.131 --> 00:17:58.150
<v Speaker 4>up</v>

351
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.140
<v Speaker 3>out of the way from a predatory reptile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

352
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 3>And that's in reference to the genesis </v>
<v Speaker 3>comment that this,</v>

353
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.570
<v Speaker 3>that Mary will bruise the head of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>serpent with her heel.</v>

354
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.750
<v Speaker 3>It's an extraordinarily extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>deep story.</v>

355
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.840
<v Speaker 3>It goes deeper than just the idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>serpent too,</v>

356
00:18:13.841 --> 00:18:16.510
<v Speaker 3>because the ultimate serpent in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>

357
00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:18.580
<v Speaker 3>isn't the one that lives in the external</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

358
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.180
<v Speaker 3>The ultimate serpent might be the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's in the heart of your enemies.</v>

359
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Or if you make a metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation in your thinking,</v>

360
00:18:26.351 --> 00:18:31.351
<v Speaker 3>even beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate serpent isn't even the one </v>

361
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:33.370
<v Speaker 3>that lives in the heart of your enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not the natural snake or,</v>

362
00:18:33.371 --> 00:18:36.100
<v Speaker 3>or the crocodile or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a Predator like that.</v>

363
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:41.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not the vicious barbarian that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to the gates of your castle to </v>

364
00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.660
<v Speaker 3>steal your belongings and make off with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your women.</v>

365
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:49.110
<v Speaker 3>It's the snake that lives in your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why Christianity insists on </v>

366
00:18:49.871 --> 00:18:53.860
<v Speaker 3>the association between the snake in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>garden of Eden and Satan.</v>

367
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

368
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I think that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

369
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.500
<v Speaker 2>if you think of of the world in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

370
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

371
00:19:02.131 --> 00:19:04.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of macrocosm and microcosm,</v>

372
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.470
<v Speaker 2>the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

373
00:19:06.471 --> 00:19:11.471
<v Speaker 2>that certain structures repeat </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves at different levels of </v>

374
00:19:11.471 --> 00:19:11.850
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like music,</v>

375
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you,</v>

376
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:14.160
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

377
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 2>you can think of this idea of a world as</v>
<v Speaker 2>having in the middle,</v>

378
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tree or a cross or you know,</v>

379
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.440
<v Speaker 2>something like an access in the center </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as you move away from that access,</v>

380
00:19:27.481 --> 00:19:32.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the access which defines the space </v>

381
00:19:32.481 --> 00:19:32.850
<v Speaker 2>basically like a flag or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a post.</v>

382
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.120
<v Speaker 2>As you move away from that center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're moving further and further from </v>

383
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.130
<v Speaker 2>what it defines and you're approaching a</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

384
00:19:41.131 --> 00:19:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

385
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.740
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're approaching chaos,</v>

386
00:19:43.741 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 2>which is in the negative sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos,</v>

387
00:19:45.841 --> 00:19:47.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the positive sense.</v>

388
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 2>It's also potential.</v>

389
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.480
<v Speaker 2>It's the potential from which that world</v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

390
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:56.630
<v Speaker 2>will grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it on one side it threatens the </v>

391
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.630
<v Speaker 2>insight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

392
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.050
<v Speaker 2>And on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the potential by which that,</v>

393
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.180
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing will grow.</v>

394
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:05.181
<v Speaker 2>And so the dragon in the Virgin in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in St George's story there,</v>

395
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.200
<v Speaker 2>there are actually several versions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the of the dragon in some virgins and </v>

396
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.840
<v Speaker 2>the most known virgins sent a St George </v>
<v Speaker 2>will kill the dragon,</v>

397
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.140
<v Speaker 2>but there are lesser known versions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story where he actually tames the </v>

398
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.290
<v Speaker 2>dragon and the dragon into his pet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

399
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.380
<v Speaker 2>and there's versions where he tames it </v>
<v Speaker 2>then killed it.</v>

400
00:20:22.381 --> 00:20:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Like there's different versions of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

401
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's to show this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of as you move out,</v>

402
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.200
<v Speaker 2>sometimes there's something on the edge </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that appears on the edge and you </v>

403
00:20:33.571 --> 00:20:35.850
<v Speaker 2>can't define it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this chaotic thing.</v>

404
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:40.851
<v Speaker 2>It's the dragon in traditional way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent representing it isn't just a </v>

405
00:20:40.851 --> 00:20:40.920
<v Speaker 2>reptile.</v>

406
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.500
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a hybrid creature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

407
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.210
<v Speaker 2>it usually has a mix of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

408
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.830
<v Speaker 2>of Lizard and it has hairy feet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wings.</v>

409
00:20:46.831 --> 00:20:49.180
<v Speaker 2>And so it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this monster.</v>

410
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:54.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amalgamation of things to be </v>

411
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.410
<v Speaker 2>frightened by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also treasure because the dragon </v>

412
00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.260
<v Speaker 2>doesn't only guard virgins that guards </v>
<v Speaker 2>treasure,</v>

413
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:04.770
<v Speaker 2>it's in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in contact with what you fear and </v>

414
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:05.530
<v Speaker 2>despise that the treasure is to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>found.</v>

415
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know in your your notion about the </v>

416
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.781
<v Speaker 2>center point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say with the flag or the cross reminded </v>

417
00:21:12.781 --> 00:21:15.570
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reminded me of the way that children </v>

418
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.341
<v Speaker 2>react with their mother and their home </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what a child will do when he or </v>

419
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:22.651
<v Speaker 2>she is exploring the world is make </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact with the mother and that and </v>

420
00:21:22.651 --> 00:21:27.000
<v Speaker 2>that's in the center of the household so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can think about it as the mother </v>

421
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.000
<v Speaker 2>embedded in society.</v>

422
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.040
<v Speaker 2>The child will will comfort himself with</v>
<v Speaker 2>contact with the mother and then go out </v>

423
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.740
<v Speaker 2>into the world until the point where his</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear overcomes his exploratory tendency </v>

424
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:43.290
<v Speaker 2>and then on the on that edge he'll play </v>
<v Speaker 2>and further his psychological </v>

425
00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:48.751
<v Speaker 2>development and his mastery of the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when he wears out and maybe </v>

426
00:21:48.751 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 2>goes beyond his limit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he runs back to the center point for </v>

427
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.131
<v Speaker 2>comfort and then the next time he goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>out he can go out a little bit farther </v>

428
00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 2>and so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That structure basically.</v>

429
00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 2>That is basically the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

430
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

431
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:05.490
<v Speaker 2>it's structure of the society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a structure of a family and like </v>

432
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.581
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the structure of an </v>

433
00:22:08.581 --> 00:22:08.581
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

434
00:22:08.581 --> 00:22:09.340
<v Speaker 2>were on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the edges of our person.</v>

435
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.610
<v Speaker 2>We have these desires that exist on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>edge of our person and those desires are</v>

436
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.670
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

437
00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:20.770
<v Speaker 2>they can lead us into a lot of the mess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also,</v>

438
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the,</v>

439
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tool by which we further ourselves.</v>

440
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:30.230
<v Speaker 2>That's very similar again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to young's idea of the incorporation of </v>

441
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.170
<v Speaker 2>the shadow and also you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's idea of beyond good and evil.</v>

442
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean niche you meant by that at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>in part beyond the conceptions of good </v>

443
00:22:37.571 --> 00:22:41.500
<v Speaker 2>and evil that are basically thrown up by</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but cowardice,</v>

444
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you try to make yourself into this </v>

445
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.661
<v Speaker 2>little restricted thing that's basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>the union persona and you define </v>

446
00:22:48.661 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 2>yourself as good if you never go outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little box.</v>

447
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 2>But to be truly good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go way outside that box.</v>

448
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:55.660
<v Speaker 2>So if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take this as a,</v>

449
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 2>as a worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean basically that,</v>

450
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:02.730
<v Speaker 2>that has become my own worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps you to identify what's </v>

451
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:03.750
<v Speaker 2>happening around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the,</v>

452
00:23:03.751 --> 00:23:08.751
<v Speaker 2>on the periphery of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are these marginal things that </v>

453
00:23:08.981 --> 00:23:12.120
<v Speaker 2>exists kind of in the buffer between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

454
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 2>order and an absolute chaos and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

455
00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:17.100
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>

456
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they rear their heads up and sometimes,</v>

457
00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 2>and so we have to have a trend.</v>

458
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.610
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we transact with them in different ways,</v>

459
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.670
<v Speaker 2>sometimes tame them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you have to,</v>

460
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:29.980
<v Speaker 2>like a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to kill it.</v>

462
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you have to just ignore it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

463
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Like monsters just have to be left alone</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

464
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Like they're too big to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

465
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.530
<v Speaker 2>to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet you just leave them alone.</v>

466
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:43.710
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really related to what you're </v>

467
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.850
<v Speaker 2>going through right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like this is where we are right</v>

468
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:51.851
<v Speaker 2>now in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our obsession with liminal things right </v>

469
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 2>now in the world seems to be a sign of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

470
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word monster actually comes from the</v>

471
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Latin word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means to show,</v>

472
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.260
<v Speaker 2>right as a portent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We in French,</v>

473
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:05.770
<v Speaker 2>we actually still have the verb </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivate,</v>

474
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.310
<v Speaker 2>which means to show them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demonstrate in.</v>

475
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

476
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:10.220
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demonstrate.</v>

477
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the word a monster is,</v>

478
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.650
<v Speaker 2>is a portent of something.</v>

479
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:20.650
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a harbinger of change or </v>

480
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.500
<v Speaker 2>harbinger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something you need to pay </v>

481
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:24.500
<v Speaker 2>attention because something is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

482
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And so right now to demonstrate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrate is to de mon straight.</v>

483
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

484
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:35.321
<v Speaker 2>It's to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to take the monster apart and make </v>

485
00:24:35.321 --> 00:24:35.321
<v Speaker 2>it into something that's you can deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

486
00:24:35.321 --> 00:24:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you can master Marduk in the old </v>

487
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian myth because mark who's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian a hero,</v>

488
00:24:42.741 --> 00:24:47.741
<v Speaker 2>God confronts tire mount who's a monster</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cuts her into pieces and makes the </v>

489
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:53.111
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually one of the names of that </v>

490
00:24:53.111 --> 00:24:56.130
<v Speaker 2>the Mesopotamians had was he who makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting and useful things from the </v>

491
00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 2>combat with tire mount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

492
00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

493
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so right now we can you look around the,</v>

494
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:07.150
<v Speaker 2>if you think of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the social manifestations that are </v>

495
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:07.150
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just take zombies for example,</v>

496
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:11.060
<v Speaker 2>like that's the greatest example because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Zombie is an inbetween figure.</v>

497
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.550
<v Speaker 2>It's something that is neither dead nor </v>
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>

498
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:17.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it stands in between two categories.</v>

499
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.740
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

500
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.950
<v Speaker 2>in the case of the Zombie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Zombie,</v>

501
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.030
<v Speaker 2>because it is in between the categories </v>
<v Speaker 2>is act as a parasite.</v>

502
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.300
<v Speaker 2>It starts to eat the interior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brain actually.</v>

503
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

504
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:33.290
<v Speaker 2>It's looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

505
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.190
<v Speaker 2>for meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so he wants to eat the thing that's</v>

506
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.820
<v Speaker 2>inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's trying to devour it.</v>

507
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 2>So the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the story of,</v>

508
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:42.110
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

509
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:45.830
<v Speaker 2>of Oedipus and the Sphinx is the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of image of this.</v>

510
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.190
<v Speaker 2>So the Sphinx appears as this undefined </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster,</v>

511
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:54.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mix of a woman and a lion and a </v>

512
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:54.280
<v Speaker 2>bird or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this thing that appears.</v>

513
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:54.830
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it is,</v>

514
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's saying like,</v>

515
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.580
<v Speaker 2>what am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

516
00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.230
<v Speaker 2>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a question or it's an enigma.</v>

517
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 2>The person coming forward is faced with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this enigma and the danger.</v>

518
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:09.770
<v Speaker 2>So one possibility is that you name the </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster and you're able to integrate it.</v>

519
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.830
<v Speaker 2>The other possibility is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>eaten by the monster.</v>

520
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Those two things are a real reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>right on the edge,</v>

521
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:21.940
<v Speaker 2>on the edge of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you come to the edge of </v>

522
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:21.940
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

523
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:21.940
<v Speaker 2>you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

524
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.220
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this image,</v>

525
00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:27.221
<v Speaker 2>and traditional stories of the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come to the end of something and </v>

526
00:26:27.221 --> 00:26:28.280
<v Speaker 2>there's the bridge and on the bridge </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

527
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:33.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you have to face this monster </v>

528
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.510
<v Speaker 2>because when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're on the bridge,</v>

529
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:37.370
<v Speaker 2>you're in a dangerous place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your inbetween inbetween categories,</v>

530
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:38.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in no man's land,</v>

531
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.720
<v Speaker 2>you're in no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the monster comes and wants to </v>

532
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.710
<v Speaker 2>devour you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it can be either this idea of the,</v>

533
00:26:45.711 --> 00:26:48.090
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monster asking question,</v>

534
00:26:48.091 --> 00:26:51.240
<v Speaker 2>asking an enigma for you to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross the bridge.</v>

535
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so this is what's happening right </v>

536
00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:56.480
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

537
00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.261
<v Speaker 2>And so there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some elements that come from </v>

538
00:27:00.261 --> 00:27:01.890
<v Speaker 2>the margins of society which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard.</v>

539
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:06.970
<v Speaker 1>The ones that I've been dealing with or </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been the people who don't fit into </v>

540
00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:06.970
<v Speaker 1>the gender categories.</v>

541
00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

542
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.620
<v Speaker 2>And so that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a situation where we were </v>

543
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that manifestation of,</v>

544
00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.770
<v Speaker 2>of hybridity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

545
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Because because if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories that are used,</v>

546
00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:22.620
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are trying to be the category of </v>

547
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.471
<v Speaker 2>multiplicity itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're trying to be the </v>

548
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:25.471
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>

549
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:27.090
<v Speaker 1>That's why the categories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplying beyond name.</v>

550
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.650
<v Speaker 1>They started with just nonbinary and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up to 70 on online.</v>

551
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be what it is.</v>

552
00:27:33.241 --> 00:27:36.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a decomposition like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a decomposition of a category.</v>

553
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.380
<v Speaker 2>You come to the end of something and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to decompose.</v>

554
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I know in your talks you talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>role of the serpent eating its own tail.</v>

555
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my vision of it,</v>

556
00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:50.500
<v Speaker 2>is that when you first see that serpent </v>
<v Speaker 2>youth,</v>

557
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:55.730
<v Speaker 2>it actually looks like it's the tail </v>
<v Speaker 2>that eating the head and then after a </v>

558
00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:00.711
<v Speaker 2>certain transition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes the head eating the </v>

559
00:28:00.711 --> 00:28:04.041
<v Speaker 2>tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine the fruit falls on the </v>

560
00:28:04.041 --> 00:28:04.041
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground starts to eat it,</v>

561
00:28:04.041 --> 00:28:07.200
<v Speaker 2>it starts to decompose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and once it's fully decomposed,</v>

562
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.510
<v Speaker 2>then something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a flip,</v>

563
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.210
<v Speaker 2>and now the seed starts to use the earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eat the earth to,</v>

564
00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:18.060
<v Speaker 2>to become a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's that moment at the end of</v>

565
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.800
<v Speaker 2>something where there's a flip that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

566
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:22.800
<v Speaker 2>like an inversion and then an inversion </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an inversion that happens.</v>

567
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a very chaotic time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

568
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.720
<v Speaker 2>and that's the moment where we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

569
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 2>we are in right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you're going through,</v>

570
00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:30.860
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

571
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.920
<v Speaker 2>the finger that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've put your finger on something </v>

572
00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.661
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very critical and that's why there's so </v>

573
00:28:38.661 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 2>much noise about it is because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

574
00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:41.790
<v Speaker 2>you're standing right in that spot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pointing,</v>

575
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.700
<v Speaker 2>your telling everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to this monster.</v>

576
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.770
<v Speaker 2>It's right there in front of us.</v>

577
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.830
<v Speaker 1>You talked before with me about two to </v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical stories that shed some light on</v>

578
00:28:51.831 --> 00:28:56.831
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were talking about Abraham and </v>

579
00:28:56.831 --> 00:28:58.160
<v Speaker 1>the stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you could walk through that</v>

580
00:28:58.161 --> 00:29:01.010
<v Speaker 1>because I thought that was an extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting analysis.</v>

581
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

582
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:07.070
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that in the Bible and in most </v>

583
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:10.521
<v Speaker 2>traditional societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that you would deal with the </v>

584
00:29:10.521 --> 00:29:10.521
<v Speaker 2>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

585
00:29:10.521 --> 00:29:12.360
<v Speaker 2>The thing that comes from the margins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

586
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.300
<v Speaker 2>it's the stranger in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

587
00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:14.970
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

588
00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.710
<v Speaker 2>in a global way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this strange thing,</v>

589
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 2>the way we deal with that is through </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospitality,</v>

590
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first way we deal with it,</v>

591
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:28.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first way we deal with something </v>

592
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.931
<v Speaker 2>coming from the outside and that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>fit into our world is through </v>

593
00:29:29.931 --> 00:29:32.130
<v Speaker 2>hospitality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the hospitality,</v>

594
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:35.970
<v Speaker 2>hospitality means that you receive this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing as a,</v>

595
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:41.030
<v Speaker 2>as a stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's these implicit rules of how </v>

596
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.900
<v Speaker 2>you interact with them so that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a mutual destruction basically.</v>

597
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in the Bible we see those,</v>

598
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.030
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

599
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:53.070
<v Speaker 2>version of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of good hospitality and bad hospitality </v>

600
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 2>play themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the story of Abraham,</v>

601
00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Abraham receives a three strangers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he received them into his tent and he </v>

602
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:05.341
<v Speaker 2>feeds them and he gives them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he received them properly and the </v>

603
00:30:05.341 --> 00:30:07.780
<v Speaker 2>strangers are also acting properly in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his tent.</v>

604
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're eating his food,</v>

605
00:30:09.011 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 2>but they're being respectful of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

606
00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:16.111
<v Speaker 2>They're not stealing things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not trying to seduce his wife </v>

607
00:30:16.111 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 2>are doing the things that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to do implicitly when you're in</v>

608
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.310
<v Speaker 2>someone else's house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

609
00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.240
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of that,</v>

610
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.080
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

611
00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:27.520
<v Speaker 2>the three strangers announced to Abraham</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's going to have a child.</v>

612
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.600
<v Speaker 2>So Abraham is in his nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:30:29.601 --> 00:30:32.890
<v Speaker 2>you'd never thought they're angels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're secretly,</v>

614
00:30:32.891 --> 00:30:37.891
<v Speaker 2>but they're secretly angels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's important is that in the </v>

615
00:30:37.891 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 2>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strange,</v>

616
00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:42.850
<v Speaker 2>because the strange is an ambiguous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a category.</v>

617
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.940
<v Speaker 2>It can contain both extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can contain both the angel and the </v>

618
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:47.940
<v Speaker 2>devil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

619
00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:53.290
<v Speaker 2>These three angels come to come to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they announce that he's going to </v>

620
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.421
<v Speaker 2>have a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what they do is that the strange </v>

621
00:30:57.421 --> 00:30:58.330
<v Speaker 2>now access this potential that we talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

622
00:30:58.390 --> 00:30:58.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

623
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:03.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's a fruit defying agent in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case that an orderly structure has </v>

624
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:10.531
<v Speaker 2>to allow an element of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an element of the strange into it in </v>

625
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:15.601
<v Speaker 2>order to become something new and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>to maintain its own survival because </v>

626
00:31:15.601 --> 00:31:17.530
<v Speaker 2>things have to become something new as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they move forward through time,</v>

627
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in this,</v>

628
00:31:18.821 --> 00:31:21.240
<v Speaker 2>in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stranger becomes the,</v>

629
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:21.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

630
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:25.960
<v Speaker 2>the means by which Abraham's marriage </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

631
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.010
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is fucked up.</v>

632
00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:28.180
<v Speaker 2>So he grows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his family,</v>

633
00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:31.660
<v Speaker 2>grows through this bright interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a stranger,</v>

634
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:37.500
<v Speaker 2>so now these same three strangers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they go to a visit,</v>

635
00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Abraham's brother lot who's in Sodom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gomorrah,</v>

636
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.530
<v Speaker 2>and then although lot receives the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers appropriately,</v>

637
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.520
<v Speaker 2>the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to rape these strangers.</v>

638
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:55.550
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to sexually assault the </v>

639
00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.310
<v Speaker 2>strangers at end rape them and angels </v>
<v Speaker 2>blind the people around them and they're</v>

640
00:31:57.311 --> 00:32:02.311
<v Speaker 2>able to escape and because of the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction and the sexual,</v>

641
00:32:02.471 --> 00:32:05.290
<v Speaker 2>the sexual interaction with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

642
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.450
<v Speaker 2>between the stranger and the people of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the city.</v>

643
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:11.660
<v Speaker 2>If the city is destroyed by fire and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it leads even further it,</v>

644
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.820
<v Speaker 2>it leads to having an incestuous </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with his daughters.</v>

645
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.680
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like the whole world just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

646
00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:22.060
<v Speaker 2>it collapses because there isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper approach to,</v>

647
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.010
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hospitality and.</v>

648
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:24.610
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

649
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:27.880
<v Speaker 2>and in that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see how it's actually.</v>

650
00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:30.820
<v Speaker 2>So there's an intimation in there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if the,</v>

651
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.480
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the interaction with a stranger is </v>

652
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.090
<v Speaker 2>handled properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everything becomes more fruitful.</v>

653
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.210
<v Speaker 2>And if the interaction with a stranger </v>
<v Speaker 2>upsets things,</v>

654
00:32:40.211 --> 00:32:42.110
<v Speaker 2>say as basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as basic as,</v>

655
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:47.290
<v Speaker 2>as sexual interactions between people </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the entire society can become </v>

656
00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.680
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

657
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:49.820
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that ended,</v>

658
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:51.590
<v Speaker 2>and I'm using those two stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

659
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:56.770
<v Speaker 2>but those two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two stories repeat themselves in </v>

660
00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:56.770
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this.</v>

661
00:32:56.770 --> 00:33:00.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many stories where you see </v>

662
00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:00.611
<v Speaker 2>that often it's not just sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's often food.</v>

663
00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:05.590
<v Speaker 2>There's sex and food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two things that the two </v>

664
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 2>major ways in which we integrate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

665
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.400
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the story of Hansel and Gretel for </v>

666
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:11.400
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

667
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:11.400
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

668
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:15.550
<v Speaker 2>is a perfect example of where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the desire to eat the people that to eat</v>

669
00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:16.880
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

670
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.270
<v Speaker 2>your guests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

671
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Or for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mother in the Hansel and Gretel </v>

672
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 2>story because she's too good to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she's all compassion.</v>

673
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:28.490
<v Speaker 2>The witch and the Hansel and Gretel </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

674
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.480
<v Speaker 2>And you can tell that because she has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ginger,</v>

675
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.330
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has a gingerbread house.</v>

676
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 2>It's made of candy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

677
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.250
<v Speaker 2>And like a house made of candy is too </v>
<v Speaker 2>good to be true.</v>

678
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:42.430
<v Speaker 2>That's the social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 2>overemphasis on compassion and inside </v>

679
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:46.250
<v Speaker 2>she's just fattening the kids up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly taking care of them,</v>

680
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 2>but her fundamental wishes to devour </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

681
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like an example,</v>

682
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:52.960
<v Speaker 2>and then one more thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been abandoned.</v>

683
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Those kids who have been abandoned to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the predations of the evil mothers </v>

684
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.200
<v Speaker 2>because the family broke down like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

685
00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.100
<v Speaker 2>It's the stepmother who tells the </v>
<v Speaker 2>farther,</v>

686
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:07.190
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to abandoned the children in the forest.</v>

687
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the breakdown of the family that</v>

688
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:15.131
<v Speaker 2>leads to the children being threatened </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the eatable mother who's too good to </v>

689
00:34:15.131 --> 00:34:18.941
<v Speaker 2>be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's compassion that's gone completely </v>

690
00:34:18.941 --> 00:34:18.941
<v Speaker 2>beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

691
00:34:18.941 --> 00:34:19.000
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

692
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.910
<v Speaker 2>it's tolerable limit cautionary tale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

693
00:34:22.911 --> 00:34:25.030
<v Speaker 2>You see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that there's a story there.</v>

694
00:34:25.031 --> 00:34:27.190
<v Speaker 2>There's so many stories of how the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

695
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:30.290
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between the host and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stranger goes,</v>

696
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:33.260
<v Speaker 2>goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's an effort and sometimes the</v>

697
00:34:33.261 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 2>push comes from the host and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the push can come from the guests.</v>

698
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:42.821
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an Ethiopian tradition where </v>

699
00:34:42.821 --> 00:34:45.740
<v Speaker 2>it's almost an inversion of Abraham's </v>
<v Speaker 2>story were able where a man receives </v>

700
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:49.400
<v Speaker 2>three guests into his home and the three</v>
<v Speaker 2>guests serve him food,</v>

701
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:49.790
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

702
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.220
<v Speaker 2>which ends up being a human being.</v>

703
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.360
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>

704
00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:58.410
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of trick the host into </v>

705
00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:58.880
<v Speaker 2>becoming a cannibal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the host becomes like an out of</v>

706
00:34:58.881 --> 00:35:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Control Cannibal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

707
00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.100
<v Speaker 2>eating people all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see how the story can go both</v>

708
00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:04.960
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

709
00:35:04.961 --> 00:35:05.380
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

710
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship with the strange can.</v>

711
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.510
<v Speaker 2>There can be a push from the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the right hand.</v>

712
00:35:11.511 --> 00:35:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the order hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be a push towards,</v>

713
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

714
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.850
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that caused the cows.</v>

715
00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:21.851
<v Speaker 2>But it can also come from the guests can</v>
<v Speaker 2>also come from the stranger which can </v>

716
00:35:21.851 --> 00:35:24.560
<v Speaker 2>push from his side or from their side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then create the chaos.</v>
