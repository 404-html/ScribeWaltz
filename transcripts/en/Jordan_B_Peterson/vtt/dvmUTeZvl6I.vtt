00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Welcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Barbara.</v>

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm the president of blue matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>uft chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On behalf of my team,</v>

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>we thank you for deciding to spend your </v>
<v Speaker 1>night with us.</v>

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.083
<v Speaker 1>Our mission at the matter project has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been to provide the resources that we </v>

6
00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:21.734
<v Speaker 1>believe would be beneficial to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health of our fellow students at </v>

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.833
<v Speaker 1>u of c because a healthy mind is crucial</v>
<v Speaker 1>for success at this university and I </v>

8
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>think we all know that maintaining such </v>
<v Speaker 1>as fade is no easy task.</v>

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.493
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be asking you a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and I hope that you </v>

10
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>participate by simply raising your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the question applies to you,</v>

11
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.940
<v Speaker 1>how many of your currently undergraduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

12
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.873
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have had a radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>change in your core beliefs after </v>

13
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:50.684
<v Speaker 1>entering university?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have been reasonably </v>

14
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:56.960
<v Speaker 1>stressed out throughout your university </v>
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

15
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.043
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have wondered at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>once in your life what the point of it </v>

16
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>all is our confused about how you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the situation?</v>

17
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.283
<v Speaker 1>If most of these questions apply to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have at least I hope come to </v>

18
00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't apply to you personally,</v>

19
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:21.700
<v Speaker 1>get some coffee with you on me to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell you do what you do,</v>

20
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 1>just getting on Brooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so probably have to split the company.</v>

21
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.403
<v Speaker 1>The person who I have the honor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing tonight that I considered </v>

22
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>with significant influence on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I most likely on any of you who are also</v>

23
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>familiar with his work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't believe me,</v>

24
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.023
<v Speaker 1>you can check the rate my prospect site </v>
<v Speaker 1>or did you have some comments on these </v>

25
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:40.094
<v Speaker 1>lectures you said you you will see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words such as mind boggling and life </v>

26
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:44.944
<v Speaker 1>changing very frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was first introduced to him in the </v>

27
00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:53.290
<v Speaker 1>first TEDX UFC event back in 2015 when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in my first year of study at UFT.</v>

28
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.283
<v Speaker 1>He was the first speaker at Tedx and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>title of his talk was potential as a </v>

29
00:01:59.141 --> 00:01:59.974
<v Speaker 1>life science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As students just finished a series of </v>

30
00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 1>courses in biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry,</v>

31
00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:04.144
<v Speaker 1>and mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could immediately see that his </v>

32
00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>perspective on life was radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>different compared to the perspective of</v>

33
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.610
<v Speaker 1>other lecturers I had listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

34
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found it difficult to connect with the</v>

35
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:18.024
<v Speaker 1>content of his talk at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was nevertheless interested in </v>

36
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>his perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fast forward two years later,</v>

37
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.593
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't hear any talk even </v>

38
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>remotely similar to that are facing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tedx talk and I took a psychology course</v>

39
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:30.234
<v Speaker 1>called personality and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations without initially </v>

40
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:33.324
<v Speaker 1>knowing that he was taught by him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how fortunate I consider myself to have </v>

41
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>decided to take that course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This course,</v>

42
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>along with his other course called maps </v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning,</v>

43
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.173
<v Speaker 1>how far being among the select your </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses that I genuinely have enjoyed </v>

44
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.553
<v Speaker 1>trying to extent that I have watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>some victories over and over solely out </v>

45
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:50.394
<v Speaker 1>of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume by now you're have your </v>

46
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 1>constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the word?</v>

47
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.943
<v Speaker 1>Obsessed means?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our speaker tonight has a bachelor of </v>

48
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:58.014
<v Speaker 1>arts in political science and a bachelor</v>
<v Speaker 1>of arts in psychology from the </v>

49
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>University of Alberta.</v>

50
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>He received his phd in clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology from Mcgill University.</v>

51
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.763
<v Speaker 1>He taught at Harvard University as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant and an associate professor </v>

52
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:09.544
<v Speaker 1>from 1993 to 1998.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He then returned to Canada and took a </v>

53
00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:13.514
<v Speaker 1>tenured position at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto and has been teaching here ever </v>

54
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the author of maps of meaning,</v>

55
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>the architecture of belief as more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>96 published articles,</v>

56
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.963
<v Speaker 1>he stocks are sincere and eloquence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>presenting content of unfathomable </v>

57
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>depth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has attempted to present the forms of</v>

58
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:31.264
<v Speaker 1>untruth that we should both pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and not fall prey to in order </v>

59
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>to find truth and ultimately leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading a meaningful life.</v>

60
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As excited as I am.</v>

61
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>So we sent you to stock tonight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>without further ado,</v>

62
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>please join me in welcoming Dr Peterson.</v>

63
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

64
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was</v>

65
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.963
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that struck me</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking those questions is how many of </v>

66
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.880
<v Speaker 3>you have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

67
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 3>pretty stressed out by your university </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience and I killed them.</v>

68
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.473
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think,</v>

69
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 3>how many of you were second year </v>
<v Speaker 3>students?</v>

70
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many are third year?</v>

71
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.130
<v Speaker 3>First Year of their.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're too busy.</v>

72
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

73
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 3>that was the case when I was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>undergraduate.</v>

74
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.420
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed my undergraduate degree and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

75
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.103
<v Speaker 3>I went to a small place to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was just a community college in </v>

76
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:47.674
<v Speaker 3>northern Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was actually a huge advantage </v>

77
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:54.211
<v Speaker 3>because I had the small classes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big classes at 38 and the people who</v>

78
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.023
<v Speaker 3>were teaching there really liked to </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach and although they might not have </v>

79
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:04.951
<v Speaker 3>known as much as might conceivably be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were excellent teachers and they do</v>

80
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 3>a lot more than me and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficient and so I really liked that.</v>

81
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.073
<v Speaker 3>I learned a lot in the first year that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>did in my entire school career prior to </v>

82
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is partly to do with me and partly</v>

83
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:18.394
<v Speaker 3>to do with the schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when I went to the University </v>

84
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.383
<v Speaker 3>of Alberta I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was less enjoyable because it got </v>

85
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:27.540
<v Speaker 3>more formulaic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still have a good time.</v>

86
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say that I was stressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

87
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.380
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

88
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say I was probably less stressed</v>

89
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:38.220
<v Speaker 3>in the university that I was in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High school pays better and I think that</v>

90
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.063
<v Speaker 3>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was probably the case for </v>

91
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:46.020
<v Speaker 3>most of my peers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people I knew with the score,</v>

92
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.913
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things have changed since then and I </v>

93
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:56.600
<v Speaker 3>think</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of those changes put undue stress.</v>

94
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.283
<v Speaker 3>I mean the first is that your ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>access careers of certainty has </v>

95
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:07.034
<v Speaker 3>declined.</v>

96
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Like for those of you who want to become</v>
<v Speaker 3>a clinical psychologist for example,</v>

97
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 3>or who wants to go to medical school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insanely difficult.</v>

98
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.373
<v Speaker 3>It's no wonder you're stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My nephew tried to get into medical </v>

99
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:20.950
<v Speaker 3>school three years ago and I mean that </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>

100
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.960
<v Speaker 3>bright man I was watching him do those</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that online set of exercises that are</v>

101
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:27.854
<v Speaker 3>supposed to make you more intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>but the mosby and he was doing amazing </v>

102
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 3>exercise where you have to maneuver his </v>
<v Speaker 3>way through a maze as well.</v>

103
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.573
<v Speaker 3>It was rotating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're treating them and that guy could </v>

104
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:42.900
<v Speaker 3>do that just like in the standing still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really amazing.</v>

105
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 3>We had a four point zero average from </v>
<v Speaker 3>queens and he had.</v>

106
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 3>He was a like a really high level soccer</v>
<v Speaker 3>player and he was a,</v>

107
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 3>he's a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

108
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:51.434
<v Speaker 3>he's the sort of person you just hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>because not only are they good at </v>

109
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're actually great people</v>

110
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 3>and a medical school.</v>

111
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.153
<v Speaker 3>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had 99th percentile and he couldn't </v>

112
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 3>get into medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

113
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How stupid is that?</v>

114
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Because obviously that's a wasted </v>
<v Speaker 3>talent,</v>

115
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:13.274
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obviously a waste of talent and </v>

116
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.403
<v Speaker 3>it's a betrayal as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's because he hit the ball out of </v>

117
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:19.484
<v Speaker 3>the park on multiple dimensions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>still had to walk through three extra </v>

118
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 3>two extra years of hoops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He finally got into medical school,</v>

119
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:25.844
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he shouldn't be in a shoe in and by </v>

120
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.613
<v Speaker 3>getting into clinical psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is another one that I'm very </v>

121
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.500
<v Speaker 3>familiar with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

122
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.033
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a higher grade point </v>

123
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 3>average because otherwise you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have good gres.</v>

124
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably have to have great juniors,</v>

125
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:45.614
<v Speaker 3>but then what you have to do is you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to apply it everywhere because it's a </v>

126
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:49.300
<v Speaker 3>laundry.</v>

127
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.300
<v Speaker 3>So you have to apply to 30 place and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember that because it's a water and a</v>

128
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:57.884
<v Speaker 3>lot of these things are lot of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you do in the base rate of </v>

129
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 3>rejection is extremely high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's first of all,</v>

130
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:02.834
<v Speaker 3>don't beat yourself up about it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the base rate of rejection is </v>

131
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 3>really high and you'll get rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has nothing to do with you,</v>

132
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 3>the base rate taught and you really have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to learn that in life.</v>

133
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.213
<v Speaker 3>You know that the base rate of rejection</v>
<v Speaker 3>for most worthwhile things is like 95 </v>

134
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:22.031
<v Speaker 3>percent and it's hitting I think in many</v>
<v Speaker 3>situations it's getting the odds against</v>

135
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:25.064
<v Speaker 3>you or actually increased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's some other positive things </v>

136
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 3>about the way things are going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

137
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.453
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you have access to the forms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities that would have been </v>

138
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:33.794
<v Speaker 3>unimaginable to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of those are also wanting to </v>

139
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.860
<v Speaker 3>monetize.</v>

140
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an increasing problem,</v>

141
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:42.460
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're a creative person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

142
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.193
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been this ramp up and </v>

143
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Speaker 3>competition and it's partly because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain jobs,</v>

144
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:49.994
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are difficult to obtain law laws the </v>

145
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 3>same way and increasingly even having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>career as a lawyer is more risky than it</v>

146
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:56.574
<v Speaker 3>was say 20 years ago because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lies being nibbled to death by </v>

147
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.923
<v Speaker 3>technological transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course journalism that's out to </v>

148
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.250
<v Speaker 3>most creative enterprises are out </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he can't monetize.</v>

149
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 3>You guys also look forward to a job </v>
<v Speaker 3>career trajectory.</v>

150
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to be changing jobs </v>
<v Speaker 3>very often.</v>

151
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.750
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>recommend is get used to that it good at</v>

152
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.653
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been CP it used to doing </v>

153
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.313
<v Speaker 3>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ready to move at the drop of a hat </v>

154
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.343
<v Speaker 3>and keep your options open because a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of you in order to rush yourself up the </v>

155
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:29.814
<v Speaker 3>career ladder where to have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>partners and you're going to have to </v>

156
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 3>have options at hap.</v>

157
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.043
<v Speaker 3>And so whenever you're employed you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might want to be looking for other </v>

158
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:37.674
<v Speaker 3>opportunities that you can use as </v>
<v Speaker 3>bargaining chips so that you need to </v>

159
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.810
<v Speaker 3>transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

160
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.673
<v Speaker 3>cross it up or you can use that as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hammer to lap your employers on the </v>

161
00:09:45.161 --> 00:09:49.800
<v Speaker 3>heads way because you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be candy and tough and you know,</v>

162
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 3>the upper end rewards insanely odd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a lot higher,</v>

163
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.533
<v Speaker 3>harder to climb into that category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's part of the reason </v>

164
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:58.430
<v Speaker 3>that you're stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

165
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.273
<v Speaker 3>is that your future is more variable and</v>
<v Speaker 3>more uncertain than people's future was </v>

166
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 3>when I was in university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that would have been in,</v>

167
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.443
<v Speaker 3>in the early eighties and certainly much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more uncertain than people in the </v>

168
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.200
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People's,</v>

169
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.303
<v Speaker 3>the people in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their concern was that they were going </v>

170
00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:21.420
<v Speaker 3>to graduate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a job that would last the rest</v>

171
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 3>of their life that would pay well and </v>
<v Speaker 3>know and then they're concerned with how</v>

172
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:26.430
<v Speaker 3>oppressive that was going to be.</v>

173
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:27.853
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks pretty damn pathetic in </v>

174
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>retrospect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

175
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 3>but you guys don't have that worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're even with that.</v>

176
00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason I'm telling you,</v>

177
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.483
<v Speaker 3>because if your stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing you gotta do is figure </v>

178
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:41.904
<v Speaker 3>out how much of that to you and how much</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it is situation because it isn't </v>

179
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 3>necessarily going to make it less </v>
<v Speaker 3>stressful to know that it's situational,</v>

180
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 3>but at least you could dispense with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the guilt and self criticism.</v>

181
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.100
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

182
00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 3>in publishing just for scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>articles.</v>

183
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 3>If you want to publish in a journal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a one percent acceptance rate.</v>

184
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 3>So you have to assume that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get it a lot</v>

185
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.813
<v Speaker 3>and the best things you ever get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're trying to publish papers that </v>

186
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.123
<v Speaker 3>that paper really sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you do a lot of work on it and </v>

187
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.123
<v Speaker 3>maybe rewrite it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rewrite it completely and do a few more </v>

188
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 3>studies of the same sort and they will </v>
<v Speaker 3>tend to really send it out for review.</v>

189
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.933
<v Speaker 3>And that's like time for a party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of the things that you're </v>

190
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 3>going to do in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be like that.</v>

191
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 3>Like they're very low probability events</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there'll be able to gradually.</v>

192
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.103
<v Speaker 3>But they are so you need to know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise you will take </v>

193
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:38.004
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for that onto yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and normally taking responsibility is a </v>

194
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:42.504
<v Speaker 3>good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you want to take responsibility for </v>

195
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:47.020
<v Speaker 3>the things that you're responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

196
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.903
<v Speaker 3>parcel out external circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could they external work and so with </v>

197
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:54.154
<v Speaker 3>conscientious people and you know a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly large number of you are going to </v>

198
00:11:57.791 --> 00:11:59.520
<v Speaker 3>be above average and conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

199
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.363
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't have gotten to where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are because you're above average in </v>

200
00:12:02.391 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and above average in </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness.</v>

201
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.853
<v Speaker 3>Is it conscientious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People often feel guilty and also if </v>

202
00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:11.260
<v Speaker 3>they're not doing as well as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>expected,</v>

203
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:13.720
<v Speaker 3>they automatically assume that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something wrong with them.</v>

204
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Now that can be a useful adaptive style </v>
<v Speaker 3>because generally if things aren't going</v>

205
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:24.361
<v Speaker 3>your way the way it changed this to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change things that you can control,</v>

206
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're thinking it's situational,</v>

207
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:27.214
<v Speaker 3>there's not much you can do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so sometimes there's utility in </v>

208
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:33.670
<v Speaker 3>focusing in on your micro path said I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>all for that.</v>

209
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to take responsibility.</v>

210
00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:39.310
<v Speaker 3>But it's easy for conscientious people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to take excess responsibility.</v>

211
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:41.860
<v Speaker 3>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do very badly if they're unemployed</v>

212
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 3>and because they feel like losers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

213
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.903
<v Speaker 3>and then they attributed that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and that can easily go too </v>

214
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 3>far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing is,</v>

215
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have reason to be stressed.</v>

216
00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.653
<v Speaker 3>Now another thing that's happened is no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you might ask </v>

217
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:02.824
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it better to be a little a big fish </v>

218
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 3>in a little pond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little fish in a big pond.</v>

219
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.450
<v Speaker 3>And I would say generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better to be a big fish in a little</v>

220
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:12.910
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you guys made a mistake by coming to</v>

221
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 3>the University of Toronto on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>diminished.</v>

222
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.600
<v Speaker 3>And I saw this when I worked in schools </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the United States.</v>

223
00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.490
<v Speaker 3>It was quite interesting watching the </v>
<v Speaker 3>students there.</v>

224
00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:24.050
<v Speaker 3>So those were the Harvard students </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

225
00:13:24.051 --> 00:13:24.884
<v Speaker 3>the diabetic students have a reputation </v>
<v Speaker 3>for being arrogant and I think that's </v>

226
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:29.690
<v Speaker 3>more or less something that's carried </v>
<v Speaker 3>over from the time,</v>

227
00:13:29.691 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>schools we're really interested,</v>

228
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.480
<v Speaker 3>chronic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

229
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.280
<v Speaker 3>and it was mostly based on economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>factors and familial connections.</v>

230
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:38.910
<v Speaker 3>It's not like that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Saudi agreement.</v>

231
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:40.683
<v Speaker 3>The thing that was interesting about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard students is that they were the </v>

232
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:43.714
<v Speaker 3>top of the class wherever they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe they get the smartest people </v>

233
00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:49.150
<v Speaker 3>they knew and when they came to her and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

234
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.260
<v Speaker 3>they were in the middle for almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in the bottom for some things</v>

235
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:54.094
<v Speaker 3>and the days of being the smartest </v>
<v Speaker 3>person in the room were seriously over </v>

236
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.030
<v Speaker 3>and so it was really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.710
<v Speaker 3>but it was.</v>

238
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:00.543
<v Speaker 3>It was alluded to some degrees because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were now with the non </v>

239
00:14:03.211 --> 00:14:04.044
<v Speaker 3>representative sample of people and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're also with the non representative </v>

240
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:08.224
<v Speaker 3>sample of people and so average in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>high school is that's it's nothing if </v>

241
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:15.334
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking about it from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>actuarial perspective and a </v>

242
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:18.514
<v Speaker 3>probabilistic perspective than not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to be surprised about </v>

243
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.430
<v Speaker 3>and that's something else to keep in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

244
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.743
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the downside of course is that wherever </v>

245
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Speaker 3>you go in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what will happen is you keep quiet until</v>

246
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:31.054
<v Speaker 3>the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're competing with her approximately </v>

247
00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:32.874
<v Speaker 3>as good at things as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that that performance tension </v>

248
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:40.840
<v Speaker 3>that you feel is something that probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>will never go away.</v>

249
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully you'll end up playing games </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are fair where if you work hard and</v>

250
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.443
<v Speaker 3>you do a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll actually translated into </v>

251
00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:48.304
<v Speaker 3>success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I suspect that that's going to be </v>

252
00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:49.630
<v Speaker 3>the case.</v>

253
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 3>The majority of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because intelligence is a good predictor</v>

254
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:55.610
<v Speaker 3>of longterm outcome and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientious.</v>

255
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.350
<v Speaker 3>People who can do things are rare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really rare and one of the things you'll</v>

256
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 3>find in the workplace is that if you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do things and you're reliable and honest</v>

257
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:08.510
<v Speaker 3>and all those things and someone finally</v>
<v Speaker 3>notices that opened doors for you,</v>

258
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.353
<v Speaker 3>like math and that's something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially I would say especially </v>

259
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurial enterprises that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>functioning well.</v>

260
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:20.200
<v Speaker 3>It's something that's underplaying when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were described.</v>

261
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.373
<v Speaker 3>People who do a good job with things </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost always want to create </v>

262
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:26.910
<v Speaker 3>opportunities for other people who do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good job at things.</v>

263
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.950
<v Speaker 3>It's actually a part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a successful,</v>

264
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 3>one of the perks of being successful is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you get to mentor young people have</v>

265
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.523
<v Speaker 3>opportunity and possibility and help </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and that's rewarding in and of </v>

266
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

267
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:44.210
<v Speaker 3>And all the people I know who are high </v>
<v Speaker 3>performing people who are powerful,</v>

268
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.740
<v Speaker 3>they all love doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So know.</v>

269
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.673
<v Speaker 3>So there's places you're going to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are going to be relatively </v>

270
00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.060
<v Speaker 3>inviting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But having said all that,</v>

271
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.983
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of uncertainty in the </v>

272
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:56.114
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of technological </v>

273
00:15:56.841 --> 00:16:01.070
<v Speaker 3>transformation and it isn't obvious </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in the future.</v>

274
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.440
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of,</v>

275
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.210
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it's situational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

276
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.653
<v Speaker 3>the other thing that's happened to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree is that there's an undue amount </v>

277
00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:16.571
<v Speaker 3>of emphasis placed on let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grades as the criteria that we'll select</v>

278
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:18.644
<v Speaker 3>you for the next level of attainment </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think it starts to become a </v>

279
00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:25.520
<v Speaker 3>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think people purely on the basis of</v>

280
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you're above about say a,</v>

281
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:29.660
<v Speaker 3>b plus or a minus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

282
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:30.523
<v Speaker 3>because people start to gerrymander </v>
<v Speaker 3>their education so that they increase </v>

283
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 3>the probability that it'll get straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>a's.</v>

284
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.093
<v Speaker 3>And so they don't take the courses that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are interested in a course to still get </v>

285
00:16:39.381 --> 00:16:40.214
<v Speaker 3>a's in logically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they twist and untangle their </v>

286
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 3>interaction with the educational system </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that they get the output,</v>

287
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 3>the system demands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's really not good.</v>

288
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think an optimal level academic record</v>

289
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.773
<v Speaker 3>is actually one where there's a fair bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>of high attainment with some outliers </v>

290
00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.573
<v Speaker 3>now because it kind of indicates that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not obsessively focused on your </v>

291
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:07.280
<v Speaker 3>grades because you shouldn't be on </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitively focused on them.</v>

292
00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:08.114
<v Speaker 3>You should be focused on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also maybe that you're willing to </v>

293
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:10.754
<v Speaker 3>take the chance to step outside of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>domain of comfort in hope of getting </v>

294
00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:17.180
<v Speaker 3>educated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course that isn't how it is.</v>

295
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.190
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're also stuck with that.</v>

296
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.220
<v Speaker 3>So I'm from a practical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

297
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:26.054
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I've done that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys could probably take advantage </v>

298
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:29.054
<v Speaker 3>of if you wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be interested for a long time on </v>

299
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:37.930
<v Speaker 3>what interventions might help people </v>
<v Speaker 3>obtain the awkward in motivation to move</v>

300
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:42.440
<v Speaker 3>forward and the minimum of uncertainty </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stress.</v>

301
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.273
<v Speaker 3>And I could tell you some things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can engage in that are going to </v>

302
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to help optimize,</v>

303
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 3>you're going to help optimize your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's some exercises you can do.</v>

304
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 3>This exercise called the future </v>
<v Speaker 3>authoring program,</v>

305
00:17:57.901 --> 00:17:58.734
<v Speaker 3>which is online at [inaudible] dot com </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've used that now with thousands </v>

306
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 3>of university students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly in Europe,</v>

307
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.760
<v Speaker 3>but we also just random Mohawk college </v>
<v Speaker 3>intro students at Mohawk college through</v>

308
00:18:09.761 --> 00:18:10.594
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it raises their grade point average </v>

309
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 3>25 percent drop out rate by about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

310
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.630
<v Speaker 3>And so what the future authoring program</v>
<v Speaker 3>does is help you.</v>

311
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.453
<v Speaker 3>It fills a niche in your education that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is pathologically underfilled for </v>

312
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:26.940
<v Speaker 3>reasons that I can't really quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehend,</v>

313
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:31.260
<v Speaker 3>but I've looked into to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

314
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.750
<v Speaker 3>and it's really the purpose of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanities,</v>

315
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.210
<v Speaker 3>which is I think in many ways speak for </v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

316
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.370
<v Speaker 3>The issue is who the hell are you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you would go,</v>

317
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.243
<v Speaker 3>where are you going?</v>

318
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 3>And then the subsidiary issues are why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you doing that?</v>

319
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.910
<v Speaker 3>And those are not optional us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're philosophical questions but</v>

320
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:50.874
<v Speaker 3>true philosophical questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not decoration on the business </v>

321
00:18:54.211 --> 00:18:55.044
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are the most fundamental possible </v>

322
00:18:57.661 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 3>issues that you can grapple with and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't grapple with them property,</v>

323
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.213
<v Speaker 3>you'll get flattened because you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 3>wheat and wheat means you won't be able </v>

324
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.290
<v Speaker 3>to express without falling apart and </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is full and stress.</v>

325
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.303
<v Speaker 3>And so if you can't tolerate it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll fall apart and that's just not </v>

326
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:15.240
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

327
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:16.074
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of what you need to figure out is </v>

328
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:17.934
<v Speaker 3>what makes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>condition optimally in some sense for </v>

329
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:23.784
<v Speaker 3>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just that because it's also </v>

330
00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:25.734
<v Speaker 3>cooperation,</v>

331
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.230
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

332
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.480
<v Speaker 3>you need both of those metaphors in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to,</v>

333
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:36.570
<v Speaker 3>to consider the situation properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The future authoring program asks</v>

334
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.693
<v Speaker 2>people</v>

335
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.520
<v Speaker 3>to formulate a vision of themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 3>formulate an ideal for themselves.</v>

336
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.413
<v Speaker 3>And it's not a Nietzschean kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>formulation under the things that need </v>

337
00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:49.134
<v Speaker 3>to discuss when he was describing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse of values first in western </v>

338
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:55.980
<v Speaker 3>civilization and then maybe around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

339
00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:57.730
<v Speaker 3>the classic traditional balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as that,</v>

340
00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.050
<v Speaker 3>people would have to create their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>values as a replacement,</v>

341
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.610
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

342
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.783
<v Speaker 3>it's too good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an erroneous demand in some sense </v>

343
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:08.010
<v Speaker 3>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't create.</v>

344
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.490
<v Speaker 3>You're smart enough and you don't live </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

345
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.330
<v Speaker 3>You have to rely on your culture</v>
<v Speaker 3>and second,</v>

346
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 3>you just can't create your own values </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't cost yourself around.</v>

347
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.590
<v Speaker 3>You are a certain way who have certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>interests.</v>

348
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.433
<v Speaker 3>You had what prophylaxis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have certain inadequacies and </v>

349
00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:25.734
<v Speaker 3>weaknesses that may be very tightly </v>
<v Speaker 3>aligned with your strengths is </v>

350
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.753
<v Speaker 3>complicated and so basically what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do is discovered in some sense </v>

351
00:20:34.681 --> 00:20:38.760
<v Speaker 3>what your values are and aligning </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself with the property.</v>

352
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 3>And so the future authoring program does</v>
<v Speaker 3>that basically asks you to envision.</v>

353
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.663
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing I've observed about people is </v>

354
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.080
<v Speaker 3>that part of the reason people don't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they want to do that and you're not</v>

355
00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:56.800
<v Speaker 3>going to get something with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure,</v>

356
00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:02.340
<v Speaker 3>and the more precisely targeted your </v>
<v Speaker 3>vision is and more clearly laid out what</v>

357
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:05.764
<v Speaker 3>you want is the higher the probability </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to get it and it's </v>

358
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 3>partly because you'll be moving ahead </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an organized and crystalline entity</v>

359
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.493
<v Speaker 3>and you'll be basically moving through </v>
<v Speaker 3>much because other people are much less </v>

360
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:18.574
<v Speaker 3>concerned about stopping you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you are concerned about going </v>

361
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:21.244
<v Speaker 3>forward and so things will move away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from you and they do that quite </v>

362
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:26.200
<v Speaker 3>dramatically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's.</v>

363
00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.073
<v Speaker 3>It's a nontrivial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nontrivial utility to get your act </v>

364
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point yourself in the proper direction.</v>

365
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 3>The question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

366
00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 3>how do you do that?</v>

367
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 3>And I've tried to think about that from </v>
<v Speaker 3>a practical perspective.</v>

368
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:42.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean the first thing is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you want,</v>

369
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:44.283
<v Speaker 3>and that doesn't mean it actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean what you want because when </v>

370
00:21:47.081 --> 00:21:47.914
<v Speaker 3>people think that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're in the theory of the </v>

371
00:21:50.131 --> 00:21:50.964
<v Speaker 3>stick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tend to think about that in terms </v>

372
00:21:52.421 --> 00:21:53.430
<v Speaker 3>of acquisition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

373
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.303
<v Speaker 3>what do you want for Christmas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's it's understandable and it's </v>

374
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:01.300
<v Speaker 3>not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just second rate.</v>

375
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.240
<v Speaker 3>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't as good as it could be and it's</v>

376
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:06.370
<v Speaker 3>not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really what you should be thinking about</v>

377
00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:07.204
<v Speaker 3>is what sort of character you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have and the reason we want to think </v>

378
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:14.311
<v Speaker 3>about that is because your character is </v>
<v Speaker 3>your motive force forward and your armor</v>

379
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.103
<v Speaker 3>and if it's not well developed then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're weak and you're going to get run </v>

380
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:21.814
<v Speaker 3>over and so you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The primary purpose of education is the </v>

381
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:28.930
<v Speaker 3>development of character and it's not.</v>

382
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not the sort of you should be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this if you're a good person.</v>

383
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not prescriptive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not if it's not.</v>

384
00:22:35.471 --> 00:22:37.300
<v Speaker 3>If it's deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

385
00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.893
<v Speaker 3>it's what are what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what under what conditions would you be </v>

386
00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:42.604
<v Speaker 3>willing to be satisfied with your life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a very important question </v>

387
00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:47.284
<v Speaker 3>because it's not that easy to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>satisfied with your life and this is </v>

388
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.663
<v Speaker 3>partly where our education system leaves</v>
<v Speaker 3>people terribly astray because you know </v>

389
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.343
<v Speaker 3>the bone headed noise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about being happy and that is </v>

390
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:03.931
<v Speaker 3>not good because life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

391
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.890
<v Speaker 3>And then having established that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

392
00:23:08.891 --> 00:23:09.671
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

393
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:10.650
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

394
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.493
<v Speaker 3>That's why things are like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you can start thinking about what </v>

395
00:23:13.631 --> 00:23:14.464
<v Speaker 3>you might do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you start from the earliest </v>

396
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.980
<v Speaker 3>presupposition that the default </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition of human experiences,</v>

397
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.823
<v Speaker 3>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just done from the start because </v>

398
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:23.764
<v Speaker 3>every time you're unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to think you're not going </v>

399
00:23:25.161 --> 00:23:28.060
<v Speaker 3>to conclude that you're inadequate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're not inadequate.</v>

400
00:23:28.061 --> 00:23:29.320
<v Speaker 3>That's just how it is.</v>

401
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.170
<v Speaker 3>The question is how do you deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and so we'll just say,</v>

402
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:36.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're destined to suffer.</v>

403
00:23:36.421 --> 00:23:37.254
<v Speaker 3>You destined to lose your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're destined to be unhappy in your </v>

404
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 3>career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least from time to time.</v>

405
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:42.184
<v Speaker 3>You're destined to fight with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>closest intimate friends and perhaps to </v>

406
00:23:44.771 --> 00:23:45.604
<v Speaker 3>be divorced and have sick children and </v>
<v Speaker 3>could develop some sort of horrible </v>

407
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:48.884
<v Speaker 3>disease yourself and like there's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of things coming forward at you and </v>

408
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Lauren have you are experienced those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

409
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.230
<v Speaker 3>So like giving all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't people are.</v>

410
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.810
<v Speaker 3>This was just hopeless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing new about it,</v>

411
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:02.703
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is is that isn't going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to help and it's also gonna make it </v>

412
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:05.624
<v Speaker 3>worse and that's just the beginnings of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem because if you take that </v>

413
00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:08.834
<v Speaker 3>attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only does it not help and make it </v>

414
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:11.474
<v Speaker 3>worse for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will then turn and naked way worse </v>

415
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 3>for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's just a nonstarter.</v>

416
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.250
<v Speaker 3>You don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's inappropriate.</v>

417
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 3>It's novelistic technically</v>

418
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.533
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

419
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.620
<v Speaker 3>nihilism leads directly to have as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as I can tell,</v>

420
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.700
<v Speaker 3>and I mean that metaphysically and </v>
<v Speaker 3>technically so because not always is one</v>

421
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 3>of the root causes of terrible social </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychopathology and societies can get so</v>

422
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:40.670
<v Speaker 3>far out of whack that they can do things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are absolutely unimaginable and you</v>

423
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.760
<v Speaker 3>probably don't want to be part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you do well then you should think</v>

424
00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:46.934
<v Speaker 3>hard about exactly what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's something about it </v>

425
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.000
<v Speaker 3>that's corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

426
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.833
<v Speaker 3>So forget about the nanoscale issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other thing that you shouldn't </v>

427
00:24:56.091 --> 00:24:56.924
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is another place where I think </v>

428
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.203
<v Speaker 3>our education system fails you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you should not learn to parent </v>

429
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.190
<v Speaker 3>ideologies and almost everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>students are taught as far as I can tell</v>

430
00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:08.024
<v Speaker 3>now in the humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is basically the paradigm of both the </v>

431
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:15.320
<v Speaker 3>head of the chiefs and there's ways of </v>
<v Speaker 3>identifying ideologies.</v>

432
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 3>And one of them is it's always someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else's fault that's one of the hallmarks</v>

433
00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:20.504
<v Speaker 3>or it's society's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other hallmark is everything </v>

434
00:25:23.511 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 3>that's complex can be explained by one </v>
<v Speaker 3>principal because that's wrong.</v>

435
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Speaker 3>It's just no one's sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything stuff.</v>

436
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:32.803
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're looking at the card </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't working and all you know is that </v>

437
00:25:37.211 --> 00:25:40.380
<v Speaker 3>the fan belt might be loose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so no matter what the car is doing,</v>

438
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:41.940
<v Speaker 3>the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the fan belts,</v>

439
00:25:41.941 --> 00:25:42.411
<v Speaker 3>loops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

440
00:25:42.411 --> 00:25:44.030
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to fix the van,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the car,</v>

441
00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes there's other things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are wrong.</v>

442
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.910
<v Speaker 3>So any alarms over simplify and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

443
00:25:49.911 --> 00:25:53.300
<v Speaker 3>very rigid and they're also resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so.</v>

444
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Speaker 3>And that's in some sense that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>easiest alternative denialism right?</v>

445
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:59.440
<v Speaker 3>Because it's false certainty and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

446
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.293
<v Speaker 3>it's rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the breakable and also takes you in </v>

447
00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:05.500
<v Speaker 3>a terrible direction because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>rigidly,</v>

448
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.070
<v Speaker 3>if you originally identified with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>radiology,</v>

449
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.070
<v Speaker 3>anyone who challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's instantly your enemy</v>

450
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.563
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

451
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.410
<v Speaker 3>what you want to do with your enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not pleasant.</v>

452
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.070
<v Speaker 3>So that's also not a very good route to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take if you're,</v>

453
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.820
<v Speaker 3>if you grab not end up in an absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible place.</v>

454
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you think,</v>

455
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:28.363
<v Speaker 3>well what are the alternatives to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets hard because </v>

456
00:26:30.261 --> 00:26:31.094
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it doesn't like there is much </v>
<v Speaker 3>of an alternative and it's like things </v>

457
00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:34.904
<v Speaker 3>are pointless obviously because look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the suffering and the shortness of </v>

458
00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:41.180
<v Speaker 3>life and all of that and nothing's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really turned.</v>

459
00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:42.014
<v Speaker 3>So you have to take refuge in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>arbitrary set of rules and concepts and </v>

460
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:49.050
<v Speaker 3>you know like postmodern relativism </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>

461
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:51.020
<v Speaker 3>That's basically it's completion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

462
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 3>mind system and other system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really matter.</v>

463
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 3>They're all predicated on power girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically arbitrary.</v>

464
00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.780
<v Speaker 3>And so there is nothing else there </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not right.</v>

465
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 3>It's seriously not running and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be taught to people.</v>

466
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.740
<v Speaker 3>I really think that's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it hurts people's mental health.</v>

467
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.350
<v Speaker 3>And actually I actually think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the point,</v>

468
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.053
<v Speaker 3>so because malevolence is a motivator </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so his resentment and not everyone </v>

469
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.513
<v Speaker 3>is trying to make things better and lots</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people would rather have the misery </v>

470
00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:22.050
<v Speaker 3>shared that hasn't disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

471
00:27:22.051 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 3>So then let's say potentially there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle road and what is that?</v>

472
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some of it's empirical,</v>

473
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.150
<v Speaker 3>like there's this idea in behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy of,</v>

474
00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.243
<v Speaker 3>of collaborative empiricism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And basically what happens is a person </v>

475
00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.413
<v Speaker 3>comes into therapy and they say things </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't going the way I would like them </v>

476
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:42.894
<v Speaker 3>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically means I can't bear the </v>

477
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:45.204
<v Speaker 3>tragedy of my own life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's basically what that statement </v>

478
00:27:46.951 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 3>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the therapist says,</v>

479
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well fair enough.</v>

480
00:27:51.031 --> 00:27:51.864
<v Speaker 3>That's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're willing to change obviously </v>

481
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:55.200
<v Speaker 3>because here you are.</v>

482
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.690
<v Speaker 3>How should you change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is,</v>

483
00:27:57.691 --> 00:27:58.680
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know.</v>

484
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.293
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing to do is find out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you go and then maybe ask the person </v>

485
00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:04.944
<v Speaker 3>to watch their life for a the while and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see when things are going well and see </v>

486
00:28:08.011 --> 00:28:10.230
<v Speaker 3>when things are not going well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

487
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 3>that's not the same thing as creating </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own values,</v>

488
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's more a process of observation.</v>

489
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.273
<v Speaker 3>And so like I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed some exercises like this that </v>

490
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.720
<v Speaker 3>can be ridiculously powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them is,</v>

491
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.233
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch when you're miserable and see if </v>

492
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:27.330
<v Speaker 3>you can figure out why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly,</v>

493
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.540
<v Speaker 3>notice when you're not miserable and see</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could figure out why.</v>

494
00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:31.374
<v Speaker 3>Because at least in part what that </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicates is that you're in the right </v>

495
00:28:34.441 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 3>place at the right time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

496
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:40.320
<v Speaker 3>Then that's when you shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now where do you should be?</v>

497
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.820
<v Speaker 3>It's partly in time and partly in space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

498
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:43.703
<v Speaker 3>Because things progressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're always trying to locate </v>

499
00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 3>yourself in prime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new space.</v>

500
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:50.910
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm in your nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 3>reports that all systems are go,</v>

501
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:52.700
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's a hit.</v>

502
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:53.341
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

503
00:28:53.341 --> 00:28:54.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing something right now.</v>

504
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:56.460
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to be working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

505
00:28:56.461 --> 00:28:59.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an a mississippian hint,</v>

506
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.610
<v Speaker 3>but it's a start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

507
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.500
<v Speaker 3>So then one thing you can think of is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

508
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.250
<v Speaker 3>let's see if I can figure out what those</v>
<v Speaker 3>places where I shouldn't be looked like.</v>

509
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Speaker 3>And then let's see if I can start making</v>
<v Speaker 3>those places bigger and you know,</v>

510
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:14.520
<v Speaker 3>if you could make them one percent a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

511
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.383
<v Speaker 3>if you do that for three years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they hold from maybe two </v>

512
00:29:17.431 --> 00:29:18.264
<v Speaker 3>percent or five percent of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience to 85 percent of your </v>

513
00:29:20.491 --> 00:29:22.860
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really useful.</v>

514
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.470
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that means humility,</v>

515
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually a classical virtue.</v>

516
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:28.463
<v Speaker 3>Humility means you don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell you're doing and you better pay </v>

517
00:29:31.381 --> 00:29:32.214
<v Speaker 3>attention because you might learn </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and then you're training </v>

518
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.150
<v Speaker 3>ignorant even with regards to yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>

519
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.073
<v Speaker 3>But it also means that you treat </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself with a certain respect because </v>

520
00:29:40.021 --> 00:29:40.854
<v Speaker 3>it means all of a sudden that know the </v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomy of your own experience has a </v>

521
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:47.890
<v Speaker 3>real reality and it's an observable </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

522
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.180
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

523
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 3>people talk about this sometimes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of the flow,</v>

524
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.773
<v Speaker 3>which is not a bad concept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically what it means is that you </v>

525
00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:59.440
<v Speaker 3>could find yourself engaged in business </v>
<v Speaker 3>in life.</v>

526
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.540
<v Speaker 3>It didn't matter that sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful.</v>

527
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:03.930
<v Speaker 3>So the fact that life is tragic at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>

528
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:07.480
<v Speaker 3>that's not matter or maybe even better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's acceptable.</v>

529
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.223
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might see this when you have </v>

530
00:30:09.761 --> 00:30:11.380
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're lucky,</v>

531
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.603
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences where people get close to </v>

532
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:15.844
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

533
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Children exposed the tragedy of life </v>
<v Speaker 3>like nothing else,</v>

534
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.860
<v Speaker 3>but if your relationship with them is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it shouldn't be,</v>

535
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

536
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:29.650
<v Speaker 3>that they're terribly vulnerable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so worth it,</v>

537
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.620
<v Speaker 3>and that's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you want.</v>

538
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.573
<v Speaker 3>You want to see your terribly vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so is everyone you love and so it </v>

539
00:30:37.351 --> 00:30:42.351
<v Speaker 3>was everything that you have around you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a way of comporting yourself</v>

540
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.600
<v Speaker 3>that makes that worthwhile and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're after.</v>

541
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.733
<v Speaker 3>And I would say that's actually the goal</v>
<v Speaker 3>of any genuine religious practice </v>

542
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.683
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason I'm I'm using the </v>

543
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:55.054
<v Speaker 3>religious example is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something is truly religious </v>

544
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:01.204
<v Speaker 3>significance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it means is that it deals with the </v>

545
00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:05.950
<v Speaker 3>deepest elements of human existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By definition,</v>

546
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:09.070
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it isn't that it's not,</v>

547
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 3>it's not in the category of religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience or knowledge.</v>

548
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:17.080
<v Speaker 3>So you need a path of being justifies </v>
<v Speaker 3>the suffering of life.</v>

549
00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Then the next question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

550
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:24.660
<v Speaker 3>can you find such a thing and the answer</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is you've got your whole life.</v>

551
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Find out and under the doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the answer.</v>

552
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.910
<v Speaker 3>It really is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the prime question.</v>

553
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:31.953
<v Speaker 3>Can you conduct yourself in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>justifies the tragedy of the now in </v>

554
00:31:36.161 --> 00:31:38.590
<v Speaker 3>order to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of it is he can't be too arrogant,</v>

555
00:31:38.591 --> 00:31:39.424
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't think you know what you're </v>

556
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 3>doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're all happy and things are going</v>

557
00:31:42.971 --> 00:31:45.970
<v Speaker 3>wonderfully and you have a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with being,</v>

558
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no problem,</v>

559
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.213
<v Speaker 3>but you guys don't put up your hands </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you said you're stressed out and </v>

560
00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:53.520
<v Speaker 3>you know you're doubtful and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what's going on and you know,</v>

561
00:31:53.521 --> 00:31:55.720
<v Speaker 3>so you're teetering between nihilism in </v>
<v Speaker 3>India,</v>

562
00:31:55.721 --> 00:31:58.760
<v Speaker 3>logical possession and so you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

563
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a good thing to notice.</v>

564
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you can know this.</v>

565
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.333
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm not correct because that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be lovely if the reason that you have a </v>

566
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:09.280
<v Speaker 3>problem is because there are things you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know.</v>

567
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.233
<v Speaker 3>That's such a good deal because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative is things are terrible </v>

568
00:32:12.911 --> 00:32:15.160
<v Speaker 3>because they're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you can do about it,</v>

569
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.960
<v Speaker 3>and then it's like not only were there </v>
<v Speaker 3>no bloody wonder,</v>

570
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:20.523
<v Speaker 3>so you could start with the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>that perhaps the reason that things </v>

571
00:32:23.891 --> 00:32:24.724
<v Speaker 3>aren't as good as they could be or as </v>
<v Speaker 3>good as is necessary is that there are </v>

572
00:32:28.451 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 3>fundamental things that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>observe and learn and change and then if</v>

573
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:33.574
<v Speaker 3>you really careful and sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified because that's also a </v>

574
00:32:36.461 --> 00:32:37.294
<v Speaker 3>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to be sufficiently </v>

575
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:39.244
<v Speaker 3>careful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can figure out how would </v>

576
00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:41.954
<v Speaker 3>conduct yourself so that you get to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong enough so that you can tolerate </v>

577
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:47.210
<v Speaker 3>to tolerate that and maybe even more.</v>

578
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.073
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could put yourself together so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're so strongly the other we </v>

579
00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:51.563
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could say it's okay that things are </v>

580
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.930
<v Speaker 3>this way or maybe even that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good that this girl,</v>

581
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.980
<v Speaker 3>so when I learned that in part by having</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>

582
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 3>because kids are unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable,</v>

583
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and be really.</v>

584
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.043
<v Speaker 3>They're so cute and so perfect in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain way that there are </v>

585
00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:11.990
<v Speaker 3>vulnerabilities also even more painful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

586
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:16.730
<v Speaker 3>but you think about them and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

587
00:33:16.731 --> 00:33:17.564
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's eradicate some of that </v>

588
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:19.964
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot take a little three year old </v>

589
00:33:23.511 --> 00:33:24.344
<v Speaker 3>and they're wandering around and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know they're subject to any number of </v>

590
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.350
<v Speaker 3>potential catastrophes at any moment and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

591
00:33:30.351 --> 00:33:31.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

592
00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:31.923
<v Speaker 3>you can enclose them in Styrofoam and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you then you could roll them down the </v>

593
00:33:34.491 --> 00:33:37.190
<v Speaker 3>stairs and that wouldn't be a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then be enclosed.</v>

594
00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:38.024
<v Speaker 3>It's powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really what we're trying to do </v>

595
00:33:39.291 --> 00:33:40.124
<v Speaker 3>with kids.</v>

596
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Or You could make them 20 feet tall and </v>
<v Speaker 3>making a buyer and then,</v>

597
00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:43.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

598
00:33:43.581 --> 00:33:44.414
<v Speaker 3>We've heard them all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that's so strange is that </v>

599
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.400
<v Speaker 3>every step you take to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

600
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:53.360
<v Speaker 3>to eradicate the vulnerability is </v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously a step that would involve</v>

601
00:33:53.361 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 3>the destruction of the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's so interesting because what it</v>

602
00:33:57.651 --> 00:33:58.484
<v Speaker 3>means is that the vulnerabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that central element of what it is that </v>

603
00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:01.503
<v Speaker 3>you love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty interesting because it </v>

604
00:34:03.261 --> 00:34:04.094
<v Speaker 3>means that you could love something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's truly vulnerable is something </v>

605
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

606
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.513
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's susceptible to tragedy and it's </v>

607
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.610
<v Speaker 3>and it's mortal and fragile and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

608
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.453
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's interesting because if you </v>

609
00:34:14.211 --> 00:34:15.044
<v Speaker 3>love someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make the judgment that their </v>

610
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:18.320
<v Speaker 3>existence is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is good,</v>

611
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:23.420
<v Speaker 3>and that's cool because it shows that </v>
<v Speaker 3>well that happens to you spontaneously.</v>

612
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:25.460
<v Speaker 3>You can spontaneously make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>judgment.</v>

613
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:27.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you could make that judgment about</v>

614
00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:28.334
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

615
00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't think you can just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just do that.</v>

616
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.520
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>

617
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.383
<v Speaker 3>you can't really fool yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you can learn to not judge </v>

618
00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:41.990
<v Speaker 3>yourself with unnecessary harshness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really useful.</v>

619
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.110
<v Speaker 3>And even learn to be compassionate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

620
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:45.973
<v Speaker 3>which basically means to treat yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>as if you're someone who care about </v>

621
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.500
<v Speaker 3>because that's where true compassion </v>
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>

622
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.860
<v Speaker 3>And so you could modify to your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your capital,</v>

623
00:34:54.861 --> 00:34:55.694
<v Speaker 3>logical self criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in order to establish a positive </v>

624
00:34:59.361 --> 00:35:02.120
<v Speaker 3>relationship with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you also have to respect yourself.</v>

625
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.983
<v Speaker 3>And I think to do that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of things that go along </v>

626
00:35:05.241 --> 00:35:06.074
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be good for something good </v>

627
00:35:09.171 --> 00:35:10.540
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be good.</v>

628
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.010
<v Speaker 3>Good for other people that'd be even </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

629
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.300
<v Speaker 3>good for other people in a crisis that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would even be better,</v>

630
00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:18.603
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that way you can have some </v>

631
00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:23.990
<v Speaker 3>respect for yourself because although </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're full of flaws and vulnerable,</v>

632
00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:25.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a storm coming,</v>

633
00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:26.810
<v Speaker 3>you can still stand up in it.</v>

634
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:28.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And No.</v>

635
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.620
<v Speaker 3>So I've observed people on surrounding a</v>
<v Speaker 3>deathbed,</v>

636
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

637
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:40.490
<v Speaker 3>just it's easy thing for people to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified of but doesn't help.</v>

638
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Like the person is dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in the room,</v>

639
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:45.570
<v Speaker 3>you're terrified and upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

640
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not your turn.</v>

641
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.863
<v Speaker 3>It's their turn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so hopefully when you're in that </v>

642
00:35:50.791 --> 00:35:53.340
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got yourself together now so that</v>

643
00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 3>you're actually going to be helpful </v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

644
00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.100
<v Speaker 3>And then if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

645
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.163
<v Speaker 3>really terrible things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So families often tear themselves apart </v>

646
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:04.700
<v Speaker 3>when you know a major part of the family</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

647
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.573
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>father and mother because there were so </v>

648
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.160
<v Speaker 3>mangled up in 15 different ways that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

649
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:14.880
<v Speaker 3>the tragedy is unfolding may turn on </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other like carnivorous wolves.</v>

650
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 3>And so they take something that's just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy and they turned it into hale.</v>

651
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 3>And I would say generally you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerate tragedy,</v>

652
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.133
<v Speaker 3>but you cannot tolerate health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So part of your life is part of what </v>

653
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:30.750
<v Speaker 3>you're doing in your life is to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy from deteriorating into hell.</v>

654
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.280
<v Speaker 3>And if you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

655
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:33.114
<v Speaker 3>like you're worth having around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually grounds for some </v>

656
00:36:34.831 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 3>self respect because that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard.</v>

657
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.410
<v Speaker 4>But consider the alternative,</v>

658
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes everything that's sad.</v>

659
00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely unbearable in every possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

660
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:50.723
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen families who were coping </v>

661
00:36:51.951 --> 00:36:56.270
<v Speaker 3>with the death say of a mother who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>courageous people.</v>

662
00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were people who had,</v>

663
00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.200
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked as palliative care nurses.</v>

664
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:01.123
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty tough for a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what they did while their </v>

665
00:37:05.601 --> 00:37:07.220
<v Speaker 3>mother was dying was held.</v>

666
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:10.003
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

667
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.960
<v Speaker 3>That makes the whole situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

668
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:16.540
<v Speaker 3>If it transforms the whole situation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

669
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.190
<v Speaker 3>you just don't know how much your </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation can be transformed.</v>

670
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.633
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can take very terrible </v>

671
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:24.264
<v Speaker 3>situations that mean don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know what terrible situations </v>

672
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:28.164
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not trying to offer you some </v>

673
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.173
<v Speaker 3>naive response,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can take situations that could </v>

674
00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:37.650
<v Speaker 3>be honored imaginably pool and terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can transform them at least into</v>

675
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.990
<v Speaker 3>bearable tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

676
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.213
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the transmutation that someone </v>

677
00:37:43.441 --> 00:37:48.441
<v Speaker 3>with real character can manage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so those things are real.</v>

678
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:49.703
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of what you hear about is about </v>

679
00:37:52.981 --> 00:37:56.430
<v Speaker 3>the fragility of representations of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

680
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.883
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and about their arbitrary ness and </v>

681
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.113
<v Speaker 3>falseness that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there isn't that belief system in </v>

682
00:38:06.251 --> 00:38:09.250
<v Speaker 3>some sense that is rotten to the core </v>
<v Speaker 3>and questionable.</v>

683
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.713
<v Speaker 3>And I think part of that is just because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the wrong questions that are being </v>

684
00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.730
<v Speaker 3>asked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

685
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:21.250
<v Speaker 3>if the manner in which you addressed the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world makes you stronger,</v>

686
00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.330
<v Speaker 3>then there was no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That puts us beyond question,</v>

687
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.060
<v Speaker 4>if you want a question at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

688
00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.213
<v Speaker 3>even if you come up can come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rational way of criticizing it because </v>

689
00:38:34.371 --> 00:38:35.260
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

690
00:38:35.261 --> 00:38:38.160
<v Speaker 3>who cares how he wrote to you are on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your mother's death bed.</v>

691
00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:40.150
<v Speaker 3>We need a trillion years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

692
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:43.030
<v Speaker 3>all the stores have exploded in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The galaxies are extinguished.</v>

693
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 3>When I hear objections that anyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>parody,</v>

694
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:47.883
<v Speaker 3>that's such a stupid question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're just missing the point </v>

695
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:51.364
<v Speaker 3>completely and it's a pathological </v>
<v Speaker 3>objection because you could say you're </v>

696
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 3>one of the first soldiers that lays eyes</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Auschwitz and the first thing you say</v>

697
00:38:58.211 --> 00:39:02.050
<v Speaker 3>is at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter who's going to know in</v>

698
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:03.070
<v Speaker 3>a million years.</v>

699
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>

700
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.930
<v Speaker 3>I get the rationale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

701
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:12.350
<v Speaker 3>get the impeccable logic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

702
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.353
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the logic that only someone who's </v>

703
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:20.270
<v Speaker 3>corrupt beyond measure would dare to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a situation like that.</v>

704
00:39:20.271 --> 00:39:22.910
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a simple way alternative </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

705
00:39:22.911 --> 00:39:25.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

706
00:39:25.581 --> 00:39:29.120
<v Speaker 3>say that reduces suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just start with that and something</v>

707
00:39:29.121 --> 00:39:32.690
<v Speaker 3>pops into your mind like who's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to carry in a million years?</v>

708
00:39:32.691 --> 00:39:33.524
<v Speaker 3>The first thing you should conclude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the wrong time for that thought </v>

709
00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.200
<v Speaker 3>because you can criticize either thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

710
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.063
<v Speaker 3>You can say that art is paramount and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the conclusion is irrefutable or </v>

711
00:39:44.031 --> 00:39:48.740
<v Speaker 3>anything say anymore on any chattering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>devil can come up with that objection.</v>

712
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Why in the world would anyone with any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense ever listened to it?</v>

713
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.410
<v Speaker 3>And that's a much more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a deeper response.</v>

714
00:39:56.411 --> 00:39:58.460
<v Speaker 3>It's an embodied response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>

715
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:02.340
<v Speaker 3>it's not a rational response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are deeper responses than rational</v>

716
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.193
<v Speaker 3>responses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their responses that involve your whole </v>

717
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:08.060
<v Speaker 3>being and those are the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>responses you're after.</v>

718
00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because rationality,</v>

719
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.750
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

720
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:18.110
<v Speaker 3>it's a states note and it's the highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit and God's heavenly kingdom.</v>

721
00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:18.973
<v Speaker 3>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most powerful psychological </v>

722
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:26.320
<v Speaker 3>forest we have at our disposal</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you and it shouldn't be lost and if</v>

723
00:40:29.571 --> 00:40:31.970
<v Speaker 3>it is you and it's awesome that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

724
00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:33.843
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

725
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.460
<v Speaker 3>So there's no reason to let that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just,</v>

726
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.410
<v Speaker 3>you can just refer to your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

727
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's other exercises and do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a really good one.</v>

728
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.330
<v Speaker 3>This is terrifying though if you do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

729
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.933
<v Speaker 3>detach yourself from yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's sort of a Buddhist faith </v>

730
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.633
<v Speaker 3>subset so you become a watcher of </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and so you have to watch </v>

731
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:57.400
<v Speaker 3>yourself like you don't know who you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't,</v>

732
00:40:57.401 --> 00:41:00.100
<v Speaker 3>so you might as well do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then</v>

733
00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.253
<v Speaker 3>watch what happens when you taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of have to watch with your whole </v>

734
00:41:06.891 --> 00:41:10.880
<v Speaker 3>body and notice that sometimes when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>say something,</v>

735
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.780
<v Speaker 3>you align and you come together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get stronger.</v>

736
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.790
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes when you say something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get weaker,</v>

737
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:18.140
<v Speaker 3>you fragmented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get weaker,</v>

738
00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.850
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could notice,</v>

739
00:41:19.851 --> 00:41:23.670
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you'll get weaker if you say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to impress someone you know,</v>

740
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:24.583
<v Speaker 3>you'll get weaker if you falsify your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own experience because you're trying to </v>

741
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.500
<v Speaker 3>manipulate the situation in order for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to happen.</v>

742
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get weak if act on it.</v>

743
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:39.730
<v Speaker 3>Act as if an intellectual principle is </v>
<v Speaker 3>something of your creation when it is,</v>

744
00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:41.523
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because lots of great ideas you can't </v>

745
00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 3>really use unless you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you've made them your own,</v>

746
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.293
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we've had an attack to take </v>

747
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:48.494
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be bought into because </v>

748
00:41:50.811 --> 00:41:54.760
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you'd just chattering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chattering</v>

749
00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.830
<v Speaker 3>like a tape recorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were chatting with tape recorder.</v>

750
00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is crowded and you don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right to know.</v>

751
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:04.693
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll notice sometimes this is a good </v>

752
00:42:06.421 --> 00:42:07.254
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be involved in an argument with </v>

753
00:42:07.921 --> 00:42:10.770
<v Speaker 3>someone and you'll feel stupid because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're arguing.</v>

754
00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Shut up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

755
00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.300
<v Speaker 3>and that's often what will happen if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this</v>

756
00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:22.970
<v Speaker 3>a whole bunch of very many occasions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have to shut up because there's</v>

757
00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:24.990
<v Speaker 3>nothing you could say that won't make </v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel weak.</v>

758
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.333
<v Speaker 3>And then you can start to feel yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>around your words and you'll see that </v>

759
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.460
<v Speaker 3>here's something you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your solidity hair,</v>

760
00:42:32.461 --> 00:42:33.294
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're standing on a rock in </v>

761
00:42:34.141 --> 00:42:37.110
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you deviate from that,</v>

762
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.000
<v Speaker 3>come apart and start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel weak.</v>

763
00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.070
<v Speaker 3>And so we practice that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

764
00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.083
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to see what happens if I only </v>

765
00:42:43.351 --> 00:42:47.610
<v Speaker 3>say things that make me feel strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you do that for five years and see</v>

766
00:42:47.611 --> 00:42:48.444
<v Speaker 3>what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's partly it's fleeting reference </v>

767
00:42:50.551 --> 00:42:51.384
<v Speaker 3>to a very old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an idea that's at the heart of </v>

768
00:42:53.761 --> 00:42:54.594
<v Speaker 3>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that the idea that there's an </v>

769
00:42:57.211 --> 00:42:58.044
<v Speaker 3>idea that conscious human interaction </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the ground with the va has </v>

770
00:43:02.911 --> 00:43:06.430
<v Speaker 3>something to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It reveals it</v>

771
00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:09.183
<v Speaker 3>conscious human interaction with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground of being is what makes potential </v>

772
00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:15.220
<v Speaker 3>transformed into reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

773
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.100
<v Speaker 3>It's an unbelievably powerful idea and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it's.</v>

774
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.710
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's as true as anything can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be true.</v>

775
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:25.263
<v Speaker 3>That means to some degree that you speak</v>
<v Speaker 3>to yourself in the va and so that being </v>

776
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.910
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to make yourself strong,</v>

777
00:43:30.911 --> 00:43:31.744
<v Speaker 3>you speak truth so that you could bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself into being in truth and the </v>

778
00:43:35.201 --> 00:43:38.410
<v Speaker 3>reason you want to do that because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be truthful.</v>

779
00:43:38.411 --> 00:43:39.244
<v Speaker 3>Like in some sort of external,</v>
<v Speaker 3>external sense of being in accordance </v>

780
00:43:45.401 --> 00:43:50.250
<v Speaker 3>with the traditional route rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although if you really pay are real,</v>

781
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.530
<v Speaker 3>him is a lot better than just the AI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more than that.</v>

782
00:43:53.531 --> 00:43:54.364
<v Speaker 3>It's your attempt to construct yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>into something that can react to the </v>

783
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.630
<v Speaker 3>manifestation manifestation of b </v>
<v Speaker 3>property.</v>

784
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:02.703
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're matching yourself to be and why </v>

785
00:44:05.711 --> 00:44:09.940
<v Speaker 3>would you not want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to contend with it.</v>

786
00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:14.920
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how powerful you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you contend property people can be so</v>

787
00:44:14.921 --> 00:44:16.840
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just unbelievable.</v>

788
00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:17.763
<v Speaker 3>And you see this even in minor</v>
<v Speaker 3>for dinner with this guy a while back </v>

789
00:44:21.881 --> 00:44:23.440
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

790
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.790
<v Speaker 3>he'd been an athletic guy.</v>

791
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.090
<v Speaker 3>He a lot of biking qualifications,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing.</v>

792
00:44:28.091 --> 00:44:33.091
<v Speaker 3>He got hit by a car just wipe out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's still recovering and he's.</v>

793
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:36.470
<v Speaker 3>He's pretty disabled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty.</v>

794
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.960
<v Speaker 3>Went back to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's aligned with mine.</v>

795
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:39.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

796
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:40.224
<v Speaker 3>You've got to climb up power splice </v>
<v Speaker 3>cables together and you have to do it </v>

797
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.630
<v Speaker 3>under employment conditions because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been the standard,</v>

798
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.593
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's demanding and dangerous and all of </v>

799
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:49.404
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's pretty screwed up because he </v>

800
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:53.520
<v Speaker 3>got hit by a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was telling me just just to casual</v>

801
00:44:53.521 --> 00:44:54.354
<v Speaker 3>a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was telling me about the last day </v>

802
00:44:55.761 --> 00:44:56.594
<v Speaker 3>that he had worked and he was working </v>
<v Speaker 3>with somebody who his partner had </v>

803
00:44:58.321 --> 00:45:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Parkinson's disease and really could use</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of his arms very well,</v>

804
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:02.124
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could use his left arm and the other </v>

805
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:04.914
<v Speaker 3>guy could use his right arm and so they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were on the ladder trying to fix this </v>

806
00:45:07.201 --> 00:45:08.730
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

807
00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.340
<v Speaker 3>it just made my jaw drop because how </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous is that?</v>

808
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.110
<v Speaker 3>He's not run over by a car and then this</v>
<v Speaker 3>other guy has Parkinson's disease,</v>

809
00:45:16.111 --> 00:45:16.944
<v Speaker 3>which is just as miserable as clean as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could hope to have nearly our their </v>

810
00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.313
<v Speaker 3>ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No freezing rain or fixing the power </v>

811
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:23.634
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like people can be unbelievably </v>

812
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:27.390
<v Speaker 3>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

813
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:28.224
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities now that just drives me </v>

814
00:45:30.121 --> 00:45:30.954
<v Speaker 3>crazy is it's like you can't be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say anything bad about black </v>

815
00:45:35.251 --> 00:45:38.580
<v Speaker 3>people or Mexicans or white people or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews or whoever.</v>

816
00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:39.843
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even expressed as much hatred for </v>

817
00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:45.000
<v Speaker 3>the entire human race as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's just.</v>

818
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.140
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just like,</v>

819
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 3>it's really bad if you only take one </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of person,</v>

820
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:51.880
<v Speaker 3>but if you hate everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that just comes into your life.</v>

821
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear about this all the time.</v>

822
00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.173
<v Speaker 3>We're screwing up the planet and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet will be better off if there were </v>

823
00:45:57.571 --> 00:45:58.260
<v Speaker 3>people on it.</v>

824
00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.420
<v Speaker 3>Then all this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think man,</v>

825
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:04.230
<v Speaker 3>never give the keys to the nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>arsenal to someone who thinks that way,</v>

826
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a despicable way of thinking and it</v>

827
00:46:08.311 --> 00:46:10.800
<v Speaker 3>would be nice if we could develop some </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect for people.</v>

828
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

829
00:46:12.211 --> 00:46:13.044
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we labor along under the burden that </v>

830
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:16.434
<v Speaker 3>exceeds the burden of anything we know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're the only creatures there are who </v>

831
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:23.670
<v Speaker 3>are conscious of their own vulnerability</v>
<v Speaker 3>and its ultimate vulnerability.</v>

832
00:46:23.671 --> 00:46:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to die.</v>

833
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:28.320
<v Speaker 3>That's where it talks out and look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here you are.</v>

834
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.830
<v Speaker 3>Now you're standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in here learning.</v>

835
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.720
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to have a life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're maybe some of you are even trying</v>

836
00:46:33.721 --> 00:46:34.554
<v Speaker 3>to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a hell of a thing to do under </v>

837
00:46:36.391 --> 00:46:38.190
<v Speaker 3>those conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

838
00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:40.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you started thinking that way,</v>

839
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:40.883
<v Speaker 3>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have a little more compassion </v>

840
00:46:41.981 --> 00:46:42.490
<v Speaker 3>for people.</v>

841
00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:43.323
<v Speaker 3>It's a little hard on the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's understand it's role in </v>

842
00:46:46.891 --> 00:46:49.320
<v Speaker 3>returning the favor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

843
00:46:49.321 --> 00:46:53.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're at war with mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's going to win,</v>

844
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all die and we're doing our best to </v>

845
00:46:56.281 --> 00:46:59.070
<v Speaker 3>protect ourselves from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And obviously there's some stupidity and</v>

846
00:46:59.071 --> 00:46:59.904
<v Speaker 3>foolishness and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence and ravenous and this and </v>

847
00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:03.174
<v Speaker 3>greed that goes along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But asking someone to solve an </v>

848
00:47:06.481 --> 00:47:11.481
<v Speaker 3>impossible problem perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're just the ultimate tired</v>

849
00:47:12.001 --> 00:47:13.770
<v Speaker 3>when you demand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could think,</v>

850
00:47:13.771 --> 00:47:15.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could give ourselves a bit of a break</v>

851
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.630
<v Speaker 3>and that's something to apply your </v>
<v Speaker 3>sending.</v>

852
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.640
<v Speaker 3>And I went to this thing at Queen's </v>
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

853
00:47:20.641 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 3>It was a tedx thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was so appalling.</v>

854
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.133
<v Speaker 3>If a professor came out and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be talking about these </v>

855
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.110
<v Speaker 3>computerized surfaces that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>inventing,</v>

856
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:32.020
<v Speaker 3>which were pretty cool.</v>

857
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:32.913
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he came out and he went into a </v>

858
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:39.960
<v Speaker 3>tirade to the students about how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>should not reproduce because he said him</v>

859
00:47:41.661 --> 00:47:42.494
<v Speaker 3>and his wife going limited themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 3>one child and I thought personally that </v>

860
00:47:45.621 --> 00:47:47.350
<v Speaker 3>was one more child and he should've </v>
<v Speaker 3>passed.</v>

861
00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.033
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even notice that what he was </v>

862
00:47:50.271 --> 00:47:51.104
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was addressing a whole room full of </v>

863
00:47:52.221 --> 00:47:54.920
<v Speaker 3>people like you who are just entering </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the,</v>

864
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.880
<v Speaker 3>into the beginnings up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up there,</v>

865
00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.520
<v Speaker 3>truly adult life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is about children.</v>

866
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Is that what makes these adult and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling them,</v>

867
00:48:04.071 --> 00:48:06.470
<v Speaker 3>you are so despicable that you're tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't breed.</v>

868
00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.990
<v Speaker 3>And then he thought that was more just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

869
00:48:08.991 --> 00:48:09.824
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told him it was great horror because </v>

870
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:14.223
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really nervous because I really don't </v>

871
00:48:14.991 --> 00:48:16.850
<v Speaker 3>like doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

872
00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.193
<v Speaker 3>I told him that I thought that what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>did was pathological beyond belief and </v>

873
00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:22.370
<v Speaker 3>that she should be ashamed of </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

874
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:24.740
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I freaked my wife out,</v>

875
00:48:24.741 --> 00:48:25.574
<v Speaker 3>completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>panicked and he just hopped off the </v>

876
00:48:30.351 --> 00:48:32.870
<v Speaker 3>stage saying that's what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk about things.</v>

877
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:36.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

878
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.340
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens when you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>genocide in your soul.</v>

879
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.790
<v Speaker 3>That's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

880
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:45.930
<v Speaker 3>hatred for humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good thing man.</v>

881
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:46.773
<v Speaker 3>We know where that leads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why would say you could start having </v>

882
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:50.503
<v Speaker 3>a relationship to yourself and have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of respect for people can </v>

883
00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.810
<v Speaker 3>older like mangled up and chewed up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>spit out and work in.</v>

884
00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.140
<v Speaker 3>It's no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

885
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:00.993
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I've noticed about </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology is that we always get things </v>

886
00:49:02.951 --> 00:49:03.784
<v Speaker 3>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did people manifest their abnormal </v>

887
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:08.410
<v Speaker 3>behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

888
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.640
<v Speaker 3>a stupid question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

889
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.593
<v Speaker 3>what would you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's why people are ever normal about </v>

890
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.600
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's step one in this history.</v>

891
00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:17.443
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people come in to my office and we're </v>

892
00:49:18.621 --> 00:49:21.530
<v Speaker 3>having a phobia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid that I,</v>

893
00:49:21.531 --> 00:49:22.364
<v Speaker 3>if I go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might die and we'll get to the </v>

894
00:49:23.871 --> 00:49:27.770
<v Speaker 3>hospital with todd having heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>palpitations and they're getting older.</v>

895
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.240
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

896
00:49:29.241 --> 00:49:31.800
<v Speaker 3>that's not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have tax surprises in it.</v>

897
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:32.883
<v Speaker 3>Like all the other 50 year olds don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen because of course what you were </v>

898
00:49:35.661 --> 00:49:36.494
<v Speaker 3>afraid of and then you don't know with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the idea that it's a </v>

899
00:49:43.191 --> 00:49:47.900
<v Speaker 3>mystery that people engage in abnormal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no personality</v>

900
00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.330
<v Speaker 3>mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no mystery why people are afraid.</v>

901
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.600
<v Speaker 3>It's no mystery why people have low self</v>
<v Speaker 3>esteem,</v>

902
00:49:55.601 --> 00:49:59.020
<v Speaker 3>which is a work by the way I hate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>why people are depressed and anxious and</v>

903
00:49:59.021 --> 00:50:01.400
<v Speaker 3>in pain and confused and uncertain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all those things.</v>

904
00:50:01.401 --> 00:50:03.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like tap doesn't require any </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation,</v>

905
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:09.390
<v Speaker 3>so if you were any of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like so and then the issue is,</v>

906
00:50:09.431 --> 00:50:10.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do about it?</v>

907
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:18.263
<v Speaker 3>You need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how you would say your right </v>

908
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:21.603
<v Speaker 3>heel should be informed by your </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of the greatest happiness of </v>

909
00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.940
<v Speaker 3>the past because there's all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge city around your waist back.</v>

910
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Don't waste it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use it,</v>

911
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:35.380
<v Speaker 3>and even ideal and ideal is a target and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a judge at the same time and it's a</v>

912
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:38.160
<v Speaker 3>motivator because you can be like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

913
00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:39.003
<v Speaker 3>as you move towards your ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will transform because otherwise it </v>

914
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be anything to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody's ideal will receive,</v>

915
00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:46.034
<v Speaker 3>but we needed an ideal need to construct</v>
<v Speaker 3>it some sense or discovered ideal that </v>

916
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:50.744
<v Speaker 3>you believed in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to inform that with your </v>

917
00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:54.584
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's partly why you need to get </v>

918
00:50:55.821 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 3>educated and that's why the humanities </v>
<v Speaker 3>are so important.</v>

919
00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.940
<v Speaker 3>If the humanities still be universities </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to go,</v>

920
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:02.893
<v Speaker 3>I think because</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they committed Harry Carey </v>

921
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.040
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally and of resentment as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as I can tell,</v>

922
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:14.990
<v Speaker 3>and so it's really not good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the terror of it is that it deprives</v>

923
00:51:14.991 --> 00:51:15.860
<v Speaker 3>you of what you mean.</v>

924
00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.053
<v Speaker 3>You need to be able to extract from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past the ideal and then you put that in </v>

925
00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:24.680
<v Speaker 3>front of us about it and it has to be an</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideal that you believe is valuable.</v>

926
00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:25.311
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

927
00:51:25.311 --> 00:51:26.660
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could pull that off,</v>

928
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:27.523
<v Speaker 3>if I could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could be that all this trouble </v>

929
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:32.180
<v Speaker 3>would be worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we do this practically.</v>

930
00:51:32.181 --> 00:51:32.841
<v Speaker 3>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

931
00:51:32.841 --> 00:51:33.674
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three to five years in the future </v>

932
00:51:34.401 --> 00:51:38.350
<v Speaker 3>because after that it gets kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>blurry for France.</v>

933
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Who Do you want your friends to be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you can pick your friends,</v>

934
00:51:41.211 --> 00:51:42.044
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pick people who like you and </v>

935
00:51:44.361 --> 00:51:46.730
<v Speaker 3>want the best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be good.</v>

936
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:50.810
<v Speaker 3>If you're willing to extend that </v>
<v Speaker 3>courtesy to yourself.</v>

937
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:54.490
<v Speaker 3>What do you want for your education?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think?</v>

938
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean?</v>

939
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Here's what it means.</v>

940
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.350
<v Speaker 3>If you're educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get your land,</v>

941
00:52:00.351 --> 00:52:01.184
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how to speak and you know how </v>

942
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 3>to write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know how to speak and write,</v>

943
00:52:05.811 --> 00:52:06.644
<v Speaker 3>you are unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're supposed to get </v>

944
00:52:09.201 --> 00:52:11.330
<v Speaker 3>educated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one ever tells you that.</v>

945
00:52:11.331 --> 00:52:11.781
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

946
00:52:11.781 --> 00:52:12.614
<v Speaker 3>why are you running this so well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a class assignment or maybe I'm </v>

947
00:52:16.321 --> 00:52:16.911
<v Speaker 3>learning too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

948
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:18.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why bother?</v>

949
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Why is that important?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

950
00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.790
<v Speaker 3>Why bother?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can write the reason you can't write.</v>

951
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:26.330
<v Speaker 3>It's because he can't think and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

952
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.420
<v Speaker 3>then you run into things and if you run </v>
<v Speaker 3>into things,</v>

953
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:32.800
<v Speaker 3>then your life is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the reason that you get educated this</v>

954
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:33.643
<v Speaker 3>so that you can fake and not run into </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible things and your life expanse </v>

955
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:42.200
<v Speaker 3>and it makes you powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

956
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.600
<v Speaker 3>part of what I'm doing in my therapy </v>
<v Speaker 3>sessions all the time,</v>

957
00:52:44.601 --> 00:52:49.601
<v Speaker 3>if someone comes in with a problem and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we articulate the problem fully and then</v>

958
00:52:49.971 --> 00:52:50.804
<v Speaker 3>we can get rid of most of it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>once it's articulated to you can see </v>

959
00:52:52.911 --> 00:52:53.744
<v Speaker 3>what's the problem and what isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we can focus on a few key </v>

960
00:52:55.791 --> 00:52:58.880
<v Speaker 3>things and make an articulate what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution would look like.</v>

961
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.030
<v Speaker 3>Then we can go war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

962
00:53:02.031 --> 00:53:03.560
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the problem.</v>

963
00:53:03.561 --> 00:53:06.050
<v Speaker 3>This is what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you get it?</v>

964
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.600
<v Speaker 3>That's all articulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's strategy one,</v>

965
00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:09.593
<v Speaker 3>strategy two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the rationales for all those </v>

966
00:53:11.151 --> 00:53:12.830
<v Speaker 3>strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what you do.</v>

967
00:53:12.831 --> 00:53:15.110
<v Speaker 3>If they fail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do that.</v>

968
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:17.323
<v Speaker 3>You do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Continuing things just move away and </v>

969
00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:22.880
<v Speaker 3>front could be like they're not even </v>
<v Speaker 3>there because the people in like systems</v>

970
00:53:22.881 --> 00:53:26.310
<v Speaker 3>that are stupid or stupid and weak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise he wouldn't be.</v>

971
00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.500
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't be stupid and weak if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't stupid and weak.</v>

972
00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:31.670
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

973
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:33.360
<v Speaker 3>a straight Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

974
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:34.403
<v Speaker 3>then that stuff just disappears in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>of you because there's no commitment to </v>

975
00:53:37.641 --> 00:53:40.250
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And language you're,</v>

976
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:43.050
<v Speaker 3>you want to be a master of language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're getting educated.</v>

977
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:43.943
<v Speaker 3>That's why university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I would say not only should you </v>

978
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:50.640
<v Speaker 3>not say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes you weak.</v>

979
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:51.623
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't write anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't believe I was talking to one </v>

980
00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughters</v>

981
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.890
<v Speaker 3>phrase this are great because I can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>drink coffee.</v>

982
00:54:02.891 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I actually hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for a drug that</v>

983
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.630
<v Speaker 3>might compromise with my own stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

984
00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:13.893
<v Speaker 3>she was complaining about this sociology</v>
<v Speaker 3>class that she was taking half </v>

985
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:16.923
<v Speaker 3>Concordia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was a sign for mental </v>

986
00:54:18.341 --> 00:54:19.570
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

987
00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:25.140
<v Speaker 3>And then she said she had to wrote her </v>
<v Speaker 3>essay so that you know,</v>

988
00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:29.020
<v Speaker 3>feed back to the professors with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular professor one of the year.</v>

989
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:33.010
<v Speaker 3>And so she was irritated about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't get me to do it,</v>

990
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.593
<v Speaker 3>to notice that the reason she couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get motivated to do it was because she </v>

991
00:54:37.961 --> 00:54:38.794
<v Speaker 3>had set herself up to the store for her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her logos to just start her being in </v>

992
00:54:45.491 --> 00:54:49.530
<v Speaker 3>order to please some person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had no respect for what's going on.</v>

993
00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:53.290
<v Speaker 3>How could you be motivated to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said to her,</v>

994
00:54:53.291 --> 00:54:54.400
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

995
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:57.430
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to take your lumps.</v>

996
00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:58.653
<v Speaker 3>You write the best essay you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He make it something you believe it and </v>

997
00:55:02.021 --> 00:55:04.330
<v Speaker 3>if it doesn't fly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough luck for you,</v>

998
00:55:04.331 --> 00:55:08.710
<v Speaker 3>but at least you haven't corrupted your </v>
<v Speaker 3>character and she's sort of my door.</v>

999
00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:09.603
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you just don't understand how the </v>

1000
00:55:10.361 --> 00:55:11.440
<v Speaker 3>university has changed?</v>

1001
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.800
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe true,</v>

1002
00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:19.803
<v Speaker 3>but it's not relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is is once you write </v>

1003
00:55:21.611 --> 00:55:25.540
<v Speaker 3>something you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can't tell them the data,</v>

1004
00:55:25.541 --> 00:55:26.374
<v Speaker 3>and that's actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can come here and let's say </v>

1005
00:55:27.701 --> 00:55:31.330
<v Speaker 3>you're a radical left wing or on some </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewpoint or radical wreck when you're,</v>

1006
00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:33.010
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I say,</v>

1007
00:55:33.011 --> 00:55:33.844
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to write an essay countering </v>

1008
00:55:36.011 --> 00:55:37.290
<v Speaker 3>that position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1009
00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:38.223
<v Speaker 3>to renew in a week later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shifted weight close to your </v>

1010
00:55:40.301 --> 00:55:43.660
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason is is that the belief you</v>

1011
00:55:43.661 --> 00:55:46.660
<v Speaker 3>have to begin with is shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've never really articulated it.</v>

1012
00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:48.380
<v Speaker 3>You just have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a heuristic.</v>

1013
00:55:48.381 --> 00:55:52.060
<v Speaker 3>It's probably based on your temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You articulated revival,</v>

1014
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.273
<v Speaker 3>you have a weighting or a well developed</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument for the repellent they need to </v>

1015
00:55:55.921 --> 00:55:58.090
<v Speaker 3>do for the original proposition so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>ship,</v>

1016
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.150
<v Speaker 3>so every time you write something to </v>
<v Speaker 3>please someone,</v>

1017
00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:06.170
<v Speaker 3>then you're damaging your character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>

1018
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.941
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

1019
00:56:06.941 --> 00:56:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Like the honest dope Friday anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is wrong.</v>

1020
00:56:11.151 --> 00:56:11.984
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1021
00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.780
<v Speaker 3>that's what you've got is your </v>
<v Speaker 3>character,</v>

1022
00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:18.610
<v Speaker 3>because nothing else will defend you </v>
<v Speaker 3>against suffering.</v>

1023
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:23.140
<v Speaker 3>That's what you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you sacrifice that,</v>

1024
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:25.683
<v Speaker 3>you sacrifice it everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's worse than that because once </v>

1025
00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:32.970
<v Speaker 3>you sacrifice that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get weak and when you get weak,</v>

1026
00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.340
<v Speaker 3>the tragedy mouth and as the tragedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouse,</v>

1027
00:56:36.341 --> 00:56:37.174
<v Speaker 3>you get resentful and then you get cruel</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get vicious and there's no </v>

1028
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:44.110
<v Speaker 3>stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's just the beginning.</v>

1029
00:56:44.111 --> 00:56:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no end to the downside </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that and like we already saw in the</v>

1030
00:56:48.881 --> 00:56:50.830
<v Speaker 3>20th century what happens when people do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1031
00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:53.373
<v Speaker 3>It's not good and all of those deaths </v>
<v Speaker 3>should have taught us a lesson and the </v>

1032
00:56:59.021 --> 00:56:59.854
<v Speaker 3>lesson is don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It leads to it least the worst possible </v>

1033
00:57:04.871 --> 00:57:05.704
<v Speaker 3>situation that you could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter how well you can imagine </v>

1034
00:57:08.081 --> 00:57:13.081
<v Speaker 3>impossible situations and maybe you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to partake in that maybe don't,</v>

1035
00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.540
<v Speaker 3>and in fact maybe you do not want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>partake in it.</v>

1036
00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:17.383
<v Speaker 3>You want to do exactly whatever is </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary to decrease the probability </v>

1037
00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:26.701
<v Speaker 3>that that will happen and we know it can</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen and we know it doesn't have to,</v>

1038
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.250
<v Speaker 3>and so obviously there must be things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could do to ensure that doesn't</v>

1039
00:57:30.251 --> 00:57:33.160
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so those things are hard to discover.</v>

1040
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.053
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easier to see where something is </v>

1041
00:57:34.931 --> 00:57:38.770
<v Speaker 3>wrong than where it isn't wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just simpler.</v>

1042
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:43.050
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's very tightly aligned,</v>

1043
00:57:43.051 --> 00:57:43.884
<v Speaker 3>you'll find that stereotype type in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life at the same set of phenomena that </v>

1044
00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:50.320
<v Speaker 3>you will discover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know this day to day,</v>

1045
00:57:50.321 --> 00:57:51.580
<v Speaker 3>week to week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>month to month,</v>

1046
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:55.000
<v Speaker 3>what makes you weak and what makes it </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful,</v>

1047
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:56.703
<v Speaker 3>so weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you speak in a way that makes you </v>

1048
00:57:58.511 --> 00:58:00.880
<v Speaker 3>weak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be curated into that domain.</v>

1049
00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:04.060
<v Speaker 3>If you don't and you watch what makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life meaningful,</v>

1050
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:07.690
<v Speaker 3>then you'll get stronger and stronger </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we get farther and farther away from</v>

1051
00:58:07.691 --> 00:58:11.500
<v Speaker 3>that and you'll be more and more likely </v>
<v Speaker 3>to manifest yourself in a way that makes</v>

1052
00:58:11.501 --> 00:58:13.600
<v Speaker 3>those things less and less likely.</v>

1053
00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.610
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like,</v>

1054
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:19.250
<v Speaker 3>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the proposition for nihilists.</v>

1055
00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:20.940
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think these are good propositions.</v>

1056
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Argue yourself out of pe.</v>

1057
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do it well so much.</v>

1058
00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.470
<v Speaker 3>The deliberate steer rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this isn't the things that are maybe</v>

1059
00:58:30.471 --> 00:58:34.330
<v Speaker 3>less because there's pain and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>form of meaning.</v>

1060
00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.253
<v Speaker 3>It's not a form of media you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's there and you can't argue </v>

1061
00:58:38.201 --> 00:58:40.240
<v Speaker 3>yourself out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the next thing you might say,</v>

1062
00:58:40.241 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about a little less pain?</v>

1063
00:58:41.711 --> 00:58:44.620
<v Speaker 3>How would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you say,</v>

1064
00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:45.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what difference has been made?</v>

1065
00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:46.803
<v Speaker 3>It's like get away from that person</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think some things are self </v>

1066
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:54.460
<v Speaker 3>evident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't torture kittens to death,</v>

1067
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.680
<v Speaker 3>but who's going to care in a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>

1068
00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:57.753
<v Speaker 3>It's the wrong level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's just a trick of the rational </v>

1069
00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:06.730
<v Speaker 3>mind so you don't play along with that.</v>

1070
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:09.370
<v Speaker 3>You notice and that's upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's horrible.</v>

1071
00:59:09.371 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go anywhere near that.</v>

1072
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't go anywhere near it.</v>

1073
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:18.550
<v Speaker 3>That would be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you can start by avoiding.</v>

1074
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:21.380
<v Speaker 3>That's the way to bring meaning into </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>

1075
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:25.810
<v Speaker 3>You start by avoiding hell</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then if you're lucky you,</v>

1076
00:59:25.811 --> 00:59:26.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you avoided enough,</v>

1077
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.030
<v Speaker 3>then maybe you can start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you might,</v>

1078
00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climate stairway to heaven,</v>

1079
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:32.293
<v Speaker 3>but the first is the first is the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's really easy to believe in </v>

1080
00:59:36.141 --> 00:59:41.141
<v Speaker 3>pain and so all you have to notice is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you believe in and that maybe you'd</v>

1081
00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:43.640
<v Speaker 3>rather not have any more of it than </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary.</v>

1082
00:59:43.641 --> 00:59:45.980
<v Speaker 3>And perhaps that that would also be good</v>
<v Speaker 3>for other people.</v>

1083
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gives you a starting point</v>

1084
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.560
<v Speaker 3>and once you have the starting point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like our communities.</v>

1085
00:59:51.561 --> 00:59:52.101
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1086
00:59:52.101 --> 00:59:54.760
<v Speaker 3>if you gave them a lever and the proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>fulcrum,</v>

1087
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:55.700
<v Speaker 3>you could move the world.</v>

1088
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can tell,</v>

1089
00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:01.520
<v Speaker 3>that piece of knowledge is precisely </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because I don't think he couldn't.</v>

1090
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:02.563
<v Speaker 3>You can't dismiss it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not without in instantaneously </v>

1091
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:12.430
<v Speaker 3>establishing yourself as an agent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence so,</v>

1092
01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.420
<v Speaker 3>so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that.</v>

1093
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:23.240
<v Speaker 3>So I would say you Orient Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you Orient Yourself,</v>

1094
01:00:23.241 --> 01:00:24.074
<v Speaker 3>you have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to Orient Yourself towards an </v>

1095
01:00:25.431 --> 01:00:26.264
<v Speaker 3>ideal and you'll have to dinner out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ideal is you can figure out what </v>

1096
01:00:29.481 --> 01:00:31.760
<v Speaker 3>your ideal is by noticing who you </v>
<v Speaker 3>admire,</v>

1097
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.433
<v Speaker 3>because the phenomena of aberration is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the attempt of your psyche to construct </v>

1098
01:00:38.711 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 3>an ideal that you can fall and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>involuntary,</v>

1099
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 3>which is another thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting to notice,</v>

1100
01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:46.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't pick who you admire,</v>

1101
01:00:46.311 --> 01:00:47.144
<v Speaker 3>it just manifests itself and so it's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious manifestation of your </v>

1102
01:00:51.831 --> 01:00:52.664
<v Speaker 3>psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or You could say it's a revelation of </v>

1103
01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Ba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same basic idea,</v>

1104
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:57.320
<v Speaker 3>and so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1105
01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:58.430
<v Speaker 3>I fire this person.</v>

1106
01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well now it's like day.</v>

1107
01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.360
<v Speaker 3>There's an ideal nest in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it that you want for match?</v>

1108
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:05.203
<v Speaker 3>What is it you want to derive from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you derive that and then ride the </v>

1109
01:01:07.391 --> 01:01:11.690
<v Speaker 3>old ship and so it's a moving target in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sense,</v>

1110
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.950
<v Speaker 3>but it's well worth following.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and again,</v>

1111
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.040
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing that you can rationally </v>
<v Speaker 3>undermined as far as I can tell any more</v>

1112
01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:22.320
<v Speaker 3>than you can rationally on your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being in love with someone you know,</v>

1113
01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.213
<v Speaker 3>being trapped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being in love with someone either can't </v>

1114
01:01:25.101 --> 01:01:25.934
<v Speaker 3>control it so you can accept it as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>existential Faq and then you can work </v>

1115
01:01:32.331 --> 01:01:34.970
<v Speaker 3>forward on that basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I would say,</v>

1116
01:01:34.971 --> 01:01:35.804
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the ideals Orient Yourself </v>

1117
01:01:36.921 --> 01:01:40.490
<v Speaker 3>towards the improvement of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is,</v>

1118
01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 3>and it can be vague because what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell do you know?</v>

1119
01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.053
<v Speaker 3>But the issue is you've got to decide </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want things to be worse or do you </v>

1120
01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 3>want them to be better?</v>

1121
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:51.350
<v Speaker 3>That's the first decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>

1122
01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:52.970
<v Speaker 3>well obviously one of the things to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

1123
01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 3>it's like don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't be thinking that's obvious because</v>

1124
01:01:55.551 --> 01:01:56.384
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people are always working to make </v>

1125
01:01:58.371 --> 01:01:59.204
<v Speaker 3>things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a part of everyone that </v>

1126
01:02:00.531 --> 01:02:01.364
<v Speaker 3>works to make things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you think that that's not part of </v>

1127
01:02:04.911 --> 01:02:05.744
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're not even in the game yet </v>

1128
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.233
<v Speaker 3>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're naive fundamentally and </v>

1129
01:02:11.151 --> 01:02:13.210
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get walloped and walt </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

1130
01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you won't be dying and then you'll start</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing this and that will be painful.</v>

1131
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.980
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be better just to circumvent </v>
<v Speaker 3>that completely.</v>

1132
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.930
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think,</v>

1133
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to make things worse?</v>

1134
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make them better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1135
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.250
<v Speaker 3>what's works?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milo?</v>

1136
01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:29.850
<v Speaker 3>Milo is China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was bad Soviet Union.</v>

1137
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.520
<v Speaker 3>That was fat Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was bad.</v>

1138
01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.440
<v Speaker 3>Let's not go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1139
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 3>So we thought how great things were.</v>

1140
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Staff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get away from that.</v>

1141
01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:41.460
<v Speaker 3>How to make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comfort question.</v>

1142
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.270
<v Speaker 3>At least stop making the worse you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I would say,</v>

1143
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

1144
01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:50.613
<v Speaker 3>the other exercise that I think is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>useful apart from watching your speech </v>

1145
01:02:53.621 --> 01:02:57.160
<v Speaker 3>and don't write things you don't believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that is really dangerous.</v>

1146
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:58.103
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're working your character and once </v>

1147
01:03:00.071 --> 01:03:02.220
<v Speaker 3>you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to get to work stuff</v>

1148
01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.980
<v Speaker 3>because you actually rewiring yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing does that.</v>

1149
01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:08.170
<v Speaker 3>You're changing your memory structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you?</v>

1150
01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.013
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's even more indication </v>

1151
01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:14.980
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see the same thing happens with</v>

1152
01:03:14.981 --> 01:03:19.981
<v Speaker 3>you speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next thing is in part,</v>

1153
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:25.130
<v Speaker 3>notice what you could make better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would make better,</v>

1154
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.780
<v Speaker 3>and then make it better because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might say,</v>

1155
01:03:29.781 --> 01:03:31.160
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's good,</v>

1156
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.080
<v Speaker 3>what's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a start.</v>

1157
01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.820
<v Speaker 3>That's really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't.</v>

1158
01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Just because you specify the end one end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a continuum,</v>

1159
01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:40.750
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean you necessarily specify </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

1160
01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:43.640
<v Speaker 3>So it's fuzzy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the opposite of being a Nazi?</v>

1161
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know.</v>

1162
01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.610
<v Speaker 3>We don't know exactly,</v>

1163
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:53.740
<v Speaker 3>but you get glimmers and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right way of thinking about it.</v>

1164
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:58.050
<v Speaker 3>There are things that glimmer glimmer is</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is right and I can fix it.</v>

1165
01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.790
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1166
01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:01.770
<v Speaker 3>it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to question.</v>

1167
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.350
<v Speaker 3>These are grandiose states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are small things.</v>

1168
01:04:04.351 --> 01:04:05.940
<v Speaker 3>They're really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're small things like,</v>

1169
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:08.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1170
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:10.660
<v Speaker 3>there's some things I should attend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

1171
01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.390
<v Speaker 3>Little tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1172
01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.593
<v Speaker 3>things that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you don't do your life will be </v>

1173
01:04:15.311 --> 01:04:16.144
<v Speaker 3>worse at the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it was at the beginning who enough </v>

1174
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.620
<v Speaker 3>and some of those things you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1175
01:04:20.621 --> 01:04:23.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do those and okay fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I don't know why,</v>

1176
01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.140
<v Speaker 3>but some of them will be the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do that,</v>

1177
01:04:26.141 --> 01:04:29.770
<v Speaker 3>you know you should do them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're little things,</v>

1178
01:04:29.771 --> 01:04:30.604
<v Speaker 3>they're little things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you do 100,000 of those states </v>

1179
01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:37.120
<v Speaker 3>and everything will get pristine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful around you and that makes life</v>

1180
01:04:37.121 --> 01:04:37.954
<v Speaker 3>a lot more bearable and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of start distributing that around </v>

1181
01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.190
<v Speaker 3>and that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really helpful.</v>

1182
01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.470
<v Speaker 3>It's really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1183
01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:49.660
<v Speaker 3>so he need to know where you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully up rather than down.</v>

1184
01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:53.290
<v Speaker 3>And if you've got desire for doubt in </v>
<v Speaker 3>you then</v>

1185
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:56.223
<v Speaker 3>well then the first stream to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>notice at least to know that that's the </v>

1186
01:04:58.751 --> 01:05:00.400
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people are very destructive,</v>

1187
01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:01.443
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they will hurt and they need to </v>

1188
01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:05.530
<v Speaker 3>destroy it and so that's part of you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to.</v>

1189
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.570
<v Speaker 3>You have to grapple with that and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to decide if that's what you want.</v>

1190
01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.220
<v Speaker 3>I would say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all there is to it.</v>

1191
01:05:15.221 --> 01:05:16.900
<v Speaker 3>You have to decide if that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1192
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:18.183
<v Speaker 3>What does you notice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you decide that and you tried </v>

1193
01:05:20.101 --> 01:05:22.840
<v Speaker 3>it or anything so that and start </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching,</v>

1194
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.890
<v Speaker 3>watching what makes you strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes you.</v>

1195
01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:27.733
<v Speaker 3>We'd do the things that make you strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stopped doing the things that make </v>

1196
01:05:30.701 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 3>you wait and while you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to make things better.</v>

1197
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.733
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in a grandiose way because what the </v>

1198
01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:38.374
<v Speaker 3>hell do you know if you don't want us to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix everything because you're just </v>

1199
01:05:41.321 --> 01:05:44.410
<v Speaker 3>screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to fix a few things around that</v>

1200
01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:45.244
<v Speaker 3>are within your realm of competence that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know absolutely that you could make </v>

1201
01:05:48.161 --> 01:05:50.170
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might not move.</v>

1202
01:05:50.171 --> 01:05:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

1203
01:05:51.671 --> 01:05:53.580
<v Speaker 3>You have the confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how to do it.</v>

1204
01:05:53.581 --> 01:05:56.540
<v Speaker 3>A child comes up in their car or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>they tell down,</v>

1205
01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.580
<v Speaker 3>you give them a hug and pat them on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>head and you know that works.</v>

1206
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:01.631
<v Speaker 3>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1207
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:03.280
<v Speaker 3>so that's something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>competent to do,</v>

1208
01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:05.230
<v Speaker 3>so that's the right thing to do in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

1209
01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:06.373
<v Speaker 3>You know</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a discussion about that </v>

1210
01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:10.624
<v Speaker 3>because it's already established and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of things that you guys </v>

1211
01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:13.523
<v Speaker 3>already know that are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you do that micro steps and sunsets </v>

1212
01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.153
<v Speaker 3>and then you stand back and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>some faith and faith is the willingness </v>

1213
01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:29.791
<v Speaker 3>to try that to see little while that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all because there's no proof like,</v>

1214
01:06:30.701 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you about this but I can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>prove it within the confines of your own</v>

1215
01:06:35.021 --> 01:06:35.854
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you have to manage faith that </v>

1216
01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:44.700
<v Speaker 3>things could possibly be right</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's an act of courage and then</v>

1217
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.433
<v Speaker 3>the things around you sort themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and hopefully they sort themselves </v>

1218
01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:53.163
<v Speaker 3>out for you in a way that also sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>them out for other people and then </v>

1219
01:06:56.861 --> 01:06:59.560
<v Speaker 3>things get better and maybe as they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

1220
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:00.394
<v Speaker 3>we won't be so concerned about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible things are because you've got </v>

1221
01:07:03.601 --> 01:07:06.910
<v Speaker 3>to say was so bloody creative and </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

1222
01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:08.493
<v Speaker 3>If everybody on the planet was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>laying things out as fast and hard as </v>

1223
01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:12.830
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1224
01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:15.070
<v Speaker 3>we'd solve every problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no time flat.</v>

1225
01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:17.053
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like a good deal for beats </v>

1226
01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.633
<v Speaker 3>complaining about how miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wretched and destructive human beings </v>

1227
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.580
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1228
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:29.510
<v Speaker 3>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

1229
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:33.170
<v Speaker 3>It's not a sign of ethics to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite the contrary.</v>

1230
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:38.700
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to save all of that.</v>

1231
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.510
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to have questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1232
01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:41.623
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1233
01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Thank</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1234
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:56.063
<v Speaker 3>What I'm going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to answer questions that I </v>

1235
01:07:59.381 --> 01:08:02.630
<v Speaker 3>haven't answered the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's either because</v>

1236
01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:09.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm too tired or I can't formulate </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable as</v>

1237
01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:13.443
<v Speaker 3>morally right to bring people into </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence without consent and knowing </v>

1238
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 3>that they will inevitably injured or </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering during their life.</v>

1239
01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it selfish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good question.</v>

1240
01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:22.173
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolstoy asked that question in his </v>

1241
01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:27.103
<v Speaker 3>confessions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're interested in an answer to </v>

1242
01:08:29.131 --> 01:08:29.964
<v Speaker 3>that question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I would recommend you </v>

1243
01:08:32.031 --> 01:08:35.590
<v Speaker 3>read that book because that was Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 3>historically should be looked at life.</v>

1244
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.600
<v Speaker 3>And he taught</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he tells this story.</v>

1245
01:08:46.311 --> 01:08:51.050
<v Speaker 3>It's a story about this guy in the field</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's being chased by people who want</v>

1246
01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:51.884
<v Speaker 3>to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he jumps into this hole and he's </v>

1247
01:08:54.561 --> 01:08:56.390
<v Speaker 3>hanging on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like an old.</v>

1248
01:08:56.391 --> 01:08:57.224
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's hanging on for dear life is </v>

1249
01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.673
<v Speaker 3>scratching and at the bottom of the hole</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a crocodile and so he's heading </v>

1250
01:09:05.511 --> 01:09:07.520
<v Speaker 3>on there will always had you gone.</v>

1251
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:10.580
<v Speaker 3>He noticed there's two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some grapes on the vine and then</v>

1252
01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:11.414
<v Speaker 3>there's about two nice ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the black mouths and one's white Nelson </v>

1253
01:09:13.871 --> 01:09:17.930
<v Speaker 3>and they're on either side if the and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're chewing through it so he knows</v>

1254
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.470
<v Speaker 3>he can get out and detail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taylor,</v>

1255
01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:23.440
<v Speaker 3>you can fall and get killed or he could </v>
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>

1256
01:09:24.690 --> 01:09:25.523
<v Speaker 3>So what do you guys eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The grapes and it's a Buddhist story </v>

1257
01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:30.363
<v Speaker 3>that was story because the white mouse </v>
<v Speaker 3>is chaos or order in a black house is </v>

1258
01:09:33.471 --> 01:09:36.740
<v Speaker 3>chaos and there's always things working </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the of being.</v>

1259
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.940
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about it and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're screwed no matter what you do,</v>

1260
01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.790
<v Speaker 3>which is the moral of that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told a story,</v>

1261
01:09:43.791 --> 01:09:45.050
<v Speaker 3>looked at that story and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1262
01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:45.884
<v Speaker 3>the only logical conclusion that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>draw from that is that life is so </v>

1263
01:09:48.801 --> 01:09:53.801
<v Speaker 3>terrible that it shouldn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hey,</v>

1264
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.130
<v Speaker 3>dusty dsts the same question in probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>just chromosome.</v>

1265
01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:02.870
<v Speaker 3>You have this character named Ivan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a smart goodwill being tough guy,</v>

1266
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.240
<v Speaker 3>good intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptive,</v>

1267
01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.710
<v Speaker 3>and he has this revenue down the Osha </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's kind of.</v>

1268
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.860
<v Speaker 3>He's a soft diet in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not an intellect,</v>

1269
01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:13.694
<v Speaker 3>but it was really a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the just kind of classically </v>

1270
01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:16.724
<v Speaker 3>religious and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to be a novitiate in the </v>

1271
01:10:18.511 --> 01:10:23.511
<v Speaker 3>monastery and I just to bed because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>can blow over with his intellect,</v>

1272
01:10:23.931 --> 01:10:24.764
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can tell us the story about the </v>

1273
01:10:29.961 --> 01:10:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took the newspaper,</v>

1274
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:33.860
<v Speaker 3>this family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mother and father,</v>

1275
01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:35.893
<v Speaker 3>they were angry at their four year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter and a locked her house </v>

1276
01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:42.460
<v Speaker 3>overnight and she was screaming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and she froze to death.</v>

1277
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:43.843
<v Speaker 3>It was news and in Moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can basically says to Leo should </v>

1278
01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:50.763
<v Speaker 3>know who's making the case for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>goodness of being of the goodness of </v>

1279
01:10:53.421 --> 01:10:53.880
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

1280
01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.180
<v Speaker 3>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to look at it,</v>

1281
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.083
<v Speaker 3>and I've been so you bothered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you even dare to make $9 like </v>

1282
01:10:58.791 --> 01:11:00.020
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

1283
01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.730
<v Speaker 3>this is the sort of thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the brain all the time,</v>

1284
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.050
<v Speaker 3>and then you ask somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1285
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:09.470
<v Speaker 3>should look when you be willing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntary departure,</v>

1286
01:11:09.471 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 3>that girl to death to ensure that things</v>
<v Speaker 3>would continue.</v>

1287
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1288
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:19.140
<v Speaker 3>I what I know you wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

1289
01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.400
<v Speaker 3>what's your conclusion about that being </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't exist?</v>

1290
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:24.683
<v Speaker 3>And then that asks the same question in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a firehouse is character in that have </v>

1291
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.110
<v Speaker 3>met the software,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1292
01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:33.013
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's kind of the intellectual ankle of </v>

1293
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:36.220
<v Speaker 3>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of thinking about it</v>

1294
01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.790
<v Speaker 3>and he says the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's talking about his motivations.</v>

1295
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:42.361
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1296
01:11:42.361 --> 01:11:45.050
<v Speaker 3>what motivates the great adversary of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mankind?</v>

1297
01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.273
<v Speaker 3>And if it says it's straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being so terrible that it should be </v>

1298
01:11:50.011 --> 01:11:52.530
<v Speaker 3>eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1299
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.990
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strong</v>

1300
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:57.660
<v Speaker 3>people try it.</v>

1301
01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:01.890
<v Speaker 3>It's not clear to me that that's where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we should go.</v>

1302
01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:04.873
<v Speaker 3>So because as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people work for the eradication of </v>

1303
01:12:07.321 --> 01:12:08.154
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes everything that they're </v>

1304
01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:10.850
<v Speaker 3>complaining about way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worst,</v>

1305
01:12:10.851 --> 01:12:11.684
<v Speaker 3>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then the other thing you might </v>

1306
01:12:13.891 --> 01:12:16.260
<v Speaker 3>ask yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that's the motivation?</v>

1307
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:21.740
<v Speaker 3>It's really so purehearted no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to destroy mankind to save</v>

1308
01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:23.603
<v Speaker 3>and then making a judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The judgment is being is so terrible </v>

1309
01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:27.120
<v Speaker 3>that it shouldn't do exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1310
01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:27.983
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the rationale for that is either </v>

1311
01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.373
<v Speaker 3>his rationale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was never put more strongly than in </v>

1312
01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:34.980
<v Speaker 3>the brothers Karamazov.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a famous passage and writing.</v>

1313
01:12:34.981 --> 01:12:35.814
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question here was with regards to </v>

1314
01:12:38.401 --> 01:12:40.180
<v Speaker 3>bringing children into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1315
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:43.450
<v Speaker 3>it's a variation of the same question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1316
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:46.620
<v Speaker 3>the question is what do you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclude if you're not going to do it,</v>

1317
01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:50.750
<v Speaker 3>you're completely with but is not with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the being is not justifiable.</v>

1318
01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a hell of a conclusion.</v>

1319
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:56.833
<v Speaker 3>I would be very careful before I made it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there are places it takes you </v>

1320
01:12:59.761 --> 01:13:02.190
<v Speaker 3>that a not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1321
01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.133
<v Speaker 3>And then you might also ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you so sure that you're asking that </v>

1322
01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:09.960
<v Speaker 3>question just because you're a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>person or you maybe asking that question</v>

1323
01:13:09.961 --> 01:13:14.961
<v Speaker 3>because you don't want to say of having </v>
<v Speaker 3>a child in his finger and said are maybe</v>

1324
01:13:15.481 --> 01:13:18.210
<v Speaker 3>you're afraid that you won't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fortify the child property.</v>

1325
01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:20.520
<v Speaker 3>So you're withdrawing fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

1326
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do with children?</v>

1327
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.233
<v Speaker 3>Does you encouraged them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean that literally it's like a </v>

1328
01:13:29.401 --> 01:13:31.040
<v Speaker 3>little kid and he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>

1329
01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:31.883
<v Speaker 3>you can take on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you don't sugarcoat it just like </v>

1330
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:35.550
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all</v>

1331
01:13:37.190 --> 01:13:41.710
<v Speaker 3>fairy tales and roses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the old Sheila is.</v>

1332
01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.560
<v Speaker 3>She opens enough so you don't damage </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1333
01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.393
<v Speaker 3>It's a really tight because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to know why overwhelmed someone </v>

1334
01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:49.163
<v Speaker 3>hurt them while you're teaching them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to expose him gradually and </v>

1335
01:13:51.331 --> 01:13:52.164
<v Speaker 3>with intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do that by having a relationship </v>

1336
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:54.443
<v Speaker 3>with a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to shield them from </v>

1337
01:13:55.471 --> 01:13:58.290
<v Speaker 3>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to show them just what it's like</v>

1338
01:13:58.470 --> 01:14:00.510
<v Speaker 3>and then you want to tell them it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter,</v>

1339
01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.070
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're tough enough.</v>

1340
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.030
<v Speaker 3>You can do it and you can do it right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's true.</v>

1341
01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.340
<v Speaker 3>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you,</v>

1342
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:11.290
<v Speaker 3>if you fortify them with that knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter are,</v>

1343
01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.313
<v Speaker 3>they're being is not characterized by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of suffering that makes </v>

1344
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:16.623
<v Speaker 3>existence intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the answer is not to have </v>

1345
01:14:19.691 --> 01:14:21.100
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The answer is</v>

1346
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:26.650
<v Speaker 3>cooperative and encourage them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's tough because you don't.</v>

1347
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:29.950
<v Speaker 3>You're kind of fragment had been broken </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you treat your child right,</v>

1348
01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:33.520
<v Speaker 3>they might exceed me and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>annoying,</v>

1349
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:36.180
<v Speaker 3>so you made you everything.</v>

1350
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.013
<v Speaker 3>You can bloody well made sure that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid is broken enough so there's no way </v>

1351
01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:40.660
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do it any better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1352
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:44.650
<v Speaker 3>and so I wouldn't recommend that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people do it all the time,</v>

1353
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:48.010
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that existence </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself is insufficient.</v>

1354
01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.033
<v Speaker 3>It just means that you're not handling </v>
<v Speaker 3>the property and you're making it far </v>

1355
01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:52.933
<v Speaker 3>worse than it has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I asked myself a long </v>

1356
01:14:55.301 --> 01:14:57.580
<v Speaker 3>time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1357
01:14:57.581 --> 01:14:58.414
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy and that's an important </v>

1358
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:01.834
<v Speaker 3>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tragedy is when things happen that </v>

1359
01:15:04.241 --> 01:15:07.590
<v Speaker 3>aren't good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone gets canceled.</v>

1360
01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:09.533
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm your child slips and breaks his or </v>

1361
01:15:11.981 --> 01:15:14.830
<v Speaker 3>her leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know your parents die.</v>

1362
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:15.843
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Evil is when something tragic happens </v>

1363
01:15:19.511 --> 01:15:22.390
<v Speaker 3>because someone wanted to tap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1364
01:15:22.391 --> 01:15:24.230
<v Speaker 3>so we can distinguish between your </v>
<v Speaker 3>students.</v>

1365
01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:25.293
<v Speaker 3>The first thing I would say is people </v>
<v Speaker 3>can have a tragedy like you can get </v>

1366
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:29.590
<v Speaker 3>tough enough so you can have.</v>

1367
01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.980
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can get tough enough so that</v>

1368
01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:35.220
<v Speaker 3>you even get tougher if you're exposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to trash.</v>

1369
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:37.210
<v Speaker 3>That sort of statement about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1370
01:15:37.211 --> 01:15:38.890
<v Speaker 3>whatever doesn't kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes me stronger.</v>

1371
01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Obviously itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an overstatement.</v>

1372
01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:46.390
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard for people to tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil level ones.</v>

1373
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:48.880
<v Speaker 3>So like I've seen people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1374
01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.970
<v Speaker 3>because that adolescent clients with </v>
<v Speaker 3>posttraumatic stress disorder there very</v>

1375
01:15:51.971 --> 01:15:54.480
<v Speaker 3>often traumatized by malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not trashy.</v>

1376
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:55.783
<v Speaker 3>They fall victim to someone who wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt and maybe it's even been self that </v>

1377
01:15:59.741 --> 01:16:01.600
<v Speaker 3>wants to hurt them and that's revealed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to them,</v>

1378
01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:02.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes it's that they come into </v>

1379
01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:04.883
<v Speaker 3>their often naive people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come into contact with someone </v>

1380
01:16:06.611 --> 01:16:07.444
<v Speaker 3>whose purpose is to hurt them and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shadows so badly they can't put </v>

1381
01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:13.900
<v Speaker 3>themselves back together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Evils really devastating.</v>

1382
01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:14.973
<v Speaker 3>I think human beings can tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy and I also think that if people </v>

1383
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:22.130
<v Speaker 3>oriented themselves towards the </v>
<v Speaker 3>improvement of being,</v>

1384
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:24.700
<v Speaker 3>we could continually ameliorate tragedy.</v>

1385
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 3>And I do also believe that being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>striving to perfect itself.</v>

1386
01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Now that's obviously a metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement,</v>

1387
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:34.990
<v Speaker 3>but I don't really care if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>medical metaphysical statement.</v>

1388
01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:35.824
<v Speaker 3>I have my reasons for for bleeding and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that the purpose of human life is </v>

1389
01:16:41.411 --> 01:16:46.180
<v Speaker 3>to participate in that process and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>

1390
01:16:46.181 --> 01:16:47.014
<v Speaker 3>the alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things are quite list and life is </v>

1391
01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:52.570
<v Speaker 3>suffering and it should be eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that leads nowhere.</v>

1392
01:16:52.571 --> 01:16:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Good really leads nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>

1393
01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.850
<v Speaker 3>so I can dispense with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better tasting.</v>

1394
01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:03.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like a bad roadmap because most </v>
<v Speaker 3>profound it is our roadmap.</v>

1395
01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:05.680
<v Speaker 3>They tell you how to get from one point </v>
<v Speaker 3>to another.</v>

1396
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.903
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to get to the depths of </v>

1397
01:17:08.321 --> 01:17:09.154
<v Speaker 3>infernal chaos or do you want to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards something that approximates </v>

1398
01:17:13.371 --> 01:17:14.660
<v Speaker 3>paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1399
01:17:14.661 --> 01:17:18.980
<v Speaker 3>he'd better make sure you have the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>map and so and most belief systems,</v>

1400
01:17:18.981 --> 01:17:19.814
<v Speaker 3>our roadmaps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're descriptions of reality </v>

1401
01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 3>description,</v>
<v Speaker 3>objective reality.</v>

1402
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:24.103
<v Speaker 3>There</v>
<v Speaker 3>are so have kids say it's one third of </v>

1403
01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:31.940
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will bloody won't regret it.</v>

1404
01:17:31.941 --> 01:17:34.900
<v Speaker 3>If you don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to make 20 or 30.</v>

1405
01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Some days you're going to be 50 or 55 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe it will be alone.</v>

1406
01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.880
<v Speaker 3>That's not so good and so you're a fool </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have kids.</v>

1407
01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1408
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:47.900
<v Speaker 3>I know people have their reasons and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people have appropriate reasons and</v>

1409
01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:50.180
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if somebody ideological hang up that</v>

1410
01:17:50.181 --> 01:17:51.170
<v Speaker 3>stopping you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ms Dot Donna,</v>

1411
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:55.220
<v Speaker 3>you better dispense with that instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of dispensing with the kids.</v>

1412
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Is there a book you could consider </v>
<v Speaker 3>essential reading?</v>

1413
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:03.403
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to ask that because after all </v>

1414
01:18:06.321 --> 01:18:07.154
<v Speaker 3>you are at university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should read Dostoyevsky's five </v>

1415
01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.310
<v Speaker 3>grades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're unparalleled.</v>

1416
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:17.000
<v Speaker 3>So that's notes from underground crime </v>
<v Speaker 3>and punishment.</v>

1417
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 3>The possessor of the devils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on the translation.</v>

1418
01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:23.380
<v Speaker 3>The brothers grounds off the idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also one called the adolescence,</v>

1419
01:18:23.381 --> 01:18:28.381
<v Speaker 3>so I missed there sits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so any of Dostoyevsky's great novels.</v>

1420
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:29.383
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't not read their key pieces in </v>

1421
01:18:34.311 --> 01:18:38.110
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the psychology of I'm</v>

1422
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn's Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a nature book.</v>

1423
01:18:45.381 --> 01:18:46.214
<v Speaker 3>Math and that's the description of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences inside the prison camps and </v>

1424
01:18:50.271 --> 01:18:52.250
<v Speaker 3>that book helped bring down the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 3>Union.</v>

1425
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 3>It destroyed the intellectual and moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>credibility of communism.</v>

1426
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:56.833
<v Speaker 3>It was an atom bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing and he memorized it 2,700 </v>

1427
01:19:00.891 --> 01:19:01.724
<v Speaker 3>pages long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's hard to manage because it's </v>

1428
01:19:05.811 --> 01:19:09.610
<v Speaker 3>nothing but atrocity in terror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's.</v>

1429
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.380
<v Speaker 3>There's no shying away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1430
01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:14.040
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is one thing that I really like</v>

1431
01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:19.041
<v Speaker 3>about it most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the novels or intellectual or moral</v>

1432
01:19:20.271 --> 01:19:21.104
<v Speaker 3>doubts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a better way of thinking about </v>

1433
01:19:22.561 --> 01:19:23.660
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1434
01:19:23.661 --> 01:19:25.910
<v Speaker 3>most of the time when you hear people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an argument,</v>

1435
01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:27.523
<v Speaker 3>they do tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let's say you and I are going to </v>

1436
01:19:28.911 --> 01:19:29.744
<v Speaker 3>happen on argument about something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I'm going to do is </v>

1437
01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.593
<v Speaker 3>listen to what you say and then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to create a stupid form of it and </v>

1438
01:19:35.091 --> 01:19:37.010
<v Speaker 3>then I'm going to destroy that stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>form.</v>

1439
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.350
<v Speaker 3>And when you try to object,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to into Robert.</v>

1440
01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.090
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

1441
01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:43.100
<v Speaker 3>that's the straw man argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1442
01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:48.120
<v Speaker 3>What I should be doing is I shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to and if you're not very good</v>

1443
01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:50.810
<v Speaker 3>at formulating your arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should help you formulate them.</v>

1444
01:19:50.811 --> 01:19:51.644
<v Speaker 3>So they come out as clearly as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly can and then we should have a </v>

1445
01:19:54.471 --> 01:19:55.940
<v Speaker 3>discussion to see where we go.</v>

1446
01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.170
<v Speaker 3>And that's what does doc does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He takes like his.</v>

1447
01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:02.750
<v Speaker 3>He was an Orthodox Christian and Russian</v>
<v Speaker 3>Orthodox Christian,</v>

1448
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.220
<v Speaker 3>his atheists man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are deadly atheists.</v>

1449
01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:08.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make it's look like a piker.</v>

1450
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Dorsey esd takes Ivan is a really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>

1451
01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:14.130
<v Speaker 3>That guy saw everything going for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really good looking.</v>

1452
01:20:14.131 --> 01:20:16.980
<v Speaker 3>He's really strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's your courageous like he's sharp,</v>

1453
01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:20.520
<v Speaker 3>he's admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fearless.</v>

1454
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:21.533
<v Speaker 3>He's a major contender and he formulates</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments in favor of atheism that are </v>

1455
01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.060
<v Speaker 3>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're almost,</v>

1456
01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:30.360
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our actually cannot write your rejoinder</v>

1457
01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:31.893
<v Speaker 3>while he does instead is he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He plays out the consequences of the </v>

1458
01:20:35.281 --> 01:20:36.114
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know as the characteristics and he </v>

1459
01:20:38.281 --> 01:20:39.114
<v Speaker 3>takes his other characters like that who</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't adopt that way of being and then </v>

1460
01:20:43.561 --> 01:20:47.070
<v Speaker 3>plays that out and shows them what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences are,</v>

1461
01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:51.120
<v Speaker 3>which is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you read brothers Karamazov</v>

1462
01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:55.660
<v Speaker 3>and then the possessed with the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you read who let her go,</v>

1463
01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:00.770
<v Speaker 3>you have the perfect merging of literary</v>
<v Speaker 3>or veterans</v>

1464
01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:03.633
<v Speaker 3>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the perfect marriage of </v>

1465
01:21:04.841 --> 01:21:05.674
<v Speaker 3>literature and history because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky says will happen and why it </v>

1466
01:21:09.761 --> 01:21:12.900
<v Speaker 3>happens is exactly what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just fun.</v>

1467
01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:13.753
<v Speaker 3>Broken sequence of moral revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Nike camp under you can hardly </v>

1468
01:21:19.901 --> 01:21:22.140
<v Speaker 3>overestimate the impact of soldier nets </v>
<v Speaker 3>is for.</v>

1469
01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:23.770
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wanted to know the price for it,</v>

1470
01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:27.510
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly he did more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

1471
01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Took out a tarion communism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the American,</v>

1472
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:34.580
<v Speaker 3>the American military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1473
01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:35.493
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying necessarily that the </v>

1474
01:21:36.461 --> 01:21:40.220
<v Speaker 3>American military was a major player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That boy,</v>

1475
01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.073
<v Speaker 3>I certainly think they work because </v>
<v Speaker 3>Stalin was perfectly willing to drop </v>

1476
01:21:44.331 --> 01:21:47.320
<v Speaker 3>into Europe with hydrogen bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1477
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:50.530
<v Speaker 3>he's a seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was seriously not a good guy.</v>

1478
01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:53.470
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>when.</v>

1479
01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those like,</v>

1480
01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:55.593
<v Speaker 3>those are absolutely necessary books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most books written by people who are </v>

1481
01:21:58.631 --> 01:22:03.420
<v Speaker 3>universally regarded as great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This</v>

1482
01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.110
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1483
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.943
<v Speaker 3>you hear this again on the edges of </v>
<v Speaker 3>literary criticism said the canonical </v>

1484
01:22:11.171 --> 01:22:12.004
<v Speaker 3>writings were selected because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>desires of the oppressive class or some </v>

1485
01:22:15.491 --> 01:22:18.300
<v Speaker 3>sort of absolute rubbish like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

1486
01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:24.723
<v Speaker 3>partly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not relevant because all these </v>

1487
01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:29.673
<v Speaker 3>people like pages and pages full of</v>
<v Speaker 3>derogatory comments about women know </v>

1488
01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.320
<v Speaker 3>they're not full of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they happen now.</v>

1489
01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's writing by yourself?</v>

1490
01:22:42.311 --> 01:22:43.440
<v Speaker 3>He was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really sick.</v>

1491
01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Never sold any books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so ill,</v>

1492
01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.480
<v Speaker 3>he could hardly write it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All confined is reading.</v>

1493
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:53.650
<v Speaker 3>Took like 10 minute bursts and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>isolated and alone,</v>

1494
01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:57.590
<v Speaker 3>so now I'm tired to resentful and wrote </v>
<v Speaker 3>something rude.</v>

1495
01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:00.450
<v Speaker 3>The guy had his off time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1496
01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Darlene was like for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1497
01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.210
<v Speaker 3>He was a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a full professor when he was here</v>

1498
01:23:05.211 --> 01:23:06.900
<v Speaker 3>as John.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1499
01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:09.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not pleasant,</v>

1500
01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:13.410
<v Speaker 3>but what you're supposed to do when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>read a grit work is</v>

1501
01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.713
<v Speaker 3>from the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know we're not supposed to noticed </v>

1502
01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.050
<v Speaker 3>one stupid thing and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1503
01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:22.340
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is rocking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's as fast.</v>

1504
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's faster.</v>

1505
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Here's so pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do that,</v>

1506
01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 3>you know when you read Freud and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1507
01:23:28.961 --> 01:23:32.470
<v Speaker 3>he wrote in the 80 90 [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of his ideas are outdated,</v>

1508
01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:34.350
<v Speaker 3>but what do you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 80,</v>

1509
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 3>what do you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1510
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:37.983
<v Speaker 3>so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you have to discard 20 percent of </v>

1511
01:23:39.611 --> 01:23:42.370
<v Speaker 3>it and you pulled in the other 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of your bloody lucky that the 80</v>

1512
01:23:42.371 --> 01:23:45.790
<v Speaker 3>percent is there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be reading not to get</v>

1513
01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:46.953
<v Speaker 3>rid of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you take the things that are </v>

1514
01:23:49.631 --> 01:23:51.760
<v Speaker 3>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I would say,</v>

1515
01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:53.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned a lot from reading Freud,</v>

1516
01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:54.463
<v Speaker 3>I learned a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tremendous amount from reading your </v>

1517
01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.040
<v Speaker 3>bio is so profound that it's through </v>
<v Speaker 3>unspeakable.</v>

1518
01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 3>It's no wonder they don't teach it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities like I'm serious,</v>

1519
01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:04.443
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy was,</v>

1520
01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:05.293
<v Speaker 3>he was a whole different form of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's terrifying you only as the </v>

1521
01:24:10.391 --> 01:24:11.224
<v Speaker 3>person who will convince you that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are things going on in your head that </v>

1522
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:15.790
<v Speaker 3>have nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is not</v>

1523
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:17.303
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

1524
01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.210
<v Speaker 3>that isn't one of those things that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>designed to make you sleep easily.</v>

1525
01:24:24.211 --> 01:24:27.170
<v Speaker 3>At night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogers,</v>

1526
01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.380
<v Speaker 3>I learned a lot from Carl Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the great clinicians,</v>

1527
01:24:31.381 --> 01:24:32.214
<v Speaker 3>they already have something to say and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and practical to say that will help you </v>

1528
01:24:35.051 --> 01:24:37.470
<v Speaker 3>live your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Orwell,</v>

1529
01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:38.550
<v Speaker 3>Elvis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huxley.</v>

1530
01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1531
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:48.320
<v Speaker 3>well that's not that start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

1532
01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.910
<v Speaker 3>if it's part of the Canon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1533
01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:52.720
<v Speaker 3>especially the literary Canon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can assume that there's something to</v>

1534
01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:55.150
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you could also assume that if you</v>

1535
01:24:55.151 --> 01:24:57.730
<v Speaker 3>read it and you don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably you.</v>

1536
01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.133
<v Speaker 3>So fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what does forgiving yourself </v>

1537
01:25:01.811 --> 01:25:06.811
<v Speaker 3>look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one,</v>

1538
01:25:11.571 --> 01:25:15.780
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the best strategy?</v>

1539
01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.633
<v Speaker 3>Can help people</v>

1540
01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.560
<v Speaker 2>get your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead by example,</v>

1541
01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:27.050
<v Speaker 3>and then if somebody comes and asks you </v>
<v Speaker 3>for your opinion,</v>

1542
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:29.040
<v Speaker 3>tell them the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1543
01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:32.180
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing I never liked someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1544
01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:35.090
<v Speaker 3>psychological trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll just make it worse,</v>

1545
01:25:35.091 --> 01:25:35.924
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're of on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia ends up things do not lie </v>

1546
01:25:38.811 --> 01:25:42.540
<v Speaker 3>to them because they're very clinging to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality as it is and if you,</v>

1547
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:43.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're already courtney structured in </v>

1548
01:25:47.101 --> 01:25:49.980
<v Speaker 3>some sense he dropped a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive to that,</v>

1549
01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:54.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's hard to tell the truth.</v>

1550
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:55.373
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's tricky because you have to be </v>

1551
01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.630
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth sort of at all levels </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time.</v>

1552
01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.820
<v Speaker 3>And also it has to be reworded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be right.</v>

1553
01:26:01.821 --> 01:26:03.750
<v Speaker 3>The phrase has to be right in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>semester.</v>

1554
01:26:03.751 --> 01:26:07.910
<v Speaker 3>We write paragraphs to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dialogue between the two of us to be</v>

1555
01:26:07.911 --> 01:26:08.744
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be oriented in the right </v>

1556
01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:10.334
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all of those things have to be </v>

1557
01:26:11.301 --> 01:26:13.450
<v Speaker 3>happening at the same time for it to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>

1558
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:14.383
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise you could say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's destructive just so </v>

1559
01:26:17.411 --> 01:26:18.244
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>filled the demands of the darkest part </v>

1560
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:23.090
<v Speaker 3>of your being and then you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well was true.</v>

1561
01:26:23.091 --> 01:26:23.601
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1562
01:26:23.601 --> 01:26:24.950
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was true.</v>

1563
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:25.784
<v Speaker 3>I had one tiny level of analysis and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is usually off the </v>

1564
01:26:28.311 --> 01:26:29.144
<v Speaker 3>street to demonstrate your moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>superiority would actually interacting </v>

1565
01:26:32.031 --> 01:26:37.031
<v Speaker 3>in a Mrs. Steve messed up</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

1566
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:43.250
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening is really useful too.</v>

1567
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:44.510
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

1568
01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.700
<v Speaker 3>So you mentioned that part of us wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make things worse.</v>

1569
01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:54.701
<v Speaker 3>What exactly do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there anybody here in this room who's</v>

1570
01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:01.900
<v Speaker 3>actually never wanted to hurt someone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1571
01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:05.750
<v Speaker 3>people</v>
<v Speaker 3>look deeper.</v>

1572
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:10.130
<v Speaker 3>How about yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

1573
01:27:10.131 --> 01:27:15.131
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to answer that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason that there are people,</v>

1574
01:27:15.951 --> 01:27:16.784
<v Speaker 3>one make things worse fundamentally is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they get irritated that the </v>

1575
01:27:19.341 --> 01:27:21.320
<v Speaker 3>structure of being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1576
01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:22.213
<v Speaker 3>we get tortured by da because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>soccer and then they get resentful and </v>

1577
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:27.800
<v Speaker 3>angry and then they want to take it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>on someone.</v>

1578
01:27:28.190 --> 01:27:29.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you really see that,</v>

1579
01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:32.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the US has an epidemic of mass shootings</v>

1580
01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.330
<v Speaker 3>were happening so often I need to record</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1581
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:41.500
<v Speaker 3>was doing that resentful people who want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make things worse and they're people,</v>

1582
01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.220
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know exactly like you,</v>

1583
01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:52.260
<v Speaker 3>but they're quite a bit like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you can't imagine what they're</v>

1584
01:27:52.281 --> 01:27:53.630
<v Speaker 3>doing and why that.</v>

1585
01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:54.553
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing I would say is you don't know </v>

1586
01:27:55.131 --> 01:27:55.964
<v Speaker 3>very much about yourself and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually not watching very carefully </v>

1587
01:27:58.071 --> 01:28:01.260
<v Speaker 3>because I mean I think I might have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>darker side,</v>

1588
01:28:01.261 --> 01:28:02.094
<v Speaker 3>but most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean be inclined to believe that from </v>

1589
01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.350
<v Speaker 3>time to time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1590
01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:11.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you watch yourself,</v>

1591
01:28:11.631 --> 01:28:13.550
<v Speaker 3>you can see how you want to hurt all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1592
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:16.850
<v Speaker 3>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet it happens 50 times a week.</v>

1593
01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to win an argument with someone</v>

1594
01:28:21.561 --> 01:28:23.060
<v Speaker 3>you love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good example.</v>

1595
01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:25.430
<v Speaker 3>You don't listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not trying to solve the problem.</v>

1596
01:28:25.431 --> 01:28:29.030
<v Speaker 3>You just want to win an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's not very helpful.</v>

1597
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.650
<v Speaker 3>It makes things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1598
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:35.210
<v Speaker 3>and this isn't my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it is my opinion,</v>

1599
01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the oldest stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1600
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.373
<v Speaker 3>there's a few very old stories of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mankind and one of them is that there's </v>

1601
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:45.680
<v Speaker 3>a battle between good and evil going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the human soul.</v>

1602
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:46.723
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As right as people can make as it's as </v>

1603
01:28:51.111 --> 01:28:53.420
<v Speaker 3>right as people can state it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

1604
01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:54.231
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1605
01:28:54.231 --> 01:28:59.231
<v Speaker 3>you know how you define good</v>
<v Speaker 3>Auschwitz.</v>

1606
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.170
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to have that discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1607
01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to know a bit about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal ideal.</v>

1608
01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.310
<v Speaker 3>What are your longterm goals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What motivates you in your life?</v>

1609
01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:24.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mind,</v>

1610
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:31.190
<v Speaker 3>what motivates us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's I think fairly strict.</v>

1611
01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.690
<v Speaker 3>All sorts of motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

1612
01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.700
<v Speaker 3>nate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>major motivations.</v>

1613
01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:41.030
<v Speaker 3>I like to figure out what the hell is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on and communicate it.</v>

1614
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:43.370
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

1615
01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:48.940
<v Speaker 3>I believe that I've done my best to </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually pursue the truth and,</v>

1616
01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:54.990
<v Speaker 3>and it's so useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so useful.</v>

1617
01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:59.070
<v Speaker 3>It's so fun to communicate to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things I see,</v>

1618
01:29:59.071 --> 01:30:01.320
<v Speaker 3>and this is gonna be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I talked to the audience,</v>

1619
01:30:01.321 --> 01:30:03.830
<v Speaker 3>it's so cool because lights go on it.</v>

1620
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:09.180
<v Speaker 3>That's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I see that all the time,</v>

1621
01:30:09.181 --> 01:30:11.320
<v Speaker 3>if I really communicating to an audience</v>
<v Speaker 3>because someone,</v>

1622
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:13.620
<v Speaker 3>people like that and then the nod and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think yes,</v>

1623
01:30:13.621 --> 01:30:15.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or a bunch of connections,</v>

1624
01:30:15.061 --> 01:30:15.894
<v Speaker 3>just throwing stuff together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the person got a little blast </v>

1625
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:20.710
<v Speaker 3>that's like turning on lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1626
01:30:20.711 --> 01:30:23.100
<v Speaker 3>And so that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fun.</v>

1627
01:30:23.970 --> 01:30:26.480
<v Speaker 3>So that's my longterm goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1628
01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Turn on lots of lights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:31.883
<v Speaker 3>What motivates me in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would really rather than things </v>

1630
01:30:34.751 --> 01:30:39.751
<v Speaker 3>couldn't get as bad as they could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's motivated me</v>

1631
01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:44.000
<v Speaker 3>since like 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long,</v>

1632
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:44.641
<v Speaker 3>19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>80.</v>

1633
01:30:44.641 --> 01:30:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Probably because it was in the height of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Cold War,</v>

1634
01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:48.174
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things did not look good and I just </v>

1635
01:30:49.981 --> 01:30:52.880
<v Speaker 3>started to read about the history of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>20th century.</v>

1636
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:56.940
<v Speaker 3>God</v>
<v Speaker 3>so terrible.</v>

1637
01:30:58.590 --> 01:31:00.870
<v Speaker 3>And like I would just wrap it up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>

1638
01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:02.550
<v Speaker 3>It seems unnecessary.</v>

1639
01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:08.180
<v Speaker 3>So whatever I could do to make that even</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat less likely to happen again,</v>

1640
01:31:08.701 --> 01:31:10.050
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

1641
01:31:10.051 --> 01:31:15.051
<v Speaker 3>And I don't question that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it seems so wrong.</v>

1642
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:17.993
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the story that really stuck </v>

1643
01:31:20.551 --> 01:31:24.090
<v Speaker 3>with me and there was this story about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1644
01:31:24.091 --> 01:31:24.924
<v Speaker 3>our switch was a big city basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a huge place and one of the </v>

1645
01:31:28.831 --> 01:31:32.190
<v Speaker 3>things that gardens used to do was when </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people were unloaded,</v>

1646
01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:34.333
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were separating families and </v>

1647
01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:36.443
<v Speaker 3>anybody who didn't look like they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be useful to do a bunch of </v>

1648
01:31:38.131 --> 01:31:41.760
<v Speaker 3>useful score before they died would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>just sent off to the gas chambers.</v>

1649
01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:48.120
<v Speaker 3>And so that's pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginative and uh,</v>

1650
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:52.910
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1651
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:53.783
<v Speaker 3>because if you did survive</v>
<v Speaker 3>even after having lost everything like </v>

1652
01:31:57.781 --> 01:32:00.430
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there was always the opportunity to</v>

1653
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:01.353
<v Speaker 3>purchase you with useless work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the tricks of the guards was </v>

1654
01:32:04.691 --> 01:32:05.524
<v Speaker 3>to make people pick up a sack of salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are 100 pounds and carry it from one </v>

1655
01:32:09.131 --> 01:32:11.760
<v Speaker 3>side of the camp to be up and then back.</v>

1656
01:32:13.710 --> 01:32:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>

1657
01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:21.580
<v Speaker 3>You know what evil is an aesthetic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a sense of humor.</v>

1658
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:23.783
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sign over Auschwitz read work will </v>

1659
01:32:25.961 --> 01:32:26.560
<v Speaker 3>make</v>

1660
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:27.393
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1661
01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:31.293
<v Speaker 3>That's a joke by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the mutual assured </v>

1662
01:32:34.361 --> 01:32:35.194
<v Speaker 3>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The geopolitical idea in the 19 sixties </v>

1663
01:32:43.191 --> 01:32:45.100
<v Speaker 3>and fifties was mutual assured </v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction.</v>

1664
01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:47.510
<v Speaker 3>When you launched your weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're done,</v>

1665
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:50.570
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing left in the afternoon is</v>

1666
01:32:50.571 --> 01:32:52.910
<v Speaker 3>math.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's a joke.</v>

1667
01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:58.310
<v Speaker 3>It's a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not funny and you know that's.</v>

1668
01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.430
<v Speaker 3>That's a place where you see the art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the archetype of evil,</v>

1669
01:33:01.710 --> 01:33:06.110
<v Speaker 3>urge in the midst of the geopolitical </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate to emerge from the pit,</v>

1670
01:33:06.111 --> 01:33:08.090
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your job like that,</v>

1671
01:33:08.091 --> 01:33:11.630
<v Speaker 3>and then to retrieve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1672
01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:14.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worth the fight.</v>

1673
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:30.380
<v Speaker 3>We should decide someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When do we stop?</v>

1674
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:32.110
<v Speaker 3>One more question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1675
01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:32.993
<v Speaker 3>One more question.</v>

1676
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.433
<v Speaker 3>How do you compromise making it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you becoming successful while being </v>

1677
01:33:53.071 --> 01:33:55.330
<v Speaker 3>true to yourself and not falling into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the system?</v>

1678
01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Pretty question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an existential question.</v>

1679
01:34:00.191 --> 01:34:01.024
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason I framed it that way just </v>

1680
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:03.783
<v Speaker 3>because it's an eternal question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the question that human </v>

1681
01:34:07.181 --> 01:34:09.730
<v Speaker 3>beings have always had to face no matter</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1682
01:34:09.731 --> 01:34:12.730
<v Speaker 3>no matter where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the system is always corrupt.</v>

1683
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.943
<v Speaker 3>It's always corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an archetype stuck to the old </v>

1684
01:34:16.421 --> 01:34:20.590
<v Speaker 3>dead evil and the reason it's corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two reasons,</v>

1685
01:34:20.591 --> 01:34:24.790
<v Speaker 3>one is it started with Dave and because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's lighting behind the present and the</v>

1686
01:34:24.791 --> 01:34:25.624
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

1687
01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:26.493
<v Speaker 3>it's just design for the wrong era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of it and they never part </v>

1688
01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:31.073
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People aren't updating it because they </v>

1689
01:34:32.031 --> 01:34:35.450
<v Speaker 3>were willfully blind tartar away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1690
01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:38.470
<v Speaker 3>and so now if you align with it too </v>
<v Speaker 3>tightly,</v>

1691
01:34:38.471 --> 01:34:41.770
<v Speaker 3>then you risk becoming a carbon copy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1692
01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:45.520
<v Speaker 3>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is it's one side who's upset.</v>

1693
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:47.380
<v Speaker 3>So this is a really important thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn.</v>

1694
01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.990
<v Speaker 3>He first he is the culture is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical cane,</v>

1695
01:34:51.991 --> 01:34:54.220
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the vice kate and at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time,</v>

1696
01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:55.054
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're obviously the press by the </v>

1697
01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:58.490
<v Speaker 3>University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1698
01:34:58.490 --> 01:35:03.490
<v Speaker 3>here you are and so you're unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>privileged at the same time you're being</v>

1699
01:35:03.651 --> 01:35:07.190
<v Speaker 3>torn apart and that's exactly what it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to live within a culture.</v>

1700
01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're lucky if you're lucky,</v>

1701
01:35:09.981 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 3>if all that's happening is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not being torn apart because the typical</v>

1702
01:35:14.630 --> 01:35:17.550
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all it does is to create a lot.</v>

1703
01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:18.413
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't do anything good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least you can sit here and relevant </v>

1704
01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:23.000
<v Speaker 3>piece and say what you want lights are </v>
<v Speaker 3>on and it's warm,</v>

1705
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's actually pretty good.</v>

1706
01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.113
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand is that you need to be </v>

1707
01:35:28.401 --> 01:35:29.690
<v Speaker 3>grateful to the system.</v>

1708
01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:33.770
<v Speaker 3>It's given you everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's taking away a lot too.</v>

1709
01:35:33.771 --> 01:35:35.470
<v Speaker 3>But that's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1710
01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:36.403
<v Speaker 3>that's the existential issue is games </v>
<v Speaker 3>with one hand and takes away with the </v>

1711
01:35:39.021 --> 01:35:39.854
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the trick is how to not become </v>

1712
01:35:41.601 --> 01:35:43.700
<v Speaker 3>corrupt by identification with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

1713
01:35:43.701 --> 01:35:46.570
<v Speaker 3>It's how to balance balance gratitude </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

1714
01:35:46.630 --> 01:35:49.670
<v Speaker 3>with the awareness and the desire to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make change.</v>

1715
01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:54.830
<v Speaker 3>And that actually is being represented </v>
<v Speaker 3>in religious thought in many ways.</v>

1716
01:35:54.831 --> 01:35:56.690
<v Speaker 3>So with the ancient Egyptians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1717
01:35:56.691 --> 01:36:00.650
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they represented the system with the god</v>

1718
01:36:00.651 --> 01:36:05.651
<v Speaker 3>or Cyrus who was old and blind and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely to fall under evil influenced and</v>

1719
01:36:06.411 --> 01:36:09.410
<v Speaker 3>the different dog named horace who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the art of Egypt,</v>

1720
01:36:09.411 --> 01:36:11.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and horace.</v>

1721
01:36:11.751 --> 01:36:15.390
<v Speaker 3>His job was to see evil because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious,</v>

1722
01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:18.440
<v Speaker 3>was blind to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then to enter into combat with it,</v>

1723
01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.040
<v Speaker 3>even though that's very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the horror said,</v>

1724
01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:23.000
<v Speaker 3>one of his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pour it out when we did that.</v>

1725
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:26.490
<v Speaker 3>And then to go bring your side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stack.</v>

1726
01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.900
<v Speaker 3>The death basically will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're supposed to do.</v>

1727
01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:32.700
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got an old dead came</v>

1728
01:36:34.730 --> 01:36:39.730
<v Speaker 3>and your job is to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See where things are not right.</v>

1729
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:44.090
<v Speaker 3>Fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you do that,</v>

1730
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:44.953
<v Speaker 3>then you can align yourself with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive element of the culture while </v>

1731
01:36:47.931 --> 01:36:52.670
<v Speaker 3>you're simultaneously act as the living </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrected to its accesses.</v>

1732
01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.130
<v Speaker 3>And you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's one way to do it.</v>

1733
01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:59.630
<v Speaker 3>You could start new university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well one is don't write things you don't</v>

1734
01:36:59.631 --> 01:37:00.464
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would also say this is where you're </v>

1735
01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:05.480
<v Speaker 3>supposed to challenge things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>University.</v>

1736
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:08.840
<v Speaker 3>Don't act like you believe things don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>bleed.</v>

1737
01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:09.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>

1738
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.823
<v Speaker 3>And it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to fight about the </v>

1739
01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:13.213
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to find 100,000 micro </v>

1740
01:37:14.991 --> 01:37:15.824
<v Speaker 3>battles with the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have to decide with each micro </v>

1741
01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:20.960
<v Speaker 3>battle what you're going to do.</v>

1742
01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:23.780
<v Speaker 3>And it's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can give you an example.</v>

1743
01:37:23.781 --> 01:37:24.614
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you go to work and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bone there because there will be and </v>

1744
01:37:29.571 --> 01:37:33.050
<v Speaker 3>the boy comes into your office and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have 10 seconds to make yourself make it</v>

1745
01:37:33.051 --> 01:37:34.600
<v Speaker 3>clear whether or not you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullied.</v>

1746
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:38.990
<v Speaker 3>That's all 10 sentence because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to figure it out that well.</v>

1747
01:37:38.991 --> 01:37:41.030
<v Speaker 3>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how have you been in not being bullied?</v>

1748
01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.193
<v Speaker 3>You have to transform yourself into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of person that isn't going to be </v>

1749
01:37:44.901 --> 01:37:45.734
<v Speaker 3>bullying and the bullies will figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that out right away and he'll go find </v>

1750
01:37:47.781 --> 01:37:52.070
<v Speaker 3>someone easier to pick on him and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>win and you'll hardly even notice.</v>

1751
01:37:53.210 --> 01:37:57.840
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you continue to fight against,</v>

1752
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.630
<v Speaker 3>if you continue to fight,</v>

1753
01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:03.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1754
01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:08.620
<v Speaker 3>and I'm wait and colorful way</v>
<v Speaker 3>against things that we didn't press you,</v>

1755
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:10.403
<v Speaker 3>but it will become strong and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>become strong but you won't be co-opted </v>

1756
01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:16.080
<v Speaker 3>into the evil of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that has to do.</v>

1757
01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:18.820
<v Speaker 3>The Egyptians have this right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mesopotamians had the same idea.</v>

1758
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.920
<v Speaker 3>They're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're chaos.</v>

1759
01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:24.970
<v Speaker 3>Eliminating God had eyes all the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>around it's head.</v>

1760
01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:28.090
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the Egyptians just worshiped </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1761
01:38:28.091 --> 01:38:28.924
<v Speaker 3>I naturally we're thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think you fight </v>

1762
01:38:31.211 --> 01:38:34.780
<v Speaker 3>corruption with rationality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

1763
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:35.703
<v Speaker 3>There's no correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and conscientiousness by </v>

1764
01:38:37.481 --> 01:38:39.370
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not a moral,</v>

1765
01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:44.110
<v Speaker 3>so what our moral faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be a discriminating factor,</v>

1766
01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.190
<v Speaker 3>but it's not an olfactory attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you fight against.</v>

1767
01:38:48.191 --> 01:38:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Watch,</v>

1768
01:38:50.170 --> 01:38:51.003
<v Speaker 3>you pay attention because paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention means I'm willing to see </v>

1769
01:38:53.891 --> 01:38:54.724
<v Speaker 3>what's happening and if something </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens that you find objectionable and </v>

1770
01:38:59.230 --> 01:39:03.100
<v Speaker 3>you know what to do about it and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do it and you would do it,</v>

1771
01:39:03.101 --> 01:39:03.870
<v Speaker 3>and that's about it.</v>

1772
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:04.703
<v Speaker 3>We feel you should engage in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>invasion right down there because that </v>

1773
01:39:07.381 --> 01:39:11.470
<v Speaker 3>made you start the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Michael Michael Challenges.</v>

1774
01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:12.793
<v Speaker 3>Stop the system from degenerating into </v>
<v Speaker 3>corruption and actually that's not a </v>

1775
01:39:16.061 --> 01:39:16.894
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You already know that if you read the </v>

1776
01:39:17.741 --> 01:39:18.574
<v Speaker 3>Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of this things that social hits and </v>

1777
01:39:20.531 --> 01:39:21.790
<v Speaker 3>does is say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1778
01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:26.860
<v Speaker 3>how did the Soviet Union developed into </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that ate its own children?</v>

1779
01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:29.710
<v Speaker 3>That's his question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what he said was</v>

1780
01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:32.920
<v Speaker 3>people lied about everything all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1781
01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:37.930
<v Speaker 3>They so they would claim to be happy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>satisfied with.</v>

1782
01:39:37.931 --> 01:39:41.770
<v Speaker 3>They were terrified and angry and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were micro decisions,</v>

1783
01:39:41.771 --> 01:39:44.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like little things like big lie now</v>

1784
01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:49.000
<v Speaker 3>happily for three hours to get bread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's not a great example,</v>

1785
01:39:49.001 --> 01:39:52.300
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I can't.</v>

1786
01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:54.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't conjure up a great example right</v>

1787
01:39:54.471 --> 01:39:58.520
<v Speaker 3>at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bullying example is not a bad one.</v>

1788
01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.190
<v Speaker 3>And then I guess the other thing would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be it's associated with the ideal.</v>

1789
01:40:07.191 --> 01:40:09.110
<v Speaker 3>So if you're an idealist to make things </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

1790
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:14.720
<v Speaker 3>then you put that above whatever else it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you're doing.</v>

1791
01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.353
<v Speaker 3>And if you're offered the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>engage in something corrupt for short </v>

1792
01:40:19.311 --> 01:40:21.950
<v Speaker 3>term material gain or even to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict,</v>

1793
01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:25.740
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should say no,</v>

1794
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:29.820
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say No and I don't think you'll be ready</v>

1795
01:40:29.821 --> 01:40:31.740
<v Speaker 3>to say no unless you know what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences are.</v>

1796
01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Not Said No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does our,</v>

1797
01:40:34.170 --> 01:40:37.430
<v Speaker 3>you'll get weak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things will go downhill,</v>

1798
01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.840
<v Speaker 3>they'll get worse and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you'll start.</v>

1799
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:42.703
<v Speaker 3>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be increasingly motivated to </v>

1800
01:40:44.321 --> 01:40:47.800
<v Speaker 3>start hurting people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you don't want to go there,</v>

1801
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:50.890
<v Speaker 3>then when you're offered the chance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build their own little bit,</v>

1802
01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:52.013
<v Speaker 3>don't go there and you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified because the thing is going to </v>

1803
01:40:55.291 --> 01:40:56.260
<v Speaker 3>be conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1804
01:40:56.261 --> 01:40:58.810
<v Speaker 3>If you say no about something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1805
01:40:58.811 --> 01:40:59.644
<v Speaker 3>if it's a moral request,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were exposing the corruption of the </v>

1806
01:41:01.391 --> 01:41:02.224
<v Speaker 3>person who's making the request and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to be happy about </v>

1807
01:41:04.271 --> 01:41:05.104
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1808
01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:05.943
<v Speaker 3>And the second thing is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>engage in some cars like that's not </v>

1809
01:41:08.051 --> 01:41:08.884
<v Speaker 3>pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to think what's going to </v>

1810
01:41:10.751 --> 01:41:12.970
<v Speaker 3>fortify you enough to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's easy.</v>

1811
01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.760
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is know where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell you could end up.</v>

1812
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:18.620
<v Speaker 3>And if you really know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really know it,</v>

1813
01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.500
<v Speaker 3>you have man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going there.</v>

1814
01:41:20.650 --> 01:41:24.850
<v Speaker 3>I knocked go there and if it means we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to have a bit of an argument for an</v>

1815
01:41:24.850 --> 01:41:26.410
<v Speaker 3>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no problem,</v>

1816
01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:29.380
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'll find it's pretty cool.</v>

1817
01:41:29.410 --> 01:41:30.243
<v Speaker 3>It's what you'll find is that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't know that much about those </v>

1818
01:41:33.531 --> 01:41:34.364
<v Speaker 3>sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just don't come and do that to you </v>

1819
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:38.833
<v Speaker 3>because it just doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll go find someone who's either </v>

1820
01:41:44.050 --> 01:41:44.883
<v Speaker 3>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know you have to know the </v>

1821
01:41:47.391 --> 01:41:52.250
<v Speaker 3>difference and you have to want to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then then you can do it.</v>

1822
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:53.083
<v Speaker 3>I think you could do it because I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think the truth is more powerful </v>

1823
01:41:55.881 --> 01:41:56.714
<v Speaker 3>than deception and I think the good is </v>
<v Speaker 3>more powerful than evil and I really </v>

1824
01:41:59.391 --> 01:42:03.170
<v Speaker 3>mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think evil and deceit are weak and so</v>

1825
01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.820
<v Speaker 3>big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could they withstand the truth?</v>

1826
01:42:07.821 --> 01:42:10.400
<v Speaker 3>How would that even be possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is reality.</v>

1827
01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:13.080
<v Speaker 3>How do you withstand reality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have a sad reality.</v>

1828
01:42:13.081 --> 01:42:13.914
<v Speaker 3>It just rolls over you and so people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are devoted towards malevolence and he </v>

1829
01:42:18.041 --> 01:42:21.230
<v Speaker 3>used deception,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pathologists to relationship with being,</v>

1830
01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:23.360
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do that,</v>

1831
01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:24.733
<v Speaker 3>it's not probably possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're driving a rickety car </v>

1832
01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:30.230
<v Speaker 3>across a really bumpy landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

1833
01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:40.630
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
