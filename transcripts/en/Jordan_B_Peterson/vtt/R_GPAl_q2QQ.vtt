1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm really looking forward to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture,</v>

3
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 2>not like I wasn't looking forward to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other ones,</v>

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 2>but the stories that I want to cover </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight,</v>

5
00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:21.991
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that just absolutely </v>

6
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:21.991
<v Speaker 2>staggers me about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the story of Cain and Abel,</v>

7
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.280
<v Speaker 2>which I hope to get to is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so short.</v>

8
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:25.780
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 10,</v>

9
00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:30.781
<v Speaker 2>11 lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to it at all and I've </v>

10
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.451
<v Speaker 2>found that it's essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>inexhaustible in its capacity to reveal </v>

11
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 2>meaning and I don't exactly know what to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make of that.</v>

12
00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

13
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I said I was going to take as </v>

14
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.260
<v Speaker 2>rational approach to this issue as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly could.</v>

15
00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:46.261
<v Speaker 2>I think it has something to do with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>intense process of condensation across </v>

16
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:48.250
<v Speaker 2>very long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the simplest explanation,</v>

17
00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you the information in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

18
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 2>it's so densely packed that it really </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

19
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to come up with an </v>

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 2>explanation for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not one that I find compelling.</v>

21
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that the really old stories,</v>

22
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 2>and we've been covering the really </v>
<v Speaker 2>archaic stories in the Bible so far,</v>

23
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 2>I think that one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be virtually certain about is that </v>

24
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 2>everything about them that was memorable</v>
<v Speaker 2>was remembered,</v>

25
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in some sense,</v>

26
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.090
<v Speaker 2>and this is kind of like the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins ideas of means,</v>

27
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:17.980
<v Speaker 2>which is often why I thought that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins,</v>

28
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 2>he was a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

29
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Speaker 2>mystically inclined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have become Carl you because </v>

30
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Speaker 2>there are theories are unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar.</v>

31
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.910
<v Speaker 2>The similar of meme in the similar of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of archetypes of the collective</v>

32
00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:32.911
<v Speaker 2>unconscious are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar ideas except the union </v>

33
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:34.540
<v Speaker 2>ideas far more profound in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimation.</v>

34
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

35
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 2>it just is.</v>

36
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 2>He thought it through so much better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because darkens,</v>

38
00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 2>tended to think of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot is sort of like a mind where,</v>

39
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that would infest the mind and</v>

40
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:46.630
<v Speaker 2>maybe multiple minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he never really took.</v>

41
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he really ever took the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea with the seriousness that deserved.</v>

42
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:54.841
<v Speaker 2>And I did hear him actually make a joke </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Sam Harris the last time they </v>

43
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 2>talked about the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

44
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some possibility that the,</v>

45
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.670
<v Speaker 2>the production of meme say religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>means could alter evolutionary history </v>

46
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.230
<v Speaker 2>and they both avoided that topic </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantly.</v>

47
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:10.231
<v Speaker 2>They had a big laugh about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men decided they weren't going to go </v>

48
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:10.231
<v Speaker 2>down that road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that wasn't fair.</v>

49
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:11.320
<v Speaker 2>That was quite interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

50
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

51
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.190
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

52
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

53
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 2>the density of these stories I do really</v>
<v Speaker 2>think still is a,</v>

54
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 2>is a mystery.</v>

55
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it certainly has something to do with </v>

56
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.851
<v Speaker 2>their absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in the impossibility to be </v>

57
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:26.851
<v Speaker 2>forgotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

58
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:29.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually something that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be tested empirically.</v>

59
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if anybody has ever done </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because you could tell naive people</v>

60
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.090
<v Speaker 2>to stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even equal length,</v>

61
00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:39.091
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One that had an archetypal team and the </v>

62
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:39.091
<v Speaker 2>other that didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then wait three months and see which</v>

63
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 2>ones people remembered better be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be relatively straightforward thing</v>

64
00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 2>to test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't tested it,</v>

65
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.400
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I will at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

66
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 2>that's all to say that I'm very excited </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this lecture because I get an </v>

67
00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:56.251
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to go over to the story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam and eve and the story of Cain and </v>

68
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:59.071
<v Speaker 2>Abel and I hope we manage both of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>today and maybe we'll get to the story </v>

69
00:02:59.071 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>of Noah and the Tower of Babel as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wouldn't count on it.</v>

70
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Not at the rate we'd been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at the rate we'd been progressing,</v>

71
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's no problem.</v>

72
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no sense rushing this.</v>

73
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to go.</v>

74
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Before we go that before we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to finish my discussion of the </v>

75
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>idea of the psychological significance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the idea of God.</v>

76
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 2>And I've been thinking about this a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

77
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course this lecture series </v>

78
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.920
<v Speaker 2>gives me the opportunity on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessity to continue to think.</v>

79
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.080
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

80
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.150
<v Speaker 2>it certainly is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the hypothesis that I've been </v>

81
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 2>developing with the trinitarian idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

82
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.940
<v Speaker 2>the trinitarian idea is the earliest </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergence in image of the idea that </v>

83
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:44.851
<v Speaker 2>there has to be an underlying cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that gives rise to </v>

84
00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 2>consciousness as well as consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

85
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 2>And so what I was suggesting was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of God,</v>

86
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>the father is something akin to the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

87
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 2>a priority structure that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gives rise to consciousness.</v>

88
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 2>That's an inbuilt part of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's our structure.</v>

89
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.940
<v Speaker 2>You could think about that as something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been produced over a vast </v>

90
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.911
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary time span.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that's completely out </v>

91
00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:05.911
<v Speaker 2>of keeping with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

92
00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:10.381
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the ideas that are laid forth in </v>

93
00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:12.871
<v Speaker 2>genesis one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least if you think about them from a </v>

94
00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:15.421
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard to read them literally </v>

95
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:15.421
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:19.650
<v Speaker 2>there's an emphasis on day and night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of day and night as a 24 </v>

97
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 2>hour diurnal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.540
<v Speaker 2>a daytime and nighttime interchanges </v>
<v Speaker 2>with are based on the claw on the </v>

99
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:32.761
<v Speaker 2>earthly clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems to be a bit absurd when you first </v>

100
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:32.761
<v Speaker 2>start to think about the construction of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos,</v>

101
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:37.741
<v Speaker 2>so just doesn't seem to me that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>literal interpretation is appropriate </v>

102
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 2>and it's another thing that you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>not know,</v>

103
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of the early church fathers,</v>

104
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 2>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>origin in particular stated very clearly</v>

105
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:48.841
<v Speaker 2>this was in 300 and that these ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories were to be taken as as as wise </v>

106
00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 2>metaphors and not to be taken.</v>

107
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Literally like the idea that the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who established Christianity,</v>

108
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:58.441
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all the sorts of people who were </v>

109
00:04:58.441 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 2>biblical literalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just absolutely historically wrong.</v>

110
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean some of them were and some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them still are.</v>

111
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.780
<v Speaker 2>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of them weren't and it's not like </v>

112
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 2>people who lived 2000 years ago were </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid by any stretch of the imagination</v>

113
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:11.620
<v Speaker 2>and so they were perfectly capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding what you know,</v>

114
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 2>what constituted something approximating</v>
<v Speaker 2>a metaphor,</v>

115
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 2>and also knew that fiction in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered as an abstraction,</v>

116
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 2>could tell you truths at that nonfiction</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't able,</v>

117
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
<v Speaker 2>wasn't able to get at lest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that fiction is only for </v>

118
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.000
<v Speaker 2>entertainment and I think that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

119
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a big mistake to think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

120
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here we go.</v>

121
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.320
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with regards to the idea of,</v>

122
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 2>of God the father.</v>

123
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that in order to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense out of the world,</v>

124
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:40.490
<v Speaker 2>you have to have an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a priori cognitive structure.</v>

125
00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 2>And that was something that Emmanuel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kant,</v>

126
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 2>as I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said last time,</v>

127
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

128
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 2>put forward as an argument against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that all of the information that we</v>

129
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 2>acquire during our lifetime as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of incoming sensor data.</v>

130
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that con objective to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

131
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:59.791
<v Speaker 2>and he was absolutely right about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you can't make sense of sense data </v>

132
00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:04.061
<v Speaker 2>without any prior restructure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't extract from census data the </v>

133
00:06:04.061 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 2>structure that enables you to make sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sense data.</v>

134
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really been demonstrated,</v>

135
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond a shadow of a doubt since the 19 </v>

136
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.411
<v Speaker 2>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the best demonstration of that was </v>

137
00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 2>actually the initial failure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence because when the</v>

138
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:23.171
<v Speaker 2>ai people started promising that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have fully functional autonomous </v>

139
00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 2>robots and artificial intelligence back </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 sixties,</v>

140
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they didn't understand and what </v>

141
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 2>stalled them terribly until about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early 19 nineties was that it was almost</v>

142
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.570
<v Speaker 2>that the problem of perception was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>much deeper problem than anybody ever </v>

143
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.570
<v Speaker 2>recognized.</v>

144
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Because like when you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just see,</v>

145
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's objects out there.</v>

146
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see objects.</v>

147
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.830
<v Speaker 2>You see tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so you know,</v>

148
00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 2>in the neurobiology of that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear.</v>

149
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't see objects and infer utility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see useful things and infer object.</v>

150
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually the reverse of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people generally think.</v>

151
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.720
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that regardless of whether you see </v>

152
00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 2>objects or useful things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the world,</v>

153
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.140
<v Speaker 2>you just see it and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

154
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 2>seeing as easy because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things are no,</v>

155
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Speaker 2>you have to do is turn your head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they appear.</v>

156
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:09.791
<v Speaker 2>And that's just so wrong that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to overstate the </v>

157
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 2>problem of perception is staggeringly </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult and one of the primary reasons</v>

158
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 2>that we still don't really have </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous robot,</v>

159
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:21.551
<v Speaker 2>so there were a lot closer to it than we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were in the 19 sixties is because it </v>

160
00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 2>turned out that you actually have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an a body.</v>

161
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a body before you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

162
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:29.591
<v Speaker 2>and even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a body before you can </v>

163
00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:32.030
<v Speaker 2>see because the act of seeing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the act of mapping the patterns</v>

164
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 2>of the world onto the patterns of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

165
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.210
<v Speaker 2>It's not things are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them,</v>

166
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 2>then you think about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you evaluate them.</v>

167
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Then you decide to act on them and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you act.</v>

168
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:46.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could call that a folk idea of </v>

169
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 2>psychological processing or perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

170
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 2>That is not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your eyes for example,</v>

171
00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:55.601
<v Speaker 2>map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they do is map right </v>

172
00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:55.601
<v Speaker 2>onto your spinal cord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

173
00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 2>they might write onto your emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

174
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 2>so it's actually possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

175
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 2>for people to be blind and still be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to detect facial expressions,</v>

176
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 2>which is to say you can put someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's cortically blind,</v>

177
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 2>so they've had their visual cortex </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed often by a stroke.</v>

178
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 2>They will tell you that they can't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

179
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 2>but they can guess which hand you put up</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ask them to.</v>

180
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 2>And if you flash them pictures of angry </v>
<v Speaker 2>or fearful faces,</v>

181
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 2>they show skin conductance responses to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more emotion laden faces.</v>

182
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Speaker 2>And it's because imagine that the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>is made out of patterns which it is.</v>

183
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that those patterns are </v>

184
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.280
<v Speaker 2>transmitted to you electromagnetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have through light.</v>

185
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.561
<v Speaker 2>And then imagine that the pattern is </v>
<v Speaker 2>duplicated on the retina and then that </v>

186
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:36.140
<v Speaker 2>pattern is propagated along the optic </v>
<v Speaker 2>nerve.</v>

187
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 2>And then the pattern is distributed </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout your brain.</v>

188
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:41.800
<v Speaker 2>And some of that pattern makes up what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you call it,</v>

189
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 2>conscious vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other parts of it just activate your</v>

190
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for example,</v>

191
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 2>when I look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I look at this,</v>

192
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:49.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

193
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

194
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a battle,</v>

195
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 2>that's the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 2>when I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with intent in mind,</v>

197
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.590
<v Speaker 2>as soon as I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pattern of the bottom of the bottle </v>

198
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 2>activates the gripping mechanism of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand and part of the action of,</v>

199
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.920
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the active perception is to adjust my </v>

200
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.111
<v Speaker 2>bodily posture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including my hand grip to be of the </v>

201
00:09:15.111 --> 00:09:15.111
<v Speaker 2>optimal size to pick that up.</v>

202
00:09:15.111 --> 00:09:19.760
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that I see the bottle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then think about how to move my hand as </v>

203
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 2>too slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that I use my motor motor cortex to</v>

204
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:25.410
<v Speaker 2>perceive the bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually somewhat independent</v>

205
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 2>of actually seeing the bottle as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious experience.</v>

206
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that I'm telling you that,</v>

207
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:38.481
<v Speaker 2>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's much more about that that </v>

208
00:09:38.481 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 2>can be told Rodney Brooks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's someone to know about.</v>

209
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:44.151
<v Speaker 2>He's a robotics engineer who worked in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 nineties and he invented the </v>

210
00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Roomba among many other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's a real genius,</v>

211
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:46.740
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

212
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:49.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he brooks was one of the first people to</v>

213
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:51.490
<v Speaker 2>really point out that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

214
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 2>to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to have a,</v>

215
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:58.911
<v Speaker 2>an n,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a machine that perceived well enough to </v>

216
00:09:58.911 --> 00:10:01.851
<v Speaker 2>work in the world that you had to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>it a body and that the perception would </v>

217
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 2>actually be built from the body up </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than the,</v>

218
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:08.631
<v Speaker 2>from the abstract cognitive perceptions </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and so well that,</v>

219
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 2>that turned out to be the case.</v>

220
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.050
<v Speaker 2>And Brooks boiled all sorts of weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>little machines in the 19 nineties that </v>

221
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.090
<v Speaker 2>didn't even really have any central </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

222
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:20.091
<v Speaker 2>but they could do things like run away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from light and so they could perceive </v>

223
00:10:20.091 --> 00:10:23.901
<v Speaker 2>light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their perception was the act of </v>

224
00:10:23.901 --> 00:10:25.890
<v Speaker 2>running away from light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so perception perception is very,</v>

225
00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very tightly tied to action in ways that</v>

226
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 2>people don't normally perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

227
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:36.230
<v Speaker 2>that's all to say that you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive the world without being </v>

228
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 2>embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

229
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:42.201
<v Speaker 2>you're embodied in a manner that's taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>you roughly three and a half billion </v>

230
00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:42.201
<v Speaker 2>years to pull off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

231
00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:47.061
<v Speaker 2>There's been a lot of death as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prerequisite to the embodied form that </v>

232
00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:51.261
<v Speaker 2>you take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's taken all that trial and </v>

233
00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:53.811
<v Speaker 2>error to produce something like you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can interact with the complexity of the </v>

234
00:10:53.811 --> 00:10:57.591
<v Speaker 2>world well enough to last the relatively</v>
<v Speaker 2>poultry 80 or so years that you can </v>

235
00:10:57.591 --> 00:10:57.591
<v Speaker 2>last.</v>

236
00:10:57.591 --> 00:11:00.870
<v Speaker 2>And so I think about that as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this may be wrong,</v>

237
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:04.890
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least it's a useful a hypothesis.</v>

238
00:11:04.891 --> 00:11:09.891
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea of God the father is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like the birth of the idea </v>

239
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.900
<v Speaker 2>that there has to be an internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that I would've wished </v>

240
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 2>consciousness itself arises that gives </v>
<v Speaker 2>form to things.</v>

241
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:20.940
<v Speaker 2>And well if that's the case and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

242
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:22.980
<v Speaker 2>but if it's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly reflection.</v>

243
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a reflection of the kind of factual</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth that I've been describing now.</v>

244
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:29.660
<v Speaker 2>And then like I also mentioned that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of see the,</v>

245
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.680
<v Speaker 2>the idea of both the Holy Spirit also of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ and most specifically of Christ </v>

246
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.760
<v Speaker 2>in the form of the word as the act of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

247
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:45.351
<v Speaker 2>That that structure produces and uses </v>
<v Speaker 2>not only to to formulate the world </v>

248
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:48.790
<v Speaker 2>because we formulate the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least the world that we experience.</v>

249
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.760
<v Speaker 2>We formulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to change.</v>

250
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:55.761
<v Speaker 2>And modify that world because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely no doubt that we do that </v>

251
00:11:55.761 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 2>partly with our bodies which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimally evolved to do that,</v>

252
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:03.121
<v Speaker 2>which is why we have hands on like </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins that have very large brains </v>

253
00:12:03.121 --> 00:12:03.550
<v Speaker 2>like us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but can't really change the world.</v>

254
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 2>We're really adapted and evolved to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change the world.</v>

255
00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.380
<v Speaker 2>And the world in our speech is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

256
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 2>an extension of our ability to use our </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

257
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:17.310
<v Speaker 2>So the speech systems that we use are </v>
<v Speaker 2>very well developed motor,</v>

258
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
<v Speaker 2>a very well developed motor skill and </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

259
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.670
<v Speaker 2>you're your dominant linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere,</v>

260
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 2>the same as your dominant hand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people talk with their hands like me,</v>

261
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:34.561
<v Speaker 2>he has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may have noticed and we use sign </v>

262
00:12:34.561 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 2>language and there's a tight </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the use of the hand</v>

263
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:40.081
<v Speaker 2>and the use of language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly because language is a </v>

264
00:12:40.081 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 2>productive force and the hand is part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

265
00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:42.280
<v Speaker 2>part of what changes the world.</v>

266
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 2>And so all those things are tied </v>
<v Speaker 2>together in a very,</v>

267
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:47.560
<v Speaker 2>very complex way with this a priori </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

268
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:52.561
<v Speaker 2>And also with the embodied structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that's part of the </v>

269
00:12:52.561 --> 00:12:55.921
<v Speaker 2>reason why classical Christianity put </v>
<v Speaker 2>such an emphasis not only on the </v>

270
00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 2>divinity of the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also on the divinity of the body,</v>

271
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.970
<v Speaker 2>which is a harder thing to grapple with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

272
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 2>it's easier for people to think if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think in religious terms at all,</v>

273
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:09.661
<v Speaker 2>but you have some sort of transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit that somehow detached from the </v>

274
00:13:09.661 --> 00:13:10.450
<v Speaker 2>body that might have some life after </v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

275
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:15.451
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the Christian Christianity in </v>

276
00:13:15.451 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 2>particular really insists on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>divinity of the body.</v>

277
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.390
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying structure that's got this </v>

278
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 2>clause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I patriarchal nature,</v>

279
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:27.241
<v Speaker 2>partly because it's for complex reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but partly because it's a reflection of </v>

280
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 2>the social structure as well as other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

281
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 2>And then that uses consciousness in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>form particularly of language,</v>

282
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:37.921
<v Speaker 2>but most particularly in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>truthful language in order to produce </v>

283
00:13:37.921 --> 00:13:41.860
<v Speaker 2>the world in a manner that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a walloping powerful,</v>

284
00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:46.861
<v Speaker 2>powerful idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially the relationship between the </v>

285
00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:47.500
<v Speaker 2>idea that it's truthful speech that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives rise to the good.</v>

286
00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Because that's a really fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral.</v>

287
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.030
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a tough one to beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

288
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:54.430
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things I've really </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed is,</v>

289
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 2>and this isn't just me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure,</v>

290
00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.740
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

291
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:02.620
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of tragedy in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no doubt about that.</v>

292
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:07.650
<v Speaker 2>And lots of people that I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example in my clinical practice are </v>

293
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.120
<v Speaker 2>laid low by the tragedy of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also see very,</v>

294
00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:12.730
<v Speaker 2>very frequently that people get tangled </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in deceit,</v>

295
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.420
<v Speaker 2>in webs of deceit that are often </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple generations long.</v>

296
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.670
<v Speaker 2>And that just takes them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:23.671
<v Speaker 2>and so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So deceit can produce extraordinary </v>

298
00:14:23.671 --> 00:14:25.090
<v Speaker 2>levels of suffering that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that last for very,</v>

299
00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:28.780
<v Speaker 2>very long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really a clinical truism,</v>

300
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:33.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Freud of course identified one </v>

301
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Speaker 2>of the problems that contributed to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering we might associate with mental</v>

302
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:37.960
<v Speaker 2>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with repression,</v>

303
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:43.290
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of like a lie of omission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a perfectly reasonable way to </v>

304
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.951
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you stated straight out that there </v>

305
00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:48.010
<v Speaker 2>was no difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychotherapeutic,</v>

306
00:14:48.011 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 2>the curative psychotherapeutic effort </v>
<v Speaker 2>and supreme moral effort,</v>

307
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 2>including truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That those were the same thing as far as</v>

308
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:59.351
<v Speaker 2>he was concerned and Carl Rogers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other great clinician who was at one </v>

309
00:14:59.351 --> 00:15:01.610
<v Speaker 2>point at Christian missionary before he </v>
<v Speaker 2>became a more,</v>

310
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more strictly scientific,</v>

311
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.100
<v Speaker 2>he believed that it was in truthful </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue that that,</v>

312
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.780
<v Speaker 2>that a clinical transformation took </v>
<v Speaker 2>place and you know it,</v>

313
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.280
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

314
00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:16.580
<v Speaker 2>and of course one of the prerequisites </v>
<v Speaker 2>for genuine transformation in the </v>

315
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 2>clinical setting is that the therapist </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells the truth and the client tells the</v>

316
00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:24.611
<v Speaker 2>truth because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how in the world do you know what's </v>

317
00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:24.611
<v Speaker 2>going on now?</v>

318
00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Can you solve a problem when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even know what the problem is and you </v>

319
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 2>don't know what the problem is unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person tells you the truth.</v>

320
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:33.310
<v Speaker 2>That's something really to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>in light of your own relationships </v>

321
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:36.461
<v Speaker 2>because you know if you don't tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people around you the truth and they </v>

322
00:15:36.461 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 2>don't know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe that's a good thing,</v>

323
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because while seriously people have </v>

324
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:41.860
<v Speaker 2>reasons to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

325
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean that aren't trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really worth knowing that you </v>

326
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:49.271
<v Speaker 2>can't even get your hands on the problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you formulate it truthfully and </v>

327
00:15:49.271 --> 00:15:49.790
<v Speaker 2>if you can't get your hands on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

328
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:52.640
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve it is just so low.</v>

329
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
<v Speaker 2>And so then I'd been thinking about as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well the this,</v>

330
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:03.011
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this idea has become more credible </v>

331
00:16:03.011 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The longer I've developed it,</v>

332
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.780
<v Speaker 2>the longer I've thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:10.450
<v Speaker 2>the idea that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go back.</v>

334
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.180
<v Speaker 2>It's partly the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

335
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.240
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me figure out how to start this </v>

336
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:19.240
<v Speaker 2>property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friend of mine,</v>

337
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.290
<v Speaker 2>business partner and guide that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>written scientific papers with very </v>

338
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.591
<v Speaker 2>smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took me to task and I think I told you </v>

339
00:16:26.591 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 2>this a little bit about using the term </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy,</v>

340
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:33.490
<v Speaker 2>which might be fine for like chimpanzees</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for lobsters and for creatures like </v>

341
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.190
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

342
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.930
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

343
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.110
<v Speaker 2>not for chimpanzees even so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

344
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:42.240
<v Speaker 2>and he said something very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought that the idea of dominance </v>

345
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.061
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy was actually a projection of </v>
<v Speaker 2>early 20th century Marxist hypothesis </v>

346
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 2>onto the animal kingdom that was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>observed.</v>

347
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:55.390
<v Speaker 2>And the notion that the hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that you see that </v>

348
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:55.390
<v Speaker 2>characterize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say mating hierarchies in,</v>

349
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.900
<v Speaker 2>in chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

350
00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:02.230
<v Speaker 2>the idea that that was predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>power was actually a projection of a </v>

351
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.861
<v Speaker 2>kind of political ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that really bugged me for </v>

352
00:17:05.861 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 2>a long time when he said that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

353
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.990
<v Speaker 2>because I agree to be used to using the </v>
<v Speaker 2>term dominance higher can,</v>

354
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:11.050
<v Speaker 2>I thought he told me all that I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

355
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.900
<v Speaker 2>that's so annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so annoying because it might be right.</v>

356
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.940
<v Speaker 2>And then it took me months to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

357
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:22.150
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I was also reading friends to </v>

358
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.191
<v Speaker 2>wall at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's a primatologist and also Jaak </v>

359
00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Panksepp who was a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant affective neuroscientist who </v>

360
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.271
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately just died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a great book called affective </v>

361
00:17:31.271 --> 00:17:31.520
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for rats to play,</v>

362
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:33.860
<v Speaker 2>they have to play fair or they won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>play with each other.</v>

363
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a staggering discovery,</v>

364
00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:38.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because anything that helps,</v>

365
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instantiate the,</v>

366
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:45.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emergence of ethical behavior in </v>

367
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:46.910
<v Speaker 2>animals and that associates it with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary process,</v>

368
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:48.230
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

369
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 2>what Panksepp was doing gives credence </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the notion that the ethics that guide</v>

370
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:57.870
<v Speaker 2>us are not mere social logical EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal constructs.</v>

371
00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.400
<v Speaker 2>They're deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply rooted.</v>

372
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.330
<v Speaker 2>If rats ended their rats for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't trust them and they still play</v>

373
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:04.170
<v Speaker 2>fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

374
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:09.530
<v Speaker 2>and the well notice that the chimp </v>
<v Speaker 2>troops that he studied like that,</v>

375
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.560
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't the barbaric barbaric chimp </v>

376
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:14.560
<v Speaker 2>that ruled with an iron fist.</v>

377
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.070
<v Speaker 2>That was the successful ruler because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept getting torn to shreds by his,</v>

378
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.830
<v Speaker 2>by the compatriots that he ignored and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stomped on.</v>

379
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Susie showed some weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just tear them into pieces.</v>

380
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.140
<v Speaker 2>The chimp leaders that were stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

381
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.960
<v Speaker 2>that had a stable kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

382
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.080
<v Speaker 2>We're very reciprocal in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions with their friends and </v>

383
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 2>chimps have friends and they asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually last for a very long time.</v>

384
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:39.621
<v Speaker 2>Chimp friendships and they're also very </v>
<v Speaker 2>reciprocal in the ranch or interactions </v>

385
00:18:39.621 --> 00:18:42.080
<v Speaker 2>with the females and with the infants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that's,</v>

386
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:47.140
<v Speaker 2>that's a friends to wall is a very smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and I thought that was also </v>

387
00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.751
<v Speaker 2>foundational science because it's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to note that the attributes </v>

388
00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:56.121
<v Speaker 2>that give rise to dominance in a male </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy sort of use that </v>

389
00:18:56.121 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it authority.</v>

390
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.490
<v Speaker 2>That might be better or even shutter </v>
<v Speaker 2>competence,</v>

391
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a better way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it,</v>

392
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.160
<v Speaker 2>is that that's not predicated purely on </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that's,</v>

393
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.630
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's as simple as brute power.</v>

394
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 2>And I think too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

395
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:13.430
<v Speaker 2>I think as well that the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a deeply devious and </v>

396
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.680
<v Speaker 2>dangerous political idea in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimation,</v>

397
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 2>the idea that male dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies,</v>

398
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.990
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male hierarchies are fundamentally </v>

399
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.841
<v Speaker 2>predicated on power in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a law abiding in a law abiding </v>

400
00:19:23.841 --> 00:19:23.841
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is.</v>

401
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I think all you have to do is think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that for like a month.</v>

402
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Say she isn't that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To understand how observed that is.</v>

403
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Because most people who are in positions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of authority,</v>

404
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:39.051
<v Speaker 2>let's say are just as him then by </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical responsibility or even more so </v>

405
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.910
<v Speaker 2>than people at the other levels of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the hierarchy.</v>

406
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:47.030
<v Speaker 2>And we know this even in the managerial </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature because we know generally </v>

407
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.361
<v Speaker 2>speaking that managers are more stressed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by their subordinates than the </v>

408
00:19:50.361 --> 00:19:51.210
<v Speaker 2>subordinates are stressed by their </v>
<v Speaker 2>managers.</v>

409
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

410
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.350
<v Speaker 2>you want to be responsible for like 200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

411
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.420
<v Speaker 2>You really want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hard work,</v>

412
00:19:57.421 --> 00:20:02.421
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I know it's a pain to have a </v>

413
00:20:02.421 --> 00:20:04.371
<v Speaker 2>boss because you have to care about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boss thinks and maybe the person is </v>

414
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:08.481
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case they're not going to be </v>

415
00:20:08.481 --> 00:20:10.311
<v Speaker 2>particularly successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's no joke to be responsible for </v>

416
00:20:10.311 --> 00:20:13.551
<v Speaker 2>200 people and you have to behave very </v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully when you're in a position of </v>

417
00:20:13.551 --> 00:20:17.301
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and authority like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you will get called out if you </v>

418
00:20:17.301 --> 00:20:18.090
<v Speaker 2>make mistakes constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like you're.</v>

419
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:23.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not like because you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position that's higher up in the </v>

420
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy that you're less constrained </v>
<v Speaker 2>by ethical necessity.</v>

421
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a psychopath,</v>

422
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:32.091
<v Speaker 2>while that's a whole different story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but psychopaths have to move pretty </v>

423
00:20:32.091 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 2>rapidly from hierarchy to hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

424
00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:37.281
<v Speaker 2>Because they get found out quite quickly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as their reputation is </v>

425
00:20:37.281 --> 00:20:40.761
<v Speaker 2>shattered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can't get away with their </v>

426
00:20:40.761 --> 00:20:40.761
<v Speaker 2>shenanigans anymore.</v>

427
00:20:40.761 --> 00:20:44.270
<v Speaker 2>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of this is to say that there is </v>

428
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.800
<v Speaker 2>something very interesting about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern of behavior,</v>

429
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 2>so imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that sexual selection is working</v>

430
00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 2>something like this and we know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual selection is a very,</v>

431
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:55.030
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

432
00:20:55.031 --> 00:21:00.031
<v Speaker 2>very powerful biological force even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though biologists ignored it for almost </v>

433
00:21:00.031 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 2>a hundred years after Charles Darwin </v>
<v Speaker 2>originally wrote about it,</v>

434
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.260
<v Speaker 2>thinking mostly about natural selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't like the idea of sexual </v>

435
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.531
<v Speaker 2>selection because it tended to introduce</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion of mind into the process of </v>

436
00:21:10.531 --> 00:21:12.200
<v Speaker 2>evolution because it deals with choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

437
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.820
<v Speaker 2>but so imagine on the one hand that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a male hierarchy.</v>

438
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.120
<v Speaker 2>We know that the men at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy are much more likely to be </v>

439
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.120
<v Speaker 2>reproductively successful then the men </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the bottom.</v>

440
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:26.150
<v Speaker 2>And it's particularly true of men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have twice as many female </v>

441
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 2>ancestors as you have male ancestors.</v>

442
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Not going to do the math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

443
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:32.930
<v Speaker 2>and I know it doesn't sound plausible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could look it up and figure it </v>

444
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.911
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's perfectly reasonable fact that </v>

445
00:21:35.911 --> 00:21:38.071
<v Speaker 2>actually happens to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's twice as you have twice as </v>

446
00:21:38.071 --> 00:21:41.191
<v Speaker 2>many female ancestors because females </v>
<v Speaker 2>are twice as likely on average to leave </v>

447
00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 2>offspring as men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what happens is any man,</v>

448
00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 2>man who does reproduce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tends to reproduce more than once,</v>

449
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:52.620
<v Speaker 2>but a bunch of the reproduce zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas so would be the average man who </v>

450
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.521
<v Speaker 2>reproduces has two children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the average man who doesn't </v>

451
00:21:56.521 --> 00:21:59.800
<v Speaker 2>reproduce has zero obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the average woman who reproduces has</v>

452
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:03.760
<v Speaker 2>one shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means that there's twice as many</v>

453
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.580
<v Speaker 2>females in your life as there is males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

454
00:22:06.581 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 2>that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so imagine that it works.</v>

455
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the men who elect the dough,</v>

456
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.660
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the competent men who were,</v>

457
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:20.300
<v Speaker 2>are admired and who are and who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

458
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I can't say dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are,</v>

459
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.850
<v Speaker 2>who are given positions of authority and</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect,</v>

460
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:25.870
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

461
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:31.050
<v Speaker 2>And it's like an election now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be an actual democratic </v>

462
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.471
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's at least an election of </v>

463
00:22:34.471 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Speaker 2>consensus or it's at least an election </v>
<v Speaker 2>of while we're not going to kill him for</v>

464
00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:38.050
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also a form of the election,</v>

465
00:22:38.051 --> 00:22:39.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a form of tolerance,</v>

466
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

467
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.900
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what happens is the women for </v>

468
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:45.900
<v Speaker 2>their part peel from the top of the male</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>

469
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.700
<v Speaker 2>And so you've got two factors that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving human sexual selection across </v>

470
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.681
<v Speaker 2>vast stretches of evolutionary time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the election of men by men to </v>

471
00:22:55.681 --> 00:22:57.400
<v Speaker 2>positions where they're much more likely</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reproduce.</v>

472
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:02.550
<v Speaker 2>And the second is the tendency of women </v>
<v Speaker 2>to peel off the top of male dominance </v>

473
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.541
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is extraordinarily well </v>

474
00:23:06.541 --> 00:23:08.131
<v Speaker 2>established cross culturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you flat out a socioeconomic </v>

475
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.650
<v Speaker 2>disparity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say between men and women like they've </v>

476
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:13.650
<v Speaker 2>done in Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

477
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:13.650
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

478
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.550
<v Speaker 2>reduce the tendency of women to peel off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of the male hierarchy by much.</v>

479
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.870
<v Speaker 2>And why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you,</v>

480
00:23:19.871 --> 00:23:21.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are smart.</v>

481
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Why in the world wouldn't they go for </v>
<v Speaker 2>four?</v>

482
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't they strive to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships with men who are </v>

483
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.621
<v Speaker 2>relatively successful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why wouldn't they let the men </v>

484
00:23:31.621 --> 00:23:33.550
<v Speaker 2>themselves define why that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that constitutes success.</v>

485
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:39.060
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to figure out who the </v>

486
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.831
<v Speaker 2>best man is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not let the men compete and let the </v>

487
00:23:40.831 --> 00:23:44.551
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man who wins whatever the </v>

488
00:23:44.551 --> 00:23:44.551
<v Speaker 2>competition is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the best man by definition.</v>

489
00:23:44.551 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 2>How else would you it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

490
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 2>so why am I telling you all that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

491
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 2>the reason is is because it seems to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's this comp,</v>

492
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:58.270
<v Speaker 2>there's been this complex interplay </v>
<v Speaker 2>across human evolution between the </v>

493
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.880
<v Speaker 2>election of the male dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sexual success.</v>

494
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's true,</v>

495
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.330
<v Speaker 2>it could be because what would happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see is that as men evolved,</v>

496
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.800
<v Speaker 2>they would evolve to be better and </v>
<v Speaker 2>better at climbing up the male hierarchy</v>

497
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.280
<v Speaker 2>because the ones who weren't good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't reproduce.</v>

498
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.000
<v Speaker 2>So obviously that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then it wouldn't just be a hierarchy</v>

499
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 2>because there's a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different hierarchies.</v>

500
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:23.300
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

501
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.060
<v Speaker 2>are there commonalities across </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies?</v>

502
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a reasonable thing to propose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

503
00:24:28.851 --> 00:24:30.650
<v Speaker 2>they're not completely opposed to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

504
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:35.651
<v Speaker 2>At least if you're more successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively more successful in one </v>

505
00:24:35.651 --> 00:24:37.940
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're more probable,</v>

506
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:40.370
<v Speaker 2>it's more probable that you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful in another,</v>

507
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.520
<v Speaker 2>and that's actually a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of general intelligence or </v>

508
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.001
<v Speaker 2>Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually one of the things </v>

509
00:24:49.001 --> 00:24:49.160
<v Speaker 2>that women select men for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men also select women for that,</v>

510
00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:51.950
<v Speaker 2>but the selection pressure is even </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher from women to men.</v>

511
00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:56.540
<v Speaker 2>And General Iq is one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>propels you across dominance hierarchies</v>

512
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 2>because it's a general problem solving </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism.</v>

513
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.030
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that seems to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to some degree is conscientiousness</v>

514
00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Speaker 2>and there's also some evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>women prefer conscientious men.</v>

515
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.160
<v Speaker 2>So and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't they?</v>

516
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Because you can trust them and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

517
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.000
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

518
00:25:10.001 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 2>and they work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those are both good things.</v>

519
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.190
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

520
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:17.120
<v Speaker 2>so men have adapted to start to climb </v>
<v Speaker 2>the male dominance hierarchy,</v>

521
00:25:17.121 --> 00:25:22.121
<v Speaker 2>but it's the set of all possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies that they're adapted to </v>

522
00:25:22.121 --> 00:25:22.600
<v Speaker 2>climb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you think there's,</v>

523
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.720
<v Speaker 2>there's a set of attributes that can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>acted out that and that can be embodied,</v>

524
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:32.801
<v Speaker 2>that will increase the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to rise to the top of any </v>

525
00:25:32.801 --> 00:25:33.020
<v Speaker 2>given hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you could say,</v>

526
00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:38.021
<v Speaker 2>well then as you adapt to that fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you start to develop an </v>

527
00:25:38.021 --> 00:25:39.950
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what that pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes.</v>

528
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.160
<v Speaker 2>And so that starts to become the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract representation of something </v>

529
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.391
<v Speaker 2>like multidimensional competence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's like the abstraction of </v>

530
00:25:49.391 --> 00:25:49.930
<v Speaker 2>virtue itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the and the,</v>

531
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.840
<v Speaker 2>none of that has been.</v>

532
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.840
<v Speaker 2>None of that's arbitrary now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not as bloody well grounded in biology </v>

533
00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.501
<v Speaker 2>as anything could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a really hard </v>

534
00:25:59.501 --> 00:26:00.020
<v Speaker 2>argument to refute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like one of the things I should tell</v>

535
00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:02.930
<v Speaker 2>you about how I think is that when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think something,</v>

536
00:26:02.931 --> 00:26:05.390
<v Speaker 2>I spend a long time trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's wrong,</v>

537
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I like to hack at it from every </v>

538
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:10.420
<v Speaker 2>possible direction to see if it's a weak</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

539
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:15.161
<v Speaker 2>Because if it's a weak idea then I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather just dispense with it and find </v>

540
00:26:15.161 --> 00:26:18.281
<v Speaker 2>something better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've had a real hard time trying to </v>

541
00:26:18.281 --> 00:26:18.960
<v Speaker 2>figure out what's wrong with that idea I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

542
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.260
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that it's pretty damn </v>

543
00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:24.260
<v Speaker 2>solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the idea that,</v>

544
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you watch what people do in movies </v>

545
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:29.880
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they're reading fiction,</v>

546
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.460
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious that they're very good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>identifying both the hero and the anti </v>

547
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:33.460
<v Speaker 2>hero.</v>

548
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.700
<v Speaker 2>We could say the Antihero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

549
00:26:34.701 --> 00:26:37.640
<v Speaker 2>the bad guy is someone who strives for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

550
00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.270
<v Speaker 2>for authority and position but fails </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

551
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.690
<v Speaker 2>not always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sales.</v>

552
00:26:42.691 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 2>So he's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad example.</v>

553
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.100
<v Speaker 2>A kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take a kid to a,</v>

554
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.990
<v Speaker 2>a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad guy movie the kid figures out pretty</v>

555
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:51.390
<v Speaker 2>fast that he's not supposed to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad guy and,</v>

556
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.930
<v Speaker 2>and fingers out very quickly to zero in </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the good guy.</v>

557
00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.140
<v Speaker 2>And that means that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an affinity between the pattern </v>

558
00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.861
<v Speaker 2>of good guy that's being played out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fiction and the perceptual capacity </v>

559
00:27:03.861 --> 00:27:04.320
<v Speaker 2>of the child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

560
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things I told my son when</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a kid,</v>

561
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I used to take them to movies that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes more frightening than they </v>

562
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.661
<v Speaker 2>should've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things I always told him </v>

563
00:27:14.661 --> 00:27:17.661
<v Speaker 2>was I'd never said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be afraid because I think that's </v>

564
00:27:17.661 --> 00:27:17.661
<v Speaker 2>bad advice for kids.</v>

565
00:27:17.661 --> 00:27:19.200
<v Speaker 2>What I said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep your eye on the hero,</v>

566
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep your eye on the hero.</v>

567
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 2>And the Nike was gripped by the movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>and often quite afraid of them,</v>

568
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:27.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because movies can be very frightened.</v>

569
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.890
<v Speaker 2>So he just like zero in on that guy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>helping him.</v>

570
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what it's like in a movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hope that the good guy wins </v>

571
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:34.910
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

572
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 2>why do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does that,</v>

573
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.380
<v Speaker 2>where does that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see how deeply rooted that is inside</v>

574
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.600
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're bloody well go line up and pay to</v>

575
00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:45.870
<v Speaker 2>watch that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an easy thing to understand and</v>

576
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:50.871
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so self evident to people that we </v>

577
00:27:50.871 --> 00:27:50.871
<v Speaker 2>don't even notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tremendous mystery.</v>

578
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
<v Speaker 2>And so why is it so unreasonable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that we would have actually over </v>

579
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.170
<v Speaker 2>the millennia come to some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective conclusion about what the </v>

580
00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:04.611
<v Speaker 2>best of the best guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best of the good guys are and what the </v>

581
00:28:04.611 --> 00:28:05.760
<v Speaker 2>worst of the bad guys are.</v>

582
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.940
<v Speaker 2>And to me architecturally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking of that as the the hostile </v>

583
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.871
<v Speaker 2>brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's Christ and Satan or Cain and </v>

584
00:28:14.871 --> 00:28:14.871
<v Speaker 2>Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

585
00:28:14.871 --> 00:28:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Very common mythological motif.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hostile brothers.</v>

586
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:18.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like those are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are archetypes.</v>

587
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:21.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Satan for example,</v>

588
00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:25.200
<v Speaker 2>is by definition the worst that a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be.</v>

589
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:30.410
<v Speaker 2>And Christ by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is independent of anything but </v>

590
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:34.401
<v Speaker 2>conceptualization is by definition the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best that a that a man can be.</v>

591
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

592
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking psychologically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptually,</v>

593
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:44.301
<v Speaker 2>but given our capacity for imagination </v>
<v Speaker 2>and our ability to engage in fiction and</v>

594
00:28:44.521 --> 00:28:49.180
<v Speaker 2>our love for fiction and our capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatize and our love for the story,</v>

595
00:28:49.181 --> 00:28:52.740
<v Speaker 2>stories of heroism and catastrophe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>good and evil,</v>

596
00:28:52.741 --> 00:28:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I can't see how it could be any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>way like so.</v>

597
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

598
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:02.390
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of the idea that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving the notion of the evolution of </v>

599
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.350
<v Speaker 2>the idea of God and even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>

600
00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:07.680
<v Speaker 2>he driving the evolution of the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part of the trinity.</v>

601
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.980
<v Speaker 2>So God is an abstracted ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>formulated in large part to dissociate </v>

602
00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:17.280
<v Speaker 2>the ideal from any particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>incarnation or man or any ruler.</v>

603
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:19.830
<v Speaker 2>And there's another rule in the biblical</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

604
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.280
<v Speaker 2>which is that when the actual ruler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned this before,</v>

605
00:29:23.281 --> 00:29:28.281
<v Speaker 2>when the actual ruler becomes confused </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the abstracted ideal than the state</v>

606
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:32.040
<v Speaker 2>immediately turns into a tyranny and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole bloody thing collapses.</v>

607
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.860
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is so sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

608
00:29:34.861 --> 00:29:37.920
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was a hard thing to figure out,</v>

609
00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:42.921
<v Speaker 2>was that you had to take the abstraction</v>
<v Speaker 2>and divorce it from any particular power</v>

610
00:29:44.171 --> 00:29:49.171
<v Speaker 2>structure and then think about it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that existed as an </v>

611
00:29:49.171 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 2>abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a real thing,</v>

612
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real limited governed your behavior it </v>

613
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.480
<v Speaker 2>in everyone's behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the damn king.</v>

614
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 2>The king was responsible to the abstract</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal man.</v>

615
00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 2>That's an impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is such an impossible ideal.</v>

616
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.250
<v Speaker 2>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would,</v>

617
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 2>if they agreed to that 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

618
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:10.650
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually happening in the old </v>

619
00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:10.650
<v Speaker 2>testament is that as soon as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israelite,</v>

620
00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.980
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Israelite Kings Become Almighty,</v>

621
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:20.780
<v Speaker 2>the rear guard comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just cuts them into pieces and then </v>

622
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 2>the whole bloody stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>falls apart for hundreds of years.</v>

623
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.100
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a lesson that,</v>

624
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.750
<v Speaker 2>that we have not thoroughly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciously yet learn.</v>

625
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:33.780
<v Speaker 2>It's still implicit in the narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We still haven't figured out why that's </v>

626
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:33.780
<v Speaker 2>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

627
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.890
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a real hard argument to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

628
00:30:35.891 --> 00:30:37.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to dispense with.</v>

629
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

630
00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 2>so we looked at this a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trinitarian idea is that there's a,</v>

631
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a father,</v>

632
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's maybe the,</v>

633
00:30:49.401 --> 00:30:50.020
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

634
00:30:50.021 --> 00:30:55.021
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dramatic representation of the </v>

635
00:30:55.021 --> 00:30:57.331
<v Speaker 2>structures that underlie consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the embodied structures that underlie </v>

636
00:30:57.331 --> 00:31:00.460
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the sun and that's </v>

637
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:00.460
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

638
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.930
<v Speaker 2>That's consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in its particular historical form,</v>

639
00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:04.270
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that's so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the figure of the sun.</v>

640
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:09.570
<v Speaker 2>And then there's consciousness as such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to be something like the </v>

641
00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.780
<v Speaker 2>indwelling spirit had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm mean,</v>

642
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:12.820
<v Speaker 2>these psychological ideas came from </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>

643
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:17.821
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have a history they didn't </v>

644
00:31:17.821 --> 00:31:17.821
<v Speaker 2>just spring out of nowhere and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerged from,</v>

645
00:31:17.821 --> 00:31:22.020
<v Speaker 2>from dreams and hypothesis and artistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>visions and all of that over a long </v>

646
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:26.071
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they get clarified into </v>

647
00:31:26.071 --> 00:31:27.430
<v Speaker 2>something like consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it takes a long time to get from,</v>

648
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.310
<v Speaker 2>to get from watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

649
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.800
<v Speaker 2>from two chimpanzees watching each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a human being saying,</v>

650
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:36.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

651
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:41.310
<v Speaker 2>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all exhibit this faculty called </v>

652
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.310
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

653
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.500
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a long journey.</v>

654
00:31:41.501 --> 00:31:43.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really long journey and there's</v>

655
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:48.151
<v Speaker 2>going to be plenty of stages in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I really like about </v>

656
00:31:48.151 --> 00:31:49.390
<v Speaker 2>John Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the developmental psychologist,</v>

657
00:31:49.391 --> 00:31:54.391
<v Speaker 2>was that he was so insistent that </v>
<v Speaker 2>children act out and dramatize ideas </v>

658
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:56.380
<v Speaker 2>before they understand them.</v>

659
00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:57.570
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

660
00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.730
<v Speaker 2>and Merlin Donald who is a psychologist </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Queen's university,</v>

661
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:03.820
<v Speaker 2>wrote a couple of interesting books </v>
<v Speaker 2>along those lines at all as well.</v>

662
00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:08.821
<v Speaker 2>Looking at the importance of invitation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the development of higher cognition </v>

663
00:32:08.821 --> 00:32:12.031
<v Speaker 2>and human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the notion that we embody ideas </v>

664
00:32:12.031 --> 00:32:14.410
<v Speaker 2>before we abstract them out and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent them in an articulated way,</v>

665
00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:19.411
<v Speaker 2>I think is an extraordinarily solid idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I really can't see how it could be </v>

666
00:32:19.411 --> 00:32:20.290
<v Speaker 2>any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you watch children,</v>

667
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:25.291
<v Speaker 2>you see that like think about what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>child is doing when he plays house or </v>

668
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:26.970
<v Speaker 2>she plays house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

669
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:27.630
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

670
00:32:27.631 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 2>the child acts out the father or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>

671
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.230
<v Speaker 2>But what's so interesting about new </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

672
00:32:32.231 --> 00:32:33.940
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that cute?</v>

673
00:32:33.941 --> 00:32:35.590
<v Speaker 2>She's imitating her mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

674
00:32:35.591 --> 00:32:36.640
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not.</v>

675
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 2>That's not what happens because when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a child imitates you,</v>

676
00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 2>it's very annoying because you move your</v>
<v Speaker 2>arm and then they move their arm and you</v>

677
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 2>know that you move your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the copy you.</v>

678
00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.910
<v Speaker 2>No one likes that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's direct direct invitation.</v>

679
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.680
<v Speaker 2>That's not what a child is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the child is playing,</v>

680
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
<v Speaker 2>what the child is doing is watching the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother over multiple instantiations and </v>

681
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:04.721
<v Speaker 2>then extracting out the spirit called </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother and that's whatever his mother </v>

682
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Speaker 2>like across all those multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestations.</v>

683
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:12.730
<v Speaker 2>And then laying out that pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>internally and manifesting itself in an </v>

684
00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.080
<v Speaker 2>abstract world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so sophisticated,</v>

685
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:20.081
<v Speaker 2>it's just I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're doing when you're </v>

686
00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:20.360
<v Speaker 2>playing house or having a tea partier or</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking care of a doll.</v>

687
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you've seen your mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of a doll,</v>

688
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:28.750
<v Speaker 2>you haven't seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that you're smart enough to pull </v>

689
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:31.961
<v Speaker 2>out the abstraction and then embody it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly the child is attempting to</v>

690
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:34.370
<v Speaker 2>strive towards an ideal at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

691
00:33:34.371 --> 00:33:37.120
<v Speaker 2>she's not lighting her doll on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

692
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:42.130
<v Speaker 2>or well with certain exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally ones that we try to not </v>

693
00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:43.910
<v Speaker 2>encourage.</v>

694
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

695
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:48.630
<v Speaker 2>so you see that capacity and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and children and,</v>

696
00:33:48.631 --> 00:33:50.990
<v Speaker 2>and it's something we also know that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>children don't,</v>

697
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:56.020
<v Speaker 2>don't engage in that sort of dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pretend play to a tremendous degree </v>

698
00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.610
<v Speaker 2>that they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't get properly socialized.</v>

699
00:33:58.611 --> 00:34:03.611
<v Speaker 2>It's really a critical element of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of developing self understanding and </v>

700
00:34:03.611 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 2>then also developing the capability of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being with others.</v>

701
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Because what you do when you're a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially around the age of four,</v>

702
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:15.010
<v Speaker 2>you jointly construct a shared fictional</v>
<v Speaker 2>world will play host together,</v>

703
00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:18.930
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you act out your,</v>

704
00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 2>your joint rules within that shared </v>
<v Speaker 2>fictional world,</v>

705
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

706
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's a form of eggs at a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced cognition.</v>

707
00:34:24.861 --> 00:34:28.250
<v Speaker 2>It's very sophisticated and I see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Piaget did as well.</v>

708
00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:31.570
<v Speaker 2>And so did you and sorted Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these brilliant observers and,</v>

709
00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:36.670
<v Speaker 2>and also Merlin Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these brilliant observers of the manner </v>

710
00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:40.661
<v Speaker 2>in which condition came to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they noted very clearly that embodied </v>

711
00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:44.741
<v Speaker 2>imitation and dramatic abstraction </v>
<v Speaker 2>constituted the ground out of which </v>

712
00:34:44.741 --> 00:34:47.150
<v Speaker 2>higher abstract cognition emerged.</v>

713
00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:52.390
<v Speaker 2>And how could it not be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously we were mostly bodies </v>

714
00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:57.101
<v Speaker 2>before we were mines clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we were acting out things way </v>

715
00:34:57.101 --> 00:35:01.571
<v Speaker 2>before we understood them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like the chimpanzees act out the </v>

716
00:35:01.571 --> 00:35:05.021
<v Speaker 2>idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to act reasonably sensibly if </v>

717
00:35:05.021 --> 00:35:06.390
<v Speaker 2>your head chimpanzee or you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get yourself rip,</v>

718
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.960
<v Speaker 2>rip apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see that role.</v>

719
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Because when wolves have a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispute,</v>

720
00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:13.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they puff up their hair at each other to</v>

721
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:16.430
<v Speaker 2>look big and they growl and bark and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

722
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very menacing.</v>

723
00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:20.720
<v Speaker 2>And one wolf chickens out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules over puts up his neck.</v>

724
00:35:20.721 --> 00:35:22.610
<v Speaker 2>And basically what he's saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

725
00:35:22.611 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty useless so you can kill me if</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

726
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.130
<v Speaker 2>if you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other wolf says,</v>

727
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

728
00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.550
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty useless and I could tear </v>
<v Speaker 2>out your throat,</v>

729
00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:33.710
<v Speaker 2>but tomorrow we might need to bring down</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wolf so,</v>

730
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.470
<v Speaker 2>or a moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll keep you out.</v>

731
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:42.120
<v Speaker 2>And it's sort of like they think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't know,</v>

732
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.150
<v Speaker 2>they don't think that they acted out as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a behavioral pattern.</v>

733
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Then if you're an anthropologist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>aura,</v>

734
00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an ecologist and you went and </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched the wolves,</v>

735
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.840
<v Speaker 2>you'd say it's as if they were acting </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the following rule.</v>

736
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.910
<v Speaker 2>And that often confused me because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

737
00:35:56.911 --> 00:35:57.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wolves,</v>

738
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 2>wolves act out rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

739
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:01.110
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

740
00:36:01.111 --> 00:36:06.111
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A rule is what we construct when we </v>

741
00:36:06.111 --> 00:36:07.320
<v Speaker 2>articulate a behavioral pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

742
00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 2>We observe a stable behavioral pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when we articulate it,</v>

743
00:36:10.471 --> 00:36:12.450
<v Speaker 2>we can call it a rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the walls,</v>

744
00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:15.630
<v Speaker 2>it's not a rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a stable behavioral pattern.</v>

745
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:19.680
<v Speaker 2>And so we acted like wolf troops or </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzee troops,</v>

746
00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:22.890
<v Speaker 2>all of that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for for untold,</v>

747
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:27.240
<v Speaker 2>really untold tens and perhaps hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of millions of years before we were able</v>

748
00:36:27.241 --> 00:36:32.241
<v Speaker 2>to formulate that pattern of behavior in</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything approximating a story or an </v>

749
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:36.030
<v Speaker 2>image and an even longer before we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate it as a set of,</v>

750
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:36.900
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

751
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ethical rules.</v>

752
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.220
<v Speaker 2>And I'm dwelling on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I've repeated this,</v>

753
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:47.230
<v Speaker 2>some of this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so important because you know </v>

754
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.590
<v Speaker 2>there's this tremendous push,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially from the social,</v>

755
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:54.740
<v Speaker 2>the social constructionists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make the case that ethics is </v>

756
00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.090
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary and ethics or morality is </v>
<v Speaker 2>relative.</v>

757
00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.180
<v Speaker 2>There's no fundamental biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>grounding in relationship to human </v>

758
00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:02.180
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the,</v>

759
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.680
<v Speaker 2>in the category of ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's.</v>

760
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:05.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

761
00:37:05.521 --> 00:37:10.521
<v Speaker 2>it's dangerous because that means that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are anything you want to turn </v>

762
00:37:10.521 --> 00:37:12.210
<v Speaker 2>them into and you bloody well better be </v>
<v Speaker 2>careful of people who think that.</v>

763
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.420
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that the evidence that </v>

764
00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.660
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong is so overwhelming that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should just stop thinking that way.</v>

765
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly why I'm also attacking</v>

766
00:37:22.051 --> 00:37:27.051
<v Speaker 2>this from an evolutionary perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of converging lines of </v>

767
00:37:27.051 --> 00:37:28.830
<v Speaker 2>evidence that ethic ethical standards </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

768
00:37:28.831 --> 00:37:29.450
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

769
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:34.490
<v Speaker 2>at least of the most of the most crucial</v>
<v Speaker 2>store sort not only evolved but also </v>

770
00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:37.320
<v Speaker 2>spontaneously reemerge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

771
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:42.321
<v Speaker 2>in the dramatic play of children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need to take that seriously and </v>

772
00:37:42.321 --> 00:37:46.551
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's partly what we're doing </v>

773
00:37:46.551 --> 00:37:46.551
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to take that seriously.</v>

774
00:37:46.551 --> 00:37:46.580
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

775
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.950
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the idea there,</v>

776
00:37:55.070 --> 00:38:00.070
<v Speaker 2>at least in part was that the father </v>
<v Speaker 2>employed the sun to generate habitable </v>

777
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:00.110
<v Speaker 2>order out of chaos.</v>

778
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I also think there might be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>more approximately true about that as </v>

779
00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:07.610
<v Speaker 2>well too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things we do know,</v>

780
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:13.300
<v Speaker 2>here's something that's cool about men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men are much more criminal than women </v>

781
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:19.390
<v Speaker 2>and that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does not look like it's </v>

782
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:19.390
<v Speaker 2>sociocultural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because it peaks.</v>

783
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:23.810
<v Speaker 2>When testosterone kicks in around 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could just spikes the hell up and then</v>

784
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:25.000
<v Speaker 2>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

785
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:30.010
<v Speaker 2>it stays pretty high until about 27.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so standard peanut logical theory </v>

786
00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.780
<v Speaker 2>for those of you who don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you have a repeat offender,</v>

787
00:38:32.781 --> 00:38:34.580
<v Speaker 2>you know a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just won't stop getting in trouble.</v>

788
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 2>He has throw them in prison until he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>28 and it isn't like you're </v>

789
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.601
<v Speaker 2>rehabilitating and or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like by 28 he's done with his </v>

790
00:38:42.601 --> 00:38:46.651
<v Speaker 2>criminal career because the crime curve </v>
<v Speaker 2>is peaks at 15 and then falls down </v>

791
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 2>around 27 or so.</v>

792
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:50.140
<v Speaker 2>It burns out and that's often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

793
00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:51.200
<v Speaker 2>that's often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

794
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.610
<v Speaker 2>That's often when men get married and </v>
<v Speaker 2>settle down and stabilize.</v>

795
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.880
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that's cool about that is the </v>

796
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.780
<v Speaker 2>creativity curve for men and is almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same thing.</v>

797
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:06.160
<v Speaker 2>It ramps up when testosterone kicks in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it starts to flatten out around</v>

798
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 2>27 that the curves match very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very closely so that.</v>

799
00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:14.581
<v Speaker 2>So that's quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least the creativity element of it </v>

800
00:39:14.581 --> 00:39:18.160
<v Speaker 2>that I'm particularly interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>because their creativity is in many ways</v>

801
00:39:18.161 --> 00:39:20.500
<v Speaker 2>had attribute of youth and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

802
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

803
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:26.850
<v Speaker 2>if you look at that sentence and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>stripped it of its religious context,</v>

804
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:32.510
<v Speaker 2>what you would say is that the older </v>
<v Speaker 2>people use the younger people to </v>

805
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.130
<v Speaker 2>generate creative ideas and renew the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

806
00:39:35.131 --> 00:39:35.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

807
00:39:35.611 --> 00:39:36.600
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens.</v>

808
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:41.630
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also have no idea how many of the </v>

809
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:42.930
<v Speaker 2>things that we discovered or invented as</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>

810
00:39:42.931 --> 00:39:45.720
<v Speaker 2>we're stumbled across by children and </v>
<v Speaker 2>adolescents,</v>

811
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're,</v>

812
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're much more exploratory.</v>

813
00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:54.610
<v Speaker 2>There are less constrained by their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by their already extend knowledge </v>

814
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.350
<v Speaker 2>structures and they're less </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>

815
00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:58.740
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems right to me.</v>

816
00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:03.770
<v Speaker 2>So right in an extraordinarily important</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

817
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:06.900
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also means that if,</v>

818
00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:11.930
<v Speaker 2>like if you're an actual father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that it means is that </v>

819
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.410
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraging your son to do,</v>

820
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:14.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

821
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:19.500
<v Speaker 2>which is because the role of a father is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to encourage that is clearly the role.</v>

822
00:40:19.501 --> 00:40:21.630
<v Speaker 2>And to encourage just to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well go out there,</v>

823
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:26.900
<v Speaker 2>confront the chaos of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the unknown and the chaos that </v>

824
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.170
<v Speaker 2>underlies everything and grappled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

825
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can do it.</v>

826
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:32.330
<v Speaker 2>You're as big as the chaos itself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

827
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.340
<v Speaker 2>do something useful as a consequence and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make your life better and make everyone </v>

828
00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:37.370
<v Speaker 2>else's life better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

829
00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:38.820
<v Speaker 2>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>

830
00:40:38.821 --> 00:40:41.430
<v Speaker 2>that's the right thing to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the right thing to tell.</v>

831
00:40:41.431 --> 00:40:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Young men and talking to young women is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more complicated because they have more,</v>

832
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:50.300
<v Speaker 2>more let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues to deal with because their lives </v>

833
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.140
<v Speaker 2>are more complicated in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's definitely the right thing to</v>

834
00:40:52.141 --> 00:40:56.370
<v Speaker 2>be to be telling your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your son and one of the things that I've</v>

835
00:40:56.371 --> 00:40:58.590
<v Speaker 2>really noticed recently since I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecturing,</v>

836
00:40:58.591 --> 00:41:00.270
<v Speaker 2>especially in the last seven or eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

837
00:41:00.271 --> 00:41:04.580
<v Speaker 2>most of my audiences being young man and</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've talked a lot of them too,</v>

838
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:05.100
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

839
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I've talked a lot to them about both </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth and responsibility and I think </v>

840
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:14.421
<v Speaker 2>that those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the two things that underlie </v>

841
00:41:14.421 --> 00:41:16.641
<v Speaker 2>this capacity and it seems to me to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous hunger for that idea.</v>

842
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same idea as rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

843
00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:21.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a very different idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

844
00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:23.640
<v Speaker 2>it's the counterpart to rights and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

845
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is hard.</v>

846
00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.960
<v Speaker 2>It's chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult.</v>

847
00:41:27.961 --> 00:41:32.961
<v Speaker 2>It's really definitely a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can either shrink from that </v>

848
00:41:32.961 --> 00:41:34.730
<v Speaker 2>and no bloody wonder because you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to kill you.</v>

849
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no joke,</v>

850
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:41.830
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can forthrightly confronted and </v>

851
00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:41.830
<v Speaker 2>try to do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

852
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.180
<v Speaker 2>what's better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you say to the person,</v>

853
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:46.130
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do it like that's what a human</v>

854
00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:51.131
<v Speaker 2>being is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you just stood up and get </v>

855
00:41:51.131 --> 00:41:52.940
<v Speaker 2>yourself together and you'd find out by </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying that,</v>

856
00:41:52.941 --> 00:41:56.050
<v Speaker 2>you can in fact do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do think that that's,</v>

857
00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 2>that's a great core religious message as</v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I can tell and I think that's </v>

858
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.050
<v Speaker 2>deeply embedded in this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this sort of idea.</v>

859
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:04.930
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

860
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:09.970
<v Speaker 2>so this is what I've been telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something like how knowledge </v>

861
00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:10.100
<v Speaker 2>itself is generated.</v>

862
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.360
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the unknown as such,</v>

863
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 2>and that's really what you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about.</v>

864
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.420
<v Speaker 2>And generally when you encounter that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't encounter it with thought.</v>

865
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.480
<v Speaker 2>You encounter it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

866
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.230
<v Speaker 2>And that that's the first representation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the absolutely unknown.</v>

867
00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:32.590
<v Speaker 2>It's something that is beyond your </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehension and it's terrifying and </v>

868
00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.440
<v Speaker 2>because it's beyond your comprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot perceive it.</v>

869
00:42:33.441 --> 00:42:35.810
<v Speaker 2>You can not understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still have to deal with it.</v>

870
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.090
<v Speaker 2>And the way you deal with it is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>freeze.</v>

871
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:43.540
<v Speaker 2>That's what the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a Bassa lisc does say to </v>

872
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:43.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the kids in Harry Potter,</v>

873
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take a look at it and they freeze.</v>

874
00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:50.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the terrible snake of chaos that leaves </v>

875
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:50.600
<v Speaker 2>underneath everything you see that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing freezes you,</v>

876
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:55.810
<v Speaker 2>and that's because you're a prey animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time it makes you </v>

877
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:55.810
<v Speaker 2>curious.</v>

878
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:59.470
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the first level of contact</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the absolute unknown is the </v>

879
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.010
<v Speaker 2>emotional combination of freezing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity.</v>

880
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:06.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's reflected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in the dragon stories.</v>

881
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:12.070
<v Speaker 2>The dragon is the terrible thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives underground the hordes gold or </v>

882
00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:12.070
<v Speaker 2>hoards virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

883
00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.570
<v Speaker 2>very strange behavior for a reptile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we pointed out before.</v>

884
00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.900
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is that it's a symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the predatory quality </v>

885
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:25.961
<v Speaker 2>of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>combined with the capacity of the </v>

886
00:43:25.961 --> 00:43:27.890
<v Speaker 2>unknown to generate nothing but novel </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

887
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:32.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see that as very characteristic </v>

888
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960
<v Speaker 2>of human beings because we are prey </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

889
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.160
<v Speaker 2>but we're also unbelievably exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're pretty damn good predators.</v>

890
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 2>And we occupied this weird cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>niche.</v>

891
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:44.441
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things we've learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if we forthrightly confront the </v>

892
00:43:44.441 --> 00:43:45.680
<v Speaker 2>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying as it is,</v>

893
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a massive prize to be gained </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually.</v>

894
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:53.030
<v Speaker 2>And so that seems to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

895
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:58.230
<v Speaker 2>It's true as anything is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would also say that that </v>

896
00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:01.181
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we know that one of the metaphors </v>

897
00:44:01.181 --> 00:44:04.331
<v Speaker 2>that underlies God's extraction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>habitable order out of chaos at the </v>

898
00:44:04.331 --> 00:44:08.951
<v Speaker 2>beginning of time is an older idea and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more archaic idea that God confronted </v>

899
00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:15.011
<v Speaker 2>something like the Leviathan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the words for this </v>

900
00:44:15.011 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 2>serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like chaos creature that's often used in</v>

901
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:20.831
<v Speaker 2>the old testament or the a leviathan and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ba,</v>

902
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Bam off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

903
00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:27.011
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this idea that I think </v>

904
00:44:27.011 --> 00:44:29.420
<v Speaker 2>came probably came from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamians that the god either in the</v>

905
00:44:29.421 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 2>sunlight aspect or in the farther aspect</v>

906
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.100
<v Speaker 4>is the thing that confronts this </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible beast that represents the </v>

907
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.371
<v Speaker 4>chaotic unknown and cuts it into pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then sometimes give the body parts </v>

908
00:44:40.371 --> 00:44:45.171
<v Speaker 4>to the populace in order to feed them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can see a hunting metaphor there </v>

909
00:44:45.171 --> 00:44:45.240
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's deeper than that.</v>

910
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.340
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

911
00:44:47.341 --> 00:44:52.341
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the first thing is that there's the </v>

912
00:44:52.341 --> 00:44:53.040
<v Speaker 4>absolute unknown and the unknown is what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do not understand.</v>

913
00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:56.640
<v Speaker 4>It's what's beyond the campfire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's what's beyond the tree.</v>

914
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.420
<v Speaker 4>Even more anciently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

915
00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 4>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we lived in trees,</v>

916
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:01.420
<v Speaker 4>it's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

917
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 4>you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what's out there,</v>

918
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:08.180
<v Speaker 4>crocodiles and snakes and birds of prey </v>
<v Speaker 4>and cats and all sorts of things like </v>

919
00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.840
<v Speaker 4>predatory cats and they will eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's utility and going out there </v>

920
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 4>to find out what's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe you go and you don't kill the</v>

921
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 4>snake.</v>

922
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:19.670
<v Speaker 4>You killed the damn nest of snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes you pretty popular just as </v>

923
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 4>you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not accelerates your,</v>

924
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:21.920
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

925
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:24.390
<v Speaker 4>reproductive potential,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

926
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 4>And we're descended from people who did </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

927
00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:29.880
<v Speaker 4>And so we have this notion about how the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world is structured,</v>

928
00:45:29.881 --> 00:45:32.460
<v Speaker 4>this deeply embedded in our psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really,</v>

929
00:45:32.461 --> 00:45:33.690
<v Speaker 4>really deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

930
00:45:33.691 --> 00:45:37.530
<v Speaker 4>way down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way below the surface cognition way down</v>

931
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:42.531
<v Speaker 4>in the limbic system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these ancient parts of the brain </v>

932
00:45:42.531 --> 00:45:45.261
<v Speaker 4>that are like $60,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million years old or 100 million years </v>

933
00:45:45.261 --> 00:45:45.261
<v Speaker 4>old or older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ancient,</v>

934
00:45:45.261 --> 00:45:50.000
<v Speaker 4>ancient brain structures and so the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first thing we do is we act out our </v>

935
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.220
<v Speaker 4>encounter with the unknown world and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>act that out in the same way,</v>

936
00:45:53.221 --> 00:45:58.221
<v Speaker 4>in a manner that's analogous to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>manor that's presented as a description </v>

937
00:45:58.221 --> 00:45:59.910
<v Speaker 4>of what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but God does at the beginning of time to</v>

938
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:03.580
<v Speaker 4>extract habitable order out of chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

939
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.730
<v Speaker 4>I will tell you about the other part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that for now.</v>

940
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:10.970
<v Speaker 4>So you act it out first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the second thing is you watch </v>

941
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.660
<v Speaker 4>people who acted out and you start to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make representations of that.</v>

942
00:46:14.661 --> 00:46:19.661
<v Speaker 4>That story's right and maybe you admire </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and then after a long time you </v>

943
00:46:19.661 --> 00:46:21.960
<v Speaker 4>collect a bunch of those stories and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can say what that is.</v>

944
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:26.961
<v Speaker 4>You can articulate it as a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this is something needs shift </v>

945
00:46:26.961 --> 00:46:30.770
<v Speaker 4>also figured out to begin with because </v>
<v Speaker 4>prior to Nisha I would say he did so </v>

946
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:32.820
<v Speaker 4>many things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First it was quite remarkable.</v>

947
00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:38.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was an idea that you first think </v>

948
00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:38.710
<v Speaker 4>and then you act and people like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that,</v>

949
00:46:38.711 --> 00:46:43.711
<v Speaker 4>but of course you do it complete bloody </v>
<v Speaker 4>rubbish because you're in as impulsive </v>

950
00:46:43.711 --> 00:46:47.661
<v Speaker 4>as you can possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're always doing things before you </v>

951
00:46:47.661 --> 00:46:48.150
<v Speaker 4>think and sometimes that's a really good</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

952
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that you see things and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>think and then act,</v>

953
00:46:51.271 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

954
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.410
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry I don't do that.</v>

955
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.160
<v Speaker 4>No one I know I know does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they certainly do that.</v>

956
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:00.750
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they're emotional,</v>

957
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:02.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you act first.</v>

958
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:07.370
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that Nisha said </v>
<v Speaker 4>very clearly was that our ideas emerged </v>

959
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:10.500
<v Speaker 4>out of the ground of our action over </v>
<v Speaker 4>over thousands and thousands of years.</v>

960
00:47:10.501 --> 00:47:13.740
<v Speaker 4>And then when philosophers were putting </v>
<v Speaker 4>forward those ideas,</v>

961
00:47:13.741 --> 00:47:17.160
<v Speaker 4>what they were doing wasn't generating </v>
<v Speaker 4>creative ideas,</v>

962
00:47:17.161 --> 00:47:22.161
<v Speaker 4>they were just telling the story of </v>
<v Speaker 4>humanity and it's already there.</v>

963
00:47:22.471 --> 00:47:27.471
<v Speaker 4>It's already in us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's already in our patterns of </v>

964
00:47:27.471 --> 00:47:27.471
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

965
00:47:27.471 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 4>and it strikes me that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

966
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.410
<v Speaker 4>he was a genius and that was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>genius,</v>

967
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:33.340
<v Speaker 4>one of his</v>

968
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.470
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many observations of pure genius.</v>

969
00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.040
<v Speaker 4>And so you can think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

970
00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:42.050
<v Speaker 4>you can think about it like this too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that there's the unknown and then you</v>

971
00:47:42.051 --> 00:47:47.051
<v Speaker 4>act in the face of the unknown and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you dream about the action and that's </v>

972
00:47:47.051 --> 00:47:50.210
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing in a movie theater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you speak about it.</v>

973
00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.740
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

974
00:47:51.741 --> 00:47:53.210
<v Speaker 4>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you speak about it,</v>

975
00:47:53.211 --> 00:47:55.970
<v Speaker 4>that effects how you dream and how you </v>
<v Speaker 4>dream affects how you act.</v>

976
00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.270
<v Speaker 4>It's not like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the causal direction is,</v>

977
00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.300
<v Speaker 4>is one way because it's not these things</v>
<v Speaker 4>loop,</v>

978
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.450
<v Speaker 4>but it's still from the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the body,</v>

979
00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.850
<v Speaker 4>through the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into articulation.</v>

980
00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:10.070
<v Speaker 4>That's the primary mode of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>generation of,</v>

981
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.420
<v Speaker 4>of wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

982
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:16.630
<v Speaker 4>And you can easily map that onto an </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary explanation because the </v>

983
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:17.390
<v Speaker 4>body comes first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

984
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:19.640
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the imagination,</v>

985
00:48:19.641 --> 00:48:23.120
<v Speaker 4>which is the body in abstraction and </v>
<v Speaker 4>only then the word.</v>

986
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:28.270
<v Speaker 4>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly how things did evolve </v>

987
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:29.600
<v Speaker 4>because we could imagine things long </v>
<v Speaker 4>before we could speak,</v>

988
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.490
<v Speaker 4>at least that's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

989
00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:36.120
<v Speaker 4>and I represented that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

990
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:39.450
<v Speaker 4>a image from my book maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

991
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:44.950
<v Speaker 4>so the idea is that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental representation of the </v>

992
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:48.801
<v Speaker 4>unknown as such,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's half spirit because it partakes of </v>

993
00:48:48.801 --> 00:48:51.420
<v Speaker 4>the air like a bird and it's half matter</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's on the ground like a,</v>

994
00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.100
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a snake.</v>

995
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:58.370
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what you think is there when </v>

996
00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:01.641
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what is there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how your body reacts to what's </v>

997
00:49:01.641 --> 00:49:01.641
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you don't know what is there,</v>

998
00:49:01.641 --> 00:49:04.320
<v Speaker 4>you know that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you're alone at night,</v>

999
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:06.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe you're a little rattled up for</v>

1000
00:49:06.781 --> 00:49:07.410
<v Speaker 4>one reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

1001
00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:12.411
<v Speaker 4>maybe you watched a horror movie and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know there's some weird noise in the </v>

1002
00:49:12.411 --> 00:49:13.540
<v Speaker 4>other room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's dark and you can just try this one.</v>

1003
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:15.420
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're on edge,</v>

1004
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:18.690
<v Speaker 4>you think you want to turn the light on </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go in the room and see,</v>

1005
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.530
<v Speaker 4>don't do that.</v>

1006
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:24.530
<v Speaker 4>Just opened the door a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sneak your hand in and just watch what </v>

1007
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:25.980
<v Speaker 4>your imagination fills that room with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1008
00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:31.220
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you remember what it's like to be </v>

1009
00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:31.220
<v Speaker 4>three years old in bed and afraid of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark.</v>

1010
00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I read a good book on dragons </v>

1011
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 4>lately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently that,</v>

1012
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.040
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that had a very interesting hypothesis </v>

1013
00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.291
<v Speaker 4>about the bi thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things the guy did was a </v>

1014
00:49:42.291 --> 00:49:42.291
<v Speaker 4>track,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember his name,</v>

1015
00:49:42.291 --> 00:49:45.900
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately track how common the image</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the dragon was worldwide.</v>

1016
00:49:45.901 --> 00:49:47.790
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievably what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Widespread.</v>

1017
00:49:47.791 --> 00:49:52.791
<v Speaker 4>It's crazily widespread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he thought that this was actually </v>

1018
00:49:52.791 --> 00:49:56.541
<v Speaker 4>the category of a primate Predator and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Predator was.</v>

1019
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:59.650
<v Speaker 4>So Predator is a weird category,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1020
00:49:59.651 --> 00:50:04.651
<v Speaker 4>Because like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's crocodiles in it and there's </v>

1021
00:50:04.651 --> 00:50:04.651
<v Speaker 4>lions and they don't have much in common</v>
<v Speaker 4>except they eat you.</v>

1022
00:50:04.651 --> 00:50:07.300
<v Speaker 4>So it's a functional category.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this is the,</v>

1023
00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:11.320
<v Speaker 4>this is the images stick representation </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the functional category of Predator.</v>

1024
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.450
<v Speaker 4>And his Predator theory was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1025
00:50:13.451 --> 00:50:16.570
<v Speaker 4>if you're a monkey than a bird would </v>
<v Speaker 4>pick you off like an eagle.</v>

1026
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.860
<v Speaker 4>And so that's this.</v>

1027
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1028
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:25.650
<v Speaker 4>And then if it wasn't illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a cat because they clump cherry </v>

1029
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.010
<v Speaker 4>trees and give you a good chomping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if it wasn't a cat,</v>

1030
00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.270
<v Speaker 4>you go down to the ground and a snake </v>
<v Speaker 4>would get you.</v>

1031
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe a snake would climb up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tree.</v>

1032
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:32.420
<v Speaker 4>Cause snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like do that and get you,</v>

1033
00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.600
<v Speaker 4>and so that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a tree cat,</v>

1034
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:39.090
<v Speaker 4>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically free cap,</v>

1035
00:50:39.091 --> 00:50:40.490
<v Speaker 4>snake bird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the thing.</v>

1036
00:50:40.491 --> 00:50:45.491
<v Speaker 4>You really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing you really want to </v>

1037
00:50:45.491 --> 00:50:47.861
<v Speaker 4>avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to come across one of </v>

1038
00:50:47.861 --> 00:50:49.541
<v Speaker 4>those and so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the other thing it does is </v>

1039
00:50:49.541 --> 00:50:52.091
<v Speaker 4>breathe fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is quite interesting because </v>

1040
00:50:52.091 --> 00:50:54.190
<v Speaker 4>obviously fire was both greatest friend </v>
<v Speaker 4>in greatest enemy of humanity and we've </v>

1041
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:59.111
<v Speaker 4>mastered fire for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be as long as two or 3 billion </v>

1042
00:50:59.111 --> 00:51:00.330
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what Richard Wrangham,</v>

1043
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.320
<v Speaker 4>I think it's rang him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote a book recently on,</v>

1044
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:07.850
<v Speaker 4>I think it was random who wrote a book </v>
<v Speaker 4>on when human beings learn to cook.</v>

1045
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:13.230
<v Speaker 4>That was about 2 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And cooking increase the increase the </v>

1046
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:18.610
<v Speaker 4>availability of calories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know how chimpanzees are sort of </v>

1047
00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:18.610
<v Speaker 4>shaped like a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're ugly.</v>

1048
00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:20.270
<v Speaker 4>They're shaped like a big bowling ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1049
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 4>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look really fat and it's.</v>

1050
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:27.580
<v Speaker 4>And they're short and they're wide and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's because they have intestinal </v>

1051
00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:31.031
<v Speaker 4>tracts that are like 300 miles long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is because they </v>

1052
00:51:31.031 --> 00:51:33.710
<v Speaker 4>have to digest leaves and so you go out </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the forest and like sit there and eat</v>

1053
00:51:33.711 --> 00:51:35.840
<v Speaker 4>leaves for a whole day and see how that </v>
<v Speaker 4>works out for you.</v>

1054
00:51:35.841 --> 00:51:38.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have no calories in them.</v>

1055
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.550
<v Speaker 4>So chimps spend to bite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>

1056
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:46.930
<v Speaker 4>I think it's eight hours a day chewing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's because what they eat has no </v>

1057
00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:51.701
<v Speaker 4>nutritional value and then they have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have this tremendous got to in order to </v>

1058
00:51:51.701 --> 00:51:51.701
<v Speaker 4>extract anything at all out of it.</v>

1059
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:53.360
<v Speaker 4>And human beings at some point just </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>

1060
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:54.890
<v Speaker 4>oh to hell with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll cook something.</v>

1061
00:51:54.891 --> 00:51:57.590
<v Speaker 4>And then we traded our gut for brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

1062
00:51:57.591 --> 00:51:59.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more or less has worked and I think it's</v>

1063
00:51:59.661 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 4>made us a lot more attractive as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1064
00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:03.680
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1065
00:52:03.681 --> 00:52:08.681
<v Speaker 4>so the idea here was that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's the basic archetype of the </v>

1066
00:52:08.681 --> 00:52:12.461
<v Speaker 4>unknown as such.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I liked the St George version </v>

1067
00:52:12.461 --> 00:52:14.030
<v Speaker 4>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so cool because St George,</v>

1068
00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:17.180
<v Speaker 4>it lives in a castle and the castle is </v>
<v Speaker 4>partly falling down.</v>

1069
00:52:17.181 --> 00:52:19.610
<v Speaker 4>And it's partly because there's a dragon</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's come up too,</v>

1070
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:24.760
<v Speaker 4>like it's an eternal dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's come back to give her two in a </v>

1071
00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.240
<v Speaker 4>rough time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which always happens because there is an</v>

1072
00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.580
<v Speaker 4>eternal dragon is always given,</v>
<v Speaker 4>giving our fallen down,</v>

1073
00:52:28.581 --> 00:52:30.680
<v Speaker 4>castle's a rough time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

1074
00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:36.310
<v Speaker 4>And so then St George is the hero who </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes out to confront the dragon and he </v>

1075
00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:37.160
<v Speaker 4>frees the virgin from its grasp.</v>

1076
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:42.220
<v Speaker 4>And I would say that's a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>straightforward story about the sexual </v>

1077
00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:45.130
<v Speaker 4>attractiveness of the masculine spirit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's willing to forthrightly encounter</v>

1078
00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.210
<v Speaker 4>the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

1079
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:51.230
<v Speaker 4>It looks just straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a straight biological </v>

1080
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.710
<v Speaker 4>representation to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a really,</v>

1081
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 4>really old story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1082
00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:58.511
<v Speaker 4>It's the oldest written story we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's basically the Mesopotamian </v>

1083
00:52:58.511 --> 00:52:58.511
<v Speaker 4>creation myth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Enuma Elish,</v>

1084
00:52:58.511 --> 00:53:03.371
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which basically lays out precisely that </v>

1085
00:53:03.371 --> 00:53:03.371
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1086
00:53:03.371 --> 00:53:04.130
<v Speaker 4>and it's replayed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1087
00:53:04.131 --> 00:53:09.131
<v Speaker 4>I bet you the movie goers among you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially the ones that are more </v>

1088
00:53:09.131 --> 00:53:09.860
<v Speaker 4>attracted to the superhero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1089
00:53:09.861 --> 00:53:12.470
<v Speaker 4>they're really flashy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of superhero type movies.</v>

1090
00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:16.940
<v Speaker 4>You've probably seen the St George story</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 150 times in the last 10 years.</v>

1091
00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:20.360
<v Speaker 4>You never get tired of it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the central story of mankind,</v>

1092
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:25.630
<v Speaker 4>so you've got the unknown as such,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that is what you react to with your </v>

1093
00:53:26.011 --> 00:53:31.011
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then in the existential terror and </v>

1094
00:53:31.011 --> 00:53:33.861
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary curiosity or gripping you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it's like the unknown unknowns </v>

1095
00:53:34.921 --> 00:53:35.490
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1096
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:39.720
<v Speaker 4>who's the politician under Bush </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rumsfeld.</v>

1097
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:44.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the reason that that phrase </v>

1098
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:44.720
<v Speaker 4>caught on so well is because he nailed </v>
<v Speaker 4>an archetype.</v>

1099
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 4>There's unknown unknowns and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>known unknowns and the unknown unknown.</v>

1100
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:52.410
<v Speaker 4>And you have to be able to react to an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown unknown because they can get you</v>

1101
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:56.340
<v Speaker 4>and you can't just plead ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 4>because then your dad that doesn't work.</v>

1102
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.730
<v Speaker 4>Like human beings are the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>creature who has to know what to do when</v>

1103
00:53:59.731 --> 00:54:02.700
<v Speaker 4>they don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's very paradoxical.</v>

1104
00:54:02.701 --> 00:54:05.340
<v Speaker 4>And what we do is we prepare to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that's right.</v>

1105
00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:07.410
<v Speaker 4>We're on guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We prepared to do everything very,</v>

1106
00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:10.740
<v Speaker 4>very stressful and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also very engaging and very,</v>

1107
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:15.770
<v Speaker 4>very much something that heightened </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and maybe those circuits </v>

1108
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:18.951
<v Speaker 4>are tr permanently turned on in human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings because we also know that we're </v>

1109
00:54:18.951 --> 00:54:19.380
<v Speaker 4>going to die and no other animal knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1110
00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.700
<v Speaker 4>And so sometimes I think that our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that our stress circuits are just on all</v>

1111
00:54:23.701 --> 00:54:28.701
<v Speaker 4>the time and that's part of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>accounts for our heightened </v>

1112
00:54:28.701 --> 00:54:28.701
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>

1113
00:54:28.701 --> 00:54:31.140
<v Speaker 4>So you have your unknown unknowns and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have your relatively,</v>

1114
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.470
<v Speaker 4>you have the unknowns that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounter in the world,</v>

1115
00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 4>like the mystery of your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your,</v>

1116
00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:39.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a romantic partner when you have a fight</v>

1117
00:54:39.601 --> 00:54:40.320
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1118
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.170
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're having a fight?</v>

1119
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:46.210
<v Speaker 4>Who the hell are you mean you're not the</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolute unknown because I know </v>

1120
00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:50.001
<v Speaker 4>something about you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're the unknown as it's </v>

1121
00:54:50.001 --> 00:54:50.070
<v Speaker 4>manifesting itself to me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1122
00:54:50.071 --> 00:54:50.840
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1123
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:54.960
<v Speaker 4>and then there's the known that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhabit and then there's the knower.</v>

1124
00:54:54.961 --> 00:54:59.961
<v Speaker 4>And the known is given symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 4>representation as far as I've been able </v>

1125
00:54:59.961 --> 00:55:02.940
<v Speaker 4>to tell in patriarchal form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the form of a male deities.</v>

1126
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:06.390
<v Speaker 4>And the unknown as you encountered is </v>
<v Speaker 4>given feminine form,</v>

1127
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.680
<v Speaker 4>so we won't get into that too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're interested in that,</v>

1128
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.420
<v Speaker 4>you could look at my maps of meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lectures,</v>

1129
00:55:12.421 --> 00:55:13.620
<v Speaker 4>or maybe take a look at the book.</v>

1130
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:18.630
<v Speaker 4>But I think it's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a good schema for religious</v>

1131
00:55:18.631 --> 00:55:19.430
<v Speaker 4>archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1132
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.590
<v Speaker 4>I've worked on a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to fit the union criteria quite</v>

1133
00:55:22.591 --> 00:55:27.591
<v Speaker 4>nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It maps nicely on to Joseph Campbell's </v>

1134
00:55:27.591 --> 00:55:27.591
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got almost all his ideas from you,</v>

1135
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.940
<v Speaker 4>however.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1136
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:35.180
<v Speaker 4>and it also makes sense from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological and evolutionary perspective </v>

1137
00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.810
<v Speaker 4>as far as I can tell that's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cross validation,</v>

1138
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.690
<v Speaker 4>at least in my estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1139
00:55:39.691 --> 00:55:41.760
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So back to the hierarchy of dominance.</v>

1140
00:55:41.761 --> 00:55:43.530
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's take a look at it a little bit.</v>

1141
00:55:43.531 --> 00:55:48.531
<v Speaker 4>So I'm quite enamored of lobsters as </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of you might know because I found </v>

1142
00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:52.050
<v Speaker 4>out this just blew me away when I found </v>
<v Speaker 4>it out.</v>

1143
00:55:52.051 --> 00:55:54.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've done a lot of work in </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurochemistry,</v>

1144
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.730
<v Speaker 4>functional neurochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemistry,</v>

1145
00:55:56.731 --> 00:56:01.731
<v Speaker 4>because I used to study alcoholism and </v>
<v Speaker 4>drug abuse and alcoholism to study </v>

1146
00:56:01.731 --> 00:56:06.441
<v Speaker 4>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to know a lot about the brain </v>

1147
00:56:06.441 --> 00:56:06.441
<v Speaker 4>because alcohol goes to everywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain.</v>

1148
00:56:06.441 --> 00:56:08.340
<v Speaker 4>It affects every neurochemical system </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so if you're going to study alcohol,</v>

1149
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:11.550
<v Speaker 4>you kind of have to study neurochemistry</v>
<v Speaker 4>in general,</v>

1150
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:14.380
<v Speaker 4>and so I did that for quite a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really got a narrative,</v>

1151
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.850
<v Speaker 4>a book called the neuropsychology of </v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety by Jeffrey Gray,</v>

1152
00:56:17.851 --> 00:56:21.230
<v Speaker 4>which is an absolute work of genius,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although extraordinary diff like it.</v>

1153
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:23.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many references that </v>
<v Speaker 4>book has.</v>

1154
00:56:23.291 --> 00:56:28.291
<v Speaker 4>It's like must be a thousand and gray </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually read them and worse he </v>

1155
00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:33.430
<v Speaker 4>understood them and then he and then he </v>
<v Speaker 4>integrated them into this book and so to</v>

1156
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:38.431
<v Speaker 4>read it you have to really master </v>
<v Speaker 4>functional neurochemistry and animal </v>

1157
00:56:38.431 --> 00:56:42.181
<v Speaker 4>behaviorism and and motivation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion and neuroanatomy like it's a </v>

1158
00:56:42.181 --> 00:56:42.850
<v Speaker 4>killer book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>

1159
00:56:42.851 --> 00:56:47.851
<v Speaker 4>it's really rich and it's taken </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologists about 40 years to really </v>

1160
00:56:47.851 --> 00:56:51.601
<v Speaker 4>unpack that book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things I learned about </v>

1161
00:56:51.601 --> 00:56:55.051
<v Speaker 4>that was just exactly how much </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuity there was in the </v>

1162
00:56:55.051 --> 00:56:55.570
<v Speaker 4>neurochemistry of human beings and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurochemistry of animals.</v>

1163
00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:57.540
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1164
00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.760
<v Speaker 4>it's the sort of thing that makes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact of evolution.</v>

1165
00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:05.820
<v Speaker 4>Something like self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think it's self evident for other </v>

1166
00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:06.610
<v Speaker 4>reasons that I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you about later.</v>

1167
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:09.100
<v Speaker 4>I think evolution or I think natural </v>
<v Speaker 4>selection,</v>

1168
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:14.610
<v Speaker 4>random mutation and natural selection is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only way you can solve the problem </v>

1169
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:19.770
<v Speaker 4>of how to deal with an environment </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's complex beyond your ability to </v>

1170
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:23.250
<v Speaker 4>comprehend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what you do is you generate </v>

1171
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:23.950
<v Speaker 4>endless variants because God only knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the Hell is gonna happen next.</v>

1172
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:28.540
<v Speaker 4>They own almost all of them die because </v>
<v Speaker 4>their failures and a couple of propagate</v>

1173
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.120
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the environment keeps moving around like</v>

1174
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:36.121
<v Speaker 4>a giant snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never know what it's going to do </v>

1175
00:57:36.121 --> 00:57:36.121
<v Speaker 4>next.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the best you can do is say,</v>

1176
00:57:36.121 --> 00:57:37.990
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's 30 things that might work and you</v>

1177
00:57:37.991 --> 00:57:39.700
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>28 of them are going to perish.</v>

1178
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:41.380
<v Speaker 4>Or if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if you're an insect,</v>

1179
00:57:41.381 --> 00:57:43.660
<v Speaker 4>it's like the ratio is way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way higher than that.</v>

1180
00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the lobsters and all of these.</v>

1181
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:52.420
<v Speaker 4>So these creatures engaging in dominance</v>
<v Speaker 4>disputes and,</v>

1182
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:57.470
<v Speaker 4>and I think dominance is the right way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to think about it because lobsters </v>

1183
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.470
<v Speaker 4>aren't very empathic and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>very social.</v>

1184
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:59.770
<v Speaker 4>And so it really is the toughest lobster</v>
<v Speaker 4>that wins,</v>

1185
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:05.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what's so cool about the lobster is </v>

1186
00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:05.100
<v Speaker 4>that when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when a lobster winds,</v>

1187
00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.870
<v Speaker 4>he flexes and gets bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he looks bigger because he's a </v>

1188
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:13.621
<v Speaker 4>winner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like he's advertising that in the </v>

1189
00:58:13.621 --> 00:58:16.080
<v Speaker 4>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the neurochemical system that makes him </v>

1190
00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:16.210
<v Speaker 4>flex is Sarah to Nirjah and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1191
00:58:16.211 --> 00:58:17.620
<v Speaker 4>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell does that mean?</v>

1192
00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:18.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you what it means.</v>

1193
00:58:18.851 --> 00:58:22.480
<v Speaker 4>It's the same chemical that's affected </v>
<v Speaker 4>by antidepressants and human beings.</v>

1194
00:58:22.481 --> 00:58:23.980
<v Speaker 4>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're depressed,</v>

1195
00:58:23.981 --> 00:58:25.330
<v Speaker 4>you're defeated lobster.</v>

1196
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.360
<v Speaker 4>Like you're like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm small,</v>

1197
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:28.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1198
00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:30.310
<v Speaker 4>things are dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to fight.</v>

1199
00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:32.270
<v Speaker 4>You give someone a united depressants </v>
<v Speaker 4>like cup,</v>

1200
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.860
<v Speaker 4>they stretch and then they're ready to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like take on the world again.</v>

1201
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:41.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you give lobsters who just got </v>

1202
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.190
<v Speaker 4>defeated in a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin,</v>

1203
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.950
<v Speaker 4>then they stretch out and they'll fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1204
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:46.330
<v Speaker 4>And that's like we separated from those </v>
<v Speaker 4>creatures on the evolutionary timescale.</v>

1205
00:58:46.331 --> 00:58:50.650
<v Speaker 4>Somewhere between 350 and 600 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago and the damn neurochemistry is</v>

1206
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 4>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that's another indication of just</v>

1207
00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.430
<v Speaker 4>how important hierarchies of authority </v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

1208
00:58:57.610 --> 00:59:00.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've been conserved since the time of</v>

1209
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:01.040
<v Speaker 4>lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1210
00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:05.860
<v Speaker 4>There were trees around with lobsters </v>
<v Speaker 4>first first manifested themselves on the</v>

1211
00:59:05.861 --> 00:59:10.861
<v Speaker 4>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what that means is these </v>

1212
00:59:10.861 --> 00:59:10.861
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies that I've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1213
00:59:10.861 --> 00:59:14.940
<v Speaker 4>those things are older than trees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the truisms for what </v>

1214
00:59:15.671 --> 00:59:20.110
<v Speaker 4>constitutes real from a Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective is that,</v>

1215
00:59:20.111 --> 00:59:22.880
<v Speaker 4>which has been around the longest period</v>
<v Speaker 4>of time,</v>

1216
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:23.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1217
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:26.540
<v Speaker 4>Because it's had the longest period of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time to exert selection pressure.</v>

1218
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know we evolved and lived in trees,</v>

1219
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:32.120
<v Speaker 4>something on the order of 60 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1220
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:36.410
<v Speaker 4>We're talking 10 times as far back as </v>
<v Speaker 4>that for the hierarchy.</v>

1221
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:41.710
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea that human beings that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchy is something that has </v>

1222
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:45.461
<v Speaker 4>exerted selection pressure on human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings is I don't think that's a </v>

1223
00:59:45.461 --> 00:59:47.300
<v Speaker 4>disputable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a disputable issue.</v>

1224
00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:50.720
<v Speaker 4>How it's done at an exactly what that </v>
<v Speaker 4>means we can argue about,</v>

1225
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:55.721
<v Speaker 4>but like that sort of biological </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuity is just absolutely </v>

1226
00:59:55.721 --> 00:59:55.721
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1227
00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:58.940
<v Speaker 4>it was funny because I revealed this </v>
<v Speaker 4>finding,</v>

1228
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't discover this,</v>

1229
01:00:00.651 --> 01:00:05.651
<v Speaker 4>I read about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I talked to my graduate students </v>

1230
01:00:05.651 --> 01:00:05.651
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to take them out for breakfast,</v>

1231
01:00:05.651 --> 01:00:06.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were very contentious,</v>

1232
01:00:06.531 --> 01:00:10.100
<v Speaker 4>snappy bunch and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're always trying to one up each</v>

1233
01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:15.101
<v Speaker 4>other and they were quite witty and for </v>
<v Speaker 4>like six months until it got very </v>

1234
01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:15.101
<v Speaker 4>annoying.</v>

1235
01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:15.560
<v Speaker 4>Every time one of them went up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>

1236
01:00:15.561 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 4>they'd stretch themselves out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like snap their hands.</v>

1237
01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:20.690
<v Speaker 4>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was,</v>

1238
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.940
<v Speaker 4>that was very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1239
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:24.800
<v Speaker 4>it was really very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you'll see this in lobsters.</v>

1240
01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:26.930
<v Speaker 4>And so that's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1241
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the other thing that's really</v>

1242
01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:31.440
<v Speaker 4>cool about lobsters is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1243
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.070
<v Speaker 4>let's say you've been like top lobster </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a long time,</v>

1244
01:00:34.071 --> 01:00:37.430
<v Speaker 4>but you're getting kind of old and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>young lobster just,</v>

1245
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whales the hell out of you.</v>

1246
01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.890
<v Speaker 4>And so you're all depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but thing is your brain is dominant,</v>

1247
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.650
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have much of a brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're a lobster.</v>

1248
01:00:45.651 --> 01:00:48.080
<v Speaker 4>And so now what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you just lost.</v>

1249
01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:53.260
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is while your brain will </v>
<v Speaker 4>dissolve and then you'll grow a </v>

1250
01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.140
<v Speaker 4>subordinate brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1251
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:57.170
<v Speaker 4>And so that's where thinking about too </v>
<v Speaker 4>right here for a couple of reasons.</v>

1252
01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:00.020
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if any of you who've ever been seriously</v>

1253
01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:03.380
<v Speaker 4>defeated in life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what that's like.</v>

1254
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:05.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's a death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a descent,</v>

1255
01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.150
<v Speaker 4>a dissolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you're lucky,</v>

1256
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.120
<v Speaker 4>a regrowth and and maybe not as the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

1257
01:01:11.121 --> 01:01:13.550
<v Speaker 4>that's what happens to people with </v>
<v Speaker 4>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

1258
01:01:13.551 --> 01:01:18.551
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their brains undergo permanent </v>

1259
01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:20.351
<v Speaker 4>neurological transformation and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they then inhabit a world that's </v>

1260
01:01:20.351 --> 01:01:21.830
<v Speaker 4>much more dangerous than the world that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they inhabited to begin with.</v>

1261
01:01:21.831 --> 01:01:26.831
<v Speaker 4>But we also know too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have posttraumatic stress </v>

1262
01:01:26.831 --> 01:01:28.550
<v Speaker 4>disorder or depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that your hippocampus shrinks or he dies</v>

1263
01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:31.340
<v Speaker 4>and shrinks and you can sometimes get it</v>
<v Speaker 4>to grow back.</v>

1264
01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:36.341
<v Speaker 4>Your hippocampus shrinks and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>amygdala grows and the Amygdala </v>

1265
01:01:36.341 --> 01:01:39.970
<v Speaker 4>increases emotional sensitivity and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hippocampus inhibits emotional </v>

1266
01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:40.760
<v Speaker 4>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you've been badly defeated,</v>

1267
01:01:40.761 --> 01:01:42.830
<v Speaker 4>the hippocampus shrinks and the amygdala</v>
<v Speaker 4>grows.</v>

1268
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.880
<v Speaker 4>Now if you recover,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hippocampus will regrow.</v>

1269
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.130
<v Speaker 4>And antidepressants actually seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>help that.</v>

1270
01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:50.990
<v Speaker 4>But the damn Amygdala never shrinks </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1271
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.800
<v Speaker 4>And so well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's another lesson from the </v>

1272
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:56.800
<v Speaker 4>lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's quite a terrifying one,</v>

1273
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.890
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's one like,</v>

1274
01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:00.260
<v Speaker 4>it's so interesting that you can relate </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that.</v>

1275
01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:05.261
<v Speaker 4>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I get what that poor </v>

1276
01:02:05.261 --> 01:02:05.261
<v Speaker 4>crustaceans going through.</v>

1277
01:02:05.261 --> 01:02:06.000
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1278
01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.720
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the rats and this is from Yak </v>

1279
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:12.720
<v Speaker 4>Panksepp's work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1280
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:12.820
<v Speaker 4>He was the first guy who figured out </v>
<v Speaker 4>that rats giggle</v>

1281
01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:15.580
<v Speaker 4>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1282
01:02:15.581 --> 01:02:17.110
<v Speaker 4>what kind of stupid thing is that to </v>
<v Speaker 4>study?</v>

1283
01:02:17.111 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>research grant giggling rats,</v>

1284
01:02:19.981 --> 01:02:20.690
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so.</v>

1285
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:25.170
<v Speaker 4>But he discovered the place circuitry </v>
<v Speaker 4>and mammals.</v>

1286
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:26.970
<v Speaker 4>That's a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1287
01:02:26.971 --> 01:02:28.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like discovering a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 4>continent.</v>

1288
01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:31.710
<v Speaker 4>There's a place circuit in mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's built right in.</v>

1289
01:02:31.711 --> 01:02:34.110
<v Speaker 4>So it's not socially constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

1290
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.000
<v Speaker 4>there's a biological platform for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what?</v>

1291
01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:39.180
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what panksepp would do with rats,</v>

1292
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:44.420
<v Speaker 4>he found out if rats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you take a rat pup away from its </v>

1293
01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:44.420
<v Speaker 4>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it dies.</v>

1294
01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.810
<v Speaker 4>Even if you feed it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it keep it warm,</v>

1295
01:02:45.811 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 4>it dies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you can stop it from dying by taking</v>

1296
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:52.560
<v Speaker 4>a pencil with an eraser on the end and </v>
<v Speaker 4>massaging it right?</v>

1297
01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:57.000
<v Speaker 4>Because rats won't live without love and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing happens to human babies,</v>

1298
01:02:57.001 --> 01:03:00.930
<v Speaker 4>and we saw that in Romania when there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was that catastrophe after Cho Chesko in</v>

1299
01:03:00.931 --> 01:03:05.931
<v Speaker 4>the orphanages were the orphanages were </v>
<v Speaker 4>full of unwanted babies because </v>

1300
01:03:05.931 --> 01:03:07.320
<v Speaker 4>Ceausescu insisted that every Romanian </v>
<v Speaker 4>women was constantly pregnant,</v>

1301
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:12.620
<v Speaker 4>so the orphanage just stacked up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>unwanted babies and lots of them didn't </v>

1302
01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:12.840
<v Speaker 4>even have names and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>warehoused.</v>

1303
01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 4>Warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shelter,</v>

1304
01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.190
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>devastating.</v>

1305
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.280
<v Speaker 4>Lots of them died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of them died before the first year </v>

1306
01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.280
<v Speaker 4>and the ones that didn't die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're permanently dysfunctional because </v>

1307
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.090
<v Speaker 4>you have to be touched.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a human being,</v>

1308
01:03:27.091 --> 01:03:29.400
<v Speaker 4>it's not an option you have to be played</v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

1309
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.460
<v Speaker 4>It's not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of neurodevelopmental </v>

1310
01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:34.460
<v Speaker 4>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1311
01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:39.170
<v Speaker 4>and you have to also play fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so because otherwise you produce a very </v>

1312
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:43.730
<v Speaker 4>disjointed child who isn't able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>engage in the niceties of social </v>

1313
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:45.090
<v Speaker 4>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is continual play in some sense in</v>

1314
01:03:45.091 --> 01:03:48.150
<v Speaker 4>reciprocity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what Panksepp did with his wrath,</v>

1315
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:53.570
<v Speaker 4>he noticed the male rats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>juveniles really liked to wrestle and </v>

1316
01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:55.220
<v Speaker 4>they wrestle just like humans beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestle.</v>

1317
01:03:55.221 --> 01:03:57.360
<v Speaker 4>They pin each other for crying out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that,</v>

1318
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:59.850
<v Speaker 4>that have just lost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's down for a 10 count,</v>

1319
01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1320
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.440
<v Speaker 4>so what you do is you take juvenile </v>
<v Speaker 4>routes and you can find out that they </v>

1321
01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.411
<v Speaker 4>want to play because you can attach a </v>
<v Speaker 4>spring to them and then they'll try to </v>

1322
01:04:10.531 --> 01:04:12.930
<v Speaker 4>run and you can measure how hard they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>running by,</v>

1323
01:04:12.931 --> 01:04:17.931
<v Speaker 4>how hard they're pulling on the spring </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you can estimate how motivated </v>

1324
01:04:17.931 --> 01:04:17.931
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>

1325
01:04:17.931 --> 01:04:21.470
<v Speaker 4>And so you can find out that a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well fed rat who doesn't have anything </v>

1326
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:24.450
<v Speaker 4>on his mind was still work hard to play </v>
<v Speaker 4>if it,</v>

1327
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:27.690
<v Speaker 4>to enter an arena where he's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to play before,</v>

1328
01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.720
<v Speaker 4>he'll work for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that you think while the rats </v>

1329
01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.641
<v Speaker 4>motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the two rats go out there and they </v>

1330
01:04:34.641 --> 01:04:34.641
<v Speaker 4>play and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so they're,</v>

1331
01:04:34.641 --> 01:04:37.320
<v Speaker 4>they're playing like dogs play and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone knows what that looks like.</v>

1332
01:04:37.321 --> 01:04:38.360
<v Speaker 4>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1333
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:43.370
<v Speaker 4>if you have any sense about dogs that </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of go like this and kids do that </v>

1334
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:47.451
<v Speaker 4>and maybe you do that with your wife if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to play with her a little </v>

1335
01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:48.390
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My poor wife man,</v>

1336
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.080
<v Speaker 4>when she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was,</v>

1337
01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:52.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was uh,</v>

1338
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:54.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a young,</v>

1339
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.840
<v Speaker 4>she had older siblings and so she wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>played with as much when she was little,</v>

1340
01:04:57.841 --> 01:04:59.280
<v Speaker 4>as she might've been in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1341
01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:01.400
<v Speaker 4>I used to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1342
01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:03.960
<v Speaker 4>if you take a pillow and he'd go like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this three times,</v>

1343
01:05:03.961 --> 01:05:04.970
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means lookout,</v>

1344
01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 4>a pillow is coming your way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I go one,</v>

1345
01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:08.550
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three.</v>

1346
01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:10.070
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

1347
01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:15.130
<v Speaker 4>she looked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was completely dismayed at and he's </v>

1348
01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:15.130
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you do that for?</v>

1349
01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:15.130
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1350
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.540
<v Speaker 4>I eventually tartar that rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing I used to,</v>

1351
01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1352
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:25.650
<v Speaker 4>the other thing I used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1353
01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:30.770
<v Speaker 4>is sometimes she'd come out and be like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this when we were playing around and I </v>

1354
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:34.681
<v Speaker 4>grabbed her wrist and I know Parker her </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands through her knuckles together and </v>

1355
01:05:34.961 --> 01:05:39.961
<v Speaker 4>she used to just get completely annoyed </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that and I thought that's what you</v>

1356
01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just open your hands.</v>

1357
01:05:42.791 --> 01:05:47.791
<v Speaker 4>While she didn't know that either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she hadn't been played with enough </v>

1358
01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:47.791
<v Speaker 4>when she was a little rat.</v>

1359
01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:47.850
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1360
01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 4>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

1361
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.870
<v Speaker 4>so you let the wrap the little rats go </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>

1362
01:05:54.871 --> 01:05:59.871
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so let's imagine one of them is 10 </v>

1363
01:05:59.871 --> 01:06:01.701
<v Speaker 4>percent bigger than the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that the 10 percent bigger wins </v>

1364
01:06:01.701 --> 01:06:06.350
<v Speaker 4>because 10 percent is enough in route </v>
<v Speaker 4>wait to ensure that you're going to be </v>

1365
01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:07.290
<v Speaker 4>the pinner rather than the pity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1366
01:06:07.291 --> 01:06:08.730
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's fine.</v>

1367
01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:11.670
<v Speaker 4>So when the rat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rat pins the pins,</v>

1368
01:06:11.671 --> 01:06:15.420
<v Speaker 4>the little route and now the big rat is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the is the authority rat.</v>

1369
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:18.900
<v Speaker 4>And so then the next time that the rats </v>
<v Speaker 4>play,</v>

1370
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:21.390
<v Speaker 4>the little rat has to invite the big rat</v>
<v Speaker 4>to play.</v>

1371
01:06:21.391 --> 01:06:24.650
<v Speaker 4>So the big rats out there being cool and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the little rat pops up and you know,</v>

1372
01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.460
<v Speaker 4>does the whole will you play with me </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing?</v>

1373
01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.590
<v Speaker 4>And the big rat will deign to play with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1374
01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:33.920
<v Speaker 4>But if you pair them repeatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless the big rat lets the little rat </v>

1375
01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.461
<v Speaker 4>win,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 percent of the time the little rack </v>

1376
01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:37.461
<v Speaker 4>will not invite him to play.</v>

1377
01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:38.370
<v Speaker 4>And panksepp discovered that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1378
01:06:38.371 --> 01:06:40.170
<v Speaker 4>I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That just blew me away.</v>

1379
01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.690
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is so amazing because you see walls</v>

1380
01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:48.700
<v Speaker 4>first of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an analogy to Piaget's ideas </v>

1381
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.470
<v Speaker 4>about the emergence of morality out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>play in human beings,</v>

1382
01:06:49.471 --> 01:06:54.471
<v Speaker 4>so that was very cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the notion that that was built into </v>

1383
01:06:54.471 --> 01:06:55.730
<v Speaker 4>rats at the level of wrestling was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're social,</v>

1384
01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.210
<v Speaker 4>they're deeply social animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1385
01:06:57.211 --> 01:07:02.211
<v Speaker 4>They have to know how to get along with </v>
<v Speaker 4>one another and most of their authority </v>

1386
01:07:02.211 --> 01:07:02.850
<v Speaker 4>disputes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dominance disputes.</v>

1387
01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:06.540
<v Speaker 4>You don't want them to end in bloodshed </v>
<v Speaker 4>and combat because you know,</v>

1388
01:07:06.541 --> 01:07:11.541
<v Speaker 4>if you're a rat one and I'm rat to and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we tear each other just threat shreds </v>

1389
01:07:11.541 --> 01:07:13.410
<v Speaker 4>and the dominance dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rats three is just going to move in.</v>

1390
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:18.470
<v Speaker 4>It's really not a great strategy and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be better if we could settle our </v>

1391
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.690
<v Speaker 4>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1392
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:20.760
<v Speaker 4>somewhat peacefully and so.</v>

1393
01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:21.660
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So rats.</v>

1394
01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:25.590
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>panksepp figured out that rats plan,</v>

1395
01:07:25.591 --> 01:07:30.591
<v Speaker 4>not only do they play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they play fair and they seem to enjoy </v>

1396
01:07:30.591 --> 01:07:30.591
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He also figured out,</v>

1397
01:07:30.591 --> 01:07:32.400
<v Speaker 4>this was really cool too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if you give juvenile rats,</v>

1398
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:37.860
<v Speaker 4>attention deficit disorder drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ritalin suppresses,</v>

1399
01:07:37.861 --> 01:07:38.880
<v Speaker 4>pray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>play.</v>

1400
01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:41.640
<v Speaker 4>So that's worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1401
01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:46.641
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you have to give juvenile human </v>

1402
01:07:46.641 --> 01:07:49.200
<v Speaker 4>beings amphetamines in school?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1403
01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.110
<v Speaker 4>because they need to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you don't,</v>

1404
01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.730
<v Speaker 4>you don't get to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't get to wrestle around.</v>

1405
01:07:53.731 --> 01:07:55.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's oppression as far as I can tell.</v>

1406
01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.990
<v Speaker 4>They don't get to wrestle around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>

1407
01:07:58.290 --> 01:07:59.790
<v Speaker 4>Feed him some amphetamines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1408
01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.680
<v Speaker 4>That'll shut down the old place </v>
<v Speaker 4>circuits.</v>

1409
01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:06.800
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the other problem is Panksepp </v>

1410
01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.421
<v Speaker 4>found out that if you don't let juvenile</v>
<v Speaker 4>male rats play their prefrontal cortexes</v>

1411
01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.280
<v Speaker 4>don't develop properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Surprise,</v>

1412
01:08:11.281 --> 01:08:12.840
<v Speaker 4>surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not letting them mature.</v>

1413
01:08:12.841 --> 01:08:14.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what else would you expect?</v>

1414
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:19.310
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something to think about really </v>

1415
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:19.310
<v Speaker 4>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say so.</v>

1416
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:23.450
<v Speaker 4>Well also there's some wolves going at </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and we're not exactly.</v>

1417
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:28.570
<v Speaker 4>There are some wolves having authority </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispute,</v>

1418
01:08:29.871 --> 01:08:34.871
<v Speaker 4>but more technically speaking and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it's posturing.</v>

1419
01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:36.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1420
01:08:36.651 --> 01:08:38.300
<v Speaker 4>they tend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tend not.</v>

1421
01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:42.380
<v Speaker 4>Well socialized wolves tend not to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other during the authority disputes</v>

1422
01:08:42.381 --> 01:08:47.381
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well for obvious reasons it's too </v>

1423
01:08:47.381 --> 01:08:49.721
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they have other ways of </v>

1424
01:08:49.721 --> 01:08:51.360
<v Speaker 4>demonstrating who should be listened to </v>
<v Speaker 4>authorities and there's chimps doing and</v>

1425
01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:55.250
<v Speaker 4>now this particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if I remember correctly,</v>

1426
01:08:55.850 --> 01:09:00.850
<v Speaker 4>I think it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a really cool picture because I </v>

1427
01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:00.850
<v Speaker 4>think this chimp chimps don't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>snakes by the way.</v>

1428
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.040
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you take a chimp that's never seen a </v>

1429
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:06.040
<v Speaker 4>snake and you showed a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is not happy,</v>

1430
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.550
<v Speaker 4>it will get the hell away from that </v>
<v Speaker 4>snake.</v>

1431
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.350
<v Speaker 4>If you bring a chimp anesthetized into a</v>
<v Speaker 4>room full of chimps,</v>

1432
01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.850
<v Speaker 4>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll all get away from that.</v>

1433
01:09:13.851 --> 01:09:15.080
<v Speaker 4>And then look at the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>

1434
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:20.110
<v Speaker 4>they don't like that either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you bring a big snake into a </v>

1435
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.270
<v Speaker 4>chimp cage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if the chimps have never seen it,</v>

1436
01:09:20.271 --> 01:09:22.730
<v Speaker 4>like they'll get away from it and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>stare at it.</v>

1437
01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:26.450
<v Speaker 4>And chimps out in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they see a big snake,</v>

1438
01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:31.650
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll stand there and they have a </v>

1439
01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:31.650
<v Speaker 4>noise that means something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy crap,</v>

1440
01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:32.100
<v Speaker 4>that's a big steak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1441
01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.880
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it actually means that technically,</v>

1442
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:37.860
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you why in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a.</v>

1443
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:40.500
<v Speaker 4>But they get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they stand away from it.</v>

1444
01:09:40.501 --> 01:09:42.170
<v Speaker 4>And then they make this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this noise,</v>

1445
01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:43.130
<v Speaker 4>which means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1446
01:09:43.131 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 4>look at the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they'll stand there for like 24</v>

1447
01:09:45.591 --> 01:09:48.530
<v Speaker 4>hours looking at the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the snakes are really,</v>

1448
01:09:48.531 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're super stimuli for chimpanzees.</v>

1449
01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:56.380
<v Speaker 4>So that's pretty interesting in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>champ theme to learn how to take a dead </v>

1450
01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:56.810
<v Speaker 4>snake and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's scare other chips with it.</v>

1451
01:09:56.811 --> 01:10:01.811
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was partly how he established </v>

1452
01:10:01.811 --> 01:10:03.200
<v Speaker 4>authority and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and while there there's a,</v>

1453
01:10:03.201 --> 01:10:05.030
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a threat to you,</v>

1454
01:10:05.031 --> 01:10:06.980
<v Speaker 4>like if I was you and I was around that </v>
<v Speaker 4>chip,</v>

1455
01:10:06.981 --> 01:10:09.860
<v Speaker 4>I would take that threat seriously </v>
<v Speaker 4>because those things are no joke man.</v>

1456
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:11.520
<v Speaker 4>And you see the same thing here with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1457
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what kind of monkey </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>

1458
01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:15.560
<v Speaker 4>but they're engaged in agonistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>

1459
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:18.120
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

1460
01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.430
<v Speaker 4>And there has been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1461
01:10:19.431 --> 01:10:24.230
<v Speaker 4>there has been recent research showing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in higher order primates that there</v>

1462
01:10:24.231 --> 01:10:26.570
<v Speaker 4>is snake detection circuitry that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>built into them.</v>

1463
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:28.520
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not learned,</v>

1464
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:31.040
<v Speaker 4>not learned steeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1465
01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:32.390
<v Speaker 4>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologists,</v>

1466
01:10:32.391 --> 01:10:37.391
<v Speaker 4>psychologist knew for a long time that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>could make you afraid in a conditioning </v>

1467
01:10:37.391 --> 01:10:41.381
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment much faster using a snake or </v>

1468
01:10:41.381 --> 01:10:43.700
<v Speaker 4>a picture of a snake than a gun or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>picture of a gun.</v>

1469
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.000
<v Speaker 4>So we can learn fear to snakes very </v>
<v Speaker 4>rapidly,</v>

1470
01:10:47.001 --> 01:10:49.340
<v Speaker 4>spiders as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then people thought,</v>

1471
01:10:49.341 --> 01:10:54.341
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we were prepared to develop fear </v>

1472
01:10:54.341 --> 01:10:54.341
<v Speaker 4>of snakes or spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of thing.</v>

1473
01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:59.740
<v Speaker 4>But the more recent research has </v>
<v Speaker 4>indicated that it's more than just </v>

1474
01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:03.310
<v Speaker 4>prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that we have the detection circuitry </v>

1475
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:04.670
<v Speaker 4>built right into us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that well is because,</v>

1476
01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.600
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't we?</v>

1477
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:07.550
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really the issue.</v>

1478
01:11:07.551 --> 01:11:12.551
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not really that much of a surprise </v>

1479
01:11:12.551 --> 01:11:12.551
<v Speaker 4>unless you think of human beings as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>blank slate.</v>

1480
01:11:12.551 --> 01:11:13.100
<v Speaker 4>And if you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

1481
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:14.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1482
01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:17.100
<v Speaker 4>you should crawl out of the 16th </v>
<v Speaker 4>century.</v>

1483
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:19.860
<v Speaker 4>That's how I would look at it because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean,</v>

1484
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:20.330
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1485
01:11:20.331 --> 01:11:21.930
<v Speaker 4>that's just gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that idea.</v>

1486
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:23.640
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1487
01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:25.830
<v Speaker 4>it's so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1488
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:30.300
<v Speaker 4>so maybe you can think about this as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy,</v>

1489
01:11:30.301 --> 01:11:32.730
<v Speaker 4>but wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look for wolves,</v>

1490
01:11:32.731 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 4>look for credibility and competence as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1491
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:41.660
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and chimpanzees don't like brutal </v>

1492
01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:42.210
<v Speaker 4>tyrants and so we'll talk about it as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchy of authority.</v>

1493
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:45.510
<v Speaker 4>And so while this is kind of how it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts to develop,</v>

1494
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who you see.</v>

1495
01:11:46.171 --> 01:11:48.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these girls are negotiating the domestic</v>

1496
01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:53.930
<v Speaker 4>environment here and how to behave </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly and how to share and all that </v>

1497
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:57.410
<v Speaker 4>and and take turns and so they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>negotiating the hierarchy of authority </v>

1498
01:11:57.410 --> 01:12:01.700
<v Speaker 4>and if you're good at reciprocity at </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you're the authority and </v>

1499
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:01.740
<v Speaker 4>sometimes the other person is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>authority.</v>

1500
01:12:01.741 --> 01:12:03.030
<v Speaker 4>That's fair play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1501
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:08.270
<v Speaker 4>And so these boys are doing the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and you see they're all smiling </v>

1502
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:11.391
<v Speaker 4>away and so it looks like aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior and people who are not very </v>

1503
01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:17.090
<v Speaker 4>attentive and who are paranoid and who </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like human beings can confuse this</v>

1504
01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:22.740
<v Speaker 4>with aggression and they forbid it at </v>
<v Speaker 4>schools,</v>

1505
01:12:22.741 --> 01:12:23.400
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1506
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:24.150
<v Speaker 4>I know it wouldn't.</v>

1507
01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:26.160
<v Speaker 4>When my kids were going to school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1508
01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:31.190
<v Speaker 4>this was quite awhile ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were forbidden to pick up snow on </v>

1509
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:36.261
<v Speaker 4>the off chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might throw a snowball and we know </v>

1510
01:12:36.261 --> 01:12:36.990
<v Speaker 4>how terrible that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what I told my son was is that he was</v>

1511
01:12:36.991 --> 01:12:41.080
<v Speaker 4>perfectly welcome to pelt any teacher he</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to in the back of the head with a</v>

1512
01:12:41.081 --> 01:12:46.081
<v Speaker 4>snowball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as he was willing to suffer the </v>

1513
01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:47.760
<v Speaker 4>consequences of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know if he ever did,</v>

1514
01:12:47.761 --> 01:12:52.761
<v Speaker 4>but he was happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was certainly happy with the idea </v>

1515
01:12:52.761 --> 01:12:55.020
<v Speaker 4>which may be very happy about him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1516
01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:56.370
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

1517
01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 4>kids need to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they really,</v>

1518
01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:03.410
<v Speaker 4>really seriously need to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what civilizes them and they know </v>

1519
01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:08.460
<v Speaker 4>that needs to happen between the ages of</v>
<v Speaker 4>two and four because if they're not </v>

1520
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:11.331
<v Speaker 4>civilized by the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>therefore then you might as well just </v>

1521
01:13:11.331 --> 01:13:11.331
<v Speaker 4>forget it.</v>

1522
01:13:11.331 --> 01:13:11.520
<v Speaker 4>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a horrible statistic.</v>

1523
01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:14.970
<v Speaker 4>But it's unbelievably well born out in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the relevant developmental literature.</v>

1524
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Like there's lots of aggressive two year</v>
<v Speaker 4>olds,</v>

1525
01:13:16.921 --> 01:13:20.550
<v Speaker 4>most of them are male and if they stay </v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive past the age of four,</v>

1526
01:13:20.551 --> 01:13:23.490
<v Speaker 4>they tend to be lifetime aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make no friends,</v>

1527
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:28.580
<v Speaker 4>they're outcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're much more likely to end up anti </v>

1528
01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:28.580
<v Speaker 4>social,</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminal delinquent and in jail.</v>

1529
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:32.700
<v Speaker 4>And so your kids need to be socialized </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the ages of two and four.</v>

1530
01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:35.640
<v Speaker 4>And that's particularly true for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>more aggressive males.</v>

1531
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.760
<v Speaker 4>And most of them are aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two year olds are male and that isn't </v>

1532
01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.000
<v Speaker 4>socialization by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's more,</v>

1533
01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:44.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more abstract representation of the same</v>

1534
01:13:44.131 --> 01:13:46.530
<v Speaker 4>sort of thing and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to make the case that this,</v>

1535
01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:51.680
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the hierarchy of authority emerges </v>

1536
01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.950
<v Speaker 4>out of a game like Matrix and underlying</v>
<v Speaker 4>game like Matrix.</v>

1537
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:57.950
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the things that is one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the things that's so brilliant about </v>

1538
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.950
<v Speaker 4>John Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he figured that out,</v>

1539
01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:02.781
<v Speaker 4>it's so smart and he was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the biological origin of morality and he</v>

1540
01:14:02.851 --> 01:14:04.290
<v Speaker 4>identified he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1541
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.430
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1542
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:10.550
<v Speaker 4>he traced the origin to play and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>emergence of morality out of play and </v>

1543
01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 4>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

1544
01:14:12.101 --> 01:14:17.101
<v Speaker 4>I just can't believe how smart an idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was because it's the bottom up </v>

1545
01:14:17.101 --> 01:14:18.160
<v Speaker 4>construction of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1546
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:21.700
<v Speaker 4>of morality don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Piaget was a constructionist and to some</v>

1547
01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:25.810
<v Speaker 4>degree of social constructionist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he underestimated the role of biology,</v>

1548
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:31.110
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't invalidate his theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really easy to put a biological </v>

1549
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 4>underpinning underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath Piaget's theory.</v>

1550
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 4>We know the biology well enough to do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>quite quite nicely now.</v>

1551
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:40.090
<v Speaker 4>So I mean we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the fact that Panksepp for example,</v>

1552
01:14:40.091 --> 01:14:42.880
<v Speaker 4>could identify the play circuit is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good start with that,</v>

1553
01:14:42.881 --> 01:14:47.881
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because play has been around so long </v>

1554
01:14:47.881 --> 01:14:49.360
<v Speaker 4>that we have a circuit that's dedicated </v>
<v Speaker 4>to it and so that's,</v>

1555
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:50.770
<v Speaker 4>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very ancient.</v>

1556
01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:52.930
<v Speaker 4>That's a very ancient issue and so you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1557
01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:55.480
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is very much of an abstraction of a</v>

1558
01:14:55.481 --> 01:15:00.481
<v Speaker 4>game here and then of course you get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate abstraction and representation </v>

1559
01:15:00.481 --> 01:15:01.630
<v Speaker 4>in a representation like</v>

1560
01:15:03.210 --> 01:15:05.070
<v Speaker 3>like that where</v>

1561
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:10.200
<v Speaker 4>even the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the landscape of the game is </v>

1562
01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.601
<v Speaker 4>fictional and of course we've migrated </v>
<v Speaker 4>to a large degree into those sorts of </v>

1563
01:15:12.601 --> 01:15:14.080
<v Speaker 4>fiction landscapes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fictional books,</v>

1564
01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.810
<v Speaker 4>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>video games.</v>

1565
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.990
<v Speaker 4>So it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an extension of the same thing.</v>

1566
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:23.500
<v Speaker 4>So practice for practice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for real life.</v>

1567
01:15:23.501 --> 01:15:25.840
<v Speaker 4>The shades in some cases into real life </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

1568
01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:27.070
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1569
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.000
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more representations of God the father.</v>

1570
01:15:34.001 --> 01:15:37.870
<v Speaker 4>I liked these representations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the triangle idea.</v>

1571
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:40.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't know why God is wearing a</v>
<v Speaker 4>triangular hat.</v>

1572
01:15:40.810 --> 01:15:45.810
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a strange fashion choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's associated with the </v>

1573
01:15:45.810 --> 01:15:49.021
<v Speaker 4>idea of the pyramid and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with the idea of the </v>

1574
01:15:49.021 --> 01:15:50.110
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy of authority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's why the Egyptians put</v>

1575
01:15:50.111 --> 01:15:53.200
<v Speaker 4>their pharaohs inside pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's more to it than that,</v>

1576
01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:58.380
<v Speaker 4>but I think some of that has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the notion of this hierarchical </v>

1577
01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:00.670
<v Speaker 4>structure and you see this on the now </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's speculative obviously,</v>

1578
01:16:00.671 --> 01:16:02.230
<v Speaker 4>and I don't want to make too much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

1579
01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:05.650
<v Speaker 4>But I can't help but think that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>something to that through that.</v>

1580
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.560
<v Speaker 4>On the back of the American dollar bill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked that a lot.</v>

1581
01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:13.620
<v Speaker 4>That's like the eye of horus from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Egyptians and so the idea here is </v>

1582
01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:15.790
<v Speaker 4>something like at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy is something that is no longer</v>

1583
01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:16.780
<v Speaker 4>part of the hierarchy.</v>

1584
01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:19.810
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you move up the hierarchy enough,</v>

1585
01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.960
<v Speaker 4>what happens is that you develop the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability as a consequence of moving up </v>

1586
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.531
<v Speaker 4>that hierarchy to be detached enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the hierarchy so you're no longer </v>

1587
01:16:28.531 --> 01:16:31.981
<v Speaker 4>really part of it and so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>move in all sorts of different </v>

1588
01:16:31.981 --> 01:16:31.981
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing,</v>

1589
01:16:31.981 --> 01:16:34.720
<v Speaker 4>the idea here is that the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're really developing is the capacity</v>

1590
01:16:34.721 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 4>to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say from a,</v>

1591
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:43.240
<v Speaker 4>from a mythological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one thing that seems to compete with</v>

1592
01:16:43.241 --> 01:16:48.241
<v Speaker 4>the idea of the spoken word as the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the source of the extraction of </v>

1593
01:16:48.881 --> 01:16:52.570
<v Speaker 4>habitable order from chaos is the eye is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the capacity to pay attention.</v>

1594
01:16:52.571 --> 01:16:53.950
<v Speaker 4>So Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1595
01:16:53.951 --> 01:16:56.520
<v Speaker 4>the Mesopotamian Creator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God who,</v>

1596
01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:01.540
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who emerged in the hierarchy of </v>

1597
01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Mesopotamian gods and came out at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>top right,</v>

1598
01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:02.650
<v Speaker 4>he was the victor of the gods.</v>

1599
01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:05.950
<v Speaker 4>He had eyes all the way around his head </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he could speak magic words.</v>

1600
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.830
<v Speaker 4>And I really liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really liked that idea.</v>

1601
01:17:08.831 --> 01:17:11.270
<v Speaker 4>And Egyptians developed that idea too </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're god.</v>

1602
01:17:11.271 --> 01:17:14.130
<v Speaker 4>Horus was the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knows the eye of horus that,</v>

1603
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:18.050
<v Speaker 4>that that image is so compelling that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>still know about.</v>

1604
01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:21.650
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has seen the eye of horus with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a really open pupil.</v>

1605
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:25.580
<v Speaker 4>And what the Egyptians learned was that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the open I was,</v>

1606
01:17:25.581 --> 01:17:29.390
<v Speaker 4>what revivified the dead society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so smart.</v>

1607
01:17:29.391 --> 01:17:31.220
<v Speaker 4>So what do you do if your life isn't in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order?</v>

1608
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:34.490
<v Speaker 4>Bloody well pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that isn't the same as thinking.</v>

1609
01:17:34.491 --> 01:17:36.740
<v Speaker 4>It's a different process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paying attention,</v>

1610
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:40.070
<v Speaker 4>thinking is like the imposition of </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure in some sense.</v>

1611
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:45.580
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm over simplifying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but paying attention to something like </v>

1612
01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:48.611
<v Speaker 4>watching for what you don't know and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>like one of the things that I often </v>

1613
01:17:48.611 --> 01:17:52.391
<v Speaker 4>recommend to my clinical clients if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're having trouble with a family </v>

1614
01:17:52.391 --> 01:17:52.640
<v Speaker 4>member is number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut up.</v>

1615
01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:56.810
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell them anything about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just and I don't mean in a rude way.</v>

1616
01:17:56.811 --> 01:17:59.210
<v Speaker 4>It's just like no more personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

1617
01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.020
<v Speaker 4>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch them like a hawk and listen,</v>

1618
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:08.200
<v Speaker 4>and if you do that long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will tell you exactly what they're </v>

1619
01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.201
<v Speaker 4>up to and they will also tell you who </v>
<v Speaker 4>they think you are and then you'll be </v>

1620
01:18:11.201 --> 01:18:12.290
<v Speaker 4>shocked because they think you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1621
01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:17.320
<v Speaker 4>Generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not like what you are at all and </v>

1622
01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:17.900
<v Speaker 4>when they tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a revelation to both of you,</v>

1623
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:23.170
<v Speaker 4>but attention is an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful for us and you see this in </v>

1624
01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:26.981
<v Speaker 4>psychotherapy to because a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you do and in any repairative </v>

1625
01:18:26.981 --> 01:18:28.460
<v Speaker 4>relationship is really pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other person.</v>

1626
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:34.030
<v Speaker 4>Pay attention and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you would not believe what people </v>

1627
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:37.631
<v Speaker 4>will tell you or revealed to you if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch them as if you want to know </v>

1628
01:18:37.631 --> 01:18:41.510
<v Speaker 4>instead of watching them so that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>have your prejudices reinforced.</v>

1629
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:44.000
<v Speaker 4>That's usually how people interact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1630
01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:49.060
<v Speaker 4>I want to keep thinking about you the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way I'm thinking about you and so I'm </v>

1631
01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.840
<v Speaker 4>going to filter out anything that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>proves my theory now.</v>

1632
01:18:50.841 --> 01:18:54.290
<v Speaker 4>It's not what I'm talking about at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm gonna Watch you and figure</v>

1633
01:18:54.291 --> 01:18:56.240
<v Speaker 4>out what you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not in a rude way.</v>

1634
01:18:56.241 --> 01:19:01.241
<v Speaker 4>None of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to see what's there and </v>

1635
01:19:01.241 --> 01:19:03.110
<v Speaker 4>that'll be good for you probably and </v>
<v Speaker 4>also be good for me.</v>

1636
01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.230
<v Speaker 4>And so well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the idea that,</v>

1637
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:08.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>climbing up a hierarchy of authority can</v>

1638
01:19:08.601 --> 01:19:12.770
<v Speaker 4>give you vision and that vision can </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcend the actual hierarchy.</v>

1639
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.770
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's also the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's also the,</v>

1640
01:19:15.771 --> 01:19:20.771
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the metaphysical space that an </v>

1641
01:19:20.771 --> 01:19:23.891
<v Speaker 4>artist occupies because artists really </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't in a hierarchy there outside of </v>

1642
01:19:23.891 --> 01:19:24.890
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've watched the lion king,</v>

1643
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:26.470
<v Speaker 4>most of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1644
01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:29.300
<v Speaker 4>That's a zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the little bird.</v>

1645
01:19:29.301 --> 01:19:31.790
<v Speaker 4>That's the eye of the king and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing there.</v>

1646
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:34.760
<v Speaker 4>So and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's echoed in this idea as well,</v>

1647
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:37.550
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so well that some more,</v>

1648
01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.330
<v Speaker 4>more ideas of hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same idea.</v>

1649
01:19:41.331 --> 01:19:43.550
<v Speaker 4>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gold,</v>

1650
01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:45.350
<v Speaker 4>silver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bronze.</v>

1651
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:48.470
<v Speaker 4>Why gold gold is the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gold is pure,</v>

1652
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:52.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea is that the thing that's</v>

1653
01:19:52.041 --> 01:19:57.041
<v Speaker 4>at the top of the hierarchy is </v>
<v Speaker 4>incorruptible because gold doesn't mix </v>

1654
01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:57.041
<v Speaker 4>with anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1655
01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 4>It's this sort of metal that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever become corrupted.</v>

1656
01:19:58.611 --> 01:20:03.611
<v Speaker 4>It's a noble metal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't become corrupted and so it </v>

1657
01:20:03.611 --> 01:20:06.371
<v Speaker 4>shines like the sun and it's associated </v>
<v Speaker 4>with what's ever at the top of the </v>

1658
01:20:06.371 --> 01:20:09.701
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy and the gold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the medal is a disc like the sun and </v>

1659
01:20:09.701 --> 01:20:13.290
<v Speaker 4>it's awarded to those people who've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who've occupied the top position and who</v>

1660
01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:15.300
<v Speaker 4>are manifestations of the ideal.</v>

1661
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.040
<v Speaker 4>And here here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>

1662
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:19.710
<v Speaker 4>I got to tell you a quick story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So imagine that you're watching.</v>

1663
01:20:19.711 --> 01:20:24.711
<v Speaker 4>And Olympic contest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found this happens to me very often </v>

1664
01:20:24.711 --> 01:20:24.711
<v Speaker 4>with gymnastics because the gymnast or </v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1665
01:20:24.711 --> 01:20:26.060
<v Speaker 4>absolutely unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1666
01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:31.340
<v Speaker 4>so you go watch a gymnastic performance </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the person's out there bouncing </v>

1667
01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:34.190
<v Speaker 4>around like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1668
01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:37.110
<v Speaker 4>you can't even imagine doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are so perfect at it.</v>

1669
01:20:37.111 --> 01:20:39.240
<v Speaker 4>So you see this person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going through this routine.</v>

1670
01:20:39.241 --> 01:20:42.360
<v Speaker 4>They're just absolutely spectacular and </v>
<v Speaker 4>flawless at it.</v>

1671
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:44.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end they stop and everybody claps</v>

1672
01:20:44.791 --> 01:20:49.791
<v Speaker 4>and they were all excited to see what a </v>
<v Speaker 4>human being can do and that's why we're </v>

1673
01:20:49.791 --> 01:20:50.670
<v Speaker 4>in the audience watching because we want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see what a human being can do.</v>

1674
01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:53.370
<v Speaker 4>And the judges go like nine point eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine point eight,</v>

1675
01:20:53.371 --> 01:20:54.840
<v Speaker 4>nine point eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's thrilled.</v>

1676
01:20:54.841 --> 01:20:57.390
<v Speaker 4>And then the next contestant comes out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

1677
01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:59.070
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just basically screwed,</v>

1678
01:20:59.071 --> 01:20:59.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1679
01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:01.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like this person came out there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>was perfect.</v>

1680
01:21:01.321 --> 01:21:06.321
<v Speaker 4>How are you going to top that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting question because </v>

1681
01:21:06.321 --> 01:21:10.280
<v Speaker 4>this is a representation of what you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>to top perfection itself and you can do </v>

1682
01:21:11.941 --> 01:21:15.390
<v Speaker 4>it and here's how you do it and you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>this even though you don't know you know</v>

1683
01:21:15.391 --> 01:21:20.391
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say the next contestant comes </v>

1684
01:21:20.391 --> 01:21:20.391
<v Speaker 4>out and they're kind of shaky because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1685
01:21:20.391 --> 01:21:21.270
<v Speaker 4>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bar has been raised high.</v>

1686
01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:26.570
<v Speaker 4>So what they do is they put themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>right on the edge of chaos and you can </v>

1687
01:21:27.421 --> 01:21:32.421
<v Speaker 4>tell by watching them that they are one </v>
<v Speaker 4>bloody fraction of a second from </v>

1688
01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:37.100
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are pushing themselves farther </v>

1689
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:37.100
<v Speaker 4>than they've ever gone in the direction </v>
<v Speaker 4>of their perfection.</v>

1690
01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:40.020
<v Speaker 4>And everyone in the room is so tense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can hardly stand it,</v>

1691
01:21:40.021 --> 01:21:45.021
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could hear a pin drop and that </v>

1692
01:21:45.021 --> 01:21:45.021
<v Speaker 4>person is flipping around and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

1693
01:21:45.021 --> 01:21:46.380
<v Speaker 4>it's just right on the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe.</v>

1694
01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:48.330
<v Speaker 4>And at the end they go like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1695
01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:53.510
<v Speaker 4>And there's that gesture that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>triumph that goes along with that and </v>

1696
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:55.050
<v Speaker 4>everybody rises in one instant and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>collapsed,</v>

1697
01:21:55.051 --> 01:21:56.100
<v Speaker 4>like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1698
01:21:56.101 --> 01:21:56.850
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

1699
01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.880
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing when you're doing </v>

1700
01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:01.880
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1701
01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:05.121
<v Speaker 4>You can't even help it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It grabs you right in the core of your </v>

1702
01:22:05.121 --> 01:22:06.570
<v Speaker 4>being and you stand up and it's an act </v>
<v Speaker 4>of worship.</v>

1703
01:22:06.571 --> 01:22:11.571
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you saw someone go beyond their </v>

1704
01:22:11.571 --> 01:22:15.081
<v Speaker 4>perfection into the domain of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 4>establish order right in front of your </v>

1705
01:22:15.081 --> 01:22:19.641
<v Speaker 4>eyes and you're so thrilled about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you're happy to be alive and </v>

1706
01:22:19.641 --> 01:22:23.010
<v Speaker 4>everyone's celebrating it all at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same time and it's an absolutely amazing</v>

1707
01:22:23.011 --> 01:22:24.630
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what,</v>

1708
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes that's what this represents.</v>

1709
01:22:26.551 --> 01:22:31.551
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes that's what this </v>
<v Speaker 4>represents and that's what we're trying </v>

1710
01:22:31.551 --> 01:22:32.220
<v Speaker 4>to get at that because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pinnacle of the hierarchy,</v>

1711
01:22:32.221 --> 01:22:37.221
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only are you doing what you should </v>

1712
01:22:37.221 --> 01:22:39.381
<v Speaker 4>be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're doing it in a way that </v>

1713
01:22:39.381 --> 01:22:40.080
<v Speaker 4>increases the probability that you'll do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it better the next time you do it,</v>

1714
01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.560
<v Speaker 4>and then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's another thing to think about </v>

1715
01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.321
<v Speaker 4>along the same lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know we haven't got Adam and eve </v>

1716
01:22:48.321 --> 01:22:48.321
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>

1717
01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:53.400
<v Speaker 4>You tell your kids to play fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1718
01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:55.530
<v Speaker 4>You say it's not him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not whether or not you win.</v>

1719
01:22:55.531 --> 01:23:00.531
<v Speaker 4>It's how you play the game and you say </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you don't really know what you </v>

1720
01:23:00.531 --> 01:23:03.921
<v Speaker 4>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel kind of stupid saying it even </v>

1721
01:23:03.921 --> 01:23:05.751
<v Speaker 4>though you know it's true and your kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks at you like there's something </v>

1722
01:23:05.751 --> 01:23:05.751
<v Speaker 4>wrong with you because he doesn't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're talking about either,</v>

1723
01:23:05.751 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 4>but you know it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so here's why.</v>

1724
01:23:08.501 --> 01:23:12.850
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life isn't a game.</v>

1725
01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:18.540
<v Speaker 4>It's a set of games and the rule is </v>
<v Speaker 4>never sacrificed victory across the set </v>

1726
01:23:19.031 --> 01:23:22.180
<v Speaker 4>of games for victory in one game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1727
01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:24.490
<v Speaker 4>And that's what it means to play </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>

1728
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.880
<v Speaker 4>You want to play so that people keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>inviting you to play because that's how </v>

1729
01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:29.880
<v Speaker 4>you win,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1730
01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:34.770
<v Speaker 4>You win by being invited to play the </v>
<v Speaker 4>largest possible array of games and the </v>

1731
01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:39.421
<v Speaker 4>way you do that is by manifesting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that you can play in a reciprocal </v>

1732
01:23:39.421 --> 01:23:42.841
<v Speaker 4>manner every time you play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if there's victory at stake and </v>

1733
01:23:42.841 --> 01:23:43.570
<v Speaker 4>that's what makes you successful across </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1734
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:46.000
<v Speaker 4>And we all know that and we even tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>our kids that,</v>

1735
01:23:46.001 --> 01:23:51.001
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know that we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we're not adapting ourselves to </v>

1736
01:23:51.001 --> 01:23:54.520
<v Speaker 4>the game and victory in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're adapting ourselves to the metagame</v>

1737
01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:57.100
<v Speaker 4>and victory across the set of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible games.</v>

1738
01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.930
<v Speaker 4>And that's what that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1739
01:23:58.931 --> 01:24:01.060
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as I can tell,</v>

1740
01:24:01.061 --> 01:24:03.100
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what this is aiming at to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1741
01:24:03.101 --> 01:24:06.310
<v Speaker 4>That's the same idea that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a transcendent,</v>

1742
01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:10.360
<v Speaker 4>there's a mode of being that transcends </v>
<v Speaker 4>the particularities of this,</v>

1743
01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:13.450
<v Speaker 4>of the localized contest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the other way to think about it.</v>

1744
01:24:13.451 --> 01:24:18.451
<v Speaker 4>And to act morally is not to win today's</v>
<v Speaker 4>contest at the expense of the rest of </v>

1745
01:24:19.571 --> 01:24:22.270
<v Speaker 4>possible contests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

1746
01:24:22.271 --> 01:24:23.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't see that as something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary.</v>

1747
01:24:23.981 --> 01:24:28.981
<v Speaker 4>It's not relativistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an absolute moral does an </v>

1748
01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:31.000
<v Speaker 4>absolute moral stance there and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 4>recognizes it.</v>

1749
01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:36.160
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I also think it's the key to </v>

1750
01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:36.420
<v Speaker 4>success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would also say it's very much a,</v>

1751
01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.330
<v Speaker 4>in his strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>

1752
01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:38.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1753
01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:43.900
<v Speaker 4>the person who is the master at being </v>
<v Speaker 4>invited to play the largest possible </v>

1754
01:24:43.901 --> 01:24:48.901
<v Speaker 4>games,</v>
<v Speaker 4>number of games is also the same person </v>

1755
01:24:48.901 --> 01:24:52.290
<v Speaker 4>I haven't quite figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The precise relationship between these </v>

1756
01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:55.591
<v Speaker 4>two is also the same person that goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>out forthrightly to conquer the unknown </v>

1757
01:24:56.170 --> 01:24:59.020
<v Speaker 4>before it presents itself as the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the door.</v>

1758
01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.120
<v Speaker 4>They're the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I don't,</v>

1759
01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:02.030
<v Speaker 4>I can't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't figured,</v>

1760
01:25:02.031 --> 01:25:03.820
<v Speaker 4>well why that is exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1761
01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:07.000
<v Speaker 4>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll figure it out eventually when I do.</v>

1762
01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:11.530
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you if you're interested,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so okay,</v>

1763
01:25:11.531 --> 01:25:14.170
<v Speaker 4>so here's some other ideas of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1764
01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.700
<v Speaker 4>of God as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

1765
01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.880
<v Speaker 4>as hierarchical authority figure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So strip the religious preconceptions </v>

1766
01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.780
<v Speaker 4>off what you observe and just look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you see.</v>

1767
01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:27.780
<v Speaker 4>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's primate looking upward at </v>

1768
01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:29.080
<v Speaker 4>dominant figure that that's what you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1769
01:25:29.081 --> 01:25:34.081
<v Speaker 4>Now it's very interestingly symbolically</v>
<v Speaker 4>represented because you have God the </v>

1770
01:25:34.081 --> 01:25:38.161
<v Speaker 4>father there with the cross and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>what that means as far as I can tell is </v>

1771
01:25:38.161 --> 01:25:42.031
<v Speaker 4>that there's a recognition there in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>image that the person who's most </v>

1772
01:25:42.031 --> 01:25:44.050
<v Speaker 4>dominant is the one who's or the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>has the most authority,</v>

1773
01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.650
<v Speaker 4>is the one who's voluntarily accepted </v>
<v Speaker 4>the suffering.</v>

1774
01:25:47.651 --> 01:25:50.620
<v Speaker 4>That's part of being and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>that picture represents.</v>

1775
01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:55.650
<v Speaker 4>It's like the authority holes that says </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what you have to accept and </v>

1776
01:25:55.661 --> 01:25:56.260
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1777
01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:01.340
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that transfixed as the viewer because </v>

1778
01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:04.711
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the fact that it's true and </v>

1779
01:26:04.711 --> 01:26:04.711
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1780
01:26:04.711 --> 01:26:04.711
<v Speaker 4>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1781
01:26:04.711 --> 01:26:07.651
<v Speaker 4>well think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you like brave people or do you like </v>

1782
01:26:07.651 --> 01:26:07.651
<v Speaker 4>cowards?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1783
01:26:07.651 --> 01:26:10.520
<v Speaker 4>that that's pretty straightforward and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the ultimate act of bravery.</v>

1784
01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:15.720
<v Speaker 4>It's to come to terms with the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're mortal and limited and to live </v>

1785
01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.120
<v Speaker 4>forthrightly regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1786
01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:22.121
<v Speaker 4>obviously that's at the core of what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what's admirable and why would we </v>

1787
01:26:22.121 --> 01:26:25.220
<v Speaker 4>presume that that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We act as if that's the case.</v>

1788
01:26:25.221 --> 01:26:27.740
<v Speaker 4>It's what everyone dreams and wishes </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they could.</v>

1789
01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.110
<v Speaker 4>They could do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean assuming that you know,</v>

1790
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:33.500
<v Speaker 4>you've dispensed with the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be a mortal,</v>

1791
01:26:33.501 --> 01:26:38.501
<v Speaker 4>I suppose that might be worth wishing </v>
<v Speaker 4>for it to or or perhaps not immortal is </v>

1792
01:26:38.501 --> 01:26:42.791
<v Speaker 4>a very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you certainly want this and that </v>

1793
01:26:42.791 --> 01:26:42.791
<v Speaker 4>image says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1794
01:26:42.791 --> 01:26:47.090
<v Speaker 4>this is what you should be and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got that same opening into the sky</v>

1795
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.040
<v Speaker 4>going on in that image that I showed you</v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

1796
01:26:49.041 --> 01:26:51.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like this is a transcendent truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It constantly,</v>

1797
01:26:51.291 --> 01:26:56.270
<v Speaker 4>we manifest self across time and space </v>
<v Speaker 4>and young would say it's built into your</v>

1798
01:26:56.271 --> 01:26:58.400
<v Speaker 4>psyche that image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you know,</v>

1799
01:26:58.401 --> 01:27:01.160
<v Speaker 4>there are elements of it that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>culturally constructed.</v>

1800
01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:03.770
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't necessarily have to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cross,</v>

1801
01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.920
<v Speaker 4>although the cross is a very old symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's far older than than its use in </v>

1802
01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.610
<v Speaker 4>Christianity and it's been used in many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many religious representations,</v>

1803
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:15.860
<v Speaker 4>but that echoes the sole echoes with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

1804
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.850
<v Speaker 1>no and</v>

1805
01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:24.300
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's Moses on the mountain </v>

1806
01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:24.500
<v Speaker 4>receiving the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1807
01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:25.870
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the law.</v>

1808
01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:28.420
<v Speaker 4>And so we'll talk a lot more about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we get the exodus.</v>

1809
01:27:30.670 --> 01:27:33.520
<v Speaker 4>But if.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1810
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:34.450
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1811
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.760
<v Speaker 4>If we get to exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

1812
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:39.490
<v Speaker 4>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where does it happen?</v>

1813
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:41.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a mountain.</v>

1814
01:27:41.850 --> 01:27:43.660
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's op,</v>

1815
01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's off the top.</v>

1816
01:27:45.090 --> 01:27:47.290
<v Speaker 4>It's up in the stratosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's up in the sky.</v>

1817
01:27:47.291 --> 01:27:49.710
<v Speaker 4>We're where you'll look upward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1818
01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.000
<v Speaker 4>And then so what's happening to Moses?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1819
01:27:52.001 --> 01:27:57.001
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a bit of a clue as far as I can </v>

1820
01:27:57.001 --> 01:27:59.221
<v Speaker 4>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I figured this out partly again by </v>

1821
01:27:59.221 --> 01:28:01.771
<v Speaker 4>reading jumped piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because one of the things that Piaget </v>

1822
01:28:01.771 --> 01:28:02.350
<v Speaker 4>said about kids was that they first </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned to play a game,</v>

1823
01:28:02.351 --> 01:28:06.070
<v Speaker 4>but they don't know what the rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meaning that if you have a bunch of kids</v>

1824
01:28:06.071 --> 01:28:07.660
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can play a game,</v>

1825
01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:10.120
<v Speaker 4>but if you take one of the kids out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the game when they're young,</v>

1826
01:28:10.121 --> 01:28:13.090
<v Speaker 4>say six and you say what the rules are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the rules,</v>

1827
01:28:13.210 --> 01:28:18.210
<v Speaker 4>they can only sort of give you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>representation so you take 60 year old </v>

1828
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:21.751
<v Speaker 4>one and he'll tell you some of the rules</v>
<v Speaker 4>and six year old to will tell you </v>

1829
01:28:21.751 --> 01:28:24.811
<v Speaker 4>different rules and and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six year old three will tell you </v>

1830
01:28:24.811 --> 01:28:28.231
<v Speaker 4>different rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you put them all together they </v>

1831
01:28:28.231 --> 01:28:28.231
<v Speaker 4>can play.</v>

1832
01:28:28.231 --> 01:28:30.940
<v Speaker 4>So they have the knowledge embodied </v>
<v Speaker 4>either individually or in the group.</v>

1833
01:28:30.941 --> 01:28:34.540
<v Speaker 4>The knowledge is there to be extracted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then they get a little older,</v>

1834
01:28:34.541 --> 01:28:38.650
<v Speaker 4>they can extract the rules and then they</v>
<v Speaker 4>start to play by the rules.</v>

1835
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:43.830
<v Speaker 4>And then the last step was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it isn't just the kids play by the </v>

1836
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:47.341
<v Speaker 4>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that they learned that they can make </v>

1837
01:28:47.341 --> 01:28:47.341
<v Speaker 4>the rules and he thought about that as </v>
<v Speaker 4>moral progression.</v>

1838
01:28:47.341 --> 01:28:49.210
<v Speaker 4>First you can play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can play by the rules.</v>

1839
01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:52.210
<v Speaker 4>Then you learn maybe because he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think everyone learned this,</v>

1840
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:54.310
<v Speaker 4>that you're actually the master of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules.</v>

1841
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:56.200
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean the rules are </v>
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary,</v>

1842
01:28:56.770 --> 01:29:01.380
<v Speaker 4>but it means that you can be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>generator of the rules assuming you knew</v>

1843
01:29:01.381 --> 01:29:06.381
<v Speaker 4>how to play the game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he thought about that as a moral </v>

1844
01:29:06.381 --> 01:29:08.780
<v Speaker 4>moral progression and then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's exactly what happened to </v>

1845
01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:11.631
<v Speaker 4>Moses and in the story of exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Moses is out there leading all </v>

1846
01:29:11.631 --> 01:29:13.530
<v Speaker 4>those Israelites around and like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have a law,</v>

1847
01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:14.670
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a law giver.</v>

1848
01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:19.730
<v Speaker 4>They have a tradition and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 4>like crabby because while they're in a </v>

1849
01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:20.880
<v Speaker 4>desert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they were in a tyranny,</v>

1850
01:29:20.881 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 4>but now they're in a desert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's no improvement.</v>

1851
01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:27.300
<v Speaker 4>So they're really getting pretty bitchy </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it and so they're worshiping false</v>

1852
01:29:27.301 --> 01:29:32.301
<v Speaker 4>idols and having one catastrophe after </v>
<v Speaker 4>another and they get Moses to judge </v>

1853
01:29:32.301 --> 01:29:36.750
<v Speaker 4>their conflicts and so he does that for </v>
<v Speaker 4>God only knows how long forever crabby </v>

1854
01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:40.350
<v Speaker 4>Israelites come to Moses and bitch at </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1855
01:29:40.351 --> 01:29:40.830
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1856
01:29:40.831 --> 01:29:45.831
<v Speaker 4>he did this and she did that and and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>then he has to figure out how to make </v>

1857
01:29:45.831 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 4>peace and he does that so long that one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of his,</v>

1858
01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I think it's his father in law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tells him he has to stop doing it </v>

1859
01:29:53.690 --> 01:29:53.690
<v Speaker 4>because he's gonna exhaust himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then you think,</v>

1860
01:29:53.690 --> 01:29:54.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening?</v>

1861
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not assuming that this is a like</v>

1862
01:29:58.501 --> 01:30:00.570
<v Speaker 4>a literal historical story.</v>

1863
01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:02.970
<v Speaker 4>I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a condensation well,</v>

1864
01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:08.010
<v Speaker 4>any group has a set of customs just like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a wolf pack does,</v>

1865
01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:13.480
<v Speaker 4>and so then the customers are being </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest in someone who's a genius is </v>

1866
01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:13.480
<v Speaker 4>watching and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1867
01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:17.610
<v Speaker 4>well what's the rule in this situation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the rule of this situation?</v>

1868
01:30:17.611 --> 01:30:20.850
<v Speaker 4>What's the rule in this situation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then in his imagination,</v>

1869
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:26.030
<v Speaker 4>the rules turned into a hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then he goes up on the mountain and it </v>

1870
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.030
<v Speaker 4>goes bang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he thinks,</v>

1871
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:31.010
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the rules that we've been living </v>

1872
01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:33.651
<v Speaker 4>by all this time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the revelation of the </v>

1873
01:30:33.651 --> 01:30:33.651
<v Speaker 4>commandments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1874
01:30:33.651 --> 01:30:33.651
<v Speaker 4>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1875
01:30:33.651 --> 01:30:38.151
<v Speaker 4>how else could it be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that rules came first and </v>

1876
01:30:38.151 --> 01:30:39.720
<v Speaker 4>obeying them came second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like know the rules come first,</v>

1877
01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:42.450
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actions come first,</v>

1878
01:30:42.451 --> 01:30:47.451
<v Speaker 4>the the old obeying them comes first and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you figure out what everybody's up </v>

1879
01:30:47.451 --> 01:30:47.451
<v Speaker 4>to and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>

1880
01:30:47.451 --> 01:30:48.520
<v Speaker 4>this is what you've been up to all </v>
<v Speaker 4>along.</v>

1881
01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.010
<v Speaker 4>And everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1882
01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.560
<v Speaker 4>that seems to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if it didn't,</v>

1883
01:30:52.561 --> 01:30:55.560
<v Speaker 4>who would follow them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one was going to follow them.</v>

1884
01:30:55.561 --> 01:30:57.600
<v Speaker 4>If they don't match what's already </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1885
01:30:57.690 --> 01:31:00.600
<v Speaker 4>you just think about that is unjust and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's,</v>

1886
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:04.830
<v Speaker 4>that's portrayed here as a cataclysmic </v>
<v Speaker 4>human event.</v>

1887
01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1888
01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:11.780
<v Speaker 4>we've been chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've been in this hierarchy of </v>

1889
01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:14.121
<v Speaker 4>authority for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have no idea what we were doing and </v>

1890
01:31:14.121 --> 01:31:16.611
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden poof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It burst into revelatory consciousness </v>

1891
01:31:16.611 --> 01:31:18.900
<v Speaker 4>and we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here is the law.</v>

1892
01:31:19.230 --> 01:31:19.830
<v Speaker 4>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1893
01:31:19.831 --> 01:31:21.600
<v Speaker 4>is it given by God?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1894
01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.030
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends on what you mean by God.</v>

1895
01:31:24.090 --> 01:31:29.090
<v Speaker 4>We could start with that presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like it just came out of </v>

1896
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.090
<v Speaker 4>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took.</v>

1897
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:31.080
<v Speaker 4>And this is something else nature </v>
<v Speaker 4>observed.</v>

1898
01:31:31.081 --> 01:31:32.610
<v Speaker 4>So interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>

1899
01:31:32.611 --> 01:31:37.611
<v Speaker 4>you know that a moral revelation was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of a tremendously long </v>

1900
01:31:38.281 --> 01:31:43.281
<v Speaker 4>process of initial construction and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>formulation thousands and thousands and </v>

1901
01:31:44.221 --> 01:31:49.221
<v Speaker 4>thousands and thousands of years of </v>
<v Speaker 4>custom of building custom before you get</v>

1902
01:31:49.411 --> 01:31:54.411
<v Speaker 4>the revelation of the articulated law </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a description of the pattern </v>

1903
01:31:54.511 --> 01:31:55.830
<v Speaker 4>that works and let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1904
01:31:55.831 --> 01:31:57.240
<v Speaker 4>what's the pattern that works?</v>

1905
01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.840
<v Speaker 4>It's the game that you can with </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody else day after day with no </v>

1906
01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 4>degeneration and that's another thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>piaget figured out.</v>

1907
01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:08.600
<v Speaker 4>That's so brilliant and that's his idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the equilibrated state.</v>

1908
01:32:08.601 --> 01:32:13.601
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an extension of a manual counts </v>

1909
01:32:13.601 --> 01:32:16.320
<v Speaker 4>idea about the universal maximum right </v>
<v Speaker 4>act in a way so that each action could </v>

1910
01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.900
<v Speaker 4>become a universal rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was fundamental moral maximum.</v>

1911
01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:21.850
<v Speaker 4>And Piaget put a twist on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1912
01:32:21.851 --> 01:32:22.300
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1913
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:26.620
<v Speaker 4>that's not exactly yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's act in such a way that it works for</v>

1914
01:32:26.621 --> 01:32:31.621
<v Speaker 4>you now and next week and next month and</v>
<v Speaker 4>next year and 10 years from now,</v>

1915
01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:37.080
<v Speaker 4>and so that while it's working for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also working for the people around </v>

1916
01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.370
<v Speaker 4>you and for the broader society and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1917
01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:43.400
<v Speaker 4>and that's the braided state and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could think about that as an intimation </v>

1918
01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.100
<v Speaker 4>of the Kingdom of the city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of God on earth.</v>

1919
01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:50.101
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that and it's based </v>
<v Speaker 4>on this idea that a morality has to be </v>

1920
01:32:50.101 --> 01:32:50.920
<v Speaker 4>interoperable and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of,</v>

1921
01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:53.560
<v Speaker 4>there's been lots of simulations online </v>
<v Speaker 4>already,</v>

1922
01:32:53.561 --> 01:32:56.710
<v Speaker 4>artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>simulations of trading gapes,</v>

1923
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1924
01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:02.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who've been studying the </v>

1925
01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.771
<v Speaker 4>emergence of moral behavior say an </v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial intelligence systems have </v>

1926
01:33:04.771 --> 01:33:07.921
<v Speaker 4>already caught onto the idea that one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the crucial elements to the analysis of </v>

1927
01:33:07.921 --> 01:33:12.361
<v Speaker 4>morality is interability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't play a degenerating game </v>

1928
01:33:12.361 --> 01:33:14.080
<v Speaker 4>because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it degenerates,</v>

1929
01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:19.290
<v Speaker 4>like obviously you want to play a game </v>
<v Speaker 4>that had least remained stable across </v>

1930
01:33:19.290 --> 01:33:23.281
<v Speaker 4>time and God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could really get your act </v>

1931
01:33:23.281 --> 01:33:23.440
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it would slowly get better.</v>

1932
01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:25.540
<v Speaker 4>And of course that's what you'd hope for</v>
<v Speaker 4>your family.</v>

1933
01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:30.541
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're always trying to do </v>

1934
01:33:30.541 --> 01:33:32.490
<v Speaker 4>and let,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you're completely hell bent on </v>

1935
01:33:32.490 --> 01:33:32.490
<v Speaker 4>revenge and destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1936
01:33:32.490 --> 01:33:36.720
<v Speaker 4>is there a way that we can continue to </v>
<v Speaker 4>play together that will make playing </v>

1937
01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.830
<v Speaker 4>together even better the next day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're up to and</v>

1938
01:33:40.690 --> 01:33:42.460
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see anything arbitrary both that</v>

1939
01:33:42.461 --> 01:33:44.710
<v Speaker 4>and part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is also why I think that bloody</v>

1940
01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:47.340
<v Speaker 4>postmodernists are so incorrect because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1941
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:52.350
<v Speaker 4>they say something like there's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>infinite number of interpretations of </v>

1942
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:56.161
<v Speaker 4>the world and that's actually true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they make a mistake and they </v>

1943
01:33:56.161 --> 01:34:00.241
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well no interpretation is to be </v>

1944
01:34:00.241 --> 01:34:00.241
<v Speaker 4>privileged over any other </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation.</v>

1945
01:34:00.241 --> 01:34:02.500
<v Speaker 4>It's like wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

1946
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:05.260
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where things go seriously off the</v>

1947
01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:07.960
<v Speaker 4>rails because the interpretation has to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

1948
01:34:07.961 --> 01:34:12.961
<v Speaker 4>and this is the psg and objection is </v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you and I are going to play a </v>

1949
01:34:12.961 --> 01:34:15.991
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rule one is we both have to want to </v>

1950
01:34:15.991 --> 01:34:18.001
<v Speaker 4>play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rule two is other people are going to </v>

1951
01:34:18.001 --> 01:34:20.551
<v Speaker 4>let us play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rule three is we should be able to play </v>

1952
01:34:20.551 --> 01:34:23.221
<v Speaker 4>it across a pretty long period of time </v>
<v Speaker 4>without it degenerating and maybe rule </v>

1953
01:34:23.221 --> 01:34:23.290
<v Speaker 4>four is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1954
01:34:23.291 --> 01:34:25.630
<v Speaker 4>we're playing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world shouldn't kill us.</v>

1955
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:31.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like there are not very many games </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you don't send your kids out to </v>

1956
01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:31.230
<v Speaker 4>play on the super highway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1957
01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:36.030
<v Speaker 4>So they're not playing hockey on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>superhighway because the world kills </v>

1958
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:38.500
<v Speaker 4>them and so there there's an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of interpretations,</v>

1959
01:34:38.501 --> 01:34:43.501
<v Speaker 4>but there is not an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>solutions and the solutions are </v>

1960
01:34:43.501 --> 01:34:45.820
<v Speaker 4>constrained by the fact of the world and</v>
<v Speaker 4>are suffering in the world and then also</v>

1961
01:34:45.821 --> 01:34:48.310
<v Speaker 4>constrained by the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>constrain each other.</v>

1962
01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:53.640
<v Speaker 4>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where I think that's gone </v>

1963
01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:53.640
<v Speaker 4>dreadfully,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dreadfully wrong.</v>

1964
01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:54.840
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1965
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:07.920
<v Speaker 4>it's really fun to look at these old </v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures once you kind of know what they</v>

1966
01:35:07.921 --> 01:35:09.040
<v Speaker 4>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1967
01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:14.180
<v Speaker 4>the delayed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least that's what I've discovered is </v>

1968
01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.930
<v Speaker 4>that once I kind of understand the </v>
<v Speaker 4>underlying rationale for.</v>

1969
01:35:15.931 --> 01:35:18.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean someone worked hard on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an engraving,</v>

1970
01:35:18.331 --> 01:35:19.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They took a long time.</v>

1971
01:35:19.681 --> 01:35:23.130
<v Speaker 4>Making that picture there are serious </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it and when you understand what it</v>

1972
01:35:23.131 --> 01:35:23.640
<v Speaker 4>means,</v>

1973
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:26.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those people there,</v>

1974
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:29.190
<v Speaker 4>their prostate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prostrate at the,</v>

1975
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:30.990
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the,</v>

1976
01:35:31.050 --> 01:35:33.120
<v Speaker 4>at the revelation of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1977
01:35:33.121 --> 01:35:38.121
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no wonder it's like break the law and </v>

1978
01:35:38.121 --> 01:35:40.071
<v Speaker 4>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Break the universal moral law man and </v>

1979
01:35:40.071 --> 01:35:40.071
<v Speaker 4>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1980
01:35:40.071 --> 01:35:41.460
<v Speaker 4>I see people in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll ask you all,</v>

1981
01:35:41.461 --> 01:35:45.330
<v Speaker 4>do all the time perhaps me more than you</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm a clinical psychologist,</v>

1982
01:35:45.331 --> 01:35:50.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if the people I'm seeing having </v>

1983
01:35:50.331 --> 01:35:52.641
<v Speaker 4>broken the universal law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can bloody well be sure that </v>

1984
01:35:52.641 --> 01:35:53.370
<v Speaker 4>people around them have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's no joke,</v>

1985
01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:57.360
<v Speaker 4>like you make a mistake and things will </v>
<v Speaker 4>go seriously wrong for you.</v>

1986
01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:02.720
<v Speaker 4>And so it's no wonder that you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrified at the revelation of the </v>

1987
01:36:03.421 --> 01:36:08.421
<v Speaker 4>structure that governs our big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that's so remarkable </v>

1988
01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:08.550
<v Speaker 4>about the old testament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is another thing,</v>

1989
01:36:08.551 --> 01:36:11.610
<v Speaker 4>nature commented or he was a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>admirer of the Old Testament,</v>

1990
01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.110
<v Speaker 4>not so much of the New Testament.</v>

1991
01:36:13.110 --> 01:36:18.110
<v Speaker 4>He thought it was a sin for Europe to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have glued the new testament onto the </v>

1992
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:22.491
<v Speaker 4>old testament because he thought the old</v>
<v Speaker 4>testament was a really accurate </v>

1993
01:36:22.491 --> 01:36:24.210
<v Speaker 4>representation of the phenomenology of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ba.</v>

1994
01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:27.780
<v Speaker 4>It's like stay awake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speak property,</v>

1995
01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:32.900
<v Speaker 4>be honest or watch the hell out because </v>
<v Speaker 4>things will come your way that you just </v>

1996
01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.670
<v Speaker 4>do not want to see at all and it might </v>
<v Speaker 4>not just be you.</v>

1997
01:36:35.671 --> 01:36:40.671
<v Speaker 4>It might be everyone you know in </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything about your culture that is </v>

1998
01:36:40.671 --> 01:36:42.300
<v Speaker 4>demolished for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for generation after generation.</v>

1999
01:36:42.301 --> 01:36:46.040
<v Speaker 4>It's like stay awake and be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I like.</v>

2000
01:36:46.170 --> 01:36:50.970
<v Speaker 4>I think that people only don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>that when they're being hubris stick.</v>

2001
01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:53.760
<v Speaker 4>And I think that most people know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>deep in their hearts.</v>

2002
01:36:53.761 --> 01:36:55.710
<v Speaker 4>You know when you get high on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>horse,</v>

2003
01:36:55.770 --> 01:36:57.990
<v Speaker 4>that happens fairly often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have any sense,</v>

2004
01:36:57.991 --> 01:36:58.500
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Geez,</v>

2005
01:36:58.501 --> 01:37:03.501
<v Speaker 4>I better be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tap myself down a fair bit because if I </v>

2006
01:37:03.501 --> 01:37:03.501
<v Speaker 4>get too puffed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2007
01:37:03.501 --> 01:37:08.160
<v Speaker 4>something's going to come along and take</v>
<v Speaker 4>me out at the knees and everyone knows </v>

2008
01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:08.670
<v Speaker 4>that pride comes before a fall.</v>

2009
01:37:08.670 --> 01:37:13.670
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you have any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it says in the Old Testament </v>

2010
01:37:13.670 --> 01:37:13.670
<v Speaker 4>that fear of God is the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wisdom.</v>

2011
01:37:13.670 --> 01:37:17.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like I've never in all my years as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a clinical psychologist,</v>

2012
01:37:17.311 --> 01:37:19.230
<v Speaker 4>and this is something that really does </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrify me.</v>

2013
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:24.430
<v Speaker 4>I as I have never seen anyone ever get </v>
<v Speaker 4>away with anything at all.</v>

2014
01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 4>Even once you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's that old idea that God has a </v>

2015
01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2016
01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:30.510
<v Speaker 4>and it keeps track of everything in </v>
<v Speaker 4>heaven.</v>

2017
01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:31.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2018
01:37:31.411 --> 01:37:32.160
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2019
01:37:32.610 --> 01:37:34.830
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's not a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>

2020
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:40.430
<v Speaker 4>but that is a really useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about because while I'd maybe you </v>

2021
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:44.601
<v Speaker 4>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you think people get away with </v>

2022
01:37:44.601 --> 01:37:44.601
<v Speaker 4>things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell you,</v>

2023
01:37:44.601 --> 01:37:47.751
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I see instead is that thing </v>

2024
01:37:47.751 --> 01:37:47.751
<v Speaker 4>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2025
01:37:47.751 --> 01:37:51.950
<v Speaker 4>Someone twists the fabric of reality and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do it successfully because it </v>

2026
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:53.580
<v Speaker 4>doesn't snap back at them that moment.</v>

2027
01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.750
<v Speaker 4>And then like two years later unraveled </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they get walloped and they think,</v>

2028
01:37:57.751 --> 01:37:59.520
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so unfair.</v>

2029
01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:01.140
<v Speaker 4>And then we track it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2030
01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.880
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened before that?</v>

2031
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:04.330
<v Speaker 4>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then what?</v>

2032
01:38:04.530 --> 01:38:06.560
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then what this,</v>

2033
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:08.610
<v Speaker 4>and then what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2034
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:09.960
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2035
01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where it went wrong.</v>

2036
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.510
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2037
01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:17.490
<v Speaker 4>because you can't twist the fabric of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality without having it snapped back.</v>

2038
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:19.980
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And why would it?</v>

2039
01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:22.710
<v Speaker 4>Because what are you going to do twist </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fabric of reality?</v>

2040
01:38:22.890 --> 01:38:25.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's bigger than you.</v>

2041
01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:30.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think one of the things that </v>

2042
01:38:30.670 --> 01:38:30.670
<v Speaker 4>really temps people is the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I can get away with it.</v>

2043
01:38:30.670 --> 01:38:31.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2044
01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.630
<v Speaker 4>you try,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see how well that works.</v>

2045
01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:38.960
<v Speaker 4>So like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get away with nothing and that is </v>

2046
01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.081
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of wisdom and I had </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that deeply terrifies me and </v>

2047
01:38:42.081 --> 01:38:43.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever since last September when I came to</v>

2048
01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:48.951
<v Speaker 4>more like broader public attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I'd be terrified of </v>

2049
01:38:48.951 --> 01:38:52.431
<v Speaker 4>making a mistake because I certainly </v>
<v Speaker 4>know I'm more than capable of making a </v>

2050
01:38:52.431 --> 01:38:52.470
<v Speaker 4>mistake and thank God so far.</v>

2051
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:55.200
<v Speaker 4>Either I haven't made one or no one's </v>
<v Speaker 4>found out about it.</v>

2052
01:38:55.590 --> 01:38:57.870
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's like,</v>

2053
01:38:57.930 --> 01:39:02.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we walk on a very thin and narrow edge </v>

2054
01:39:02.930 --> 01:39:06.350
<v Speaker 4>and we're very lucky when things aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>degenerating into chaos around us or </v>

2055
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:10.400
<v Speaker 4>rapidly moving too far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too much order and it's not an easy </v>

2056
01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.870
<v Speaker 4>thing to stay on that line and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell when you stay,</v>

2057
01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:16.900
<v Speaker 4>you're on that line because the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>are deeply meaningful and engaging when </v>

2058
01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:20.571
<v Speaker 4>you're on that line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're not existentially </v>

2059
01:39:20.571 --> 01:39:21.720
<v Speaker 4>terrified about the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wavering off that,</v>

2060
01:39:21.721 --> 01:39:24.690
<v Speaker 4>then you are truly not awake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2061
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:26.740
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I see in this picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2062
01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:31.760
<v Speaker 4>it's like look out man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there are rules and if you break</v>

2063
01:39:31.921 --> 01:39:33.750
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God help you.</v>

2064
01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2065
01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:46.250
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the case with regard,</v>

2066
01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.510
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned this in the question period </v>
<v Speaker 4>a bit last time,</v>

2067
01:39:48.511 --> 01:39:53.511
<v Speaker 4>is that one of the things that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be actually one of the advantages to </v>

2068
01:39:53.511 --> 01:39:57.621
<v Speaker 4>gluing the new testament onto the old </v>
<v Speaker 4>testament is the idea of a </v>

2069
01:39:57.621 --> 01:40:01.010
<v Speaker 4>transformation and morality that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>analogous to the Piagetian idea that </v>

2070
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:04.350
<v Speaker 4>after you learn to play by the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can learn to make the rules.</v>

2071
01:40:04.351 --> 01:40:07.590
<v Speaker 4>Because I think that's actually what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens to some degree in the transition</v>

2072
01:40:07.591 --> 01:40:09.960
<v Speaker 4>between the Old Testament and the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>testament,</v>

2073
01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.140
<v Speaker 4>because in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most morality is prohibition.</v>

2074
01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Here are things you shouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2075
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:20.590
<v Speaker 4>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a lot of what you do with your </v>

2076
01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:20.590
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't do this.</v>

2077
01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:20.590
<v Speaker 4>Don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do it.</v>

2078
01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:25.580
<v Speaker 4>Especially when they're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're always going around and telling </v>

2079
01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:25.620
<v Speaker 4>them to stop being so happy because all </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing is causing trouble.</v>

2080
01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:27.840
<v Speaker 4>It's quite painful if you're a parent </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you noticed that,</v>

2081
01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:31.030
<v Speaker 4>but the first morality is prohibition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2082
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.050
<v Speaker 4>Control yourself so you don't cause too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much trouble.</v>

2083
01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:36.630
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe if you get that down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're good at it,</v>

2084
01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:37.620
<v Speaker 4>then the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2085
01:40:37.621 --> 01:40:42.621
<v Speaker 4>once you're disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can start working towards </v>

2086
01:40:42.621 --> 01:40:44.190
<v Speaker 4>something that's a positive good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the transformation that seems</v>

2087
01:40:44.191 --> 01:40:49.191
<v Speaker 4>to me to be fundamentally characteristic</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the juxtaposition of the new </v>

2088
01:40:49.191 --> 01:40:50.610
<v Speaker 4>testament onto the old testament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in these images,</v>

2089
01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:53.160
<v Speaker 4>it's still something like serve </v>
<v Speaker 4>tradition.</v>

2090
01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:57.910
<v Speaker 4>Serve the father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologically speaking,</v>

2091
01:40:58.090 --> 01:41:02.250
<v Speaker 4>support the tradition because you live </v>
<v Speaker 4>on it there.</v>

2092
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:04.610
<v Speaker 4>In the old Mesopotamian story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2093
01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:06.000
<v Speaker 4>the Enuma Elish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you can,</v>

2094
01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:11.100
<v Speaker 4>which you can read about if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in the original gods who are </v>

2095
01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:12.310
<v Speaker 4>really badly behaved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like two year olds.</v>

2096
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:14.110
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot like two year olds,</v>

2097
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:19.870
<v Speaker 4>they kill the primordial God absolute </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's the Patriarchal God,</v>

2098
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:21.550
<v Speaker 4>to kill them and try to live on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>corpse.</v>

2099
01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we all do,</v>

2100
01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:28.410
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we live on a corpse of our </v>

2101
01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:30.031
<v Speaker 4>ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could say we live in the Corpus of </v>

2102
01:41:30.031 --> 01:41:31.881
<v Speaker 4>our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's dead and that's not a great place </v>

2103
01:41:31.881 --> 01:41:31.881
<v Speaker 4>to live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to keep reinventing it.</v>

2104
01:41:31.881 --> 01:41:35.110
<v Speaker 4>So the damn thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stays active and awake.</v>

2105
01:41:35.190 --> 01:41:40.190
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stay on the carbs for too long and </v>

2106
01:41:40.190 --> 01:41:40.810
<v Speaker 4>then the devil of or the demon of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes back.</v>

2107
01:41:40.811 --> 01:41:42.700
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mesopotamian story.</v>

2108
01:41:42.701 --> 01:41:47.701
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be thinking that you can stay on </v>

2109
01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:50.671
<v Speaker 4>the core of your ancestors for too long </v>
<v Speaker 4>without contributing to the </v>

2110
01:41:50.671 --> 01:41:54.580
<v Speaker 4>revivification of the system because the</v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos that all of that holds,</v>

2111
01:41:54.581 --> 01:41:59.581
<v Speaker 4>that all of that holds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Bay will definitely come and visit </v>

2112
01:41:59.581 --> 01:42:03.121
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you'll see that in stories like a </v>

2113
01:42:03.121 --> 01:42:03.121
<v Speaker 4>Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2114
01:42:03.121 --> 01:42:04.090
<v Speaker 4>hobbits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're nice,</v>

2115
01:42:04.091 --> 01:42:05.330
<v Speaker 4>they like to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're kind of fat,</v>

2116
01:42:05.331 --> 01:42:06.670
<v Speaker 4>they're short,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not very bright,</v>

2117
01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:07.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a hubris stick.</v>

2118
01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:10.660
<v Speaker 4>They have no idea what's out there in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the broader world.</v>

2119
01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:15.720
<v Speaker 4>They're protected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you remember by the striders who are </v>

2120
01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:16.090
<v Speaker 4>the sons of great kings who look like </v>
<v Speaker 4>tramps,</v>

2121
01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:21.240
<v Speaker 4>they have nothing but contempt for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They patrol the borders and keep the </v>

2122
01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:21.850
<v Speaker 4>bloody harbored safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would.</v>

2123
01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:26.140
<v Speaker 4>They're it out there in the periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All Hell is brewing and chaos is,</v>

2124
01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:28.420
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is generating and forming.</v>

2125
01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:33.780
<v Speaker 4>And that's an archetypal story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why people liked that story </v>

2126
01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.700
<v Speaker 4>so much because that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're the hobbits and there are,</v>

2127
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:40.810
<v Speaker 4>we are protected from chaos by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>spirits of our data ancestors and we're </v>

2128
01:42:40.810 --> 01:42:42.220
<v Speaker 4>too damn stupid to know it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we think,</v>

2129
01:42:42.221 --> 01:42:43.960
<v Speaker 4>oh well we don't need them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>

2130
01:42:43.961 --> 01:42:45.370
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's postmodernism.</v>

2131
01:42:45.371 --> 01:42:50.371
<v Speaker 4>That's what the bloody universities are </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing with the humanities to absolutely </v>

2132
01:42:50.371 --> 01:42:50.890
<v Speaker 4>appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we will pay for it.</v>

2133
01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:56.310
<v Speaker 4>So unless we wake up and hopefully we'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>wake up because that would be better </v>

2134
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:58.270
<v Speaker 4>than paying for it even though being </v>
<v Speaker 4>awake is rather painful.</v>

2135
01:42:58.990 --> 01:43:02.470
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I had this vision one time and I</v>

2136
01:43:02.471 --> 01:43:05.550
<v Speaker 4>kind of portrayed in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this image of,</v>

2137
01:43:05.551 --> 01:43:07.780
<v Speaker 4>of what the world was like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

2138
01:43:07.781 --> 01:43:09.190
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a pyramid.</v>

2139
01:43:09.191 --> 01:43:11.530
<v Speaker 4>It's not a single hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 4>authority.</v>

2140
01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:12.820
<v Speaker 4>That's not what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2141
01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:17.970
<v Speaker 4>it's an array of hierarchy of authority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you imagine this sort of infinite </v>

2142
01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:21.991
<v Speaker 4>plane and in the infinite plane there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing but pyramids and inside the </v>

2143
01:43:21.991 --> 01:43:24.240
<v Speaker 4>Pyramids there are strata of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere,</v>

2144
01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:26.770
<v Speaker 4>far as you can look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of the pyramids are tall,</v>

2145
01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.810
<v Speaker 4>some of them are short,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they overlap there.</v>

2146
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:33.830
<v Speaker 4>It's endless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The plane is endless and those are all </v>

2147
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:36.361
<v Speaker 4>the positions to which you could rise </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody's inside the pyramid sort </v>

2148
01:43:36.361 --> 01:43:38.530
<v Speaker 4>of crammed up trying to move towards the</v>
<v Speaker 4>top.</v>

2149
01:43:38.650 --> 01:43:43.650
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sailing across overtop of all of them </v>

2150
01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:44.920
<v Speaker 4>and seeing how the structure itself </v>
<v Speaker 4>works.</v>

2151
01:43:44.921 --> 01:43:49.921
<v Speaker 4>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the I that floats above the </v>

2152
01:43:49.921 --> 01:43:51.650
<v Speaker 4>pyramid and the sees the structure </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself and the highest order of being is</v>

2153
01:43:51.651 --> 01:43:56.651
<v Speaker 4>not to be at the top of the pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's to use the discipline that you </v>

2154
01:43:56.651 --> 01:44:00.560
<v Speaker 4>attained by striving towards the top of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the pyramid to release yourself from the</v>

2155
01:44:00.561 --> 01:44:03.170
<v Speaker 4>pyramid and move one step up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

2156
01:44:03.171 --> 01:44:06.200
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>instantiated in the idea of the,</v>

2157
01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.970
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the Holy Ghost.</v>

2158
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:09.050
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2159
01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:17.020
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's a kin to that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>says office and need you to set of </v>

2160
01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:17.020
<v Speaker 4>Sisyphus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly,</v>

2161
01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:21.461
<v Speaker 4>that one has to imagine him happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well if there's a rock at the bottom of </v>

2162
01:44:21.461 --> 01:44:26.081
<v Speaker 4>the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you might as well push it up the </v>

2163
01:44:26.081 --> 01:44:26.081
<v Speaker 4>hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if it rolls back down,</v>

2164
01:44:26.081 --> 01:44:26.081
<v Speaker 4>well then you've got something else to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

2165
01:44:26.081 --> 01:44:31.001
<v Speaker 4>Don't you can push the damn rock back up</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hill and there's no shortage of </v>

2166
01:44:31.001 --> 01:44:33.230
<v Speaker 4>rocks to put up to push up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what we're built for anyways.</v>

2167
01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:35.900
<v Speaker 4>And so let's go out and like push them </v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

2168
01:44:35.901 --> 01:44:38.510
<v Speaker 4>boulders up the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe we could have enough self</v>

2169
01:44:38.511 --> 01:44:43.511
<v Speaker 4>confidence and enough enough respect for</v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves that we wouldn't have to turn </v>

2170
01:44:43.511 --> 01:44:47.501
<v Speaker 4>to hatred and revenge and try to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything down because I think that's </v>

2171
01:44:47.501 --> 01:44:49.610
<v Speaker 4>the alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's not weak.</v>

2172
01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.260
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing you can say about them.</v>

2173
01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same idea represented there,</v>

2174
01:44:55.621 --> 01:44:56.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's atlas.</v>

2175
01:44:56.521 --> 01:44:58.650
<v Speaker 4>Who voluntarily takes the world on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulders.</v>

2176
01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.370
<v Speaker 4>It's like the idea of Christ taking the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sins of the world on his shoulders.</v>

2177
01:45:02.490 --> 01:45:07.490
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly the same notion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the notion that you should be </v>

2178
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:10.791
<v Speaker 4>able to recognize in yourself all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>horror of humanity and take </v>

2179
01:45:10.791 --> 01:45:12.750
<v Speaker 4>responsibility for it because that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what that means.</v>

2180
01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:17.900
<v Speaker 4>And the thing that's so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that is that if you can recognize </v>

2181
01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:18.660
<v Speaker 4>yourself in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the horror of humanity,</v>

2182
01:45:18.930 --> 01:45:23.930
<v Speaker 4>you will instantly have a hell of a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>more respect for yourself than you did </v>

2183
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:27.051
<v Speaker 4>before you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there's some real utility in </v>

2184
01:45:27.051 --> 01:45:29.841
<v Speaker 4>knowing that you're a monster now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just because you're a monster </v>

2185
01:45:29.841 --> 01:45:32.901
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean you have to be a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's really useful to know that you </v>

2186
01:45:32.901 --> 01:45:35.880
<v Speaker 4>are one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things that you knew,</v>

2187
01:45:35.881 --> 01:45:38.800
<v Speaker 4>and this is something that I find so </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing about his writing,</v>

2188
01:45:38.801 --> 01:45:40.950
<v Speaker 4>is I think something that really </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinguishes him,</v>

2189
01:45:41.010 --> 01:45:46.010
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from Joseph Campbell who talked about </v>

2190
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:46.010
<v Speaker 4>following your bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like you said,</v>

2191
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:50.331
<v Speaker 4>very clearly that the first step to </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment is the encounter with the </v>

2192
01:45:50.331 --> 01:45:54.021
<v Speaker 4>shadow and what he meant by that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything horrible that human beings </v>

2193
01:45:54.021 --> 01:45:58.500
<v Speaker 4>have done was done by human beings and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your one of the.</v>

2194
01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:04.080
<v Speaker 4>And so if you don't understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to understand that really means to </v>

2195
01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:05.490
<v Speaker 4>know how it was that you could have done</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2196
01:46:05.610 --> 01:46:08.400
<v Speaker 4>and that's a shattering thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To try to imagine that.</v>

2197
01:46:08.401 --> 01:46:12.690
<v Speaker 4>To try to imagine yourself as someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's engaged in medieval torture,</v>

2198
01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:17.840
<v Speaker 4>to see how you could in fact do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're never the same after you learned </v>

2199
01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.551
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but being never the same after learning </v>

2200
01:46:21.551 --> 01:46:22.650
<v Speaker 4>that is unbelievably useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when you understand that,</v>

2201
01:46:22.651 --> 01:46:26.040
<v Speaker 4>that's what you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then your whole different creature and I</v>

2202
01:46:26.041 --> 01:46:31.041
<v Speaker 4>don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is something I did learn from </v>

2203
01:46:31.041 --> 01:46:32.841
<v Speaker 4>young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you cannot be a good person </v>

2204
01:46:32.841 --> 01:46:33.990
<v Speaker 4>until you know how much evil you contain</v>
<v Speaker 4>within you.</v>

2205
01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:37.650
<v Speaker 4>It is not possible and it's partly </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you just don't have any potency.</v>

2206
01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:41.040
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're just naive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're just nice,</v>

2207
01:46:41.041 --> 01:46:43.180
<v Speaker 4>if you'd never hurt anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd never heard of fly.</v>

2208
01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:44.880
<v Speaker 4>You don't have the capability for any of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2209
01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:47.340
<v Speaker 4>Why would anyone ever take you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seriously?</v>

2210
01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:48.780
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just,</v>

2211
01:46:48.781 --> 01:46:51.090
<v Speaker 4>you're a animal at best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2212
01:46:51.091 --> 01:46:52.770
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather contemptible one at that.</v>

2213
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:57.950
<v Speaker 4>And it's a very strange thing because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't think that the revelation </v>

2214
01:46:57.950 --> 01:47:02.031
<v Speaker 4>of the capacity for evil is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>precondition for the realization of </v>

2215
01:47:02.031 --> 01:47:02.031
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I believe that,</v>

2216
01:47:02.031 --> 01:47:06.950
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would you be serious enough to even </v>

2217
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:09.741
<v Speaker 4>attempt to pursue the good?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you had some sense of what the </v>

2218
01:47:09.741 --> 01:47:11.500
<v Speaker 4>consequences of not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2219
01:47:11.501 --> 01:47:13.710
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be serious about these sorts</v>

2220
01:47:13.711 --> 01:47:14.490
<v Speaker 4>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a,</v>

2221
01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.710
<v Speaker 4>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not the game of a child,</v>

2222
01:47:16.711 --> 01:47:19.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the game of a fully developed adult</v>

2223
01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:22.410
<v Speaker 4>and you have learned this in part when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>had little kids,</v>

2224
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:26.310
<v Speaker 4>I wrote a chapter for my new book called</v>
<v Speaker 4>never let your children do anything that</v>

2225
01:47:26.311 --> 01:47:27.210
<v Speaker 4>makes you dislike them.</v>

2226
01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:29.580
<v Speaker 4>And why was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I read,</v>

2227
01:47:29.610 --> 01:47:34.610
<v Speaker 4>I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote that after I knew I was a monster </v>

2228
01:47:34.610 --> 01:47:35.910
<v Speaker 4>and I thought I'm going to make sure I </v>
<v Speaker 4>like my kids.</v>

2229
01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:41.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make sure that they behave </v>
<v Speaker 4>around me so that I liked them because </v>

2230
01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:45.201
<v Speaker 4>I'm way bigger than them and I'm way </v>
<v Speaker 4>more cruel than they are and I've got </v>

2231
01:47:45.201 --> 01:47:47.670
<v Speaker 4>tricks up my sleeve that they cannot </v>
<v Speaker 4>even possibly imagine.</v>

2232
01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 4>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they irritate me,</v>

2233
01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:56.480
<v Speaker 4>I will absolutely take it out on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't think that you're the </v>

2234
01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.291
<v Speaker 4>sort of person that would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you are the sort of person who is </v>

2235
01:48:00.291 --> 01:48:00.570
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>

2236
01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:17.580
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to get to Adam and eve.</v>

2237
01:48:17.610 --> 01:48:22.610
<v Speaker 4>Haha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched this great documentary once a </v>

2238
01:48:22.710 --> 01:48:25.480
<v Speaker 4>called Hitman Hart and was about Bret </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hart,</v>

2239
01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:29.050
<v Speaker 4>who was the most famous Canadian in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world for awhile and he was,</v>

2240
01:48:29.250 --> 01:48:31.950
<v Speaker 4>he was a world wide wrestling federation</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestler,</v>

2241
01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:34.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was a good guy and uh,</v>

2242
01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:38.460
<v Speaker 4>he came from this famous family of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestlers who all came from Alberta,</v>

2243
01:48:38.461 --> 01:48:41.840
<v Speaker 4>I think there were seven brothers who </v>
<v Speaker 4>were wrestlers and seven sisters and all</v>

2244
01:48:41.841 --> 01:48:45.510
<v Speaker 4>of the sisters married wrestlers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were all offspring.</v>

2245
01:48:45.511 --> 01:48:47.010
<v Speaker 4>Children of Stu Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

2246
01:48:47.011 --> 01:48:47.610
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

2247
01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:50.730
<v Speaker 4>who was wrestling impresario like 40 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

2248
01:48:51.090 --> 01:48:54.360
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was such a cool documentary because I</v>

2249
01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:58.770
<v Speaker 4>was always wondering why in the world do</v>
<v Speaker 4>people watch wrestling and,</v>

2250
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:59.850
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and believe it,</v>

2251
01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe it.</v>

2252
01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:03.900
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe movies when you go watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>them?</v>

2253
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:08.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a hard question to answer while </v>

2254
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:08.990
<v Speaker 4>you're there.</v>

2255
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:12.170
<v Speaker 4>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're watching wrestling and </v>

2256
01:49:12.170 --> 01:49:12.170
<v Speaker 4>you're a wrestling fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you believe it?</v>

2257
01:49:12.170 --> 01:49:12.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't a matter of belief.</v>

2258
01:49:12.811 --> 01:49:17.811
<v Speaker 4>It's a matter of being engaged in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>drama and there are different levels of </v>

2259
01:49:17.811 --> 01:49:17.811
<v Speaker 4>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2260
01:49:17.811 --> 01:49:22.611
<v Speaker 4>So let's say worldwide Wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 4>Federation drama is not the most </v>

2261
01:49:22.611 --> 01:49:26.391
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated form of drama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not being not being assessed </v>

2262
01:49:26.391 --> 01:49:31.071
<v Speaker 4>smart Alec when I'm saying that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was drama of different sophistication </v>

2263
01:49:31.071 --> 01:49:35.571
<v Speaker 4>for different people and that's also why</v>
<v Speaker 4>religious truths exists at multiple </v>

2264
01:49:35.571 --> 01:49:35.571
<v Speaker 4>levels simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2265
01:49:35.571 --> 01:49:40.460
<v Speaker 4>There's gotta be something in it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone and that's a hard belief </v>

2266
01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:40.560
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a hard system to put together.</v>

2267
01:49:40.710 --> 01:49:45.710
<v Speaker 4>Something for the unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated and something for the </v>

2268
01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:45.840
<v Speaker 4>common person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2269
01:49:45.841 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 4>So we have wrestling and Brett Hart was </v>
<v Speaker 4>a good guy and</v>

2270
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:51.730
<v Speaker 5>he fell into the archetype of being a </v>
<v Speaker 5>good guy and that's partly what the.</v>

2271
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:54.010
<v Speaker 5>What the story's about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a bit too much for him,</v>

2272
01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:59.460
<v Speaker 5>but one of the things that he he laid </v>
<v Speaker 5>out so carefully was because he figured </v>

2273
01:49:59.621 --> 01:50:04.621
<v Speaker 5>that a 120 million people knew him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that and that everywhere </v>

2274
01:50:04.621 --> 01:50:08.371
<v Speaker 5>he went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was treated like a hero and he found </v>

2275
01:50:08.371 --> 01:50:10.471
<v Speaker 5>that quite a bit of quite a burden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you can imagine if you think about </v>

2276
01:50:10.471 --> 01:50:14.071
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he portrayed what was happening in </v>

2277
01:50:14.071 --> 01:50:16.171
<v Speaker 5>the wrestling ring as classic good </v>
<v Speaker 5>against evil but not conceptualized in </v>

2278
01:50:16.241 --> 01:50:17.440
<v Speaker 5>discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2279
01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.150
<v Speaker 5>Embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fought out,</v>

2280
01:50:19.151 --> 01:50:20.120
<v Speaker 5>act it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2281
01:50:20.130 --> 01:50:20.950
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2282
01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:24.340
<v Speaker 5>like thor and the hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>except like right in front of you.</v>

2283
01:50:24.670 --> 01:50:29.230
<v Speaker 5>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's exactly this sort of thing.</v>

2284
01:50:29.231 --> 01:50:34.231
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we could consider hockey more </v>

2285
01:50:34.231 --> 01:50:34.231
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated than wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps not.</v>

2286
01:50:34.231 --> 01:50:35.950
<v Speaker 5>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not being a critic of these.</v>

2287
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:38.980
<v Speaker 5>I am not being critically minded about </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things.</v>

2288
01:50:38.981 --> 01:50:42.310
<v Speaker 5>I understand their purpose and I would </v>
<v Speaker 5>highly recommend that documentary.</v>

2289
01:50:42.311 --> 01:50:44.470
<v Speaker 5>It's a brilliant documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is,</v>

2290
01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:46.420
<v Speaker 5>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a Silver Cup,</v>

2291
01:50:46.421 --> 01:50:51.421
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's the hero of the team </v>

2292
01:50:51.421 --> 01:50:51.640
<v Speaker 5>that's the hero of the teams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2293
01:50:51.730 --> 01:50:56.730
<v Speaker 5>here's something cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're the fan of the Toronto Blue </v>

2294
01:50:57.730 --> 01:51:02.730
<v Speaker 5>Jays are the Toronto Maple leafs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course this hardly ever happens to </v>

2295
01:51:02.730 --> 01:51:02.950
<v Speaker 5>you if you're a fan of the Toronto Maple</v>
<v Speaker 5>leafs because they always lose,</v>

2296
01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.960
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2297
01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:10.110
<v Speaker 5>but if you're watching a game and your </v>
<v Speaker 5>team wins and we take your testosterone </v>

2298
01:51:11.201 --> 01:51:15.250
<v Speaker 5>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they went up and if you watched the</v>

2299
01:51:15.250 --> 01:51:17.260
<v Speaker 5>Toronto Maple leafs and they lost and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a fan,</v>

2300
01:51:17.261 --> 01:51:20.860
<v Speaker 5>then your testosterone levels go down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's pretty damn funny,</v>

2301
01:51:21.130 --> 01:51:26.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean really don't you see how deeply </v>

2302
01:51:26.130 --> 01:51:26.130
<v Speaker 5>instantiated this as in people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2303
01:51:26.130 --> 01:51:28.640
<v Speaker 5>it bloody well alters your biochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like your,</v>

2304
01:51:28.810 --> 01:51:30.580
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your testosterone levels.</v>

2305
01:51:30.581 --> 01:51:34.810
<v Speaker 5>It's all more my team lost know there'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>be no.</v>

2306
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:36.850
<v Speaker 5>There'll be nothing in it for the wife </v>
<v Speaker 5>tonight.</v>

2307
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2308
01:51:55.290 --> 01:51:57.210
<v Speaker 5>well this is the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think from,</v>

2309
01:51:57.240 --> 01:52:00.430
<v Speaker 5>from the phenomenological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and one of the things that,</v>

2310
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:05.830
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that has come to my realization is that </v>

2311
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:08.310
<v Speaker 5>this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is real.</v>

2312
01:52:08.311 --> 01:52:11.460
<v Speaker 5>It's not a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's way deeper than a metaphor.</v>

2313
01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:17.060
<v Speaker 5>The most real things about life are the </v>
<v Speaker 5>place you don't know and the place you </v>

2314
01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:18.150
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you could say,</v>

2315
01:52:18.151 --> 01:52:20.100
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's explored territory and unexplored</v>

2316
01:52:20.101 --> 01:52:23.370
<v Speaker 5>territory that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's been around forever.</v>

2317
01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:26.040
<v Speaker 5>Back to the lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lobsters in a new place.</v>

2318
01:52:26.041 --> 01:52:28.170
<v Speaker 5>The first thing they do is go around </v>
<v Speaker 5>their territory,</v>

2319
01:52:28.171 --> 01:52:30.960
<v Speaker 5>finding places to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and also making a burrow.</v>

2320
01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:36.140
<v Speaker 5>So the first thing they do is establish </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they know against what they don't </v>

2321
01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:37.200
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's real.</v>

2322
01:52:37.201 --> 01:52:39.420
<v Speaker 5>It's real from the Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective.</v>

2323
01:52:39.421 --> 01:52:42.570
<v Speaker 5>And we're going to say that what's real </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the Darwinian perspective is plenty</v>

2324
01:52:42.571 --> 01:52:44.760
<v Speaker 5>real enough because we're alive and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

2325
01:52:44.761 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 5>And so sort of thing matters.</v>

2326
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:46.940
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2327
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:52.000
<v Speaker 4>that's what this is the dallas symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it says is that what's Wade </v>

2328
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.961
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is experienced made of eternally </v>

2329
01:52:55.961 --> 01:52:55.961
<v Speaker 4>outs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Easy.</v>

2330
01:52:56.490 --> 01:52:57.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>off in order.</v>

2331
01:52:58.490 --> 01:53:03.490
<v Speaker 4>And in every bit of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the possibility of order and </v>

2332
01:53:03.490 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 4>every bit of order there's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility of chaos.</v>

2333
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:05.060
<v Speaker 4>And that's the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2334
01:53:05.061 --> 01:53:07.460
<v Speaker 4>That's the path of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's life itself.</v>

2335
01:53:07.461 --> 01:53:10.280
<v Speaker 4>And where you're supposed to be is right</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the border between the two of those.</v>

2336
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:14.420
<v Speaker 4>And why is that stable enough?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Engaged enough,</v>

2337
01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:19.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So not only are you doing what you </v>

2338
01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:22.241
<v Speaker 4>should be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it in a way that increases </v>

2339
01:53:22.241 --> 01:53:22.241
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you'll do it better</v>
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow,</v>

2340
01:53:22.241 --> 01:53:25.460
<v Speaker 4>and you can tell when you're doing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're engaged,</v>

2341
01:53:25.461 --> 01:53:28.660
<v Speaker 4>you're in the right time and place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your,</v>

2342
01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:31.250
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your neurology tells you that.</v>

2343
01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:35.000
<v Speaker 4>That's what meaning is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what transcendent meaning is.</v>

2344
01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:39.350
<v Speaker 4>And that's so cool because I also think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that is the antidote to existential</v>

2345
01:53:39.351 --> 01:53:42.290
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The antidote to existential suffering is</v>

2346
01:53:42.291 --> 01:53:47.291
<v Speaker 4>to be at the right place at the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and you know you want to get </v>

2347
01:53:47.291 --> 01:53:47.780
<v Speaker 4>technical about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2348
01:53:47.781 --> 01:53:50.030
<v Speaker 4>Anxiety and pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's the key.</v>

2349
01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:52.940
<v Speaker 4>That's the reality of existential </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>

2350
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:58.390
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say you're in the right place </v>

2351
01:53:58.390 --> 01:54:00.521
<v Speaker 4>at the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens to biochemically </v>

2352
01:54:00.521 --> 01:54:00.890
<v Speaker 4>dopaminergic activation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that do?</v>

2353
01:54:01.410 --> 01:54:04.420
<v Speaker 4>Suppress this anxiety and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>analgesic.</v>

2354
01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:08.060
<v Speaker 4>Now it's more than that because it also </v>
<v Speaker 4>produces positive emotion and the desire</v>

2355
01:54:08.061 --> 01:54:11.370
<v Speaker 4>to move forward and it underlies </v>
<v Speaker 4>creativity and,</v>

2356
01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:16.380
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so not only do you get the positive </v>

2357
01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:16.380
<v Speaker 4>engagement from a neurochemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>

2358
01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:20.591
<v Speaker 4>you get the Analgesia and you get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ante and you get the reduction of </v>

2359
01:54:20.591 --> 01:54:22.760
<v Speaker 4>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not hypothetical,</v>

2360
01:54:22.761 --> 01:54:25.130
<v Speaker 4>it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is the case that the dopaminergic</v>

2361
01:54:25.131 --> 01:54:26.990
<v Speaker 4>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are the exploratory systems,</v>

2362
01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:32.020
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably ancient and archaic are </v>
<v Speaker 4>activated when you're optimally </v>

2363
01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:33.790
<v Speaker 4>positioned to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be,</v>

2364
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:36.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what incorporating new information,</v>

2365
01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:41.920
<v Speaker 4>which is what human beings do because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're information foragers and so we </v>

2366
01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:43.910
<v Speaker 4>want to be secure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but building on our security at the same</v>

2367
01:54:43.911 --> 01:54:44.210
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2368
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.170
<v Speaker 4>And then we want to do it for ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want to do it for other people.</v>

2369
01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:51.080
<v Speaker 4>We want to do it for our families,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we want to do it for broader society.</v>

2370
01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:54.650
<v Speaker 4>We want to bring the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 4>together in alignment to do that.</v>

2371
01:54:54.651 --> 01:54:59.651
<v Speaker 4>And that's meaningful and God only knows</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we could do about the suffering of </v>

2372
01:54:59.651 --> 01:54:59.651
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we did that,</v>

2373
01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:04.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have no idea what we could do if we </v>

2374
01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:07.841
<v Speaker 4>started doing things properly and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>so many of the things that dismay us </v>

2375
01:55:07.841 --> 01:55:07.841
<v Speaker 4>about life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could,</v>

2376
01:55:07.841 --> 01:55:09.140
<v Speaker 4>we could stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2377
01:55:09.170 --> 01:55:11.330
<v Speaker 4>we stopped a lot of them in the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred years.</v>

2378
01:55:11.630 --> 01:55:14.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are a lot better than they were a</v>

2379
01:55:14.210 --> 01:55:15.890
<v Speaker 4>hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously they're not perfect,</v>

2380
01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:18.800
<v Speaker 4>but 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>120 years ago,</v>

2381
01:55:18.801 --> 01:55:19.280
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2382
01:55:19.281 --> 01:55:24.281
<v Speaker 4>the average person in the western world </v>
<v Speaker 4>lived on less than a dollar a day in </v>

2383
01:55:24.281 --> 01:55:28.151
<v Speaker 4>today's dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like he just try that for a week </v>

2384
01:55:28.151 --> 01:55:30.770
<v Speaker 4>and see how much fun that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the daoists wow,</v>

2385
01:55:30.771 --> 01:55:31.580
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2386
01:55:31.581 --> 01:55:36.581
<v Speaker 4>this is the pre caused chaos out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>which the word of God extracted </v>

2387
01:55:36.581 --> 01:55:37.700
<v Speaker 4>habitable order at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2388
01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:41.590
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing and that chaos.</v>

2389
01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:47.380
<v Speaker 4>We'll talk a bit more about that later I</v>
<v Speaker 4>guess because it's a very complicated </v>

2390
01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:47.380
<v Speaker 4>thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to describe,</v>

2391
01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:52.311
<v Speaker 4>but it's certainly the thing that when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you encounter the chaos is what you </v>

2392
01:55:52.311 --> 01:55:52.770
<v Speaker 4>encounter when the twin towers fall.</v>

2393
01:55:54.130 --> 01:55:55.870
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember what that was like?</v>

2394
01:55:55.871 --> 01:55:57.940
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was.</v>

2395
01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.730
<v Speaker 4>It was September 10th.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While that was the World Cup.</v>

2396
01:56:00.850 --> 01:56:05.850
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knew what the world was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it was September 11th and </v>

2397
01:56:05.850 --> 01:56:08.791
<v Speaker 4>everyone walked around days for three </v>
<v Speaker 4>days because the building's felt,</v>

2398
01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:13.540
<v Speaker 4>but so what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can see a building fall.</v>

2399
01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:16.660
<v Speaker 4>You can understand what it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens when a building falls,</v>

2400
01:56:16.661 --> 01:56:21.661
<v Speaker 4>so then what's going on with the being </v>
<v Speaker 4>dazed while it's the chaos that </v>

2401
01:56:21.661 --> 01:56:25.441
<v Speaker 4>underlies or how to bill order </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifested itself in those buildings </v>

2402
01:56:25.441 --> 01:56:28.501
<v Speaker 4>collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a brilliant act of terrorism and </v>

2403
01:56:28.501 --> 01:56:31.081
<v Speaker 4>everyone was frozen and curious because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how we react to that sort of </v>

2404
01:56:31.081 --> 01:56:31.570
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2405
01:56:31.630 --> 01:56:32.710
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2406
01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:34.960
<v Speaker 4>it's like the shark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't remember that famous,</v>

2407
01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:40.520
<v Speaker 4>that famous movie poster for jaws with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the woman's swimming on the top of the </v>

2408
01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:43.290
<v Speaker 4>water in that terrible leviathan shark </v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath coming up too,</v>

2409
01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:44.770
<v Speaker 4>to take her out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2410
01:56:44.771 --> 01:56:45.760
<v Speaker 4>that's life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2411
01:56:45.761 --> 01:56:50.761
<v Speaker 4>That's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now and then you see that and when </v>

2412
01:56:50.761 --> 01:56:50.830
<v Speaker 4>something falls like the twin towers </v>
<v Speaker 4>fall,</v>

2413
01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:53.740
<v Speaker 4>you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ocean below you the abyss,</v>

2414
01:56:53.741 --> 01:56:55.090
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The primordial best.</v>

2415
01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:56.950
<v Speaker 4>That bloody thing is deep.</v>

2416
01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:02.280
<v Speaker 4>And the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a fragile and that happens when </v>

2417
01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:02.280
<v Speaker 4>someone betrays you and it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens to you.</v>

2418
01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:07.201
<v Speaker 4>When your dreams fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you encounter that chaos again from </v>

2419
01:57:07.201 --> 01:57:10.441
<v Speaker 4>which the world is extracted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you're called upon to act out </v>

2420
01:57:10.441 --> 01:57:13.300
<v Speaker 4>attention and the word in order to bring</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world back into order.</v>

2421
01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.980
<v Speaker 4>And none of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of that is superstitious.</v>

2422
01:57:18.010 --> 01:57:21.010
<v Speaker 4>None of that is superstitious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of that's even metaphorical.</v>

2423
01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:23.180
<v Speaker 4>It's real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's real.</v>

2424
01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:28.200
<v Speaker 4>It's more real than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think the reason for that in part </v>

2425
01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:30.160
<v Speaker 4>is that this has been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been this way forever,</v>

2426
01:57:31.210 --> 01:57:32.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as there's been life,</v>

2427
01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:37.990
<v Speaker 4>this has been the rule of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the cosmos.</v>

2428
01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:40.090
<v Speaker 4>That's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we inhabit.</v>

2429
01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:42.190
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2430
01:57:42.210 --> 01:57:44.960
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the so called new atheists tonight,</v>

2431
01:57:44.961 --> 01:57:48.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to go on a tangent about </v>
<v Speaker 4>new atheist because I think atheists are</v>

2432
01:57:48.791 --> 01:57:52.210
<v Speaker 4>often remarkably honest and very </v>
<v Speaker 4>consistent in their analysis.</v>

2433
01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:57.540
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just don't think they're taking </v>

2434
01:57:57.540 --> 01:57:58.270
<v Speaker 4>the problem seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

2435
01:57:58.290 --> 01:58:03.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they take their </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary theorizing nearly with the </v>

2436
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:05.700
<v Speaker 4>seriousness that it that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessitates,</v>

2437
01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:07.710
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think that.</v>

2438
01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:16.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that you can dispute the </v>
<v Speaker 4>proposition that the longer something </v>

2439
01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:20.781
<v Speaker 4>has had a selection effect on life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more real it is.</v>

2440
01:58:22.170 --> 01:58:27.170
<v Speaker 4>It's the fundamental axiom of Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 4>biology and I think the Darwinian world </v>

2441
01:58:28.021 --> 01:58:33.021
<v Speaker 4>is more real than the physical world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the argument that I was trying </v>

2442
01:58:33.021 --> 01:58:34.140
<v Speaker 4>to have with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with with Sam Harris and I didn't do the</v>

2443
01:58:34.141 --> 01:58:39.141
<v Speaker 4>world's best job of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although it went not too bad the second </v>

2444
01:58:39.141 --> 01:58:39.141
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

2445
01:58:39.141 --> 01:58:43.270
<v Speaker 4>It's not something to be taken lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very serious,</v>

2446
01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:48.300
<v Speaker 4>profound and meaningful proposition and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people acted out and want to act it out </v>

2447
01:58:48.611 --> 01:58:52.210
<v Speaker 4>whether they know it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Martin.</v>

2448
01:58:54.450 --> 01:58:57.690
<v Speaker 4>So the story of Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just give it to you very briefly.</v>

2449
01:58:59.450 --> 01:59:02.600
<v Speaker 4>Time out and aps who are locked in </v>
<v Speaker 4>embrace at the beginning of time.</v>

2450
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:06.350
<v Speaker 4>God is of salt water garden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fresh water together,</v>

2451
01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:08.240
<v Speaker 4>chaos and order,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2452
01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:10.640
<v Speaker 4>They give rise masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feminine.</v>

2453
01:59:10.641 --> 01:59:13.220
<v Speaker 4>They give rise to the world of the elder</v>
<v Speaker 4>gods and those are,</v>

2454
01:59:13.221 --> 01:59:18.221
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're primordial motivational forces </v>

2455
01:59:18.221 --> 01:59:20.380
<v Speaker 4>or something like that and their rage </v>
<v Speaker 4>and their lust and their love and all </v>

2456
01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:25.181
<v Speaker 4>these things that possess us that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>there forever and they're out in the </v>

2457
01:59:25.181 --> 01:59:28.481
<v Speaker 4>world acting and they carelessly slay </v>
<v Speaker 4>appsu their father and their making a </v>

2458
01:59:29.451 --> 01:59:32.940
<v Speaker 4>rocket and then they collapse zoo and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then tie them out,</v>

2459
01:59:33.530 --> 01:59:35.780
<v Speaker 4>gets wind of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's time out right there.</v>

2460
01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:40.840
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's kind of a rough looking creature </v>

2461
01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:43.960
<v Speaker 4>and she's the mother of all things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so she's not very happy about this </v>

2462
01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:48.060
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her children have destroyed structure </v>

2463
01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:51.461
<v Speaker 4>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plus they're noisy and careless and so </v>

2464
01:59:51.461 --> 01:59:51.461
<v Speaker 4>she thinks all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like Noah,</v>

2465
01:59:51.461 --> 01:59:55.520
<v Speaker 4>just like the God that brings the flood </v>
<v Speaker 4>to know what exactly the same idea.</v>

2466
01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.190
<v Speaker 4>Time Matt comes back and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2467
01:59:57.191 --> 01:59:58.760
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough is enough.</v>

2468
01:59:59.030 --> 02:00:03.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take you out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she makes this battalion of monsters</v>

2469
02:00:03.141 --> 02:00:06.650
<v Speaker 4>and puts the worst monster there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the head of the battalion,</v>

2470
02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:07.820
<v Speaker 4>his name is king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knew.</v>

2471
02:00:07.850 --> 02:00:12.410
<v Speaker 4>He's like a precursor to the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Satan and she lets the gods know,</v>

2472
02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:14.720
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm coming for you,</v>

2473
02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:17.210
<v Speaker 4>and so they're not very happy about this</v>
<v Speaker 4>because their gods,</v>

2474
02:00:17.211 --> 02:00:18.380
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2475
02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:20.450
<v Speaker 4>she's chaos itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2476
02:00:20.451 --> 02:00:22.970
<v Speaker 4>She gave birth to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is no joke,</v>

2477
02:00:23.210 --> 02:00:28.210
<v Speaker 4>and so they send one got out after </v>
<v Speaker 4>another to confront her and they all </v>

2478
02:00:28.210 --> 02:00:28.460
<v Speaker 4>come back with their tails between their</v>
<v Speaker 4>legs.</v>

2479
02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:33.720
<v Speaker 4>There is no hope and then one day </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a new God that emerges and </v>

2480
02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:35.000
<v Speaker 4>that's Marduk and the gods know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as he pops up,</v>

2481
02:00:35.001 --> 02:00:36.930
<v Speaker 4>they know he's something new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember,</v>

2482
02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:41.940
<v Speaker 4>and this is happening while the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mesopotamians are assembling themselves </v>

2483
02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:43.100
<v Speaker 4>into one of the world's first great </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilizations.</v>

2484
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:48.250
<v Speaker 4>So all the gods of all of those tribes </v>
<v Speaker 4>are coming together to organize </v>

2485
02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:50.750
<v Speaker 4>themselves into a hierarchy to figure </v>
<v Speaker 4>out what proposition rules,</v>

2486
02:00:50.751 --> 02:00:54.110
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so Marta has elected by all the gods</v>

2487
02:00:54.111 --> 02:00:55.220
<v Speaker 4>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2488
02:00:55.221 --> 02:00:57.350
<v Speaker 4>I'll go out there and I'll take on time </v>
<v Speaker 4>map,</v>

2489
02:00:57.351 --> 02:01:00.290
<v Speaker 4>but here's the rule from here on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you follow me.</v>

2490
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:03.050
<v Speaker 4>I determined destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the top God.</v>

2491
02:01:03.051 --> 02:01:06.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm the thing at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy and all the other gods say,</v>

2492
02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:07.550
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no problem.</v>

2493
02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:11.630
<v Speaker 4>You get rid of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do exactly what you say.</v>

2494
02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:14.150
<v Speaker 4>Now Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his eyes all the way around his head and</v>

2495
02:01:14.151 --> 02:01:19.151
<v Speaker 4>he speaks magic words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are his primary attributes and so </v>

2496
02:01:19.151 --> 02:01:22.331
<v Speaker 4>he takes a net and he goes out to </v>
<v Speaker 4>confront time at and and he,</v>

2497
02:01:22.530 --> 02:01:23.240
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2498
02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:26.420
<v Speaker 4>he encloses her in the neck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is so cool because it's an</v>

2499
02:01:26.421 --> 02:01:27.500
<v Speaker 4>encapsulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2500
02:01:27.501 --> 02:01:32.030
<v Speaker 4>It's a conceptual encapsulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He encloses chaos itself in a conceptual</v>

2501
02:01:32.031 --> 02:01:37.031
<v Speaker 4>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He puts it in the net and then he cuts </v>

2502
02:01:37.031 --> 02:01:38.750
<v Speaker 4>her into pieces and he makes the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then</v>

2503
02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:47.860
<v Speaker 4>that he creates human beings to inhabit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that world and to serve the gods and he </v>

2504
02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:48.280
<v Speaker 4>creates human beings out of the blood of</v>
<v Speaker 4>king,</v>

2505
02:01:48.281 --> 02:01:52.520
<v Speaker 4>of the worst of the demons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that took me a call.</v>

2506
02:01:52.521 --> 02:01:57.521
<v Speaker 4>Andy Young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a student of mine helped me </v>

2507
02:01:57.521 --> 02:01:57.521
<v Speaker 4>figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought,</v>

2508
02:01:57.521 --> 02:01:57.521
<v Speaker 4>because that's pretty damn pessimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2509
02:01:57.521 --> 02:02:00.590
<v Speaker 4>you know what exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a fall metaphor.</v>

2510
02:02:00.591 --> 02:02:02.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like the idea of original sin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2511
02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:07.680
<v Speaker 4>but our joint conclusion with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was that human beings are the only </v>

2512
02:02:09.501 --> 02:02:13.610
<v Speaker 4>creatures in creation that can truly </v>
<v Speaker 4>deceive,</v>

2513
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:15.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have the capacity for evil,</v>

2514
02:02:15.831 --> 02:02:17.720
<v Speaker 4>just like it says in the Adam and Eve </v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

2515
02:02:17.721 --> 02:02:20.460
<v Speaker 4>We can actually do that and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're made out of the blood of King,</v>

2516
02:02:20.461 --> 02:02:24.830
<v Speaker 4>knew the king of the demons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the we are that thing that can deceive,</v>

2517
02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:27.500
<v Speaker 4>that can twist the structure of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2518
02:02:27.501 --> 02:02:31.460
<v Speaker 4>so Marduk now the massive team has had </v>
<v Speaker 4>an emperor,</v>

2519
02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:33.620
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the emperor was the</v>

2520
02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:37.370
<v Speaker 4>Avatar of Marta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what made him emperor.</v>

2521
02:02:37.371 --> 02:02:39.490
<v Speaker 4>He was only at Emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he was going to be Murdoch,</v>

2522
02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:41.190
<v Speaker 4>he had to be a good duck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which man,</v>

2523
02:02:41.191 --> 02:02:43.030
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do confront time,</v>

2524
02:02:43.190 --> 02:02:47.630
<v Speaker 4>chaos and cut her up and make order out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of her pieces and what the Mesopotamians</v>

2525
02:02:47.631 --> 02:02:49.760
<v Speaker 4>used to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After New Year's celebration,</v>

2526
02:02:49.761 --> 02:02:54.761
<v Speaker 4>they'd go outside their walled city and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's explored territory versus </v>

2527
02:02:54.761 --> 02:02:58.661
<v Speaker 4>unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go outside their world's citi into </v>

2528
02:02:58.661 --> 02:03:01.181
<v Speaker 4>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they bring all the statutes that </v>

2529
02:03:01.181 --> 02:03:03.311
<v Speaker 4>represented the gods and they'd act this</v>
<v Speaker 4>out because they're trying to figure </v>

2530
02:03:03.311 --> 02:03:03.311
<v Speaker 4>something out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2531
02:03:03.311 --> 02:03:04.370
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to figure out what this </v>
<v Speaker 4>means.</v>

2532
02:03:04.371 --> 02:03:09.371
<v Speaker 4>They're acting it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they'd take their emperor and </v>

2533
02:03:09.371 --> 02:03:10.040
<v Speaker 4>the priest would make them kneel and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they take all his king,</v>

2534
02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:16.060
<v Speaker 4>all his king uniform off is emperor </v>
<v Speaker 4>uniform off and make them Neil and </v>

2535
02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:17.900
<v Speaker 4>humiliate them and nail them with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>glove and say,</v>

2536
02:03:17.901 --> 02:03:22.901
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how were you not a good Martech this </v>

2537
02:03:22.901 --> 02:03:22.901
<v Speaker 4>year?</v>

2538
02:03:22.901 --> 02:03:26.410
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he'd recount all the ways that </v>

2539
02:03:26.410 --> 02:03:28.931
<v Speaker 4>he was inadequate in confronting chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they'd do the celebration and </v>

2540
02:03:28.931 --> 02:03:32.030
<v Speaker 4>Martech would win and the king would go </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep with a royal prostitute.</v>

2541
02:03:32.031 --> 02:03:37.031
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that was it's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same idea as St George pulling the </v>

2542
02:03:37.031 --> 02:03:41.291
<v Speaker 4>Virgin from the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly the same idea that if you </v>

2543
02:03:41.291 --> 02:03:42.200
<v Speaker 4>call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you encounter the reptilian chaos,</v>

2544
02:03:42.201 --> 02:03:46.190
<v Speaker 4>you can extract something out of it with</v>
<v Speaker 4>which if you unite,</v>

2545
02:03:46.191 --> 02:03:51.191
<v Speaker 4>you produce creative order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they were acting out and </v>

2546
02:03:51.191 --> 02:03:52.970
<v Speaker 4>that was the basis for the Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of sovereignty.</v>

2547
02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:56.000
<v Speaker 4>It's so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so unbelievably smart,</v>

2548
02:03:56.270 --> 02:04:01.270
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Mesopotamians had a massive </v>

2549
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.640
<v Speaker 4>influence on the civilizations that then</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a massive influence on us.</v>

2550
02:04:01.641 --> 02:04:05.780
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the stories of how the </v>
<v Speaker 4>notion of sovereignty itself came to be.</v>

2551
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:09.770
<v Speaker 4>It's the evolution of the idea of God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>

2552
02:04:09.771 --> 02:04:14.771
<v Speaker 4>but even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the evolution of the idea of the </v>

2553
02:04:14.771 --> 02:04:15.530
<v Speaker 4>redemptive human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2554
02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:18.710
<v Speaker 4>and that's taken to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of its conclusions while in the</v>

2555
02:04:18.711 --> 02:04:20.870
<v Speaker 4>story of Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also in the story of Christ,</v>

2556
02:04:20.871 --> 02:04:23.420
<v Speaker 4>the idea of the perfect individual and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the notion is,</v>

2557
02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:28.660
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the word that speaks truth into </v>

2558
02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:29.030
<v Speaker 4>chaos at the beginning of time to </v>
<v Speaker 4>generate habitable order.</v>

2559
02:04:29.031 --> 02:04:31.430
<v Speaker 4>That is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the story.</v>

2560
02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:33.170
<v Speaker 4>And so with that,</v>

2561
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

2562
02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:44.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just show you these pictures </v>

2563
02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:44.880
<v Speaker 5>because they're so interesting once you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know what they mean.</v>

2564
02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:46.570
<v Speaker 5>They're so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a symbol of infinity.</v>

2565
02:04:47.090 --> 02:04:48.920
<v Speaker 5>That's Hercules and the hydro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2566
02:04:48.921 --> 02:04:51.220
<v Speaker 5>what's life like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It cut off one head.</v>

2567
02:04:51.250 --> 02:04:53.740
<v Speaker 5>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seven more grow,</v>

2568
02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:54.970
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you do?</v>

2569
02:04:54.971 --> 02:04:56.110
<v Speaker 5>Run whole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2570
02:04:56.111 --> 02:04:57.700
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not what you do it.</v>

2571
02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:00.160
<v Speaker 5>This is what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You fight it.</v>

2572
02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:06.180
<v Speaker 5>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the chaos that generates partial </v>

2573
02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:10.581
<v Speaker 5>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the ultimate chaos that generates </v>

2574
02:05:10.581 --> 02:05:12.591
<v Speaker 5>partial chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that also is what revivified his </v>

2575
02:05:12.591 --> 02:05:12.591
<v Speaker 5>life because otherwise it would just be </v>
<v Speaker 5>static.</v>

2576
02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:21.600
<v Speaker 5>Mercury headed Hydra,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2577
02:05:21.730 --> 02:05:23.920
<v Speaker 5>Freezes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have St George.</v>

2578
02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:26.380
<v Speaker 5>He's doing it peacefully,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is so interesting,</v>

2579
02:05:26.381 --> 02:05:28.240
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's got to be a terrific look on his</v>

2580
02:05:28.241 --> 02:05:31.090
<v Speaker 5>face and that particular representation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another St George,</v>

2581
02:05:31.091 --> 02:05:32.710
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Virgin in the background.</v>

2582
02:05:32.711 --> 02:05:34.750
<v Speaker 5>I think that's safe and if I remember </v>
<v Speaker 5>correctly,</v>

2583
02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:41.480
<v Speaker 5>St George,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's the patron saint of England.</v>

2584
02:05:42.050 --> 02:05:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2585
02:05:43.690 --> 02:05:46.050
<v Speaker 5>Here's an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This actually sheds light on,</v>

2586
02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:48.940
<v Speaker 5>on the human proclivity for warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say George,</v>

2587
02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:54.180
<v Speaker 5>that's a Muslim soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really easy to transform the enemy </v>

2588
02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:55.060
<v Speaker 5>into the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2589
02:05:55.061 --> 02:05:58.000
<v Speaker 5>Because the enemy is often the Predator </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we do that instantaneously,</v>

2590
02:05:58.020 --> 02:05:59.500
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>With without a second thought,</v>

2591
02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:03.730
<v Speaker 5>and so then we can go to war morally </v>
<v Speaker 5>because why not take out the snakes?</v>

2592
02:06:04.330 --> 02:06:04.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2593
02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:07.360
<v Speaker 5>the problem is where are the snakes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2594
02:06:07.361 --> 02:06:09.550
<v Speaker 5>maybe they're outside and maybe they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>

2595
02:06:09.610 --> 02:06:11.590
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're in this room and even </v>
<v Speaker 5>worse,</v>

2596
02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:13.720
<v Speaker 5>maybe they were in you and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>wisdom.</v>

2597
02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:18.870
<v Speaker 5>When you know that they're renew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why wouldn't she be happy about that?</v>

2598
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:24.620
<v Speaker 5>Especially if she had a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if she had a child right?</v>

2599
02:06:24.650 --> 02:06:29.650
<v Speaker 5>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's horace,</v>

2600
02:06:34.261 --> 02:06:35.820
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The God of vision,</v>

2601
02:06:36.150 --> 02:06:41.150
<v Speaker 5>and he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a can because falcons have great </v>

2602
02:06:41.150 --> 02:06:45.621
<v Speaker 5>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They fly above everything and they can </v>

2603
02:06:45.621 --> 02:06:45.840
<v Speaker 5>see everything and so that was the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Egyptian creative God,</v>

2604
02:06:45.841 --> 02:06:47.670
<v Speaker 5>Horus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'll tell you the story about horace</v>

2605
02:06:47.671 --> 02:06:52.671
<v Speaker 5>at some points as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now here's some pictures that </v>

2606
02:06:53.751 --> 02:06:58.751
<v Speaker 5>demonstrate what I had described as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>emergence of let's say the Metta hero </v>

2607
02:06:58.751 --> 02:07:03.611
<v Speaker 5>out of the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's the person you admire and </v>

2608
02:07:03.611 --> 02:07:06.341
<v Speaker 5>then there's the set of people that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>admire and then there's the set of </v>

2609
02:07:06.341 --> 02:07:08.330
<v Speaker 5>admirable people and the extraction of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that ideal.</v>

2610
02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:13.510
<v Speaker 5>As far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just what's portrayed in these </v>

2611
02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.510
<v Speaker 5>images.</v>

2612
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:23.370
<v Speaker 5>That's a great one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very sophisticated image.</v>

2613
02:07:23.371 --> 02:07:26.160
<v Speaker 5>You see the two sides of Christ's face </v>
<v Speaker 5>or not.</v>

2614
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:30.560
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>symmetrical one's garden ones,</v>

2615
02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:32.580
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what that icon means,</v>

2616
02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:34.770
<v Speaker 5>and so the fully developed person in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2617
02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:39.280
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the oldest representations </v>
<v Speaker 5>of of this sort that we know.</v>

2618
02:07:39.610 --> 02:07:40.420
<v Speaker 5>The idea is that</v>

2619
02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:43.280
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's the human person</v>

2620
02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:47.600
<v Speaker 5>in his ordinariness let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there's this,</v>

2621
02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:53.020
<v Speaker 5>this kinship with the divine that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with the willing adoption of </v>

2622
02:07:53.121 --> 02:07:58.121
<v Speaker 5>the responsibility of moral mortal being</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that produces this union and then </v>

2623
02:07:58.121 --> 02:08:00.140
<v Speaker 5>it's manifest in a book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2624
02:08:00.141 --> 02:08:02.720
<v Speaker 5>Because that speech and it's associated </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the sun,</v>

2625
02:08:03.230 --> 02:08:04.970
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the proper way of being.</v>

2626
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:15.790
<v Speaker 5>And that's a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think of the emergence of the </v>

2627
02:08:15.790 --> 02:08:17.390
<v Speaker 5>archetype of the multitude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

2628
02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:32.610
<v Speaker 5>And so I guess now we're done with </v>
<v Speaker 5>genesis one and that took three </v>

2629
02:08:32.610 --> 02:08:34.130
<v Speaker 5>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but God is complicated,</v>

2630
02:08:34.131 --> 02:08:35.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing.</v>

2631
02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:36.070
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2632
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:45.790
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>

2633
02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:52.450
<v Speaker 5>Next week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By all appearances,</v>

2634
02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:57.310
<v Speaker 5>that's where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we've got 20 minutes</v>

2635
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:59.270
<v Speaker 6>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2636
02:08:59.271 --> 02:09:01.520
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the past I've done some work with big</v>

2637
02:09:01.521 --> 02:09:02.780
<v Speaker 6>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 6>big sister and whatever.</v>

2638
02:09:02.970 --> 02:09:07.970
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that being said that the most common </v>

2639
02:09:07.970 --> 02:09:07.970
<v Speaker 6>story I tend to hear from the youth is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they read,</v>

2640
02:09:07.970 --> 02:09:10.760
<v Speaker 6>they're raising a single family home,</v>
<v Speaker 6>usually with a mom,</v>

2641
02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:13.190
<v Speaker 6>daddy's there on the picture and </v>
<v Speaker 6>alcoholic,</v>

2642
02:09:13.191 --> 02:09:14.150
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever that brought her.</v>

2643
02:09:14.450 --> 02:09:19.450
<v Speaker 6>So we have this child who is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 6>seek ways to make himself healthy and </v>

2644
02:09:21.231 --> 02:09:23.900
<v Speaker 6>empower himself in ways that a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 6>father should have done.</v>

2645
02:09:23.901 --> 02:09:24.710
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2646
02:09:24.711 --> 02:09:26.480
<v Speaker 6>between the formative years of like one </v>
<v Speaker 6>to four.</v>

2647
02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:27.410
<v Speaker 6>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2648
02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:28.550
<v Speaker 6>ongoing with this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2649
02:09:29.150 --> 02:09:34.150
<v Speaker 6>how,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say for someone who born without </v>

2650
02:09:34.150 --> 02:09:34.150
<v Speaker 6>like a good father figure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where would they go out in the world and</v>

2651
02:09:34.150 --> 02:09:37.450
<v Speaker 6>like what four spheres of influence </v>
<v Speaker 6>where they try to expose themselves to,</v>

2652
02:09:37.451 --> 02:09:42.451
<v Speaker 6>to like gain access to that Fountain of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Health and knowledge at a father or a </v>

2653
02:09:43.851 --> 02:09:46.310
<v Speaker 6>good father figures should have provided</v>
<v Speaker 6>them to in the first place.</v>

2654
02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:47.280
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well partly,</v>

2655
02:09:47.281 --> 02:09:50.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean certainly to some degree a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>mother can provide that,</v>

2656
02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:52.140
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>To some degree,</v>

2657
02:09:52.410 --> 02:09:54.780
<v Speaker 5>although it's hard for one person to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything right.</v>

2658
02:09:54.890 --> 02:09:59.890
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think one of the conundrums that </v>

2659
02:09:59.890 --> 02:10:01.701
<v Speaker 5>face women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is a tough one and this is why </v>

2660
02:10:01.701 --> 02:10:03.771
<v Speaker 5>I think women are higher in trait </v>
<v Speaker 5>agreeableness and higher in trait </v>

2661
02:10:03.771 --> 02:10:03.771
<v Speaker 5>negative emotion is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2662
02:10:03.771 --> 02:10:07.950
<v Speaker 5>the primary problem that a woman has </v>
<v Speaker 5>with an infant is why not throw it out a</v>

2663
02:10:07.951 --> 02:10:09.660
<v Speaker 5>window?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's very annoying,</v>

2664
02:10:09.930 --> 02:10:12.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's constant demand.</v>

2665
02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:17.480
<v Speaker 5>It's absolutely constant man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tremendous dependency and so a woman has</v>

2666
02:10:17.521 --> 02:10:21.540
<v Speaker 5>to be tilted towards mercy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how it looks to me and especially</v>

2667
02:10:21.541 --> 02:10:23.370
<v Speaker 5>during.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so important during the.</v>

2668
02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:28.460
<v Speaker 5>Especially the first year when children </v>
<v Speaker 5>are so unbelievably vulnerable and so I </v>

2669
02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:32.181
<v Speaker 5>think it's very difficult for women to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be merciful like that and to make the </v>

2670
02:10:32.181 --> 02:10:33.030
<v Speaker 5>shift to encouraging.</v>

2671
02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:37.910
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a very difficult thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>for people to do simultaneously.</v>

2672
02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:40.040
<v Speaker 5>Although you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2673
02:10:40.190 --> 02:10:45.190
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that women are always </v>

2674
02:10:45.190 --> 02:10:45.370
<v Speaker 5>only merciful and men are always only </v>
<v Speaker 5>encouraging disciplinarians,</v>

2675
02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:50.400
<v Speaker 5>but things do sort themselves out to </v>
<v Speaker 5>some degree like that and I think also </v>

2676
02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:54.491
<v Speaker 5>the biochemical transformations that </v>
<v Speaker 5>accompany pregnancy and childbirth and </v>

2677
02:10:54.491 --> 02:10:58.781
<v Speaker 5>lactation also tilt mother towards that </v>
<v Speaker 5>as well because he has to really love </v>

2678
02:10:58.781 --> 02:10:59.000
<v Speaker 5>that little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2679
02:10:59.001 --> 02:11:00.620
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's number one,</v>

2680
02:11:00.621 --> 02:11:05.621
<v Speaker 5>no matter what it demands and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>telling it what to do and making sure </v>

2681
02:11:05.621 --> 02:11:05.840
<v Speaker 5>it's behaving properly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

2682
02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:07.760
<v Speaker 5>that's a whole different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2683
02:11:07.790 --> 02:11:10.250
<v Speaker 5>but the kids who lacked fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2684
02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:15.880
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can find that to some degree in </v>

2685
02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:15.880
<v Speaker 5>their friends and that's often look for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the boys do in particular they,</v>

2686
02:11:15.881 --> 02:11:19.310
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go into gangs and they generate the</v>

2687
02:11:19.311 --> 02:11:21.410
<v Speaker 5>missing men masculinity in the game.</v>

2688
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:24.500
<v Speaker 5>Well that's not so good because like </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell do they know it?</v>

2689
02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:25.880
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't know anything,</v>

2690
02:11:25.881 --> 02:11:30.881
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just stupid kids and they're </v>

2691
02:11:30.881 --> 02:11:31.040
<v Speaker 5>like 15 years old and their testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 5>is pumping and they're trying to get the</v>

2692
02:11:31.041 --> 02:11:33.890
<v Speaker 5>hell away from their mother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what they're supposed to do and</v>

2693
02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:38.030
<v Speaker 5>they're not in the right position to </v>
<v Speaker 5>exercise any authority over themselves.</v>

2694
02:11:38.031 --> 02:11:41.060
<v Speaker 5>So that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can find it in education.</v>

2695
02:11:41.061 --> 02:11:42.670
<v Speaker 5>They can find it in books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can find it.</v>

2696
02:11:42.700 --> 02:11:45.470
<v Speaker 5>Movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can find it in sports heroes and so</v>

2697
02:11:45.471 --> 02:11:50.471
<v Speaker 5>forth because the image of the father is</v>
<v Speaker 5>fragmented and distributed among the </v>

2698
02:11:50.471 --> 02:11:50.900
<v Speaker 5>community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's very,</v>

2699
02:11:50.901 --> 02:11:53.800
<v Speaker 5>very difficult to not have a father.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2700
02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:55.550
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that we're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>our society,</v>

2701
02:11:55.551 --> 02:11:58.430
<v Speaker 5>which I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's absolutely appalling,</v>

2702
02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:01.940
<v Speaker 5>is that we're making the case that all </v>
<v Speaker 5>families are equal.</v>

2703
02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:03.200
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

2704
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:06.980
<v Speaker 5>no wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's no empirical data supporting</v>

2705
02:12:06.981 --> 02:12:08.120
<v Speaker 5>that proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way.</v>

2706
02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:11.600
<v Speaker 5>It's much better for kids to have two </v>
<v Speaker 5>parents who those parents are.</v>

2707
02:12:11.601 --> 02:12:16.601
<v Speaker 5>That's a whole different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if I could just to add one more </v>

2708
02:12:16.601 --> 02:12:16.730
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how would you ask that question too?</v>

2709
02:12:16.731 --> 02:12:19.160
<v Speaker 5>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A daughter who is her father because she</v>

2710
02:12:19.161 --> 02:12:24.161
<v Speaker 5>would often see how different ways to </v>
<v Speaker 5>find those fragments of her missing </v>

2711
02:12:24.161 --> 02:12:26.891
<v Speaker 5>father then like a boy wouldn't said </v>
<v Speaker 5>because obviously they're raised </v>

2712
02:12:26.891 --> 02:12:26.891
<v Speaker 5>differently or at least they should have</v>
<v Speaker 5>been.</v>

2713
02:12:26.891 --> 02:12:28.070
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the same issue.</v>

2714
02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:28.820
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2715
02:12:29.170 --> 02:12:34.170
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that another danger that </v>

2716
02:12:34.170 --> 02:12:34.170
<v Speaker 5>emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mrs Freud's of course famous observation</v>

2717
02:12:34.170 --> 02:12:34.880
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2718
02:12:34.881 --> 02:12:39.881
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there's mum and child or father and </v>

2719
02:12:39.881 --> 02:12:41.210
<v Speaker 5>child relationship can get a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>closer than it should.</v>

2720
02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:46.540
<v Speaker 5>And then the lines get blurry and mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not saying that that happens to </v>

2721
02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:46.920
<v Speaker 5>everyone obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2722
02:12:47.210 --> 02:12:50.300
<v Speaker 5>but it's still a danger that that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>inherent in the situation.</v>

2723
02:12:50.450 --> 02:12:54.470
<v Speaker 5>They're thrust together too tightly </v>
<v Speaker 5>without sufficient resources.</v>

2724
02:12:54.710 --> 02:12:57.890
<v Speaker 5>And so the responsibility has to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>distributed more and like,</v>

2725
02:12:57.891 --> 02:13:02.891
<v Speaker 5>I really do think that it's the sign of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the degeneration of the society when </v>

2726
02:13:02.891 --> 02:13:02.990
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

2727
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:07.040
<v Speaker 5>when single parenthood becomes anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>approximating the norm,</v>

2728
02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:09.470
<v Speaker 5>it's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the,</v>

2729
02:13:09.471 --> 02:13:11.090
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason I believe that,</v>

2730
02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:16.080
<v Speaker 5>and I think this has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming selfishness of,</v>

2731
02:13:16.330 --> 02:13:18.020
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of modern life,</v>

2732
02:13:18.050 --> 02:13:20.210
<v Speaker 5>is that marriage isn't for the people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who are married.</v>

2733
02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:25.010
<v Speaker 5>It's for the children obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like if you can't handle that,</v>

2734
02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:26.840
<v Speaker 5>grow the hell up Sarah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2735
02:13:26.841 --> 02:13:27.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean seriously,</v>

2736
02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:28.910
<v Speaker 7>seriously,</v>

2737
02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:33.930
<v Speaker 1>once you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have kids,</v>

2738
02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:37.430
<v Speaker 5>it is not about you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

2739
02:13:38.150 --> 02:13:40.220
<v Speaker 5>Now that doesn't mean it isn't about you</v>
<v Speaker 5>at all,</v>

2740
02:13:40.730 --> 02:13:45.730
<v Speaker 5>but it just seems so self evident to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe that anybody would even </v>

2741
02:13:46.130 --> 02:13:47.580
<v Speaker 5>would even question it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2742
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:48.800
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes.</v>

2743
02:13:48.801 --> 02:13:50.150
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm certainly aware of that.</v>

2744
02:13:50.151 --> 02:13:51.470
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's questioned.</v>

2745
02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:53.920
<v Speaker 5>It's almost illegal to question it now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2746
02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:57.860
<v Speaker 5>to to or illegal to make the set of </v>
<v Speaker 5>propositions that I'm making,</v>

2747
02:13:58.370 --> 02:14:03.090
<v Speaker 5>so that's the best I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's excellent.</v>

2748
02:14:03.091 --> 02:14:03.570
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

2749
02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:13.990
<v Speaker 8>Going to the first part of first year </v>
<v Speaker 8>lecture,</v>

2750
02:14:13.991 --> 02:14:18.991
<v Speaker 8>but it's also something that's been on </v>
<v Speaker 8>my mind listening to lectures or the </v>

2751
02:14:18.991 --> 02:14:23.640
<v Speaker 8>past few months and that's when we </v>
<v Speaker 8>talked about the psychological truth or </v>

2752
02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:27.100
<v Speaker 8>significance of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 8>To what extent does that psychological,</v>

2753
02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:32.160
<v Speaker 8>psychological truth has to be embodied </v>
<v Speaker 8>in specific historical events or people </v>

2754
02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:36.060
<v Speaker 8>and so for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the thing that's sort of been bugging on</v>

2755
02:14:36.070 --> 02:14:41.070
<v Speaker 8>my mind is there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a part that St Paul's talking </v>

2756
02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:43.920
<v Speaker 8>about in the new testament somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 8>one of his letters and he.</v>

2757
02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:46.630
<v Speaker 8>He's talking about the resurrection and </v>
<v Speaker 8>he says,</v>

2758
02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:48.690
<v Speaker 8>if it didn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then it.</v>

2759
02:14:48.910 --> 02:14:51.190
<v Speaker 8>This whole thing is just meaning the </v>
<v Speaker 8>faith is meaningless.</v>

2760
02:14:51.710 --> 02:14:56.710
<v Speaker 8>Like for him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there had to be that embodiment of that </v>

2761
02:14:56.710 --> 02:14:56.710
<v Speaker 8>historical person or event in that case.</v>

2762
02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:01.940
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the best answer I have to that at the </v>

2763
02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:04.551
<v Speaker 5>moment is that I'm really happy that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>not at that point yet in this lecture </v>

2764
02:15:04.551 --> 02:15:07.881
<v Speaker 5>series because I know because that is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>crucial issue there and I don't know </v>

2765
02:15:10.471 --> 02:15:15.240
<v Speaker 5>exactly what to make of it and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>approach at the moment as I said,</v>

2766
02:15:15.241 --> 02:15:18.810
<v Speaker 5>is to approach this as rationally as I </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibly can and I hope I know a hell of</v>

2767
02:15:18.811 --> 02:15:23.340
<v Speaker 5>a lot more about what I'm doing by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time I get to that particular question.</v>

2768
02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:25.680
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

2769
02:15:25.681 --> 02:15:29.160
<v Speaker 5>I do have the beginnings of ways to </v>
<v Speaker 5>answer that,</v>

2770
02:15:29.161 --> 02:15:34.161
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not going to answer that at all </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now because it's so bloody </v>

2771
02:15:34.161 --> 02:15:38.151
<v Speaker 5>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would just burn me to a frazzle and </v>

2772
02:15:38.151 --> 02:15:38.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm already mostly bird to a frazzle </v>
<v Speaker 5>after that lecture.</v>

2773
02:15:38.281 --> 02:15:43.281
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't attempt to even start to </v>

2774
02:15:43.281 --> 02:15:43.281
<v Speaker 5>sketch it out.</v>

2775
02:15:43.281 --> 02:15:43.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2776
02:15:43.710 --> 02:15:46.740
<v Speaker 5>part of it is to be just rational about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2777
02:15:46.741 --> 02:15:51.741
<v Speaker 5>just to be rational about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is something about the idea that </v>

2778
02:15:51.741 --> 02:15:55.401
<v Speaker 5>continual death and rebirth is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessary precondition to proper human </v>

2779
02:15:55.401 --> 02:15:58.761
<v Speaker 5>adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like every time you learn something new </v>

2780
02:15:58.761 --> 02:16:01.461
<v Speaker 5>that's important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the stupid old you has to die </v>

2781
02:16:01.461 --> 02:16:05.900
<v Speaker 5>and sometimes that can be an awful lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of you and in fact in can be so much of </v>

2782
02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:06.120
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you just die,</v>

2783
02:16:06.490 --> 02:16:07.830
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just can't handle it.</v>

2784
02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:13.100
<v Speaker 5>And so there is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a real idea that you have to </v>

2785
02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:15.750
<v Speaker 5>identify with the part of yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 5>transcends your current personality that</v>

2786
02:16:15.751 --> 02:16:18.390
<v Speaker 5>can constantly die and be reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

2787
02:16:18.391 --> 02:16:19.260
<v Speaker 5>Then I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2788
02:16:19.261 --> 02:16:24.261
<v Speaker 5>that means that all of this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological and symbolic and that's </v>

2789
02:16:24.261 --> 02:16:28.611
<v Speaker 5>the simplest answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm not satisfied with that answer </v>

2790
02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:34.020
<v Speaker 5>even though I think it's coherent and </v>
<v Speaker 5>complete because the world's a very </v>

2791
02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:35.590
<v Speaker 5>weird place and there are things about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it that we don't understand.</v>

2792
02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:37.690
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>

2793
02:16:37.691 --> 02:16:42.691
<v Speaker 5>I can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't go any farther than that at the </v>

2794
02:16:42.691 --> 02:16:42.691
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that.</v>

2795
02:16:42.691 --> 02:16:42.691
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

2796
02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:49.210
<v Speaker 9>I got to Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2797
02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:54.720
<v Speaker 9>I just recently watched one of your </v>
<v Speaker 9>videos of you debating with </v>

2798
02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:58.420
<v Speaker 9>transgendered protesters at uft,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a free speech rally in October.</v>

2799
02:16:58.870 --> 02:17:02.680
<v Speaker 9>And one of the protesters,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one of the comments,</v>

2800
02:17:02.681 --> 02:17:06.370
<v Speaker 9>one of the protests are said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which was in particularly very,</v>

2801
02:17:06.450 --> 02:17:07.750
<v Speaker 9>very chilling,</v>
<v Speaker 9>was,</v>

2802
02:17:07.751 --> 02:17:12.751
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>why do you have the right to determine </v>

2803
02:17:12.751 --> 02:17:14.230
<v Speaker 9>whether an individual is worthy of you </v>
<v Speaker 9>using their pronouns?</v>

2804
02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:19.260
<v Speaker 9>I'm the scary thing to me is how common </v>
<v Speaker 9>this type of view is among radical left </v>

2805
02:17:19.871 --> 02:17:24.871
<v Speaker 9>wing protesters on university campuses </v>
<v Speaker 9>who feel they have the right to tell </v>

2806
02:17:24.871 --> 02:17:28.831
<v Speaker 9>other people what they can think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what words they can use and what </v>

2807
02:17:29.111 --> 02:17:32.580
<v Speaker 9>speakers they can or cannot listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2808
02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:38.040
<v Speaker 9>the scarier part is that our government </v>
<v Speaker 9>is creating legislation to backup their </v>

2809
02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:39.460
<v Speaker 9>Adl ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2810
02:17:39.461 --> 02:17:44.461
<v Speaker 9>which is evident through bill.</v>
<v Speaker 9>See 16 and one slash three and bill 89.</v>

2811
02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:49.870
<v Speaker 9>So my question is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what do you think the end game is in all</v>

2812
02:17:49.871 --> 02:17:52.870
<v Speaker 9>of this because it seems every year or </v>
<v Speaker 9>we're</v>

2813
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:55.700
<v Speaker 5>in the process of finding that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2814
02:17:55.710 --> 02:17:57.050
<v Speaker 5>and I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

2815
02:17:58.570 --> 02:18:00.430
<v Speaker 5>We're in the process of finding that </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2816
02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:01.900
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2817
02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:07.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the end game that underlies all </v>

2818
02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:07.990
<v Speaker 5>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my estimation,</v>

2819
02:18:07.991 --> 02:18:12.991
<v Speaker 5>is best summed up by Jacques Derrida's </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christian or her criticism of Western </v>

2820
02:18:13.211 --> 02:18:16.090
<v Speaker 5>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fell logo centric.</v>

2821
02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:18.370
<v Speaker 5>Now we've already talked about what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>logos means,</v>

2822
02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:19.750
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

2823
02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:21.850
<v Speaker 5>and so for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for decorative,</v>

2824
02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:24.380
<v Speaker 5>that was a sign of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's after a,</v>

2825
02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:26.410
<v Speaker 5>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>utter despair,</v>

2826
02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:30.520
<v Speaker 5>the utterly despicable dominant nature </v>
<v Speaker 5>of western culture.</v>

2827
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.980
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2828
02:18:31.981 --> 02:18:36.981
<v Speaker 5>that's what animates the postmodernists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they may not know that because I </v>

2829
02:18:37.211 --> 02:18:41.170
<v Speaker 5>need the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets fragmented across its adherence and</v>

2830
02:18:41.171 --> 02:18:46.171
<v Speaker 5>then it only access the coherent </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideology wouldn't hold those adherence </v>

2831
02:18:46.171 --> 02:18:47.800
<v Speaker 5>come together in a mall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you see the animating spirit.</v>

2832
02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:53.340
<v Speaker 5>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that there's a battle going on </v>

2833
02:18:53.681 --> 02:18:57.480
<v Speaker 5>that's a battle exactly at the level </v>
<v Speaker 5>that Derrida described,</v>

2834
02:18:57.510 --> 02:19:01.030
<v Speaker 5>and that's a theological battle with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophical,</v>

2835
02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:03.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a,</v>

2836
02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:08.280
<v Speaker 5>with a philosophical implications and </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of those philosophical implications,</v>

2837
02:19:09.130 --> 02:19:14.130
<v Speaker 5>political implications,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not primarily political and </v>

2838
02:19:14.130 --> 02:19:15.340
<v Speaker 5>it's not primarily philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's deeper than that.</v>

2839
02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:20.760
<v Speaker 5>And the postmodernist out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their criticism was designed to be </v>

2840
02:19:21.970 --> 02:19:26.970
<v Speaker 5>fundamental and it also emerged out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Marxism and let's not forget that the </v>

2841
02:19:26.970 --> 02:19:31.741
<v Speaker 5>Marxist criticism was not only </v>
<v Speaker 5>fundamental but just about resulted in </v>

2842
02:19:31.741 --> 02:19:35.651
<v Speaker 5>the nuclear annihilation of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are not trivial issues and we're </v>

2843
02:19:35.651 --> 02:19:39.461
<v Speaker 5>back in the same insane boat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what do I think should be done </v>

2844
02:19:40.161 --> 02:19:41.540
<v Speaker 5>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2845
02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:46.840
<v Speaker 5>I thought about that way before any of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this happened and I think that what we </v>

2846
02:19:47.061 --> 02:19:52.061
<v Speaker 5>should do about it is we should tell the</v>
<v Speaker 5>truth because there isn't anything more </v>

2847
02:19:52.061 --> 02:19:56.381
<v Speaker 5>powerful than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the right theological answer </v>

2848
02:19:56.381 --> 02:19:59.240
<v Speaker 5>because the spoken truth brings good </v>
<v Speaker 5>into Ba.</v>

2849
02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:03.400
<v Speaker 5>While that's the foul logo centric idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've,</v>

2850
02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:08.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to revisit that to explain to</v>
<v Speaker 5>people what it means and to see if they </v>

2851
02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:12.700
<v Speaker 5>think that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what we have to figure out</v>

2852
02:20:12.701 --> 02:20:17.701
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that an idea worth adhering to or </v>

2853
02:20:17.701 --> 02:20:20.221
<v Speaker 5>not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The alternative is the see for the </v>

2854
02:20:20.221 --> 02:20:24.661
<v Speaker 5>postmodernists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The world is that landscape of pyramids </v>

2855
02:20:24.661 --> 02:20:28.230
<v Speaker 5>that I described,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's no transcendent vision </v>

2856
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:31.981
<v Speaker 5>that's over above that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all of those pyramids are equally </v>

2857
02:20:31.981 --> 02:20:34.150
<v Speaker 5>valid and it's a war of everyone against</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone.</v>

2858
02:20:34.450 --> 02:20:36.790
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the nightmare of Hobbs,</v>

2859
02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:37.950
<v Speaker 5>Thomas Hobbes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>excepted.</v>

2860
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:39.580
<v Speaker 5>It's not individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's groups.</v>

2861
02:20:39.970 --> 02:20:43.180
<v Speaker 5>And everyone said group your group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your whatever your group is.</v>

2862
02:20:43.181 --> 02:20:46.090
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's death as far as I'm concerned.</v>

2863
02:20:46.450 --> 02:20:47.290
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2864
02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:50.230
<v Speaker 5>it's utterly reprehensible</v>

2865
02:20:50.930 --> 02:20:51.350
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2866
02:20:52.570 --> 02:20:57.570
<v Speaker 5>and we better sorted out because if we </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't sort it out we are bloody well </v>

2867
02:20:57.570 --> 02:20:59.140
<v Speaker 5>going to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So thank you.</v>

2868
02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:07.200
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how's it going?</v>

2869
02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:09.870
<v Speaker 8>I just want to say thank you for doing </v>
<v Speaker 8>all this.</v>

2870
02:21:09.871 --> 02:21:10.460
<v Speaker 8>And I really.</v>

2871
02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:12.580
<v Speaker 5>That was bob and Doug Mackenzie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2872
02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:13.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2873
02:21:13.301 --> 02:21:16.030
<v Speaker 5>how's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad you caught that.</v>

2874
02:21:16.031 --> 02:21:16.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2875
02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:18.600
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew the facebook</v>

2876
02:21:18.650 --> 02:21:22.290
<v Speaker 8>pull some people who are familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 8>your work and uh,</v>

2877
02:21:22.291 --> 02:21:25.870
<v Speaker 8>a question kind of rose to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like just right out of the blue.</v>

2878
02:21:25.871 --> 02:21:27.700
<v Speaker 8>It was spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>

2879
02:21:27.980 --> 02:21:29.810
<v Speaker 8>what it was you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you didn't really touch it here.</v>

2880
02:21:30.210 --> 02:21:35.210
<v Speaker 8>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you touched a little bit in your </v>

2881
02:21:35.210 --> 02:21:36.431
<v Speaker 8>lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was about integrating the shadow and </v>

2882
02:21:36.431 --> 02:21:38.810
<v Speaker 8>one of the main questions was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how does one go about that?</v>

2883
02:21:38.811 --> 02:21:40.490
<v Speaker 8>Especially in the modern world?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2884
02:21:40.491 --> 02:21:41.250
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2885
02:21:41.630 --> 02:21:44.990
<v Speaker 8>usually sheltered from anything </v>
<v Speaker 8>resembling that kind of concept.</v>

2886
02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:47.600
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we don't engage like the unknown.</v>

2887
02:21:47.601 --> 02:21:50.600
<v Speaker 8>We don't come into life or death </v>
<v Speaker 8>situations.</v>

2888
02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:53.210
<v Speaker 8>Most of us actually work is like an </v>
<v Speaker 8>ambulance,</v>

2889
02:21:53.230 --> 02:21:54.270
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

2890
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:56.390
<v Speaker 5>well that's one thing you can do </v>
<v Speaker 5>without,</v>

2891
02:21:56.450 --> 02:21:58.740
<v Speaker 5>is the one thing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2892
02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:03.840
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can search out experiences that put </v>

2893
02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:06.280
<v Speaker 5>you there because while you can do that </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a volunteer for example,</v>

2894
02:22:06.281 --> 02:22:07.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can.</v>

2895
02:22:07.810 --> 02:22:11.290
<v Speaker 5>One of the things I saw once I was in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Montreal,</v>

2896
02:22:11.291 --> 02:22:13.750
<v Speaker 5>I was in this outdoor mall in Montreal </v>
<v Speaker 5>on Saint Hubert.</v>

2897
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:17.470
<v Speaker 5>And I saw this great big 17 year old </v>
<v Speaker 5>kid,</v>

2898
02:22:17.471 --> 02:22:18.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

2899
02:22:19.140 --> 02:22:23.030
<v Speaker 5>he had a Mohawk and he was dressed in </v>
<v Speaker 5>leather and studs and like he,</v>

2900
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:24.220
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

2901
02:22:24.221 --> 02:22:29.221
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was doing modern barbarian thing and </v>

2902
02:22:29.221 --> 02:22:30.330
<v Speaker 5>he had it really down and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his standing in the corner with two pink</v>

2903
02:22:30.331 --> 02:22:33.870
<v Speaker 5>shopping bags.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was looking at him and I thought,</v>

2904
02:22:33.930 --> 02:22:35.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if someone offered him the,</v>

2905
02:22:35.690 --> 02:22:40.690
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the opportunity to drop those God damn </v>

2906
02:22:40.690 --> 02:22:42.810
<v Speaker 5>sleeping bags or shopping bags and go </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight with Isis.</v>

2907
02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:44.880
<v Speaker 5>He'd be there in a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2908
02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:50.600
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because what the hell is some monster </v>

2909
02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:52.581
<v Speaker 5>like that doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>standing on the corner of St Hubert </v>

2910
02:22:52.581 --> 02:22:52.581
<v Speaker 5>holding two pink shopping bags.</v>

2911
02:22:53.810 --> 02:22:56.470
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so some of it is that you need the,</v>

2912
02:22:56.471 --> 02:23:01.471
<v Speaker 5>you need to find out where you can push,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you need to find out that edge </v>

2913
02:23:01.471 --> 02:23:04.200
<v Speaker 5>that you can push yourself against it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be different for different</v>

2914
02:23:04.201 --> 02:23:05.570
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's,</v>

2915
02:23:05.610 --> 02:23:08.820
<v Speaker 5>there's the call to adventure and </v>
<v Speaker 5>heroism in the EU.</v>

2916
02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:12.150
<v Speaker 5>There are life and death situations </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere around you.</v>

2917
02:23:12.151 --> 02:23:14.590
<v Speaker 5>If you want to involve yourself in them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2918
02:23:14.890 --> 02:23:19.890
<v Speaker 5>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sometimes that might be like two to </v>

2919
02:23:19.890 --> 02:23:21.540
<v Speaker 5>put yourself together to the degree that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can say physically or spiritually or</v>

2920
02:23:21.541 --> 02:23:23.490
<v Speaker 5>intellectually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could be an intellectual battle.</v>

2921
02:23:23.491 --> 02:23:27.270
<v Speaker 5>It could be a moral battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the frontier is everywhere.</v>

2922
02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:31.170
<v Speaker 5>The frontier is just the edge between </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you know and what you don't know.</v>

2923
02:23:31.171 --> 02:23:36.171
<v Speaker 5>You want to put yourself on that damn </v>
<v Speaker 5>edge and make yourself into something </v>

2924
02:23:36.171 --> 02:23:38.300
<v Speaker 5>and you can retreat into comfort in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>modern world.</v>

2925
02:23:38.390 --> 02:23:40.540
<v Speaker 5>And I think that is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2926
02:23:40.541 --> 02:23:41.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've noticed that,</v>

2927
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:47.590
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the pathologies of wealth I </v>

2928
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:50.121
<v Speaker 5>would say because one of the problems </v>
<v Speaker 5>with being relatively wealthy if you're </v>

2929
02:23:50.121 --> 02:23:52.710
<v Speaker 5>a parent is that you cannot provide your</v>
<v Speaker 5>children with necessity and that's a big</v>

2930
02:23:52.711 --> 02:23:56.140
<v Speaker 5>problem because they need necessity to </v>
<v Speaker 5>call them into being.</v>

2931
02:23:56.460 --> 02:24:01.300
<v Speaker 5>And we know if you don't have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>material resources and your children ask</v>

2932
02:24:01.301 --> 02:24:04.290
<v Speaker 5>you for something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can say no because no is the answer.</v>

2933
02:24:04.291 --> 02:24:04.830
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2934
02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:07.470
<v Speaker 5>we can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you can say yes,</v>

2935
02:24:07.471 --> 02:24:10.440
<v Speaker 5>then it's really hard to say no because </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're just arbitrary.</v>

2936
02:24:10.890 --> 02:24:11.880
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2937
02:24:12.090 --> 02:24:13.410
<v Speaker 5>It's like character guard said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2938
02:24:13.411 --> 02:24:18.411
<v Speaker 5>there will come a time when we have so </v>
<v Speaker 5>much security and comfort that what </v>

2939
02:24:18.411 --> 02:24:20.340
<v Speaker 5>we'll want more than anything else is </v>
<v Speaker 5>deprivation and challenge.</v>

2940
02:24:20.700 --> 02:24:25.700
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's particularly what young </v>

2941
02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:27.330
<v Speaker 5>men want now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that that's partly because young</v>

2942
02:24:27.331 --> 02:24:32.331
<v Speaker 5>women there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're stuck without anyways because </v>

2943
02:24:32.331 --> 02:24:32.331
<v Speaker 5>they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2944
02:24:32.331 --> 02:24:36.461
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the necessity of living in the </v>

2945
02:24:36.461 --> 02:24:38.721
<v Speaker 5>world and the responsibility of infant </v>
<v Speaker 5>care in particular like that occupies </v>

2946
02:24:39.241 --> 02:24:41.190
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Men have to do it voluntarily.</v>

2947
02:24:41.850 --> 02:24:43.740
<v Speaker 5>Women now too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the birth control pill.</v>

2948
02:24:43.741 --> 02:24:45.810
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's 30 years ago.</v>

2949
02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:47.600
<v Speaker 5>We hardly have to talk about that at all</v>
<v Speaker 5>yet.</v>

2950
02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:50.130
<v Speaker 5>So it's just so much.</v>

2951
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2952
02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:57.820
<v Speaker 4>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Peterson.</v>

2953
02:24:57.821 --> 02:25:00.100
<v Speaker 4>So I'm actually a Coptic Orthodox and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Egyptian.</v>

2954
02:25:00.101 --> 02:25:02.410
<v Speaker 4>So I found your talk today incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

2955
02:25:02.830 --> 02:25:07.830
<v Speaker 4>I've also taken a deep interest in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>early church fathers and as you you're </v>

2956
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:10.581
<v Speaker 4>talking about hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Harken back to St Athanasius in the </v>

2957
02:25:10.581 --> 02:25:13.420
<v Speaker 4>idea of theosis that you brought up last</v>
<v Speaker 4>time that God became man so that man can</v>

2958
02:25:13.421 --> 02:25:15.790
<v Speaker 4>become like God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was thinking about this in terms of</v>

2959
02:25:15.791 --> 02:25:19.180
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchies and is that an example </v>
<v Speaker 4>of how the top of the pyramid,</v>

2960
02:25:19.181 --> 02:25:23.590
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchy sort of gets inverted or </v>
<v Speaker 4>descends to the bottom and brings it up</v>

2961
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:26.090
<v Speaker 5>to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that sort of an attraction to,</v>

2962
02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:29.140
<v Speaker 5>of Christianity that's sort of make </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christiana such a powerful idea.</v>

2963
02:25:29.141 --> 02:25:31.030
<v Speaker 5>What are your thoughts on that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2964
02:25:31.031 --> 02:25:31.990
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it certainly one of the.</v>

2965
02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:34.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it certainly one of the things that made</v>

2966
02:25:34.450 --> 02:25:38.350
<v Speaker 5>not just Christianity a powerful idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>because one of the things that happened,</v>

2967
02:25:38.351 --> 02:25:41.260
<v Speaker 5>this was called the democratization of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus,</v>

2968
02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:44.110
<v Speaker 5>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what happened,</v>

2969
02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:47.800
<v Speaker 5>see if I can answer this question using </v>
<v Speaker 5>this approach for a sec.</v>

2970
02:25:47.801 --> 02:25:48.580
<v Speaker 5>Is that to work?</v>

2971
02:25:59.730 --> 02:26:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2972
02:26:02.490 --> 02:26:04.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I can answer that </v>
<v Speaker 5>question that way.</v>

2973
02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:05.610
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2974
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:08.670
<v Speaker 5>the part of the attraction of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christianity.</v>

2975
02:26:08.671 --> 02:26:13.671
<v Speaker 5>But this was something that emerged </v>
<v Speaker 5>across time was the notion that even if </v>

2976
02:26:13.671 --> 02:26:17.631
<v Speaker 5>you were in a lowly position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there was something about you that </v>

2977
02:26:17.631 --> 02:26:18.870
<v Speaker 5>was akin to the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now you might say,</v>

2978
02:26:18.871 --> 02:26:20.220
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just wish fulfillment.</v>

2979
02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:22.380
<v Speaker 5>That's what Freud would say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what Marx would say.</v>

2980
02:26:22.381 --> 02:26:23.790
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The opiate of the masses.</v>

2981
02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:26.250
<v Speaker 5>I tweeted yesterday something I thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>was pretty funny,</v>

2982
02:26:26.251 --> 02:26:27.500
<v Speaker 5>which was that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2983
02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:30.480
<v Speaker 5>like religion was the opiate of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>masses.</v>

2984
02:26:30.481 --> 02:26:33.030
<v Speaker 5>But that Marxism with the meth </v>
<v Speaker 5>amphetamine,</v>

2985
02:26:33.031 --> 02:26:35.220
<v Speaker 5>if the Max of the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2986
02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:39.230
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I think the attraction was that it,</v>

2987
02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:40.100
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2988
02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:44.280
<v Speaker 5>it allowed people to recognize their </v>
<v Speaker 5>intrinsic dignity.</v>

2989
02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:49.400
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things I'd been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about is the juxtaposition between </v>

2990
02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:49.470
<v Speaker 5>genesis one and genesis two.</v>

2991
02:26:49.470 --> 02:26:52.710
<v Speaker 5>Because what happens in genesis two is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that human beings collapse and fall,</v>

2992
02:26:53.010 --> 02:26:58.010
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then were these fallen creatures </v>

2993
02:26:58.010 --> 02:26:58.010
<v Speaker 5>that no evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in,</v>

2994
02:26:58.010 --> 02:26:58.290
<v Speaker 5>in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in genesis one,</v>

2995
02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:00.630
<v Speaker 5>it's really an optimistic story because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it says,</v>

2996
02:27:00.631 --> 02:27:05.631
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the sorts of creatures that </v>

2997
02:27:05.631 --> 02:27:05.631
<v Speaker 5>partake in the calling forth of being </v>
<v Speaker 5>from chaos?</v>

2998
02:27:05.631 --> 02:27:07.830
<v Speaker 5>And that's in our essential nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And to some degree,</v>

2999
02:27:07.831 --> 02:27:10.110
<v Speaker 5>if you juxtapose both of those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it says,</v>

3000
02:27:10.111 --> 02:27:15.111
<v Speaker 5>if that's the entire biblical story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ram together in the first two chapters,</v>

3001
02:27:15.181 --> 02:27:17.430
<v Speaker 5>which is partly why we're taking so long</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get through this.</v>

3002
02:27:17.431 --> 02:27:22.431
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that to there to return to genesis </v>

3003
02:27:22.431 --> 02:27:25.881
<v Speaker 5>one is the antidote to genesis two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to continue to act out the doctrine </v>

3004
02:27:26.431 --> 02:27:30.210
<v Speaker 5>that you're made in God's image.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that means that you're,</v>

3005
02:27:30.350 --> 02:27:34.860
<v Speaker 5>you're capable of speaking good being </v>
<v Speaker 5>into existence through truth.</v>

3006
02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:37.080
<v Speaker 5>And that that's also the antidote to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fall,</v>

3007
02:27:37.081 --> 02:27:42.081
<v Speaker 5>which I think is actually the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fundamental narrative message of the </v>

3008
02:27:42.081 --> 02:27:44.550
<v Speaker 5>entire biblical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I also think of Western civilization</v>

3009
02:27:44.551 --> 02:27:48.180
<v Speaker 5>for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a nobility,</v>

3010
02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:53.300
<v Speaker 5>and this is also why think Nietzsche was</v>
<v Speaker 5>fundamentally wrong in his criticism of </v>

3011
02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:54.210
<v Speaker 5>Christianity because he thought about it</v>
<v Speaker 5>as slave morality.</v>

3012
02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:57.210
<v Speaker 5>The vengeance of the bottom against the </v>
<v Speaker 5>top,</v>

3013
02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:02.940
<v Speaker 5>that's more historical than theological.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it gives dignity it,</v>

3014
02:28:03.010 --> 02:28:07.180
<v Speaker 5>it illuminates the dignity of the human </v>
<v Speaker 5>being and,</v>

3015
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:11.910
<v Speaker 5>and it requires responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not just wish fulfillment.</v>

3016
02:28:11.911 --> 02:28:14.440
<v Speaker 5>It's not Friday and wish fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Freudian theory,</v>

3017
02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:18.430
<v Speaker 5>which I thought about a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is not tenable in my estimation.</v>

3018
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:21.650
<v Speaker 5>It also doesn't account for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>existence of hell because it's only wish</v>

3019
02:28:21.651 --> 02:28:23.810
<v Speaker 5>fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why bother with hell?</v>

3020
02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:29.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a lot more if you're really going </v>

3021
02:28:29.380 --> 02:28:31.431
<v Speaker 5>to just fulfill a wish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like everybody gets to go to </v>

3022
02:28:31.431 --> 02:28:31.431
<v Speaker 5>heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no matter what they do,</v>

3023
02:28:31.431 --> 02:28:32.390
<v Speaker 5>you don't have hell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was of course something absolutely</v>

3024
02:28:32.391 --> 02:28:37.391
<v Speaker 5>terrifying to medieval Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then to plenty of people now for </v>

3025
02:28:37.391 --> 02:28:39.980
<v Speaker 5>that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's the nobility.</v>

3026
02:28:39.981 --> 02:28:44.981
<v Speaker 5>It's the idea of the nobility that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think steeply attractive to people and </v>

3027
02:28:44.981 --> 02:28:45.200
<v Speaker 5>that's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3028
02:28:45.860 --> 02:28:48.130
<v Speaker 5>what do you have to fight against your </v>
<v Speaker 5>worm?</v>

3029
02:28:48.131 --> 02:28:53.131
<v Speaker 5>Like fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mortal existence is the possibility of </v>

3030
02:28:53.131 --> 02:28:56.340
<v Speaker 5>transcending that with nobility of </v>
<v Speaker 5>speech and act.</v>

3031
02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:01.600
<v Speaker 5>That's what you have and who can hear </v>
<v Speaker 5>that without feeling ennoble by that.</v>

3032
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:03.800
<v Speaker 5>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3033
02:29:03.860 --> 02:29:05.090
<v Speaker 5>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3034
02:29:05.091 --> 02:29:07.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't bear the responsibility.</v>

3035
02:29:07.221 --> 02:29:07.700
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3036
02:29:07.701 --> 02:29:08.480
<v Speaker 5>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3037
02:29:08.481 --> 02:29:09.600
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

3038
02:29:09.980 --> 02:29:14.980
<v Speaker 5>that's a reasonable criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the consequences of not bearing the </v>

3039
02:29:14.980 --> 02:29:16.640
<v Speaker 5>responsibility is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's help really.</v>

3040
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.350
<v Speaker 5>So thank you.</v>

3041
02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:26.590
<v Speaker 10>And thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 10>If you had told him,</v>

3042
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:29.150
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know if you're familiar with the</v>

3043
02:29:29.151 --> 02:29:30.840
<v Speaker 10>works of Nassim Taleb,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm,</v>

3044
02:29:31.210 --> 02:29:36.210
<v Speaker 10>I'm reasonably familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so I think it's fair to say that he has,</v>

3045
02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:42.760
<v Speaker 10>he talks about the idea that people in </v>
<v Speaker 10>especially modern people have a failure </v>

3046
02:29:43.551 --> 02:29:48.260
<v Speaker 10>to recognize the unknown's unknowns as </v>
<v Speaker 10>such.</v>

3047
02:29:48.390 --> 02:29:49.230
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3048
02:29:49.530 --> 02:29:54.530
<v Speaker 5>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you move the mic up a bit so that </v>

3049
02:29:54.530 --> 02:29:54.530
<v Speaker 5>people can hear you a little better?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>

3050
02:29:54.530 --> 02:29:55.310
<v Speaker 10>Can you?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yes.</v>

3051
02:29:55.810 --> 02:29:58.310
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>well I was wondering,</v>

3052
02:29:58.580 --> 02:30:03.580
<v Speaker 10>do you think that that failure might,</v>
<v Speaker 10>might be in some way related to the way </v>

3053
02:30:05.391 --> 02:30:09.620
<v Speaker 10>that people fail to relate to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 10>of God,</v>

3054
02:30:10.130 --> 02:30:15.130
<v Speaker 10>so in the sense that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>people can't really grappled with the,</v>

3055
02:30:18.270 --> 02:30:21.260
<v Speaker 10>the notion of God either you that as </v>
<v Speaker 10>much as you can give a rational argument</v>

3056
02:30:21.261 --> 02:30:26.261
<v Speaker 10>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you can't feel God in the way that </v>

3057
02:30:26.261 --> 02:30:27.770
<v Speaker 10>perhaps a more religious person or more,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm an older person,</v>

3058
02:30:27.771 --> 02:30:32.771
<v Speaker 10>might have felt God.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Do you think that that inability to </v>

3059
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:37.820
<v Speaker 10>recognize the unknown unknowns might </v>
<v Speaker 10>play into that?</v>

3060
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.110
<v Speaker 10>No.</v>

3061
02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:41.390
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that seems to be related to this idea</v>

3062
02:30:41.391 --> 02:30:44.600
<v Speaker 5>of the absence of necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So something like that.</v>

3063
02:30:44.601 --> 02:30:47.990
<v Speaker 5>Is that because I think that I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that what you're,</v>

3064
02:30:48.060 --> 02:30:51.380
<v Speaker 5>you're making a claim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe tell me if I've got it wrong,</v>

3065
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:55.460
<v Speaker 5>that if you're sheltered too much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it,</v>

3066
02:30:55.480 --> 02:31:00.480
<v Speaker 5>it also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it also separates you from anything </v>

3067
02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:03.581
<v Speaker 5>that's divine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess that might be right because </v>

3068
02:31:03.581 --> 02:31:03.581
<v Speaker 5>there's not enough intensity of </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience at something like that.</v>

3069
02:31:03.581 --> 02:31:04.750
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that part of the.</v>

3070
02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:05.930
<v Speaker 5>Is that part of the issue?</v>

3071
02:31:06.250 --> 02:31:08.460
<v Speaker 10>It might be more related to the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

3072
02:31:09.300 --> 02:31:13.980
<v Speaker 10>like realizing the absolute infinitude </v>
<v Speaker 10>of what you don't know,</v>

3073
02:31:14.010 --> 02:31:16.230
<v Speaker 10>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like the mysterium tremendum that,</v>

3074
02:31:16.390 --> 02:31:18.410
<v Speaker 10>that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

3075
02:31:18.450 --> 02:31:20.220
<v Speaker 10>if you believe through statistical</v>

3076
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:22.680
<v Speaker 5>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get everything under control and</v>

3077
02:31:22.730 --> 02:31:25.400
<v Speaker 5>you genuinely believe that at some point</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll get into a wonder,</v>

3078
02:31:25.470 --> 02:31:27.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

3079
02:31:27.721 --> 02:31:28.290
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3080
02:31:28.291 --> 02:31:29.880
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's also,</v>

3081
02:31:29.881 --> 02:31:34.881
<v Speaker 5>I think part of the danger of </v>
<v Speaker 5>rationality that the Catholics have been</v>

3082
02:31:35.521 --> 02:31:40.521
<v Speaker 5>implicitly warning against for forever </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that rather the rational mind tends </v>

3083
02:31:40.521 --> 02:31:44.070
<v Speaker 5>to fall in love with its own productions</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then to worship them as absolutes,</v>

3084
02:31:44.310 --> 02:31:49.310
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what Milton was trying to </v>

3085
02:31:49.310 --> 02:31:49.310
<v Speaker 5>represent by his satanic figure in </v>
<v Speaker 5>paradise lost.</v>

3086
02:31:49.380 --> 02:31:54.380
<v Speaker 5>I think of that as like a precursor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a prophetic precursor to the emergence </v>

3087
02:31:54.380 --> 02:31:54.930
<v Speaker 5>of totalitarian states in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

3088
02:31:55.170 --> 02:32:00.170
<v Speaker 5>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that you can believe that what </v>

3089
02:32:00.170 --> 02:32:03.810
<v Speaker 5>you know is sufficient to banish </v>
<v Speaker 5>permanently what you don't know.</v>

3090
02:32:03.930 --> 02:32:06.870
<v Speaker 5>And I do think that that does </v>
<v Speaker 5>paradoxically,</v>

3091
02:32:06.871 --> 02:32:08.670
<v Speaker 5>although you'd think that that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>make you secure.</v>

3092
02:32:08.671 --> 02:32:10.980
<v Speaker 5>It also does destroy your relationship </v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

3093
02:32:11.310 --> 02:32:12.180
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

3094
02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:15.060
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with his spirit that might help you deal</v>

3095
02:32:15.061 --> 02:32:18.510
<v Speaker 5>with what it is that you really don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know with the unknown unknowns.</v>

3096
02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:23.780
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we don't know to what degree </v>

3097
02:32:23.780 --> 02:32:26.661
<v Speaker 5>extreme experience is necessary to bring</v>
<v Speaker 5>forth extreme experience,</v>

3098
02:32:27.361 --> 02:32:32.361
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you have to be through before </v>

3099
02:32:32.361 --> 02:32:32.361
<v Speaker 5>you encounter a religious revelation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or people might say,</v>

3100
02:32:32.361 --> 02:32:34.020
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't because there's no such thing.</v>

3101
02:32:34.021 --> 02:32:34.860
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3102
02:32:34.861 --> 02:32:36.990
<v Speaker 5>don't be so sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3103
02:32:36.991 --> 02:32:38.700
<v Speaker 5>people have reported them throughout </v>
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

3104
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:41.040
<v Speaker 5>but they don't generally occur when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

3105
02:32:41.180 --> 02:32:46.180
<v Speaker 5>that's my favorite trope when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating cheeses and playing on playing </v>

3106
02:32:46.180 --> 02:32:46.650
<v Speaker 5>Mario brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3107
02:32:48.050 --> 02:32:49.230
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3108
02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:52.590
<v Speaker 5>so that's the best I can do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you very much.</v>

3109
02:32:58.270 --> 02:33:00.940
<v Speaker 6>This has to be the last question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll make it quick.</v>

3110
02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:01.490
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3111
02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:05.270
<v Speaker 6>earlier when you talked about </v>
<v Speaker 6>criminality and creativity trends in,</v>

3112
02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:08.890
<v Speaker 6>in men peaking at 14,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it reminded me of something you said.</v>

3113
02:33:08.891 --> 02:33:13.891
<v Speaker 6>I think it was Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking with sjws and kind of in how</v>

3114
02:33:14.381 --> 02:33:19.381
<v Speaker 6>they create their own chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Talking about how adolescents have this </v>

3115
02:33:19.381 --> 02:33:20.140
<v Speaker 6>drive to change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was wondering if,</v>

3116
02:33:20.170 --> 02:33:21.640
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if those three,</v>

3117
02:33:21.641 --> 02:33:24.940
<v Speaker 6>the criminality,</v>
<v Speaker 6>creativity drive to change the world are</v>

3118
02:33:24.941 --> 02:33:26.380
<v Speaker 6>linked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if so,</v>

3119
02:33:26.381 --> 02:33:31.381
<v Speaker 6>if they manifest differently in men and </v>
<v Speaker 6>women and if they kind have come from </v>

3120
02:33:31.391 --> 02:33:31.730
<v Speaker 6>the same.</v>

3121
02:33:31.810 --> 02:33:33.200
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they are linked,</v>

3122
02:33:33.980 --> 02:33:36.800
<v Speaker 5>but I'm going to concentrate more on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>second part of your question.</v>

3123
02:33:36.980 --> 02:33:39.560
<v Speaker 5>So I'm going to ask you guys to think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about something.</v>

3124
02:33:39.561 --> 02:33:41.330
<v Speaker 5>So I talked to a friend of mine the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other day.</v>

3125
02:33:41.390 --> 02:33:46.390
<v Speaker 5>He's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very smart guy and we'd been talking </v>

3126
02:33:46.390 --> 02:33:48.941
<v Speaker 5>about all the sorts of things that we've</v>
<v Speaker 5>been talking about tonight for a long </v>

3127
02:33:48.941 --> 02:33:50.510
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we were talking about the relatively</v>

3128
02:33:50.650 --> 02:33:52.970
<v Speaker 5>relative evolutionary roles of men and </v>
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>

3129
02:33:53.090 --> 02:33:55.400
<v Speaker 5>This is speculative obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3130
02:33:55.490 --> 02:33:59.570
<v Speaker 5>and because our research did indicate </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's tended of research so far that,</v>

3131
02:33:59.930 --> 02:34:01.030
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3132
02:34:01.090 --> 02:34:04.910
<v Speaker 5>the SGS sjw sort of equality above all </v>
<v Speaker 5>else,</v>

3133
02:34:04.911 --> 02:34:08.120
<v Speaker 5>philosophy is more prevalent among </v>
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>

3134
02:34:09.450 --> 02:34:14.450
<v Speaker 5>It's predicted by the personality </v>
<v Speaker 5>factors that are more common among </v>

3135
02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:18.131
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So agreeableness and high negative </v>

3136
02:34:18.131 --> 02:34:18.131
<v Speaker 5>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>primarily agreeableness.</v>

3137
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:21.160
<v Speaker 5>But in addition it's also predicted by </v>
<v Speaker 5>being female.</v>

3138
02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:26.640
<v Speaker 5>And that's interesting because in most </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the personality research that I've </v>

3139
02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:27.490
<v Speaker 5>done and as far as I know in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>literature at,</v>

3140
02:34:27.870 --> 02:34:30.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in more broadly speaking,</v>

3141
02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:35.400
<v Speaker 5>most of the time you can get rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>attitudinal differences between men and </v>

3142
02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:36.640
<v Speaker 5>women or at least reduced them by </v>
<v Speaker 5>controlling for personality.</v>

3143
02:34:36.970 --> 02:34:39.430
<v Speaker 5>So if you take a feminine man in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>masculine woman,</v>

3144
02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:43.570
<v Speaker 5>then you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the polls reverse.</v>

3145
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:46.120
<v Speaker 5>But that didn't seem to be the case with</v>
<v Speaker 5>political correctness.</v>

3146
02:34:46.390 --> 02:34:49.030
<v Speaker 5>And so I've been thinking about that a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot because,</v>

3147
02:34:49.630 --> 02:34:53.110
<v Speaker 5>well men are bailing out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>humanities like Matt and pretty much out</v>

3148
02:34:53.111 --> 02:34:58.111
<v Speaker 5>of the universities except for stamp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The women are moving in like mad and </v>

3149
02:34:58.111 --> 02:35:00.370
<v Speaker 5>they're also moving into the political </v>
<v Speaker 5>sphere like Matt and this is new,</v>

3150
02:35:00.371 --> 02:35:02.020
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've never had this happen before.</v>

3151
02:35:02.021 --> 02:35:02.740
<v Speaker 5>And we do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3152
02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:07.750
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do not know what the significance of it </v>

3153
02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:07.750
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's only 50 years old.</v>

3154
02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:11.850
<v Speaker 5>And so we were thinking about this and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know what you think about </v>

3155
02:35:11.850 --> 02:35:12.340
<v Speaker 5>this proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but imagining that,</v>

3156
02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:14.440
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that historically speaking,</v>

3157
02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:20.280
<v Speaker 5>it's something like women were </v>
<v Speaker 5>responsible for distribution and men </v>

3158
02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:22.690
<v Speaker 5>were responsible for production.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something like that,</v>

3159
02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:27.900
<v Speaker 5>and maybe maybe that's only the case </v>
<v Speaker 5>really in the tight confines of the </v>

3160
02:35:27.900 --> 02:35:31.861
<v Speaker 5>immediate family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't matter because that's </v>

3161
02:35:31.861 --> 02:35:31.861
<v Speaker 5>most of the evolutionary landscape for </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings anyways.</v>

3162
02:35:31.861 --> 02:35:35.050
<v Speaker 5>What the women does it did was make sure</v>
<v Speaker 5>that everybody got enough.</v>

3163
02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:41.100
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that seems to me to be one of the </v>

3164
02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:41.100
<v Speaker 5>things that's driving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least in part,</v>

3165
02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:43.570
<v Speaker 5>the sjw demand for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for equity and equality.</v>

3166
02:35:43.571 --> 02:35:46.330
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's make sure everybody has enough.</v>

3167
02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:47.080
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well look,</v>

3168
02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:47.980
<v Speaker 5>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3169
02:35:47.981 --> 02:35:48.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3170
02:35:48.361 --> 02:35:50.110
<v Speaker 5>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't argue with that,</v>

3171
02:35:50.350 --> 02:35:55.350
<v Speaker 5>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an antipathy between that and </v>

3172
02:35:55.350 --> 02:35:56.830
<v Speaker 5>the reality of differential </v>
<v Speaker 5>productivity,</v>

3173
02:35:56.850 --> 02:35:58.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because people really do differ in their</v>

3174
02:35:58.751 --> 02:36:00.460
<v Speaker 5>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

3175
02:36:01.390 --> 02:36:03.280
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to answer your question fully,</v>

3176
02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:09.120
<v Speaker 5>I do think that the rebellious tendency </v>
<v Speaker 5>of adolescents is associated both with </v>

3177
02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:13.531
<v Speaker 5>that criminality spike,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially among men and with </v>

3178
02:36:13.531 --> 02:36:13.531
<v Speaker 5>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3179
02:36:13.531 --> 02:36:17.730
<v Speaker 5>I think that the sjw phenomena is </v>
<v Speaker 5>different and I think it is associated </v>

3180
02:36:17.730 --> 02:36:20.380
<v Speaker 5>at least in part with the rise of women </v>
<v Speaker 5>to political power and,</v>

3181
02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:25.500
<v Speaker 5>and we don't know what women are like </v>
<v Speaker 5>when they have political power because </v>

3182
02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:28.600
<v Speaker 5>they've never had it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's been queens obviously and</v>

3183
02:36:28.601 --> 02:36:33.601
<v Speaker 5>that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just being female authority figures and </v>

3184
02:36:33.601 --> 02:36:35.731
<v Speaker 5>females have wielded far more power </v>
<v Speaker 5>historically than feminists generally </v>

3185
02:36:35.731 --> 02:36:39.511
<v Speaker 5>liked to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is a different thing and we </v>

3186
02:36:39.511 --> 02:36:40.360
<v Speaker 5>don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a truly female political philosophy</v>

3187
02:36:40.361 --> 02:36:42.580
<v Speaker 5>would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it might be,</v>

3188
02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:46.060
<v Speaker 5>especially if it's not been well </v>
<v Speaker 5>examined and it isn't very sophisticated</v>

3189
02:36:46.061 --> 02:36:47.530
<v Speaker 5>conceptually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could easily be,</v>

3190
02:36:47.700 --> 02:36:50.380
<v Speaker 5>but let's make sure things are </v>
<v Speaker 5>distributed equally well.</v>

3191
02:36:50.381 --> 02:36:55.381
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but sorry that that's just not gonna </v>

3192
02:36:55.381 --> 02:36:55.381
<v Speaker 5>fly.</v>

3193
02:36:55.381 --> 02:36:59.000
<v Speaker 6>Do you think in terms of the west with </v>
<v Speaker 6>sjws and you talked about last lecture </v>

3194
02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:00.450
<v Speaker 6>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>creating chaos when there is none.</v>

3195
02:37:00.451 --> 02:37:03.480
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise it'd be Sadek.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think there would be any validity</v>

3196
02:37:03.481 --> 02:37:07.860
<v Speaker 6>in saying that in a country like Canada </v>
<v Speaker 6>where we're pretty gender equal,</v>

3197
02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:13.280
<v Speaker 6>is there any merit to thinking sjws are </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to create chaos even when they're</v>

3198
02:37:13.501 --> 02:37:16.070
<v Speaker 6>arguably is none on a level?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Obviously</v>

3199
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:18.260
<v Speaker 5>there's still problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would they do that?</v>

3200
02:37:18.470 --> 02:37:22.730
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise it would be static and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>drive it wouldn't,</v>

3201
02:37:22.731 --> 02:37:26.080
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just wondering is this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read this quote once and I don't.</v>

3202
02:37:26.090 --> 02:37:28.480
<v Speaker 5>Don't remember who.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who said it.</v>

3203
02:37:28.570 --> 02:37:33.570
<v Speaker 5>It might've been Robert Heinlein for </v>
<v Speaker 5>crying out loud starts fiction author </v>

3204
02:37:33.570 --> 02:37:33.570
<v Speaker 5>that springs to mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it probably,</v>

3205
02:37:33.570 --> 02:37:38.471
<v Speaker 5>it probably wasn't the proposition was </v>
<v Speaker 5>that men tested ideas and that women </v>

3206
02:37:38.781 --> 02:37:43.250
<v Speaker 5>tested men and I kinda liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something about that,</v>

3207
02:37:43.251 --> 02:37:48.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and now it obviously it's an </v>

3208
02:37:48.251 --> 02:37:49.691
<v Speaker 5>overgeneralization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we also don't know to what degree </v>

3209
02:37:49.691 --> 02:37:53.800
<v Speaker 5>women test men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Surely through provo provocation it's a </v>

3210
02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:54.320
<v Speaker 5>lot because like if you want to test </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone,</v>

3211
02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:56.450
<v Speaker 5>you don't have a little conversation </v>
<v Speaker 5>with them.</v>

3212
02:37:56.451 --> 02:37:58.160
<v Speaker 5>Like you poke the hell out of them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you see,</v>

3213
02:37:58.161 --> 02:38:00.680
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm gonna like go after you and see</v>

3214
02:38:00.681 --> 02:38:03.710
<v Speaker 5>where your weak spots are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it seems to me that this.</v>

3215
02:38:04.010 --> 02:38:09.010
<v Speaker 5>It seems to me that in this constant </v>
<v Speaker 5>protest and use of shame and all of that</v>

3216
02:38:09.381 --> 02:38:14.381
<v Speaker 5>that goes along with this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with this sort of radical movement </v>

3217
02:38:14.381 --> 02:38:17.861
<v Speaker 5>towards egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's a tremendous amount of </v>

3218
02:38:17.861 --> 02:38:18.380
<v Speaker 5>provocation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And God,</v>

3219
02:38:18.381 --> 02:38:20.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say this too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though I shouldn't,</v>

3220
02:38:20.470 --> 02:38:22.170
<v Speaker 5>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we may not.</v>

3221
02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:24.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm trying trying to figure it out.</v>

3222
02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:27.860
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was absolutely comical when</v>

3223
02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:31.970
<v Speaker 5>50 shades of grey came out that just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just thought that was just so insanely</v>

3224
02:38:31.971 --> 02:38:36.971
<v Speaker 5>comical that at the same time there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>this massive political demand for like </v>

3225
02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:42.640
<v Speaker 5>radical equality and and say with </v>
<v Speaker 5>regards to sexual behavior and the </v>

3226
02:38:42.981 --> 02:38:47.981
<v Speaker 5>fastest selling novel the world had ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>seen was snm domination.</v>

3227
02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:49.340
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3228
02:38:49.430 --> 02:38:52.160
<v Speaker 5>oh well we can know where the </v>
<v Speaker 5>unconscious is going with that one don't</v>

3229
02:38:52.260 --> 02:38:57.260
<v Speaker 5>make.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes I think like because one </v>

3230
02:38:57.260 --> 02:38:57.800
<v Speaker 5>of the things that I've really tried to </v>
<v Speaker 5>puzzle out,</v>

3231
02:38:58.040 --> 02:39:00.050
<v Speaker 5>and it's not like I believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3232
02:39:00.050 --> 02:39:05.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm just telling you what were the edges</v>
<v Speaker 5>of my thinking have been going is that </v>

3233
02:39:05.050 --> 02:39:08.240
<v Speaker 5>you have this crazy alliance between the</v>
<v Speaker 5>feminists and the radical Islamists that</v>

3234
02:39:08.241 --> 02:39:13.241
<v Speaker 5>I just do not get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the feminist is like why they </v>

3235
02:39:13.241 --> 02:39:16.241
<v Speaker 5>aren't protesting nonstop about Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 5>Arabia is just completely beyond me.</v>

3236
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:19.100
<v Speaker 5>Like I do not understand it in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>least.</v>

3237
02:39:19.370 --> 02:39:22.030
<v Speaker 5>And I wonder too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just wonder bloody wellness,</v>

3238
02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:25.160
<v Speaker 5>this is the frightened me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there an attraction,</v>

3239
02:39:25.370 --> 02:39:25.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

3240
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:29.690
<v Speaker 5>Is there an attraction that's emerging </v>
<v Speaker 5>among the female radicals?</v>

3241
02:39:29.691 --> 02:39:34.691
<v Speaker 5>For that totalitarian male dominance </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they've chased out of the west and </v>

3242
02:39:35.451 --> 02:39:36.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's a hell of a thing to </v>
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>

3243
02:39:36.951 --> 02:39:41.951
<v Speaker 5>but I am after all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am a psychoanalytically minded and I </v>

3244
02:39:41.951 --> 02:39:44.780
<v Speaker 5>do think things like that because like I</v>
<v Speaker 5>just can see no rational reason for it.</v>

3245
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:47.960
<v Speaker 5>The only other rational reason is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3246
02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:53.020
<v Speaker 5>the West needs to fall and so the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 5>of my enemy is exactly.</v>

3247
02:39:53.850 --> 02:39:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Now what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The I got that wrong,</v>

3248
02:39:56.061 --> 02:39:58.360
<v Speaker 5>but the enemy of an enemy is my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3249
02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:03.400
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The elements tend to vote liberal as </v>

3250
02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:03.400
<v Speaker 5>well as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that that could be the case,</v>

3251
02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:07.841
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not going to shake my suspicion </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the this unconscious balancing </v>

3252
02:40:08.421 --> 02:40:13.421
<v Speaker 5>because as the demand for egalitarianism</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the eradication of masculinity</v>

3253
02:40:14.820 --> 02:40:19.820
<v Speaker 4>accelerates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a longing in the </v>

3254
02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:21.360
<v Speaker 4>unconscious for the precise opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3255
02:40:21.390 --> 02:40:24.540
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The more you you scream for equality,</v>

3256
02:40:24.780 --> 02:40:29.490
<v Speaker 4>the more your unconscious is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>admire dominance and so.</v>

3257
02:40:30.060 --> 02:40:31.230
<v Speaker 4>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3258
02:40:31.290 --> 02:40:33.120
<v Speaker 4>that's well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how you think.</v>

3259
02:40:33.121 --> 02:40:38.121
<v Speaker 4>If you're a psychoanalytically minded </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know I'm a great admirer of </v>

3260
02:40:38.121 --> 02:40:38.121
<v Speaker 4>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knew a hell of a lot more than people</v>

3261
02:40:38.121 --> 02:40:41.250
<v Speaker 4>like to think and and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is partly why everyone still hates</v>

3262
02:40:41.251 --> 02:40:43.860
<v Speaker 4>him even though it's 100 years since </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's really,</v>

3263
02:40:44.010 --> 02:40:45.070
<v Speaker 4>really been around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

3264
02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:46.400
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should stop.</v>
