1
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.303
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first question I guess I might </v>

2
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>have is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>why are you here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody got an interesting reason?</v>

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to be able to manipulate,</v>

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.783
<v Speaker 1>manipulate reality to my best interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good plan except for the manipulate </v>

6
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:26.784
<v Speaker 1>part</v>
<v Speaker 1>is often it's better to work with </v>

7
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>reality generally then manipulate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it tends to,</v>

8
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick back.</v>

9
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

11
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Actually changes for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the better</v>

12
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>author</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

13
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.913
<v Speaker 1>Is he any good</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and you are no wonder he </v>

14
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.790
<v Speaker 1>threatens</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this course.</v>

15
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Six years ago in this course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed the way I see the world.</v>

16
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>So I want to say after six years what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens now?</v>

17
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>You want to see if it'll change back.</v>

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

19
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.343
<v Speaker 1>So why did you decide why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why after all this time did you decide </v>

20
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>to come back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

21
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.334
<v Speaker 1>I thought about the things you discussed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the class over you over those six </v>

22
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's been a while.</v>

23
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:29.600
<v Speaker 1>And I want to refresh myself and see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>new experiences I have in your things.</v>

24
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I've learned how and what I can take </v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

25
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very,</v>

26
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.554
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated and hopefully useful to get a </v>

27
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>spiritual awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

28
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>I hope I didn't see that he did he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he did any,</v>

29
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any description or</v>

30
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>was it associated with an epileptic </v>
<v Speaker 1>seizure associated with vision?</v>

31
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

32
00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

33
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>that can get out of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

34
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

35
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced when I started to learn some</v>

36
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:06.954
<v Speaker 1>of the things that aren't going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you guys about is a very radical </v>

37
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>increase in the intensity and clarity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dreams.</v>

38
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't pleasant by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

39
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>thought it was useful or most useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>things aren't that pleasant.</v>

40
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>So you're in for some of the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

41
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that all right?</v>

42
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.203
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of have a independent interest and </v>

43
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.420
<v Speaker 1>existential psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. So this seemed like a good place to</v>

44
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.373
<v Speaker 1>discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I took care of all your previouS </v>

45
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>class personnel personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you take that?</v>

46
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a good preparation for this </v>

48
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:50.664
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is there anybody here who doesn't </v>

49
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:54.114
<v Speaker 1>have any idea what this class is about </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just more or less showed up because </v>

50
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>the time was right to or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

51
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>So you don't really have any idea what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in for.</v>

52
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.350
<v Speaker 1>It looked cool and it's not also that </v>
<v Speaker 1>utfc</v>

53
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.583
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm going to jump right into it </v>

54
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>because why not and all spend.</v>

55
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.753
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to talk to you for about </v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours and then you can have a break </v>

56
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to tell you what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do in the class.</v>

57
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.124
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

58
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.563
<v Speaker 1>but by that time you'll know if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take the class because you'll know </v>

59
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you were interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I told you about.</v>

60
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to video the clAss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always do that.</v>

61
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:31.054
<v Speaker 1>And so the vIdeos will be online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones from previous years are online </v>

62
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

63
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:35.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.090
<v Speaker 1>hopefully that'll be a useful resource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

65
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't take me as much setup time </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next time is it did today,</v>

66
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:42.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still getting used to this </v>

67
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.793
<v Speaker 1>equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

68
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

69
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you why I'm telling you </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that I'm going to tell you</v>

70
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.853
<v Speaker 2>mean</v>

71
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.693
<v Speaker 1>when I was approximately the same age </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you people are probably a little </v>

72
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 1>bit older because I imagine your guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>around 21 or something like that.</v>

73
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I was probably about your age and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a couple of years older.</v>

74
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.510
<v Speaker 1>First year I was in graduate school in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

75
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 1>which I guess was the 1985.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was 23 then,</v>

76
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was in,</v>

77
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:18.360
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was in 1985 and there were a couple</v>

78
00:04:18.361 --> 00:04:22.290
<v Speaker 1>of times in the late 20th century where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cold war,</v>

79
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.223
<v Speaker 1>it came to a peak and one time I guess </v>
<v Speaker 1>was probably in about 1957 when I think </v>

80
00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:32.040
<v Speaker 1>it was 57.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I have my dates right.</v>

81
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Was whenever stalad and announced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had developed a hydrogen bomb.</v>

82
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know how much you guys know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about hydrogen bombs,</v>

83
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.923
<v Speaker 1>but all you really need to know about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen bomb is that they use atom </v>

84
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:44.370
<v Speaker 1>bombs as a trigger.</v>

85
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.550
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

86
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.980
<v Speaker 1>they're quite the weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ussr and the us made some very,</v>

87
00:04:54.981 --> 00:04:55.814
<v Speaker 1>very big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're big enough to make the thing </v>

88
00:04:56.961 --> 00:05:00.260
<v Speaker 1>that was dropped on hiroshima look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamite,</v>

89
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hundreds and hundreds of times </v>

90
00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe thousands of times.</v>

91
00:05:05.631 --> 00:05:07.100
<v Speaker 1>It's been a while since I looked into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

92
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.930
<v Speaker 1>and then in 1962 there was a cuban </v>
<v Speaker 1>missile crisis.</v>

93
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.183
<v Speaker 1>Not a good story about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So about 10 years ago I went down to </v>

94
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.520
<v Speaker 1>tucson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona to a conference on consciousness</v>

95
00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:23.354
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have that conference fairly </v>

96
00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>frequently in tucson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

97
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.140
<v Speaker 1>it's become quite a popular conference </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it isn't clear to me that we</v>

98
00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:30.974
<v Speaker 1>know anything more about consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>than we did before the conference </v>

99
00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:36.110
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And two songs,</v>

100
00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:38.660
<v Speaker 1>kind of an interesting town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the middle of the desert,</v>

101
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:43.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a big sort of sorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a road runner,</v>

103
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.570
<v Speaker 1>cactuses and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also extremely dry there,</v>

104
00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:49.820
<v Speaker 1>which is of course what you'd expect </v>
<v Speaker 1>given that it's a desert.</v>

105
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.683
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things the american do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with tucson is store old fighter planes </v>

106
00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a airplane museum,</v>

107
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>which is an amazing place that has maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 planes,</v>

108
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:03.240
<v Speaker 1>including john f kennedy's airforce one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

109
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Which is the jet that he used to zoom </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>

110
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>it didn't even have a shower in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

111
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.030
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because on the outside it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like a modern jet,</v>

112
00:06:10.031 --> 00:06:12.690
<v Speaker 1>but to me inside it looks pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was from world war two,</v>

113
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because 19,</v>

114
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:19.001
<v Speaker 1>62 is a lot closer to world war ii than </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is to now and all sorts of ways.</v>

115
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:20.534
<v Speaker 1>Even the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rockets that went to the moon look </v>

116
00:06:22.171 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>like they were built by people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>using world war ii technology,</v>

117
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're full of switches,</v>

118
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:31.541
<v Speaker 1>mechanical switches and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty basic anyways,</v>

119
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>as well as the airport museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very interesting place.</v>

120
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 1>There's be 52 bombers there and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things.</v>

121
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:39.794
<v Speaker 1>Those things are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also an airport graveyard where </v>

122
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:44.860
<v Speaker 1>they store old fighter jets and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of old fighter jets,</v>

123
00:06:44.861 --> 00:06:49.861
<v Speaker 1>so there's acres and acres and acres and</v>
<v Speaker 1>acres and thousands and thousands of old</v>

124
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>mothballed fighter jets lined up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desert.</v>

125
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of cool in a strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was one other thing down there</v>

126
00:06:58.221 --> 00:06:59.054
<v Speaker 1>that I went and saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a decommissioned nuclear </v>

127
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:02.174
<v Speaker 1>missile site and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a intercontinental ballistic missile </v>

128
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 1>site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

129
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Those were built in the fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>early sixties.</v>

130
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were major league rockets.</v>

131
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:13.754
<v Speaker 1>I think the silo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we could go into the cycle of </v>

133
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:16.423
<v Speaker 1>missiles weren't there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can go into the silo and it was </v>

134
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>certainly farther across in diameter </v>
<v Speaker 1>than this room,</v>

135
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I would think probably twice as twice as</v>
<v Speaker 1>large as this room.</v>

136
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine how big a missile </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be it.</v>

137
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.593
<v Speaker 1>It's not your grandmother's missile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a major league piece of armament </v>

138
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:33.254
<v Speaker 1>and out on the grounds that these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>were underground deep underground </v>

139
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:38.530
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't want them to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>blown up if,</v>

140
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were bombed.</v>

141
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.143
<v Speaker 1>So they buried them quite a long ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and to get into it you had to go </v>

142
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:48.731
<v Speaker 1>through this massive steel door that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a huge safe door except you know,</v>

143
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.953
<v Speaker 1>10 times as big and 10 times as thick </v>
<v Speaker 1>and out in the yard of the nuclear </v>

144
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:55.634
<v Speaker 1>missile site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were fences with barbed wire on </v>

145
00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:00.770
<v Speaker 1>them of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a missile cap,</v>

146
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:01.604
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it'd be the nose cone of the missile </v>

147
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:03.554
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these missiles had single </v>

148
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:05.864
<v Speaker 1>warheads and which were more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to demolish a city and some </v>

149
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 1>of them had multiple warheads so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would shoot out into space and then come</v>

150
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:16.160
<v Speaker 1>back into earth and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially break apart or,</v>

151
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.053
<v Speaker 1>or disperse into multiple missiles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you could really bomb the hell out </v>

152
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>of whatever you were going to bomb </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of just destroying one city.</v>

153
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.433
<v Speaker 1>And so the nose cone was sitting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and that was a pretty freaky </v>

154
00:08:26.721 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>looking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

155
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.713
<v Speaker 1>like it was big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about seven feet high I would </v>

156
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:31.724
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe about the same amount of </v>

157
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was made out of this plastic,</v>

158
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>kind of a variegated plastic material </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was about three quarters of an inch</v>

159
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>thick and then it would melt off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course on re-entry because as I said,</v>

160
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:44.984
<v Speaker 1>these things shot out into space and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of unnerving really in a </v>

161
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>serious way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

162
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 1>so we're at the missile site and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

163
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned your grandmother's missile </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there was actually a reason for</v>

164
00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bit of foreshadowing because it</v>

165
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 1>was a very funny place because at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of the missile site there was sort</v>

166
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 1>of this museum set up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:06.234
<v Speaker 1>and it had pictures of reagan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorbachev on it because they </v>

168
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 1>decommissioned the missile sites.</v>

169
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

170
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.983
<v Speaker 1>when detente occurred and then when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when perestroika hit and the soviet </v>

171
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:16.524
<v Speaker 1>union started to collapse and so there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was all these pictures of reagan and </v>

172
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:19.704
<v Speaker 1>gorbachev from 1984.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the museum was kind of like a </v>

173
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:22.973
<v Speaker 1>time capsule of 1984.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people who were running it were </v>

174
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:30.951
<v Speaker 1>like retired arizona's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were like your grandparents,</v>

175
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:34.080
<v Speaker 1>assuming you have retired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona's for your grandparents,</v>

176
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 1>but they're real friendly and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were pretty happy to show you their</v>

177
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.153
<v Speaker 1>nuclear missile museum and it was sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like being in their rec room except </v>

178
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>that it was a nuclear missile site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 1>and they were hospitable and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

180
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like welcome to,</v>

181
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.340
<v Speaker 1>you don't welcome people to a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>missile sites,</v>

182
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not,</v>

183
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.153
<v Speaker 1>it's just not reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was very disconcerting and it was </v>

184
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.054
<v Speaker 1>disconcerting that it was locked in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties and then it was </v>

185
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:02.090
<v Speaker 1>disconcerting that it was friendly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitable and you know,</v>

186
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 1>they were kind of proud to show it off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and happy to be there.</v>

187
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 1>And then when you went down into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear missile silo,</v>

188
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 1>proper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the control center,</v>

189
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like star trek,</v>

190
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from 19,</v>

191
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 1>66 or 1967,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except more primitive.</v>

192
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.253
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if the star trek </v>
<v Speaker 1>control command area was modeled after </v>

193
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear missile site control systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if it was the other way around,</v>

194
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:29.514
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were modeled after the nuclear </v>

195
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:35.480
<v Speaker 1>controls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was really 1950.</v>

196
00:10:35.481 --> 00:10:38.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like the whole place was painted in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pastel green,</v>

197
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late fifties and early sixties.</v>

198
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:42.380
<v Speaker 1>People really liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

199
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.550
<v Speaker 1>it had this 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

200
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.983
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an aesthetic and you wouldn't </v>

201
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:50.220
<v Speaker 1>necessarily think that a nuclear missile</v>
<v Speaker 1>site would have an aesthetic,</v>

202
00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 1>but it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it looked like high tech,</v>

203
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:57.111
<v Speaker 1>1957 in 1957 technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they brought you into the control</v>

204
00:10:58.741 --> 00:10:59.574
<v Speaker 1>room and the control desk was probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the molecule or whatever you might </v>

205
00:11:01.951 --> 00:11:02.784
<v Speaker 1>call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was about three times as long as this </v>

206
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:05.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe four times.</v>

207
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:05.963
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not pretty impressive piece of </v>

208
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:07.404
<v Speaker 1>machinery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way you launch the missiles was </v>

209
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.953
<v Speaker 1>not too secure in my humble opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened was one guy wore the key </v>

210
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:18.150
<v Speaker 1>around his neck and another guy who wore</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key around his neck.</v>

211
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:18.984
<v Speaker 1>And then in order to launch the sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to put the keys in the same </v>

212
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:24.030
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were far enough apart so nobody</v>

213
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:25.310
<v Speaker 1>could stretch their arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 1>which was the kind of the high tech part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

215
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.303
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you had to put the key in and then </v>

216
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:33.240
<v Speaker 1>you both had to turn the key for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

217
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.613
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now one of the things that you may </v>

218
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>know about ballistic missiles or you may</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

219
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 1>is there not cruise missiles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

220
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:42.360
<v Speaker 1>onCe you set those things off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not coming back.</v>

221
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.430
<v Speaker 1>There are bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes them ballistic.</v>

222
00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:45.264
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you aim a gun at someone and you </v>

223
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:47.334
<v Speaker 1>shoot and you decide halfway when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullets halfway there that maybe that </v>

224
00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:52.374
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the good thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little late because you're not </v>

225
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 1>telling that bullet to come back.</v>

226
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.483
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with ballistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles and those things are going a </v>

227
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>lot faster than the bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

228
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 1>like at 22 bullet goes about the speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sound,</v>

229
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 1>600 miles an hour or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a ballistic missile,</v>

230
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>nothing has to go seven miles a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of the gravity of theory.</v>

231
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not sure they go quite that fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's escape velocity,</v>

232
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:15.964
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to do that to get out of the </v>

233
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:19.690
<v Speaker 1>gravitational wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to get out there into space,</v>

234
00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to be damn close to seven miles</v>
<v Speaker 1>a second.</v>

235
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:22.894
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very large bullet with a very explosive </v>

236
00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:30.010
<v Speaker 1>hand on it going seven miles at second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once You turn those two keys,</v>

237
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:31.000
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

238
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

239
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 1>there's no turning back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>

240
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 1>And so theY took us through a simulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>launch,</v>

241
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 1>which still kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still an uncanny feeling,</v>

242
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 1>remembering that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hell of a thing to apprehend.</v>

244
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.040
<v Speaker 1>And then they told us that the keys Were</v>
<v Speaker 1>in once,</v>

245
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were 10 seconds away.</v>

246
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.033
<v Speaker 1>Now they wouldn't tell us when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know it was during the cuban </v>

247
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:56.734
<v Speaker 1>missile crisis.</v>

248
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

249
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.360
<v Speaker 1>there are a couple of times in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>latter part of the 20th century where we</v>

250
00:13:03.361 --> 00:13:04.690
<v Speaker 1>made it through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

251
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.240
<v Speaker 1>like the eye of a needle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We barely bloody well made it.</v>

252
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.270
<v Speaker 1>And the cuban missile crisis was one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those points.</v>

253
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.133
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early eighties things were heating </v>

254
00:13:14.431 --> 00:13:16.740
<v Speaker 1>up pretty badly to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.663
<v Speaker 1>in about 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a movie that came out called </v>

256
00:13:19.801 --> 00:13:22.890
<v Speaker 1>the day after you guys probably don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about the day after,</v>

257
00:13:22.891 --> 00:13:23.724
<v Speaker 1>but it was the most watched movie that </v>
<v Speaker 1>had ever been broadcast on tv at that </v>

258
00:13:26.311 --> 00:13:27.930
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically what it showed us,</v>

259
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.663
<v Speaker 1>what a city would be like the day after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States had been bombed into </v>

260
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.220
<v Speaker 1>total desolation by a soviet missile </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

261
00:13:38.221 --> 00:13:41.310
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a pretty hair raising movie.</v>

262
00:13:41.311 --> 00:13:42.144
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that was quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about it was the ronald </v>

263
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:45.024
<v Speaker 1>reagan later said that he watched that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie and that was actually part of the </v>

264
00:13:47.251 --> 00:13:50.110
<v Speaker 1>reason that he entered into detente </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks with,</v>

265
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.750
<v Speaker 1>with the soviets.</v>

266
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.793
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reagan and being basically scaring the </v>

267
00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:58.410
<v Speaker 1>hell out of the soviets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called him an evil empire,</v>

268
00:13:58.411 --> 00:14:01.140
<v Speaker 1>which liberals weren't very happy about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the soviets man,</v>

269
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.290
<v Speaker 1>they were an evil empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely no doubt about it.</v>

270
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.483
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious how many people the </v>

271
00:14:06.811 --> 00:14:10.110
<v Speaker 1>soviets killed during their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their communist revolution.</v>

272
00:14:10.111 --> 00:14:10.944
<v Speaker 1>And in the years following that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the estimates range from 20 to $60 </v>

273
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:17.490
<v Speaker 1>million now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of people like even if it's</v>

274
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:18.324
<v Speaker 1>$20 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's three times as many people were </v>

275
00:14:20.131 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>killed in the holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the song,</v>

276
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.053
<v Speaker 1>the soviet starved 6 million ukrainians </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 thirties and that was just to </v>

277
00:14:26.641 --> 00:14:27.474
<v Speaker 1>get warmed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that the soviets were an </v>

278
00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:33.030
<v Speaker 1>eviL empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a strong word,</v>

279
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.850
<v Speaker 1>but there's absolutely no doubt that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was true.</v>

280
00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And the more we learn about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

281
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.100
<v Speaker 1>especially during the this period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although lennon was no picnic,</v>

282
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

283
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 1>he pretty much created the stalinists </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster that followed him.</v>

284
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.380
<v Speaker 1>The more we learned about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more horrible if it comes,</v>

285
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the soviet system was operated,</v>

286
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.400
<v Speaker 1>the economy fundamentally ran on slave </v>
<v Speaker 1>labor,</v>

287
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what economy there was.</v>

288
00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened with reagan and park was,</v>

289
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.123
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soviet union was falling apart </v>

290
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:05.420
<v Speaker 1>because there's just so long you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep a sinking ship afloat,</v>

291
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:06.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and something that big can die 20 years </v>

292
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 1>before it falls over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

293
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:14.890
<v Speaker 1>a system like that can stumble along </v>
<v Speaker 1>half got it and,</v>

294
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.200
<v Speaker 1>and still manage and so by the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>reagan come along,</v>

295
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:19.034
<v Speaker 1>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably pretty much burned itself </v>

296
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 1>out as a consequence of internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions,</v>

297
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:26.600
<v Speaker 1>but he ramped up the american military </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending to a staggering degree and part</v>

298
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:27.434
<v Speaker 1>of the idea behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least that's what republicans would </v>

299
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 1>have everyone believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be true,</v>

300
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:31.903
<v Speaker 1>was that they're just going to spend the</v>
<v Speaker 1>russians right into bankruptcy and they </v>

301
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:35.924
<v Speaker 1>basically did.</v>

302
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 1>and so that was that for the soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>union and it fell over 1989,</v>

303
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a good day.</v>

304
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.823
<v Speaker 1>That was a really good day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the weird thing is no one saw it </v>

305
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 1>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

306
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:47.450
<v Speaker 1>and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

307
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.950
<v Speaker 1>that was shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like one day the soviet union was</v>

308
00:15:49.951 --> 00:15:50.784
<v Speaker 1>there and the next day the soviet union </v>
<v Speaker 1>was gone and there were no cia analysts </v>

309
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:55.161
<v Speaker 1>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

310
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were about ready to crumble.</v>

311
00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:57.434
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to blow on them and </v>

312
00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 1>they'll fall over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a shock to everyone,</v>

313
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.213
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was very iffy in the </v>

314
00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:06.680
<v Speaker 1>aftermath whether or not it would hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>'em yeltsin who was a terrible drunkard,</v>

315
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:08.840
<v Speaker 1>but actually a pretty courageous while </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a russian,</v>

316
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a pretty courageous guy and he </v>

317
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:16.901
<v Speaker 1>faced down a reestablishment by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarians on a tank,</v>

318
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was good for him because that </v>

319
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:21.350
<v Speaker 1>was pretty frightening to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

320
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:25.190
<v Speaker 1>So I'm telling you all this because when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up,</v>

321
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.490
<v Speaker 1>most of the people I knew were convinced</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was no bloody way we're gonna</v>

322
00:16:30.491 --> 00:16:31.720
<v Speaker 1>make it to the 20th century,</v>

323
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think I can remember discussing </v>

324
00:16:36.511 --> 00:16:38.700
<v Speaker 1>this with all of my friends frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

325
00:16:38.701 --> 00:16:40.470
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

326
00:16:40.471 --> 00:16:43.470
<v Speaker 1>some people kind of used that as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse not to get their life together.</v>

327
00:16:43.471 --> 00:16:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.120
<v Speaker 1>what the hell's the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

329
00:16:45.121 --> 00:16:46.490
<v Speaker 1>we're going to blow ourselves up </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

330
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:46.851
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

331
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I might as well drink until I fall over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

332
00:16:49.411 --> 00:16:52.020
<v Speaker 1>that's not particularly a moral way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it.</v>

333
00:16:52.021 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

334
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.163
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no shortage of thinking that </v>

335
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:57.993
<v Speaker 1>this was so insane that it was going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Siri certainly am an absolute </v>

336
00:17:00.931 --> 00:17:04.080
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it damn near did like it wasn't some</v>

337
00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:06.480
<v Speaker 1>kind of collective delusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:17:06.481 --> 00:17:08.010
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were times,</v>

339
00:17:08.011 --> 00:17:08.844
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a story recently published </v>

340
00:17:09.931 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

341
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.210
<v Speaker 1>a russian general who was given the </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to launch the missiles.</v>

342
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a mistake and reading on their</v>

343
00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:19.254
<v Speaker 1>display,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing the missiles were coming from </v>

344
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.370
<v Speaker 1>north America across the pools into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>

345
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And he was told to launch and he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

346
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for him,</v>

347
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a little too close really.</v>

348
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.223
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's all sorts of other crazy </v>

349
00:17:34.021 --> 00:17:35.820
<v Speaker 1>things that happened during that period </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

350
00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:36.654
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this book by an ex kgb guy who </v>

351
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.160
<v Speaker 1>said he worked in a biological warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lab in the soviet union,</v>

352
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.453
<v Speaker 1>'em.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd killed a number of people by </v>

353
00:17:46.711 --> 00:17:48.540
<v Speaker 1>accident when some of their bugs got </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

354
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the new order of 500 people,</v>

355
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:52.140
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

356
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:54.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 250,000 people,</v>

357
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:54.864
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what those geniuses we're trying to </v>

358
00:17:57.181 --> 00:17:58.380
<v Speaker 1>do mr krause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ebola,</v>

359
00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.970
<v Speaker 1>smallpox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smallpox,</v>

360
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 1>smallpox is unbelievably.</v>

361
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.173
<v Speaker 1>The combination of smallpox in ebola is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily easy to transmit and </v>

362
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.520
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

363
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:12.354
<v Speaker 1>very fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they were trying to cross it and </v>

364
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:16.704
<v Speaker 1>then aerosolized it so that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribute it in canisters and blow it </v>

365
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:20.830
<v Speaker 1>over cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

366
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.373
<v Speaker 1>nice bit of scientific investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfectly reasonable scientific </v>

367
00:18:25.231 --> 00:18:26.064
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can it be done a little sketchy on the </v>

368
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:30.270
<v Speaker 1>moral side you might say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

369
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a pretty crazy period of time and</v>

370
00:18:33.401 --> 00:18:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all human history.</v>

371
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.930
<v Speaker 1>What does the esky say about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>history?</v>

372
00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 1>The one thing you can say about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not rational,</v>

373
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.033
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said the very word sticks in your </v>

374
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:42.721
<v Speaker 1>throat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

375
00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:43.554
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always been crazy and it's crazy </v>

376
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:46.950
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really crazy then.</v>

377
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.770
<v Speaker 1>And so we got through that and thank </v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

378
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

379
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:53.040
<v Speaker 1>the world is a lot better place now than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

380
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Well it is 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years ago,</v>

381
00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 1>50 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are way better now.</v>

382
00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.243
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear a lot of doom and gloom about </v>

383
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 1>how we're going to destroy the planet,</v>

384
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:02.603
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

385
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.080
<v Speaker 1>but we probably aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.070
<v Speaker 1>the population is going to stabilize out</v>
<v Speaker 1>at about 9 billion.</v>

387
00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what the projections look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already have about seven.</v>

388
00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.420
<v Speaker 1>We can handle another two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's kind of,</v>

389
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.840
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna be some extinctions were </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating up the ocean like insane.</v>

390
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purina,</v>

391
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.143
<v Speaker 1>that's mostly a fault of public policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it looks like we're probably going </v>

392
00:19:25.421 --> 00:19:26.254
<v Speaker 1>to squeak through the century with a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of damage and then things will settle </v>

393
00:19:28.451 --> 00:19:29.130
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

394
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's highly probable if there's anything</v>

395
00:19:31.121 --> 00:19:33.910
<v Speaker 1>vaguely human left in 100 years that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>big problem will be.</v>

396
00:19:33.911 --> 00:19:34.744
<v Speaker 1>That population is rapidly decreasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's already happening in european </v>

397
00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:41.680
<v Speaker 1>countries is happening in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen in China.</v>

398
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.693
<v Speaker 1>So by the year 2100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most populous country in the world </v>

399
00:19:45.341 --> 00:19:48.040
<v Speaker 1>is going to be Nigeria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not China.</v>

400
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.610
<v Speaker 1>China's gonna lose people like mad </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they had one child policy,</v>

401
00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:53.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody in China is getting old so</v>

402
00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you know that it's not going to be hiker</v>
<v Speaker 1>populated.</v>

403
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.943
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was interested in all of this </v>

404
00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:00.341
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:20:00.341 --> 00:20:01.174
<v Speaker 1>I kind of felt that I'd grown up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel like I'd grown up under a </v>

406
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.010
<v Speaker 1>shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grown up under it's shadow,</v>

407
00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was something in the back of our </v>

408
00:20:07.601 --> 00:20:10.240
<v Speaker 1>minds all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a question underneath</v>

409
00:20:10.241 --> 00:20:12.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of them and one was</v>

410
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.990
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this possible?</v>

411
00:20:15.991 --> 00:20:16.824
<v Speaker 1>How is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could it be that the world could </v>

412
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:22.920
<v Speaker 1>divide itself up into two armed camps </v>
<v Speaker 1>like hyper armed camps,</v>

413
00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:23.754
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of nuclear missiles </v>

414
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.560
<v Speaker 1>more than enough to wipe out the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>many times over.</v>

415
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what the american </v>
<v Speaker 1>arsenal peak debt,</v>

416
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:33.720
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was more than 50,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons.</v>

417
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there are 50,000 towns </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the soviet union,</v>

418
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they were going to bomb bomb </v>

419
00:20:39.061 --> 00:20:42.330
<v Speaker 1>moscow 50 times or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after the first two or three years,</v>

420
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.390
<v Speaker 1>probably more or less irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was really,</v>

421
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.140
<v Speaker 1>it was really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

422
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.073
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe this was during the </v>

423
00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 1>kennedy era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I've got thiS right.</v>

424
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.013
<v Speaker 1>one of kennedy's genius boys came up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the [inaudible] kennedy's </v>

425
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.123
<v Speaker 1>administration was run by a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>harvard graduates and ivy league </v>

426
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:03.730
<v Speaker 1>graduates and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

427
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:05.320
<v Speaker 1>they were supposed to be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

428
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:07.630
<v Speaker 1>but intelligence and wisdom are not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

429
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.070
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

430
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.570
<v Speaker 1>they established a policy which was </v>
<v Speaker 1>called mutual assured destruction,</v>

431
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.110
<v Speaker 1>which means if you hit me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kill you and then you kill me.</v>

432
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:19.390
<v Speaker 1>And so it'd be better if we just didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bother.</v>

433
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.720
<v Speaker 1>and the acronym was mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

434
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Mutual assured destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

435
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just thinking about that it,</v>

436
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.413
<v Speaker 1>it's a chilling thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what horrible entity thought </v>

437
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:34.660
<v Speaker 1>that up as a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

438
00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 1>when you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

439
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.273
<v Speaker 1>does that sum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says that some politician's idea of </v>

440
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:40.150
<v Speaker 1>width,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where'd that come from?</v>

441
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's a hell of a thing to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke about,</v>

442
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>

443
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:44.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was right.</v>

444
00:21:44.951 --> 00:21:46.840
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:47.674
<v Speaker 1>and the odd thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we didn't blow ourselves up and </v>

446
00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:52.210
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have a third world war and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

447
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.203
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't make a solid claim that the </v>

448
00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:56.554
<v Speaker 1>invention of nuclear weapons was </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily the worst thing that could </v>

449
00:21:59.221 --> 00:22:00.340
<v Speaker 1>have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

450
00:22:00.341 --> 00:22:03.100
<v Speaker 1>because even the soviets who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely insane,</v>

451
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.830
<v Speaker 1>and of course the model was to probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>even worse.</v>

452
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.980
<v Speaker 1>They weren't insane enough to start a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear war.</v>

453
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Now stalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence,</v>

454
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.560
<v Speaker 1>there's debate about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was,</v>

455
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.710
<v Speaker 1>and there's evidence that stalin was </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically murdered partly by khrushchev,</v>

456
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 1>was who was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was his successor,</v>

457
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when stalin died,</v>

458
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.243
<v Speaker 1>khrushchev and three other people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his house and what happened in </v>

459
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.450
<v Speaker 1>stalin's house the night he died is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

460
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.720
<v Speaker 1>But I read a book recently called </v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen.</v>

461
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was written by a guy who had access</v>

462
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:36.850
<v Speaker 1>to the full communist party archives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

463
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:37.763
<v Speaker 1>which was relatively new thing and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was his conclusion and he also believed </v>

464
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:45.970
<v Speaker 1>that stalin was gearing up to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an invasion of europe and that he didn't</v>

465
00:22:45.971 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 1>give a damn how many cities would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be bombed in order for the soviets to</v>

466
00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:51.450
<v Speaker 1>roll through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And stalIn.</v>

467
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.670
<v Speaker 1>He was like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:53.643
<v Speaker 1>stalin was perfectly capable of taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire nations of people out in eastern </v>

469
00:22:57.371 --> 00:23:01.330
<v Speaker 1>europe by train and shipping them out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>siberia in the middle of the winter with</v>

470
00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:04.570
<v Speaker 1>nothing to eat and no tools and letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them live,</v>

471
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:05.830
<v Speaker 1>which of course they didn't.</v>

472
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.390
<v Speaker 1>And that meant women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

473
00:23:07.391 --> 00:23:08.590
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

474
00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:13.240
<v Speaker 1>shorn of all their belongings and thrust</v>
<v Speaker 1>out into the middle of nowhere to perish</v>

475
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.961
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

476
00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:17.290
<v Speaker 1>or live as they saw fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they perished so much,</v>

477
00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:19.120
<v Speaker 1>the better as far as stalin was </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

478
00:23:19.121 --> 00:23:21.490
<v Speaker 1>And so he wasn't exactly the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

479
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 1>The idea of a nuclear war would </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily stop.</v>

480
00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:28.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly possible that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was hoping for.</v>

481
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.123
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when we look at people like </v>

482
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:32.230
<v Speaker 1>stalin and hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think,</v>

483
00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

484
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 1>thereafter world domination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.823
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in some sense that's kind of a </v>

486
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:38.950
<v Speaker 1>positive motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

487
00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like if you have a core vat say</v>

488
00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:44.470
<v Speaker 1>and someone steals it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think,</v>

489
00:23:44.471 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know why they stole it.</v>

490
00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.570
<v Speaker 1>They want to have the corvette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

491
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:48.404
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an understandable motivation to </v>

492
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:51.674
<v Speaker 1>want power.</v>

493
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:52.783
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily an admirable one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although sometimes power is a perfectly </v>

494
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.353
<v Speaker 1>reasonable thing to pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have any idea why we ever </v>

495
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 1>assumed that those guys were after </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory.</v>

496
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:03.763
<v Speaker 1>Like you should never make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that everyone is out to </v>

497
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 1>When some people are out to lose and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people they can take wIth them,</v>

498
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:11.860
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

499
00:24:11.861 --> 00:24:12.694
<v Speaker 1>And when hitler died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he committed suicide in a bunker way </v>

500
00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:15.764
<v Speaker 1>down below berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>West berlin was on fire and europe was </v>

501
00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:18.351
<v Speaker 1>burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

502
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:19.184
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was exactly what hitler was after </v>

503
00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:22.800
<v Speaker 1>right from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

504
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.940
<v Speaker 1>he was interested in fire as a purifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>agent.</v>

505
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a fire worship or in some sense,</v>

506
00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:31.860
<v Speaker 1>because if you look at the nuremberg </v>
<v Speaker 1>gatherings of the nazis,</v>

507
00:24:31.861 --> 00:24:33.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're spectacular,</v>

508
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:37.250
<v Speaker 1>spectacular celebrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably dramatic and impressive,</v>

509
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.080
<v Speaker 1>and they frequently featured fire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire's up purifying agent,</v>

510
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:42.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hitler,</v>

511
00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:43.784
<v Speaker 1>by the end of world war ii was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was pretty contemptuous of the </v>

512
00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 1>germans because they really hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>served him well.</v>

513
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.480
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it wasn't such a good idea to</v>

514
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:55.190
<v Speaker 1>start a whole second world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

515
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:57.560
<v Speaker 1>because he was a little on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic side we might say.</v>

516
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.620
<v Speaker 1>But by the time the russians came </v>
<v Speaker 1>marching in,</v>

517
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:01.463
<v Speaker 1>in Germany was in ruins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was perfectly happy to have the </v>

518
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:05.623
<v Speaker 1>allies tromp all over the citizens </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what they deserved </v>

519
00:25:07.581 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the sort of guy he was.</v>

520
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:10.754
<v Speaker 1>And so why we would assume that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to win just because that's what </v>

521
00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:16.160
<v Speaker 1>he said is something I've never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to understand.</v>

522
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.533
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids who shot up columbine didn't </v>

523
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:19.754
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they wanted to kill as many people </v>

524
00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:22.394
<v Speaker 1>as possible to make a point and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to kill themselves just in </v>

525
00:25:24.831 --> 00:25:25.664
<v Speaker 1>case you didn't exactly get the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the point was the more destruction </v>

526
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.580
<v Speaker 1>the vendor and if I asked to go along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

527
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:32.690
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

528
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.900
<v Speaker 1>That just makes me a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious than I might've otherwise be.</v>

529
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.820
<v Speaker 1>And so those sorts of motivations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not pleasant to understand,</v>

530
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.300
<v Speaker 1>but we have enough documentation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>events like that,</v>

531
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the mass killings.</v>

532
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Those guys have written down exactly why</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it.</v>

533
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:49.483
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some excellent books on </v>

534
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary vengeful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a map serial killers at mass murderers.</v>

535
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:56.354
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly how they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great book if you're </v>

536
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:00.140
<v Speaker 1>interested in this sort of thing called </v>
<v Speaker 1>pans,</v>

537
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 1>ram p a n zed r a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>m and carl pants.</v>

538
00:26:04.701 --> 00:26:05.534
<v Speaker 1>Ram waS a serial killer and rapist who </v>
<v Speaker 1>lIve pretty much early in the 20th </v>

539
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:10.244
<v Speaker 1>century and he was a tough delinquency </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta kid from a large family and when </v>

540
00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

541
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.680
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

542
00:26:15.681 --> 00:26:16.514
<v Speaker 1>they sent them off to some reform school</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was run by the same sort of </v>

543
00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:22.880
<v Speaker 1>people that run canada's residential </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools and you know,</v>

544
00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:27.500
<v Speaker 1>so those were basically predators on </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and of course he was raped and,</v>

545
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.640
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

546
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.750
<v Speaker 1>and brutalized and tormented and in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of horrible ways and,</v>

547
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 1>but he was a tough guy and when he came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out he decided that,</v>

548
00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human race really wasn't worth that </v>

549
00:26:38.421 --> 00:26:42.170
<v Speaker 1>much and that he was going to reek as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much mayhem as he possibly could for the</v>

550
00:26:42.171 --> 00:26:43.004
<v Speaker 1>rest of his life.</v>

551
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.220
<v Speaker 1>He raped a thousand men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed dozens of people.</v>

552
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.220
<v Speaker 1>He kept track of the dollar value of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>

553
00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 1>He burned down like this was a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>scott and he wasn't.</v>

554
00:26:54.631 --> 00:26:58.970
<v Speaker 1>He was bent on destruction and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what his.</v>

555
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.920
<v Speaker 1>What were his dying words?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

556
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:03.540
<v Speaker 1>there was a committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

557
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:04.374
<v Speaker 1>of women who intervened on behalf of him</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were anti a capital </v>

558
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:09.294
<v Speaker 1>punishment and he said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly that he wished </v>

559
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:13.734
<v Speaker 1>the human race had one neck so that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could put his hands around it and </v>

560
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:17.580
<v Speaker 1>squeeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

561
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:18.414
<v Speaker 1>that was his way of pointing out to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who didn't think that maybe </v>

562
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.493
<v Speaker 1>capital punishment was justified in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>case that maybe they weren't thinking </v>

563
00:27:25.381 --> 00:27:27.360
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to the hang man,</v>

564
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:29.340
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurry up you who's your bastard?</v>

565
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I could kill 10 men in the time it takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to hang me.</v>

566
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a statement like that from</v>

567
00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 1>someone who isn't thoroughly committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to what he's doing.</v>

568
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.443
<v Speaker 1>So the situation in the world found </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself involved in really had me </v>

569
00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:46.081
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:47.010
<v Speaker 1>part of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

571
00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:47.844
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is going on with all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons and how can it possibly be that </v>

572
00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:52.810
<v Speaker 1>anyone thinks that that's a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution?</v>

573
00:27:52.811 --> 00:27:55.980
<v Speaker 1>And how did it come about that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>could even occur?</v>

574
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:56.814
<v Speaker 1>And what are we thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so there was that and then </v>

575
00:27:58.951 --> 00:27:59.784
<v Speaker 1>there was also the why are people so </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn convinced on each side of this </v>

576
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:06.060
<v Speaker 1>argument that they are right enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk everything for,</v>

577
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a perfectly good question.</v>

578
00:28:08.641 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

579
00:28:10.651 --> 00:28:11.484
<v Speaker 1>like how much of this has nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with wanting to see your side when and </v>

580
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:17.520
<v Speaker 1>everything to do with wanting to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything lose,</v>

581
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.260
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

582
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there was another issue which was,</v>

583
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.830
<v Speaker 1>well our are both sides wrong</v>

584
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 1>are both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

585
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Because that's more of a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>relativist approach,</v>

586
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:36.631
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

587
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:36.991
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

588
00:28:36.991 --> 00:28:37.824
<v Speaker 1>The communists believed one thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bloody capitalist believe another </v>

589
00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.770
<v Speaker 1>and they're just as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who were you lIke,</v>

590
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.653
<v Speaker 1>who believes what is completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary because belief systems are </v>

591
00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:47.270
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary and so maybe they're both </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>

592
00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 1>they're both wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

593
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:49.614
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either of those conclusions was pretty </v>

594
00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:53.010
<v Speaker 1>damn dismal because if they're both </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

595
00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:54.720
<v Speaker 1>then well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

596
00:28:54.721 --> 00:28:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Have them talk it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

597
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.520
<v Speaker 1>And if they're both wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not much better.</v>

598
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.710
<v Speaker 1>And then if one's right in the other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

599
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.203
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that mean anything like is it </v>

600
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 1>possible for one belief system to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more right than another belief system?</v>

601
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:09.384
<v Speaker 1>Because of course that's certainly not </v>
<v Speaker 1>attendant of moral relativism and you </v>

602
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:12.924
<v Speaker 1>might think about that as the standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly the standard intellectual </v>

603
00:29:15.691 --> 00:29:18.690
<v Speaker 1>approach to morality and probably has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been for the last hundred years,</v>

604
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I think by the way that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible morality</v>

605
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:24.923
<v Speaker 2>w</v>

606
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:25.933
<v Speaker 1>and what I'll tell you as the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas we move through the course </v>

607
00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:29.774
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out was why is what we were </v>

608
00:29:32.841 --> 00:29:33.950
<v Speaker 1>fighting for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

609
00:29:33.951 --> 00:29:37.400
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you give the west a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefit of the doubt and assume that</v>

610
00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:38.234
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that we stand for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually stand for and aren't just </v>

611
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.153
<v Speaker 1>posturing and parading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that grOunded in anything or was it </v>

612
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:48.190
<v Speaker 1>just arbitrary opinion?</v>

613
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

614
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.670
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about that,</v>

615
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.620
<v Speaker 1>why people believe the things they </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe,</v>

616
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.800
<v Speaker 1>what psychological function at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>

617
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

618
00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.353
<v Speaker 2>perform.</v>

619
00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:04.223
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and aS far as I can tell like </v>

620
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:07.973
<v Speaker 1>malevolence is the willingness to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil and I think the best is the best </v>

621
00:30:11.071 --> 00:30:12.330
<v Speaker 1>definition of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

622
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.160
<v Speaker 1>and I thought about this for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

623
00:30:14.161 --> 00:30:15.780
<v Speaker 1>it's like actually what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

624
00:30:15.781 --> 00:30:17.460
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated and we'll talk about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>

625
00:30:17.461 --> 00:30:20.670
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you want a one line </v>
<v Speaker 1>summary,</v>

626
00:30:20.671 --> 00:30:23.820
<v Speaker 1>it's the desire to do harm for the sake </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the harm.</v>

627
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So you have to think about it as a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of art form.</v>

628
00:30:27.011 --> 00:30:28.390
<v Speaker 1>So like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

629
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:28.710
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

630
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:29.543
<v Speaker 1>if you have a terrorist and you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's hitting an atom bomb in a stadium </v>

631
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:32.830
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

632
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:34.720
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to tell me you have good </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>

633
00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:36.550
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to tell me unless I </v>
<v Speaker 1>torture them.</v>

634
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should torture because</v>
<v Speaker 1>tortures wrong.</v>

635
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.143
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing that and you really </v>

636
00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:44.080
<v Speaker 1>believe these hidden atom bomb in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stadium,</v>

637
00:30:44.081 --> 00:30:44.914
<v Speaker 1>well at least you have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>justification for what you're doing and </v>

638
00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:49.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily that what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is evil.</v>

639
00:30:49.031 --> 00:30:51.520
<v Speaker 1>It might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be misguided.</v>

640
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's to say in a situation like that,</v>

641
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 1>it should certainly be illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least you can say,</v>

642
00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:01.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a plausible explanation for it,</v>

643
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:04.000
<v Speaker 1>but lots of situations where there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute horror,</v>

644
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:06.580
<v Speaker 1>there's no plausible explanation for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

645
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.040
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

646
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that used to happen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>auschwitz,</v>

647
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.970
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>auschwitz,</v>

648
00:31:14.971 --> 00:31:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you guys envisioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you envisioned concentration camps,</v>

649
00:31:18.241 --> 00:31:20.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like concentration camp.</v>

650
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny name first of all because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really at camp.</v>

651
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.593
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a concentration camp is like a </v>

652
00:31:27.391 --> 00:31:29.010
<v Speaker 1>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

653
00:31:29.011 --> 00:31:31.230
<v Speaker 1>and that's easy to scan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to envision them,</v>

654
00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:33.780
<v Speaker 1>like a prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those bloody things where cities,</v>

655
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have tens of thousands of people in</v>

656
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.390
<v Speaker 1>sort of their massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least they were large towns.</v>

657
00:31:39.391 --> 00:31:41.940
<v Speaker 1>So these are very big places anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

658
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.293
<v Speaker 1>at the typical concentration camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trains would come rolling in and of </v>

659
00:31:46.381 --> 00:31:48.740
<v Speaker 1>course people have been packed into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn trains,</v>

660
00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:50.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well worse than animals.</v>

661
00:31:50.191 --> 00:31:51.024
<v Speaker 1>They'd be packed standing and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just died in the cars because </v>

662
00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:54.323
<v Speaker 1>especially if they are old or little in </v>
<v Speaker 1>or had some respiratory problem or </v>

663
00:31:57.691 --> 00:31:58.524
<v Speaker 1>something like that because they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>overheat if they were cramped right in </v>

664
00:32:00.421 --> 00:32:01.254
<v Speaker 1>the middle of people or they'd freeze to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death on the outsIde because they're </v>

665
00:32:03.181 --> 00:32:05.100
<v Speaker 1>pushed right against the wood or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

666
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.113
<v Speaker 1>But that was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just made the job easier when they </v>

667
00:32:07.351 --> 00:32:08.970
<v Speaker 1>finally landed at auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

668
00:32:08.971 --> 00:32:09.804
<v Speaker 1>and then once they were in auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then the guards used to like to </v>

669
00:32:13.351 --> 00:32:14.184
<v Speaker 1>play tricks on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one trick would be to get some </v>

670
00:32:15.841 --> 00:32:17.340
<v Speaker 1>poor son of a bitch who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

671
00:32:17.341 --> 00:32:20.490
<v Speaker 1>being torn away from his country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who'd had his family destroyed,</v>

672
00:32:20.491 --> 00:32:21.324
<v Speaker 1>who knew where he was going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was half dead for six different </v>

673
00:32:23.701 --> 00:32:25.290
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who iS among strangers.</v>

674
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.243
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he dIdn't even speak or she didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even speak the language that was most </v>

675
00:32:29.311 --> 00:32:30.700
<v Speaker 1>common there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:35.900
<v Speaker 1>guarded by absolutely ruthless </v>
<v Speaker 1>barbarians who wanted to do nothing else</v>

677
00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>but make people as miserable as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>in is in the most creative</v>

678
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.873
<v Speaker 3>possible ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what they would do with some of </v>

679
00:32:42.981 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 3>the prisoners would say give them wet </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacks of salt.</v>

680
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:46.604
<v Speaker 3>and so those weigh about 100 pounds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd have them carry them from one </v>

681
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:52.400
<v Speaker 3>side of the compound to the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

682
00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:55.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not so bad when you're really,</v>

683
00:32:55.101 --> 00:32:59.150
<v Speaker 3>really Innovative in your capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>perpetrate evil.</v>

684
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:01.250
<v Speaker 3>But the next thing they did was carried </v>
<v Speaker 3>them back.</v>

685
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.500
<v Speaker 3>And so you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

686
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.860
<v Speaker 3>and this is something half to understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to understand evil,</v>

687
00:33:06.861 --> 00:33:09.950
<v Speaker 3>is that it's an aesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's An art form.</v>

688
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.953
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that that was such a </v>

689
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 3>terrible torture was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

690
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:14.804
<v Speaker 3>partly because these people were already</v>
<v Speaker 3>ruined and 100 pounds is a lot of salt </v>

691
00:33:18.051 --> 00:33:20.090
<v Speaker 3>and maybe it was winter and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have any shoes.</v>

692
00:33:20.091 --> 00:33:22.130
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's just brutal labor.</v>

693
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.653
<v Speaker 3>But solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he wrote about the gulag </v>

694
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Speaker 3>archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

695
00:33:26.091 --> 00:33:27.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you were a prisoner,</v>

696
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.580
<v Speaker 3>they were having you build a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can at least take some damn pride in</v>

697
00:33:31.581 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 3>building the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

698
00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 3>you could lay some bricks out and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can think,</v>

699
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:36.710
<v Speaker 3>well this sucks and it's really horrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything,</v>

700
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I built a straight wall that something.</v>

701
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 3>BuT if you have to take a sack of wet </v>
<v Speaker 3>salt,</v>

702
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:45.020
<v Speaker 3>the one side of the compound and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>carry it back,</v>

703
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:47.870
<v Speaker 3>like the net consequence of that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>zero,</v>

704
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's zero.</v>

705
00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:50.223
<v Speaker 3>Then of course the famous signs on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of the concentration camps were </v>

706
00:33:55.430 --> 00:34:00.380
<v Speaker 3>work will set you free right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another joke.</v>

707
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:04.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like mutual assured destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

708
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.500
<v Speaker 3>and the only way you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

709
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.960
<v Speaker 3>a job like that is st stanek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no other way to think about it.</v>

710
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:13.003
<v Speaker 3>The a job like that comes out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>deepest depths of human malevolence and </v>

711
00:34:17.991 --> 00:34:20.390
<v Speaker 3>then the work that sets you free when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't even work,</v>

712
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

713
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.850
<v Speaker 3>it was at parody of work and the purpose</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the work was to destroy you,</v>

714
00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:30.851
<v Speaker 3>but not quickly because that's not as </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible as destroying you slowly,</v>

715
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.530
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are very,</v>

716
00:34:33.531 --> 00:34:34.364
<v Speaker 3>very terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so part of what I thought about in </v>

717
00:34:37.311 --> 00:34:39.650
<v Speaker 3>relationship to people's belief systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

718
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:42.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are territorial chimps,</v>

719
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know this or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but chimps basically go to war.</v>

720
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Jane goodall diScovered that a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>decades ago and it really,</v>

721
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:53.580
<v Speaker 3>really was hard on her because she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a ruse soviet.</v>

722
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.883
<v Speaker 3>So for those of you don't know joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>john jacques rousseau is a french </v>

723
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.090
<v Speaker 3>philosopher and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

724
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.720
<v Speaker 3>french philosophers have a lawful lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sins on their conscience.</v>

725
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.590
<v Speaker 3>And then of course it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

726
00:35:03.591 --> 00:35:07.190
<v Speaker 3>it was certainly one of them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>russell was the first,</v>

727
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:08.443
<v Speaker 3>like what fully articulate promoter of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that human beings were </v>

728
00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:14.900
<v Speaker 3>basically good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know we had a good soul in a moral</v>

729
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:15.734
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were corrupted by our social </v>

730
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:19.400
<v Speaker 3>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

731
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:20.743
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

732
00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:23.571
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

733
00:35:23.571 --> 00:35:26.870
<v Speaker 3>as far as russo was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of a noble savage idea.</v>

734
00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:27.704
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the human being in their raw form </v>

735
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:30.540
<v Speaker 3>has a pure soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

736
00:35:30.541 --> 00:35:31.374
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give them to parents and you've </v>

737
00:35:32.121 --> 00:35:32.954
<v Speaker 3>given them to teachers and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd get into politics and there's </v>

738
00:35:35.331 --> 00:35:37.560
<v Speaker 3>group disputes and then they get all </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupted,</v>

739
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and well,</v>

740
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:40.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

741
00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.673
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what to say about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>except that it's absolutely moronic </v>

742
00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.653
<v Speaker 3>keynote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's an appealing proposition if </v>

743
00:35:46.351 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 3>you're naive optimist.</v>

744
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.241
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

745
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:49.074
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't explain where malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from because the people created </v>

746
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:53.820
<v Speaker 3>the institution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

747
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:54.654
<v Speaker 3>it just puts you into an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 3>regress chicken and egg if the </v>

748
00:35:57.571 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 3>institutions are reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>BUt the people who built them aren't.</v>

749
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Then where did the reprehensible element</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the institutions come from,</v>

750
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.093
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might think it's an autogenerated </v>

751
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.630
<v Speaker 3>consequences of organizing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

752
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty specious theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm of course hit.</v>

753
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.060
<v Speaker 3>He had a counterpart of philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 3>counterpart,</v>

754
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Hobbs and hobbs said basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the opposite,</v>

755
00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:18.840
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

756
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.673
<v Speaker 3>people were vicious and cruel unless you</v>
<v Speaker 3>put them in straight jackets </v>

757
00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:24.204
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally and made them obey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then everything was going to go </v>

758
00:36:26.761 --> 00:36:29.960
<v Speaker 3>immediately to help you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>

759
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.350
<v Speaker 3>when you saw what happened in Iran after</v>
<v Speaker 3>the americans won't stand in,</v>

760
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.060
<v Speaker 3>the power structure disintegrated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

761
00:36:35.061 --> 00:36:36.510
<v Speaker 3>it was a hell of a lot more like hobbs.</v>

762
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Then it was like rousseau,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

763
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.380
<v Speaker 3>You took out the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

764
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tyrant at the top.</v>

765
00:36:41.461 --> 00:36:43.650
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't like everybody got all </v>
<v Speaker 3>peaceful and loving.</v>

766
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:46.070
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden it was like absolute </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos reign.</v>

767
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.160
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

768
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.130
<v Speaker 3>of course you can rationalize that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

769
00:36:50.131 --> 00:36:51.450
<v Speaker 3>roost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by the way,</v>

770
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:54.900
<v Speaker 3>had five children by a made a </v>
<v Speaker 3>illiterate,</v>

771
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:56.210
<v Speaker 3>made that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was as mr.</v>

772
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:58.560
<v Speaker 3>And he put every single one of them in </v>
<v Speaker 3>orphanages where,</v>

773
00:36:58.561 --> 00:36:59.394
<v Speaker 3>of course they perished because </v>
<v Speaker 3>orphanages at russo's times were not </v>

774
00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:03.960
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

775
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:04.973
<v Speaker 3>a luxury resort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even up until the beginning of the </v>

776
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:09.780
<v Speaker 3>20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most children who are under one years of</v>

777
00:37:09.781 --> 00:37:14.781
<v Speaker 3>age who were in care institutions died </v>
<v Speaker 3>partly disease and that sort of thing.</v>

778
00:37:15.151 --> 00:37:16.940
<v Speaker 3>But often because they just weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>touched,</v>

779
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:20.250
<v Speaker 3>they weren't cared for physically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if they were fed and you know,</v>

780
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:22.320
<v Speaker 3>200 years ago they weren't even fed.</v>

781
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.570
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

782
00:37:25.571 --> 00:37:26.940
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nonetheless,</v>

783
00:37:26.941 --> 00:37:28.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have people</v>

784
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.440
<v Speaker 3>maintain the optimistic idea that human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings were basically good and that they</v>

785
00:37:34.441 --> 00:37:37.350
<v Speaker 3>were corrupted by institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a common idea among,</v>

786
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a very common idea in </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities,</v>

787
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:40.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because university people are always </v>

788
00:37:41.701 --> 00:37:45.420
<v Speaker 3>complaining about the corrupt nature of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this institution and that institution,</v>

789
00:37:45.421 --> 00:37:46.254
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they sit here in the warm with the </v>

790
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:51.190
<v Speaker 3>electricity on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

791
00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.453
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by wealth that characterizes </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe one 10th of one percent of the </v>

792
00:37:55.411 --> 00:37:56.244
<v Speaker 3>entire world's population and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they complained about how we'll press </v>

793
00:37:58.771 --> 00:38:01.130
<v Speaker 3>they are and how will we get no nasty?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The institutions are,</v>

794
00:38:01.131 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

795
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 3>well you actually have been to a nasty </v>
<v Speaker 3>institution,</v>

796
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:08.940
<v Speaker 3>cause nasty institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get pretty damn bad and most of the</v>

797
00:38:08.941 --> 00:38:09.774
<v Speaker 3>institutions in the world are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it isn't exactly clear that people </v>

798
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:16.820
<v Speaker 3>are pristine in their heart and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupted by institutions.</v>

799
00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Although I'm sure that happens patent </v>
<v Speaker 3>depends around,</v>

800
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:21.630
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

801
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:25.560
<v Speaker 3>this has been a line of philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 3>speculation.</v>

802
00:38:25.561 --> 00:38:26.470
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

803
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:27.383
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say constituted one of the </v>

804
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:34.360
<v Speaker 3>unspoken fundamental assumptions of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of western intellectuals in particular,</v>

805
00:38:34.361 --> 00:38:36.230
<v Speaker 3>and jane thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

806
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 3>it'd be in many ways the same way she </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought chimps were basically at all.</v>

807
00:38:39.311 --> 00:38:41.350
<v Speaker 3>They're just animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are okay.</v>

808
00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:45.490
<v Speaker 3>They coexist relatively peacefully with </v>
<v Speaker 3>one another,</v>

809
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:46.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>

810
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.493
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

811
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.180
<v Speaker 3>Carl Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I talk about a bit in my personality</v>

812
00:38:54.181 --> 00:38:54.631
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

813
00:38:54.631 --> 00:38:57.780
<v Speaker 3>he basically thought that people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally good and that institutions</v>

814
00:38:57.781 --> 00:38:59.620
<v Speaker 3>make the badge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

815
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.910
<v Speaker 3>the problem is you look at chimps and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair bit like us,</v>

816
00:39:02.911 --> 00:39:04.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bonobos,</v>

817
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.510
<v Speaker 3>you can look at them too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>

818
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.363
<v Speaker 3>they're genetically quite related to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're quite a bit different than </v>

819
00:39:08.731 --> 00:39:09.301
<v Speaker 3>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

820
00:39:09.301 --> 00:39:11.910
<v Speaker 3>So we're sort of a weird mixture of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>two in some sense.</v>

821
00:39:11.911 --> 00:39:13.710
<v Speaker 3>But champs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those things,</v>

822
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.353
<v Speaker 3>there is no evidence that they really </v>
<v Speaker 3>have any internal control over the </v>

823
00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:20.220
<v Speaker 3>regression at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

824
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.083
<v Speaker 3>there was a horrible case about two </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago where a woman was interacting </v>

825
00:39:24.601 --> 00:39:27.320
<v Speaker 3>with the chimp and it tore her to pieces</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they can do that man.</v>

826
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:32.040
<v Speaker 3>Like it took her face right off and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the strength of about six men,</v>

827
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:32.891
<v Speaker 3>like an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an,</v>

828
00:39:32.891 --> 00:39:33.724
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an adult male chimp can break a 300 </v>

829
00:39:35.311 --> 00:39:37.210
<v Speaker 3>pound test cable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

830
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:41.280
<v Speaker 3>those things are really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really strong and they are not friendly,</v>

831
00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.653
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

832
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:43.703
<v Speaker 3>So in arnhem zoo for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been a troop of chimps there </v>

833
00:39:49.051 --> 00:39:53.580
<v Speaker 3>that have been followed by it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely brilliant primatologists named</v>

834
00:39:53.581 --> 00:39:56.190
<v Speaker 3>frans de waal who's work I would very </v>
<v Speaker 3>highly recommend.</v>

835
00:39:56.191 --> 00:39:57.024
<v Speaker 3>The wall is a very smart guy and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at the origins of morality and </v>

836
00:39:59.551 --> 00:40:00.900
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

837
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.880
<v Speaker 3>from a biological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

838
00:40:02.881 --> 00:40:03.930
<v Speaker 3>very nice work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

839
00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:05.520
<v Speaker 3>very clearheaded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

840
00:40:05.521 --> 00:40:09.870
<v Speaker 3>he's recounted absolutely horrific </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories of chimpanzee behavior.</v>

841
00:40:09.871 --> 00:40:12.660
<v Speaker 3>So one of the stories he talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

842
00:40:12.661 --> 00:40:13.710
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

843
00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:16.740
<v Speaker 3>when you kind of have this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a mail chimp hierarchy,</v>

844
00:40:16.741 --> 00:40:18.870
<v Speaker 3>it's roughly true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a female hierarchy too,</v>

845
00:40:18.871 --> 00:40:21.900
<v Speaker 3>but the males and the chimp world </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways tend to be the dominant ones.</v>

846
00:40:21.901 --> 00:40:22.734
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of think of a dominant primate </v>

847
00:40:24.421 --> 00:40:25.890
<v Speaker 3>like a prize fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

848
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.580
<v Speaker 3>pretty much he's ruling because of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical prowess.</v>

849
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Now that turns out not to exactly be </v>
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>

850
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.173
<v Speaker 3>but in this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was running the chimp troop </v>

851
00:40:35.911 --> 00:40:38.670
<v Speaker 3>was a bit of a bully and he wasn't very </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at making friends,</v>

852
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:39.803
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not such a good idea because </v>

853
00:40:41.011 --> 00:40:41.844
<v Speaker 3>no matter how tough you are by yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>to weaker guys can probably take you </v>

854
00:40:44.431 --> 00:40:44.640
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

855
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.473
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happened during friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>to wall observations and two chimps </v>

856
00:40:48.751 --> 00:40:51.210
<v Speaker 3>attack the leader and they had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>coalition.</v>

857
00:40:51.211 --> 00:40:52.850
<v Speaker 3>They were grooming each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They repels,</v>

858
00:40:52.851 --> 00:40:54.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in chimps are pretty good at remembering</v>

859
00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.160
<v Speaker 3>like risk reciprocal relationships and </v>
<v Speaker 3>having friendships really like they have</v>

860
00:40:59.161 --> 00:41:00.840
<v Speaker 3>a very highly social structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

861
00:41:00.841 --> 00:41:01.674
<v Speaker 3>just tore him apart like the things they</v>
<v Speaker 3>did to him like you don't even want to </v>

862
00:41:03.991 --> 00:41:07.110
<v Speaker 3>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so chimps have really no upper limit</v>

863
00:41:07.111 --> 00:41:09.930
<v Speaker 3>on their capacity for aggression and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they hunt,</v>

864
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.490
<v Speaker 3>because chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honda and they liked me,</v>

865
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.300
<v Speaker 3>they often call us monkeys and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>weigh about 35 pounds,</v>

866
00:41:15.301 --> 00:41:16.134
<v Speaker 3>like a cola.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This monkeys a major league animal and </v>

867
00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:20.280
<v Speaker 3>they eat those things alive and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>scream while they're being killed.</v>

868
00:41:20.281 --> 00:41:22.410
<v Speaker 3>And that does not slow the chimps down </v>
<v Speaker 3>one bit.</v>

869
00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.550
<v Speaker 3>So it's not obvious that the chimp is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really a creature of a lot of empathy,</v>

870
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.900
<v Speaker 3>especially the males.</v>

871
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:28.943
<v Speaker 3>The females are likely more empathic </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they have to deal with infants </v>

872
00:41:31.231 --> 00:41:32.064
<v Speaker 3>for longer periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What seems to inhibit the aggression of </v>

873
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:38.540
<v Speaker 3>mail chimp's isn't anything they hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>internally.</v>

874
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:41.270
<v Speaker 3>It seems that when they get hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive in the truth,</v>

875
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:44.210
<v Speaker 3>the truth gets more and more agitated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically shuts them down.</v>

876
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.780
<v Speaker 3>So you can imagine maybe you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rough bar and some dingbat who is,</v>

877
00:41:47.781 --> 00:41:48.614
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half psychopathic and has had two pints </v>

878
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:51.374
<v Speaker 3>of alcohol is starting to cause a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of trouble and he's </v>

879
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:56.960
<v Speaker 3>not going to shut himself down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the rest of the troop might.</v>

880
00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:01.130
<v Speaker 3>And that kind of means that the control </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the aggression is externalized.</v>

881
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.650
<v Speaker 3>It's not a consequence of super ego </v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

882
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 3>And we like to think that we actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>control our own aggression,</v>

883
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:09.730
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not so sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

884
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 3>if you read things like there's a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

885
00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:16.490
<v Speaker 3>horrifying book published about 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago called the rape of nanking,</v>

886
00:42:16.491 --> 00:42:19.310
<v Speaker 3>which is while the woman who wrote it </v>
<v Speaker 3>committed suicide.</v>

887
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:20.143
<v Speaker 3>So that sort of suffices to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the rape of nan king is about and </v>

888
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a story about the japanese in world</v>
<v Speaker 3>war ii going into a chinese kitty's city</v>

889
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:31.370
<v Speaker 3>called nan king where I believe about </v>
<v Speaker 3>350,000 people were killed.</v>

890
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:34.080
<v Speaker 3>And the nazis in that story where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>good guys.</v>

891
00:42:34.081 --> 00:42:37.520
<v Speaker 3>So you can imagine the kind of brutality</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be an been occurring there.</v>

892
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.593
<v Speaker 3>But there's absolutely perfectly well </v>
<v Speaker 3>documented evidence suggesting that the </v>

893
00:42:42.471 --> 00:42:45.920
<v Speaker 3>japanese soldiers engaged in competitive</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutality.</v>

894
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.313
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so really what happened was the </v>

895
00:42:48.531 --> 00:42:49.364
<v Speaker 3>japanese had been pretty militarized by </v>
<v Speaker 3>world war two and nate adopted a </v>

896
00:42:52.251 --> 00:42:55.790
<v Speaker 3>prussian education system and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prussians and the germans,</v>

897
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:56.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pre,</v>

898
00:42:56.781 --> 00:42:57.614
<v Speaker 3>pre 20th century germans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were basically interested in </v>

899
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.130
<v Speaker 3>educating obedient soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

900
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.993
<v Speaker 3>because it was a militaristic culture </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the japanese kind of adopted that </v>

901
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:07.964
<v Speaker 3>because they were sick of being kicked </v>
<v Speaker 3>around by the europeans and pretty </v>

902
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:12.170
<v Speaker 3>successfully because they defeated the </v>
<v Speaker 3>russians,</v>

903
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:13.004
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the early stages of rural or of the </v>

904
00:43:14.601 --> 00:43:15.290
<v Speaker 3>20th century.</v>

905
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.120
<v Speaker 3>It wAs quite a shock to everyone in </v>
<v Speaker 3>europe and,</v>

906
00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause for great celebration in Japan and</v>

907
00:43:19.791 --> 00:43:20.870
<v Speaker 3>no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

908
00:43:20.871 --> 00:43:24.290
<v Speaker 3>they militarize the hell out of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>young men and taught them basically that</v>

909
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:26.420
<v Speaker 3>the japanese were a master race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

910
00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:28.190
<v Speaker 3>and that other people were subhuman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

911
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.470
<v Speaker 3>it's a very common human way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thInking.</v>

912
00:43:30.471 --> 00:43:31.304
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's really the default way </v>

913
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.650
<v Speaker 3>that human tribes think about other </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribes.</v>

914
00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:37.581
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

915
00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:38.414
<v Speaker 3>it's a little more complicated than that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because human tribes tend to trade with </v>

916
00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:44.870
<v Speaker 3>other tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not all demonization,</v>

917
00:43:44.871 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

918
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:48.950
<v Speaker 3>and if you look around the world in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropological literature,</v>

919
00:43:48.951 --> 00:43:49.784
<v Speaker 3>what you see Is that the names that most</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribes have for themselves is something </v>

920
00:43:53.811 --> 00:43:56.960
<v Speaker 3>like that human beings or the people you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

921
00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.600
<v Speaker 3>indicating that the rest of the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are reading people,</v>

922
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:00.463
<v Speaker 3>god only they're barbarians or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they live out where the sun is being </v>

923
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:05.690
<v Speaker 3>eaten by the dragon of the night or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

924
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:07.970
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the word barbarian is a,</v>

925
00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:12.030
<v Speaker 3>is a word that comes from the greeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>making fun of how non-greek spoke,</v>

926
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought they went bar bar,</v>

927
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:14.331
<v Speaker 3>bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bar,</v>

928
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:15.650
<v Speaker 3>bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

929
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.320
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what good.</v>

930
00:44:18.321 --> 00:44:19.880
<v Speaker 3>All phone was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The chimps,</v>

931
00:44:19.881 --> 00:44:22.380
<v Speaker 3>like the chimp adolescents in particular</v>
<v Speaker 3>in particular,</v>

932
00:44:22.381 --> 00:44:23.214
<v Speaker 3>the males would patrol the borders of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their territory in groups of three or </v>

933
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 3>four and with often with a female or </v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

934
00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.970
<v Speaker 3>but the females didn't seem to be really</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

935
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.313
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

936
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.633
<v Speaker 3>they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were more part of the group rather </v>

937
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:38.244
<v Speaker 3>than the initiators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what the chimps would do is if they </v>

938
00:44:40.171 --> 00:44:41.004
<v Speaker 3>found a chip from another troop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if that was a chimp that had moved </v>

939
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:47.670
<v Speaker 3>from their troop in the not too distant </v>
<v Speaker 3>past and joined another,</v>

940
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.340
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes the males leave and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they go to other troops.</v>

941
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.413
<v Speaker 3>If they are numbered them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would tear them to pIeces and it </v>

942
00:44:53.971 --> 00:44:57.360
<v Speaker 3>looked like that's why they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the border patrol.</v>

943
00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:00.690
<v Speaker 3>They're looking for trouble there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gangs roughly speaking,</v>

944
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:02.650
<v Speaker 3>they're looking for trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point of it is,</v>

945
00:45:02.651 --> 00:45:03.484
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would only attack if they </v>

946
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:08.370
<v Speaker 3>outnumbered because chimps can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say they count,</v>

947
00:45:08.371 --> 00:45:12.810
<v Speaker 3>but they have a rudimentary notion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>group size.</v>

948
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:13.644
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can count without </v>

949
00:45:14.941 --> 00:45:17.760
<v Speaker 3>being able to verbalize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can estimate at a glance.</v>

950
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.140
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

951
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.180
<v Speaker 3>when I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I say tear apart,</v>

952
00:45:21.181 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no upper limit on the brutality.</v>

953
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:29.370
<v Speaker 3>And so good all discovered that first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she didn't tell anybody about it.</v>

954
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:30.623
<v Speaker 3>Now she had her reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some of them I think </v>

955
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:33.870
<v Speaker 3>radiological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh the lovely chimps,</v>

956
00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:35.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fair enough.</v>

957
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:40.320
<v Speaker 3>But some of it was also she thought that</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the chimps had been corrupted as a</v>

958
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:41.154
<v Speaker 3>consequence of their contact with human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings and that their natural behavior </v>

959
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 3>had been somehow transform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

960
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:48.710
<v Speaker 3>and that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's reasonable to be cautious if you're</v>

961
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.400
<v Speaker 3>a scientist before you go out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

962
00:45:50.401 --> 00:45:51.420
<v Speaker 3>chimps go to war.</v>

963
00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.640
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that revolutionary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it is,</v>

964
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it just,</v>

965
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.370
<v Speaker 3>it just ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that our warlike and malevolent</v>

966
00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:02.340
<v Speaker 3>nature is a function of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if chimps do it well,</v>

967
00:46:02.341 --> 00:46:04.050
<v Speaker 3>what did they perverted by their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture?</v>

968
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

969
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:06.833
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are more and less violent </v>
<v Speaker 3>chimp cultures and there are more and </v>

970
00:46:10.411 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 3>less violent baboons culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is some cultural variation.</v>

971
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.753
<v Speaker 3>But since goodall's time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of behavior is being </v>

972
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:19.470
<v Speaker 3>documented on many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many chimp troops.</v>

973
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.160
<v Speaker 3>So that's us in a nutshell and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>self evident that if you put the typical</v>

974
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.273
<v Speaker 3>adolescent male say who's not a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well formulated personality and you </v>

975
00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.890
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's not that individual and you</v>

976
00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.740
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't seen much of the world and the</v>

977
00:46:34.741 --> 00:46:36.890
<v Speaker 3>typical guy that goes into the army is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

978
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.300
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of on the margins of society.</v>

979
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.350
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's not particularly bright and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to be insulting by that,</v>

980
00:46:43.351 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not exactly a high end job.</v>

981
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.400
<v Speaker 3>You put someone that like that either </v>
<v Speaker 3>place where there's no rules.</v>

982
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:55.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like who leads where.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no rules while the probability</v>

983
00:46:55.591 --> 00:46:57.840
<v Speaker 3>that it's the friendliest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nicest people is very,</v>

984
00:46:57.841 --> 00:47:00.810
<v Speaker 3>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what seemed to happen in nan king</v>

985
00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:01.644
<v Speaker 3>was the japanese soldiers took their </v>
<v Speaker 3>cues from the people with the most </v>

986
00:47:03.751 --> 00:47:06.960
<v Speaker 3>brutal imaginations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

987
00:47:06.961 --> 00:47:09.330
<v Speaker 3>when people can have pretty brutal </v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginations,</v>

988
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:12.150
<v Speaker 3>especially when they start to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

989
00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.640
<v Speaker 3>so I was interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

990
00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.570
<v Speaker 3>what exactly was at the core of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence mean,</v>

991
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:21.090
<v Speaker 3>and I think it is uniquely human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The chimps.</v>

992
00:47:21.091 --> 00:47:23.400
<v Speaker 3>So go tear another chimp apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically they just,</v>

993
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:24.630
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to kill him,</v>

994
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:25.523
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's their goal and maybe it takes a </v>

995
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:28.830
<v Speaker 3>while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not going to take four weeks.</v>

996
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:30.453
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you're a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you can draw out your enemies </v>

997
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.333
<v Speaker 3>death for a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very long period of time and part of </v>

998
00:47:35.381 --> 00:47:36.214
<v Speaker 3>that is the desire to produce the misery</v>
<v Speaker 3>and suffering that's attended on the </v>

999
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:41.980
<v Speaker 3>death and only human beings have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination to do that.</v>

1000
00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.470
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll return to this.</v>

1001
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.480
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think that in the book of </v>
<v Speaker 3>genesis,</v>

1002
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:49.120
<v Speaker 3>when people's eyes are open and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>become self conscious,</v>

1003
00:47:49.121 --> 00:47:49.954
<v Speaker 3>they always are all always all solar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Learn the difference between good and </v>

1004
00:47:52.991 --> 00:47:53.824
<v Speaker 3>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once your eyes are open and you know </v>

1005
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:56.404
<v Speaker 3>what you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you know you're naked and </v>

1006
00:47:57.521 --> 00:47:58.354
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can exploit that in other </v>

1007
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:00.334
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And only human beings have that kInd of </v>

1008
00:48:02.111 --> 00:48:02.944
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the fact that we know that we can be </v>

1009
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:08.960
<v Speaker 3>hurt makes us particularly dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if I know how I can be heard,</v>

1010
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 3>I sure know how you can be heard.</v>

1011
00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.363
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a nasty situation and then of </v>

1012
00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 3>course I'm kind of interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation for that.</v>

1013
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.033
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at the columbine kids for </v>

1014
00:48:19.061 --> 00:48:20.410
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1015
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.363
<v Speaker 3>the mayhem and they produced was trivial</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to the mayhem they were </v>

1016
00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 3>planning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1017
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:25.924
<v Speaker 3>if it was up to those two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have bombed detroit flat </v>

1018
00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:28.611
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1019
00:48:28.611 --> 00:48:29.444
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had visions of doing exactly that </v>

1020
00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.660
<v Speaker 3>and it was immediate spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they didn't do it because they were,</v>

1021
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:35.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor kids in some sense who were </v>

1022
00:48:37.511 --> 00:48:39.700
<v Speaker 3>bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is an idiotic explanation.</v>

1023
00:48:39.701 --> 00:48:41.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1024
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 3>everybody's at bloody outsider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1025
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:44.763
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there isn't a single one of you</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't have a memory from junior </v>

1026
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:50.050
<v Speaker 3>high where you were an outcast in one </v>
<v Speaker 3>way or another,</v>

1027
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.880
<v Speaker 3>maybe some of the word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very,</v>

1028
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:52.714
<v Speaker 3>very common.</v>

1029
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.060
<v Speaker 3>And to think of that as sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation to,</v>

1030
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot people cold bloodedly in high </v>

1031
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.840
<v Speaker 3>highschool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

1032
00:48:58.841 --> 00:49:01.750
<v Speaker 3>that's a little on the naive side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm very,</v>

1033
00:49:01.751 --> 00:49:04.390
<v Speaker 3>very interested in what makes up that </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation.</v>

1034
00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because malevolence plus nuclear weapons</v>

1035
00:49:07.931 --> 00:49:08.764
<v Speaker 3>is not a good combination and so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really look to me like we can </v>

1036
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:12.574
<v Speaker 3>afford that kind of unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence anymore because we're just </v>

1037
00:49:15.551 --> 00:49:16.384
<v Speaker 3>too damn powerful and if the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>person ends up being like that with the </v>

1038
00:49:18.941 --> 00:49:21.040
<v Speaker 3>wrong weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like game's over.</v>

1039
00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:22.323
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've also become convinced while I'd </v>

1040
00:49:25.331 --> 00:49:26.164
<v Speaker 3>been looking through this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the problem that we're discussing </v>

1041
00:49:28.481 --> 00:49:32.440
<v Speaker 3>is not associate logical problem or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political problem or an economic problem</v>

1042
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:33.363
<v Speaker 3>because you know a lot of what you read </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of political scientists who </v>

1043
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.573
<v Speaker 3>tell you this sort of thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're basically almost always closet </v>

1044
00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 3>marxists.</v>

1045
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.680
<v Speaker 3>They'll tell you that the reason for for</v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle for competition between nations</v>

1046
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 3>economic and I think that's observed not</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it isn't true,</v>

1047
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:51.580
<v Speaker 3>but because it doesn't actually address </v>
<v Speaker 3>a more fundamental issue,</v>

1048
00:49:51.581 --> 00:49:52.414
<v Speaker 3>which is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well economic struggle is a struggle </v>

1049
00:49:54.581 --> 00:49:55.414
<v Speaker 3>about who has access to what's valued,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing self evident about </v>

1050
00:50:00.551 --> 00:50:02.950
<v Speaker 3>what's valued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

1051
00:50:02.951 --> 00:50:05.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the idea of natural resource.</v>

1052
00:50:05.321 --> 00:50:10.321
<v Speaker 3>It's like oil is not a natural resource </v>
<v Speaker 3>till you have an automobile.</v>

1053
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.213
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the interplay between cultural </v>

1054
00:50:14.531 --> 00:50:15.760
<v Speaker 3>values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>structures,</v>

1055
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:20.490
<v Speaker 3>and what constitutes a natural resources</v>
<v Speaker 3>so tightly put together except for maybe</v>

1056
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:23.380
<v Speaker 3>air and water that saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1057
00:50:23.381 --> 00:50:24.214
<v Speaker 3>there are natural resources which means </v>
<v Speaker 3>things of intrinsic value and that's </v>

1058
00:50:27.231 --> 00:50:29.030
<v Speaker 3>what people fight over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1059
00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:29.830
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1060
00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:30.663
<v Speaker 3>you did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you made the mystery mystery disappear </v>

1061
00:50:32.301 --> 00:50:35.570
<v Speaker 3>inside the word natural resource,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you haven't solved anything.</v>

1062
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1063
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 3>why would people fight over things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they value?</v>

1064
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:41.383
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's all sorts of things you </v>

1065
00:50:42.291 --> 00:50:44.870
<v Speaker 3>could value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like peace for example.</v>

1066
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:49.060
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a suFficient explanation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1067
00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:50.923
<v Speaker 3>and it's also not clear to me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's primary motivations are </v>

1068
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 3>economic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1069
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.630
<v Speaker 3>it's one element of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not trIvial,</v>

1070
00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.090
<v Speaker 3>but I would say the motivation isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even really economic.</v>

1071
00:50:59.091 --> 00:51:01.820
<v Speaker 3>It's more related to dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy position.</v>

1072
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:04.010
<v Speaker 3>And that's fundamentally a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation,</v>

1073
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:06.830
<v Speaker 3>especially for men because men are </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher up in the dorm,</v>

1074
00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:07.664
<v Speaker 3>male dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then women are much more attracted to </v>

1075
00:51:09.261 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you could make,</v>

1076
00:51:11.061 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 3>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's economics.</v>

1077
00:51:12.711 --> 00:51:13.544
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this economic is just a secondary </v>

1078
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:17.114
<v Speaker 3>consequences of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't believe by the way that </v>

1079
00:51:18.721 --> 00:51:19.554
<v Speaker 3>that's a theory because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>excellent documentation on hyper </v>

1080
00:51:22.431 --> 00:51:23.264
<v Speaker 3>aggression in adolescent males and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best evidence suggests that adolescent </v>

1081
00:51:26.901 --> 00:51:27.734
<v Speaker 3>males become hyper aggressive when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>put them in situations where they can't </v>

1082
00:51:30.261 --> 00:51:31.094
<v Speaker 3>win and then they become hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive and ended attempt to </v>

1083
00:51:33.171 --> 00:51:34.004
<v Speaker 3>formulate a dominance hierarchy so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them can rise to the top and </v>

1084
00:51:36.591 --> 00:51:37.424
<v Speaker 3>basically be attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can call that economic if you </v>

1085
00:51:40.941 --> 00:51:41.960
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's,</v>

1086
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 3>I think you're pushing your luck with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of explanation so.</v>

1087
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's basically the background.</v>

1088
00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.173
<v Speaker 3>So when I was investigating this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I first started studying political </v>

1089
00:51:58.481 --> 00:51:59.360
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1090
00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.213
<v Speaker 3>and I actually liked that quite a bit in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first couple of years because </v>

1091
00:52:01.771 --> 00:52:03.730
<v Speaker 3>they're just basically reading political</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy,</v>

1092
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's actually worthwhile reading </v>

1093
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:07.023
<v Speaker 3>great political philosophers because a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could think and that's a really </v>

1094
00:52:09.671 --> 00:52:10.960
<v Speaker 3>good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And b,</v>

1095
00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.810
<v Speaker 3>you think like they think even if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know it,</v>

1096
00:52:13.811 --> 00:52:14.644
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the hallmarks of a great </v>

1097
00:52:16.151 --> 00:52:16.984
<v Speaker 3>philosopher is that his ideas or her </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas sink into the culture so deeply </v>

1098
00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:24.640
<v Speaker 3>that like 100 years after they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>written,</v>

1099
00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:26.680
<v Speaker 3>everybody just thinks they always </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought that way.</v>

1100
00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.560
<v Speaker 3>Like that'S one of the thIngs say that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to freud.</v>

1101
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:30.503
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody kind of understands </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's an unconscious and that </v>

1102
00:52:32.711 --> 00:52:34.790
<v Speaker 3>people are motivated by sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1103
00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:36.430
<v Speaker 3>sexual drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1104
00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:37.643
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1105
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's so brilliant about that?</v>

1106
00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>

1107
00:52:41.321 --> 00:52:42.970
<v Speaker 3>it's obvious ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freud points it out.</v>

1108
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:44.740
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1109
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:55.880
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started,</v>

1110
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 3>I took political science first and </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature,</v>

1111
00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:03.350
<v Speaker 3>which I found was also extremely useful </v>
<v Speaker 3>because great literary people have great</v>

1112
00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:04.184
<v Speaker 3>things to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like dostoevsky mean what his novels </v>

1113
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:08.744
<v Speaker 3>just absolutely flattened me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so brilliant and I've never read </v>

1114
00:53:12.531 --> 00:53:14.840
<v Speaker 3>anyone who takes moral question so </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

1115
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:16.040
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1116
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:17.623
<v Speaker 3>if you look at crime and punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a book I would highly </v>

1117
00:53:19.221 --> 00:53:20.054
<v Speaker 3>recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dostoevsky is the absolute model of a </v>

1118
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:24.373
<v Speaker 3>true intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I say that because in crime and </v>

1119
00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:28.134
<v Speaker 3>punishment for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dostoevsky has this character named </v>

1120
00:53:31.681 --> 00:53:34.880
<v Speaker 3>roscoe and off and you guys can identify</v>
<v Speaker 3>with risk.</v>

1121
00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:35.763
<v Speaker 3>and the call to some degree because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>about your age and he's a university </v>

1122
00:53:37.771 --> 00:53:40.080
<v Speaker 3>student now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's having a rough time because he's in</v>

1123
00:53:40.081 --> 00:53:40.914
<v Speaker 3>st petersburg and he doesn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>money and he lives in this tiny little </v>

1124
00:53:43.141 --> 00:53:43.974
<v Speaker 3>room which has basically a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes on the bed that he can sleep in </v>

1125
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:48.570
<v Speaker 3>and he's starving to death.</v>

1126
00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.753
<v Speaker 3>It can only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only has bread to eat and he's a law </v>

1127
00:53:51.211 --> 00:53:53.310
<v Speaker 3>student so he's having a rough time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1128
00:53:53.311 --> 00:53:54.144
<v Speaker 3>in st petersburg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of the nIneteenth century is </v>

1129
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:57.330
<v Speaker 3>kind of a rough place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he hasn't,</v>

1130
00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 3>some of you guys probably have is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad,</v>

1131
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 3>but was calling the call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had it pretty bad.</v>

1132
00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:04.260
<v Speaker 3>And so he's half starved and half </v>
<v Speaker 3>delirious.</v>

1133
00:54:04.261 --> 00:54:06.060
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's also very,</v>

1134
00:54:06.061 --> 00:54:06.894
<v Speaker 3>his ideas are very adult because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first russians who really </v>

1135
00:54:10.471 --> 00:54:12.870
<v Speaker 3>considered themselves an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1136
00:54:12.871 --> 00:54:13.704
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia was a medieval society until the </v>

1137
00:54:17.461 --> 00:54:18.780
<v Speaker 3>late name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19 hundreds.</v>

1138
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:22.290
<v Speaker 3>it was sorta like quebec before 1950.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] before 1960.</v>

1139
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:23.693
<v Speaker 3>And I'm serious about that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>quebec was really the last european </v>

1140
00:54:26.341 --> 00:54:27.330
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

1141
00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:28.164
<v Speaker 3>that underwent a secularization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that happened in in about 1960 and </v>

1142
00:54:31.741 --> 00:54:32.574
<v Speaker 3>quebec families went from an average </v>
<v Speaker 3>size of about 12 to 13 to about one </v>

1143
00:54:35.641 --> 00:54:36.474
<v Speaker 3>point two lowest birth rate in the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>and see all the quebecois while we're </v>

1144
00:54:38.941 --> 00:54:42.090
<v Speaker 3>married and none of them are now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were all catholic and hardly any of</v>

1145
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:44.340
<v Speaker 3>them are now and was an overnight </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

1146
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:48.270
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly what fed quebec </v>
<v Speaker 3>nationalism because there was actually a</v>

1147
00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:49.533
<v Speaker 3>study that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a study that was released by gallup </v>

1148
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.823
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only heard it referred to in one </v>

1149
00:54:54.721 --> 00:54:58.550
<v Speaker 3>meeting where they indicated that if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were a lapsed catholic and in,</v>

1150
00:54:58.620 --> 00:54:59.453
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1151
00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:00.563
<v Speaker 3>in quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were 10 times more likely to be a </v>

1152
00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:04.260
<v Speaker 3>separate that that's really worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about,</v>

1153
00:55:04.261 --> 00:55:05.094
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because religion collapses and what </v>

1154
00:55:05.911 --> 00:55:06.744
<v Speaker 3>happens is nationalism just rises up to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take its place because you'd need a </v>

1155
00:55:09.871 --> 00:55:11.700
<v Speaker 3>bloody belief structure because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>else?</v>

1156
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.710
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wander around aimlessly.</v>

1157
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.160
<v Speaker 3>That's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not useless are useful,</v>

1158
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:21.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you just jumped from one structure of</v>

1159
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:23.430
<v Speaker 3>belief to another or you fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1160
00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:26.430
<v Speaker 3>So that's also something that's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>much worth knowing.</v>

1161
00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Finding ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all risk on the cog.</v>

1162
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:29.993
<v Speaker 3>He thinks he's a pretty educated guy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's pretty smart and he is pretty </v>

1163
00:55:32.401 --> 00:55:33.600
<v Speaker 3>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's like smart,</v>

1164
00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:36.180
<v Speaker 3>arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not smart wise because he's 21.</v>

1165
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.013
<v Speaker 3>What the hell does he know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know anything but he's smart </v>

1166
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:40.223
<v Speaker 3>and he's contemptuous of other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he can probably smarter than </v>

1167
00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1168
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.740
<v Speaker 3>and he confuses that with health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with knowing what's going on.</v>

1169
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:51.810
<v Speaker 3>And so he lives in this little horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment and he has a horrible landlady</v>

1170
00:55:51.811 --> 00:55:54.660
<v Speaker 3>and she really like this is where is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>genius.</v>

1171
00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.673
<v Speaker 3>Like cove hates his landline and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>dostoevsky tells you why and you'd </v>

1172
00:56:00.111 --> 00:56:01.320
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>

1173
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.780
<v Speaker 3>I'd hate her too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she's</v>

1174
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.700
<v Speaker 3>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She owns a bunch of apartments.</v>

1175
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:09.623
<v Speaker 3>She charges too much rent for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She tortures all the people that rent </v>

1176
00:56:12.751 --> 00:56:16.260
<v Speaker 3>from her in every possible way she can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but places are filthy.</v>

1177
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:20.550
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't provide any furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She hoards money and doesn't do anything</v>

1178
00:56:20.551 --> 00:56:22.770
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she lives in absolute poverty and you</v>

1179
00:56:22.771 --> 00:56:23.271
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1180
00:56:23.271 --> 00:56:27.250
<v Speaker 3>and in film and she's a cruel person in </v>
<v Speaker 3>every possible way.</v>

1181
00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Plus she has this nice who isn't very </v>
<v Speaker 3>bright,</v>

1182
00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:30.424
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same intellectually impaired and she </v>

1183
00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:31.894
<v Speaker 3>basically treats her like to slave so </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not doing anyone any good and </v>

1184
00:56:35.771 --> 00:56:36.604
<v Speaker 3>that's where to nicholson and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets a letter from his mother and his </v>

1185
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.073
<v Speaker 3>mother basically tells them that his </v>
<v Speaker 3>sister is going to go marry this rich </v>

1186
00:56:44.111 --> 00:56:44.944
<v Speaker 3>guy because she's in love with him and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>battle solve all of his monetary </v>

1187
00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:51.280
<v Speaker 3>problems so he can keep going to law </v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

1188
00:56:51.281 --> 00:56:52.900
<v Speaker 3>but he reads between the lines and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1189
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:57.610
<v Speaker 3>he realizes pretty quiCkly that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>rich guys are real like miserly scum rat</v>

1190
00:56:57.611 --> 00:57:01.090
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to treat his sister and </v>
<v Speaker 3>his mother absolutely miserably.</v>

1191
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:02.103
<v Speaker 3>And his sister doesn't really love in </v>
<v Speaker 3>many Ways and the only reason she's </v>

1192
00:57:04.211 --> 00:57:06.400
<v Speaker 3>marrying him so that risk all knockoff </v>
<v Speaker 3>can go to school.</v>

1193
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:08.800
<v Speaker 3>So he's not very happy with that and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1194
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 3>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1195
00:57:10.601 --> 00:57:12.070
<v Speaker 3>you can understand his motivation.</v>

1196
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 3>So he starving and he's full of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

1197
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Also the sort of meat chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1198
00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:17.763
<v Speaker 3>so and like atheistic ideas hit Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard because it went from </v>

1199
00:57:23.561 --> 00:57:24.394
<v Speaker 3>seriously orthodox christian and every </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible way to unbelievably skeptical </v>

1200
00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 3>in one generation and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just fractured the society.</v>

1201
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.073
<v Speaker 3>It's partly why communism became so </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely attractive for the russians </v>

1202
00:57:35.021 --> 00:57:35.854
<v Speaker 3>and dostoevsky also details that </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely brIlliantly in a book called </v>

1203
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 3>the possessed of the devils.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a wonderful book.</v>

1204
00:57:42.371 --> 00:57:43.204
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to read about 200 pages before </v>

1205
00:57:44.951 --> 00:57:46.490
<v Speaker 3>it really kicks in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1206
00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:48.220
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all those sorta like that.</v>

1207
00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:52.510
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>risk on the curve is he's thinking these</v>

1208
00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:56.470
<v Speaker 3>sort of superman ish rationalistic ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he thinks,</v>

1209
00:57:56.471 --> 00:57:57.304
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1210
00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.173
<v Speaker 3>there's no evidence that there's any </v>
<v Speaker 3>real moral hierarchy and you can easily </v>

1211
00:58:02.171 --> 00:58:04.930
<v Speaker 3>make a case that the reason that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't really moral,</v>

1212
00:58:04.931 --> 00:58:06.100
<v Speaker 3>they're just cowardly.</v>

1213
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.290
<v Speaker 3>And this is a nietzschean observation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1214
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.030
<v Speaker 3>Most of what you call your morality </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't morality all.</v>

1215
00:58:11.031 --> 00:58:11.864
<v Speaker 3>It's just too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're too afraid to do what you want </v>

1216
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:16.180
<v Speaker 3>and because you're too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we easily to admit that you say that you</v>

1217
00:58:16.181 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 3>don't do those things because your </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral.</v>

1218
00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:18.963
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd love to do them if you were brave </v>

1219
00:58:20.741 --> 00:58:21.670
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just aren't.</v>

1220
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.013
<v Speaker 3>So people misread that to say that what </v>
<v Speaker 3>nisha thought was that all morality was </v>

1221
00:58:26.831 --> 00:58:28.600
<v Speaker 3>cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't what he thought.</v>

1222
00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.290
<v Speaker 3>He thought that all cowardice </v>
<v Speaker 3>masquerading as morality,</v>

1223
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:34.600
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1224
00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:37.840
<v Speaker 3>recall the call is thinking about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and he's thinking,</v>

1225
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.060
<v Speaker 3>well I could be a lawyer and I'd be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good one.</v>

1226
00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:43.280
<v Speaker 3>I'd help people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd help the poor people you know,</v>

1227
00:58:43.281 --> 00:58:44.114
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what the hell good is it for me to </v>

1228
00:58:45.161 --> 00:58:48.250
<v Speaker 3>wander around starving like this and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem reasonable and,</v>

1229
00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:52.660
<v Speaker 3>and my is going to go basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitute herself for this rich guy and</v>

1230
00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:53.350
<v Speaker 3>that sucks.</v>

1231
00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:54.183
<v Speaker 3>And there's my landlady and she's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely reprehensible creature and </v>

1232
00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 3>everyone agrees and she's old and worn </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and it's like,</v>

1233
00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:04.480
<v Speaker 3>and she has this person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she keeps us a slave.</v>

1234
00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.430
<v Speaker 3>Although maybe I should just get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

1235
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:13.230
<v Speaker 3>And what I love about that is that like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this happens almost all the time</v>

1236
00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:17.200
<v Speaker 3>in universities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

1237
00:59:17.201 --> 00:59:20.400
<v Speaker 3>but it really between and whenever you </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear people who think they're smart have</v>

1238
00:59:20.401 --> 00:59:21.234
<v Speaker 3>a discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they generally do is they have an </v>

1239
00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 3>idea and then they have an idea about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the person who has a different idea.</v>

1240
00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:29.293
<v Speaker 3>And the idea about the person who has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different idea is that their idea is </v>

1241
00:59:32.061 --> 00:59:34.640
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what they do is they produce.</v>

1242
00:59:34.641 --> 00:59:35.474
<v Speaker 3>They're caricatures of that person's </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea and then they blast it and they </v>

1243
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:40.201
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1244
00:59:40.201 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I won that argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really pathetic.</v>

1245
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:44.630
<v Speaker 3>It's a straw man argument.</v>

1246
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.553
<v Speaker 3>It's the sign of a weak mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you do if you really want to have </v>

1247
00:59:48.291 --> 00:59:50.180
<v Speaker 3>an argument with someone is you help </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1248
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.033
<v Speaker 3>LIke let's say you're a right winger and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're arguing with a left winger or </v>

1249
00:59:53.911 --> 00:59:55.820
<v Speaker 3>you're a left winger and you're arguing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a right winger.</v>

1250
00:59:55.821 --> 00:59:56.654
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to make their argument as </v>

1251
00:59:58.971 --> 01:00:03.971
<v Speaker 3>magnificent as you possibly can and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>see If you can undermine it.</v>

1252
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:06.163
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do because then you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting somewhere like any idiot can </v>

1253
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 3>make a straw man in light it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky never does that.</v>

1254
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:20.210
<v Speaker 3>He makes the people that he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he sets up two ideas to go to war,</v>

1255
01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:21.913
<v Speaker 3>he embodies both sets of ideas in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most powerful characters he could </v>

1256
01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:25.754
<v Speaker 3>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the brothers karamazov for </v>

1257
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:29.990
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two people,</v>

1258
01:00:29.991 --> 01:00:30.824
<v Speaker 3>the two protagonists basically there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of them but one is named leo osha </v>

1259
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:38.030
<v Speaker 3>and the other is named ivan and now osha</v>
<v Speaker 3>is kind of an innocent guy.</v>

1260
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Goodguide fundamentally a little on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>naive side,</v>

1261
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.060
<v Speaker 3>religious but not in a way that he can </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend,</v>

1262
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:44.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more of a natural expression of </v>

1263
01:00:46.131 --> 01:00:50.710
<v Speaker 3>spirit and he's in a monastery and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the follower of this famous monk and you</v>

1264
01:00:50.711 --> 01:00:51.544
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of into orthodox christianity </v>

1265
01:00:53.391 --> 01:00:58.250
<v Speaker 3>and his</v>
<v Speaker 3>benevolent and sincere way,</v>

1266
01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:00.890
<v Speaker 3>but he's not much of an intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ivan,</v>

1267
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.780
<v Speaker 3>his older brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like ivan's got everything.</v>

1268
01:01:02.781 --> 01:01:04.040
<v Speaker 3>He's good looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's tall.</v>

1269
01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:07.440
<v Speaker 3>I believe he's a soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's an impressive guy and he's got</v>

1270
01:01:07.441 --> 01:01:08.274
<v Speaker 3>a viciously cutting intellect and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>just tears leo shoW apart every chance </v>

1271
01:01:12.801 --> 01:01:14.750
<v Speaker 3>he gets across the whole book and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1272
01:01:14.751 --> 01:01:18.680
<v Speaker 3>you can see the two parts of dostoevsky </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting it out in the book because part</v>

1273
01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:19.514
<v Speaker 3>of dostoevsky was highly spiritualized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not least because he was epileptic and </v>

1274
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:24.583
<v Speaker 3>that often for reasons we'll talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>later that often exaggerate </v>

1275
01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:31.700
<v Speaker 3>spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also because he was like,</v>

1276
01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:32.534
<v Speaker 3>he was a deeply spiritual person and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also a tremendous intellect and so he </v>

1277
01:01:35.991 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 3>was at war inside and he put those parts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of emoting into these characters and let</v>

1278
01:01:40.611 --> 01:01:41.870
<v Speaker 3>them just go at it.</v>

1279
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:43.640
<v Speaker 3>And it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1280
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I even makes the best argument for </v>
<v Speaker 3>atheism that's ever been written.</v>

1281
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.700
<v Speaker 3>It's really powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1282
01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:51.770
<v Speaker 3>he taught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically what he does is he talks about</v>

1283
01:01:51.771 --> 01:01:52.604
<v Speaker 3>all these terrible things that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>being done to children in Russia at the </v>

1284
01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:57.220
<v Speaker 3>turn of the century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back in the late 19,</v>

1285
01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.360
<v Speaker 3>18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1286
01:01:59.361 --> 01:02:00.194
<v Speaker 3>he talks about this one situation where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the parents of this young girl locked </v>

1287
01:02:03.351 --> 01:02:04.184
<v Speaker 3>her in a freezing out house overnight </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was crying and screaming and </v>

1288
01:02:07.281 --> 01:02:08.114
<v Speaker 3>telling them that she was sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just left her in there and she </v>

1289
01:02:09.651 --> 01:02:13.640
<v Speaker 3>froze to death and it was like front </v>
<v Speaker 3>page news and in Russia at the time,</v>

1290
01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:18.020
<v Speaker 3>I guess probably in moscow or maybe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>st petersburg and dostoevsky lifted that</v>

1291
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:21.710
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TheN said to he had ivan asked leo ships</v>

1292
01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.321
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1293
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:25.680
<v Speaker 3>well thIs is the sort of thing god </v>
<v Speaker 3>permits.</v>

1294
01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:27.360
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1295
01:02:27.361 --> 01:02:28.194
<v Speaker 3>the whole damn world isn't worth that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The suffering of one child in a </v>

1296
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:31.224
<v Speaker 3>situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you possibly see that something </v>

1297
01:02:33.481 --> 01:02:34.314
<v Speaker 3>like that can exist and wander around </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your bone headed belief in a </v>

1298
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:37.764
<v Speaker 3>benevolent god what's up with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you like a girl in our house </v>

1299
01:02:40.711 --> 01:02:44.130
<v Speaker 3>overnight and let her freeze if that </v>
<v Speaker 3>meant that other people would be happy,</v>

1300
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:44.790
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1301
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.200
<v Speaker 3>and of course ldl osha says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1302
01:02:46.201 --> 01:02:47.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never do that.</v>

1303
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.930
<v Speaker 3>And so I even tell some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1304
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:49.764
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1305
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:50.933
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this god that you imagined exists </v>

1306
01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:56.040
<v Speaker 3>would be perfectly pleased to let </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that occur.</v>

1307
01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:58.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ellie osha has no idea what to say about</v>

1308
01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 3>god and you're either that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1309
01:03:00.181 --> 01:03:02.070
<v Speaker 3>that's just a fragment of ivan's </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

1310
01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:04.950
<v Speaker 3>He's like punching at him like map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1311
01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:05.993
<v Speaker 3>And I think the way on the osha </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically responds is by trying to live </v>

1312
01:03:08.431 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 3>a good life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1313
01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:10.464
<v Speaker 3>he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can argue are even better at it than </v>

1314
01:03:14.941 --> 01:03:15.774
<v Speaker 3>he is in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus there's this vicious strain of </v>

1315
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.593
<v Speaker 3>critical thinking about religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion that's being lost it in from </v>

1316
01:03:21.781 --> 01:03:22.710
<v Speaker 3>western europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1317
01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:25.950
<v Speaker 3>there's 300 years of philosophical force</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind it.</v>

1318
01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:26.993
<v Speaker 3>And ivan is its mouth bass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like ellie osha and Russia itself </v>

1319
01:03:29.821 --> 01:03:33.660
<v Speaker 3>is just blown apart by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have no defense against that.</v>

1320
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.793
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bloody western europeans had 300 </v>

1321
01:03:36.061 --> 01:03:36.894
<v Speaker 3>years to get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The russians had like 10 years solely </v>

1322
01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:42.620
<v Speaker 3>just frank fragmented them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1323
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:45.630
<v Speaker 3>And they were like waiting for the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>messiah and they sure got one.</v>

1324
01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:49.020
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And both dostoevsky and in each.</v>

1325
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:49.854
<v Speaker 3>You prophesied about what would happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Russia for 40 years before it </v>

1326
01:03:53.341 --> 01:03:56.850
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's bloody amazing to be,</v>

1327
01:03:56.851 --> 01:04:00.330
<v Speaker 3>to think that you could look that far in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future and actually get it right.</v>

1328
01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1329
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.420
<v Speaker 3>things didn't change quite as fast and </v>
<v Speaker 3>as they are now,</v>

1330
01:04:03.421 --> 01:04:05.730
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like victoria,</v>

1331
01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:07.950
<v Speaker 3>the victorian times were static,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1332
01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:11.340
<v Speaker 3>there were a lot of things going on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so to get that right over four decades,</v>

1333
01:04:11.341 --> 01:04:12.174
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys were in touch with something </v>

1334
01:04:13.531 --> 01:04:17.100
<v Speaker 3>very deep that was going on underneath </v>
<v Speaker 3>the substrata of,</v>

1335
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.350
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of western civilization.</v>

1336
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.113
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1337
01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:25.170
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

1338
01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about belief structures and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about mlevel incident.</v>

1339
01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:30.324
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the psychological role that these sorts </v>

1340
01:04:35.281 --> 01:04:36.750
<v Speaker 3>of things are playing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1341
01:04:36.751 --> 01:04:40.550
<v Speaker 3>because it occurred to me at some point </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like an idea,</v>

1342
01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:43.740
<v Speaker 3>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this actually tormented me for about</v>

1343
01:04:43.741 --> 01:04:44.574
<v Speaker 3>six months I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'd been thinking these things </v>

1344
01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:47.424
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess it was for probably five </v>

1345
01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 3>years at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was really obsessed by it.</v>

1346
01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.433
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about this literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>every minute of the day from the time I </v>

1347
01:04:54.661 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 3>woke up until the time I went to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really manic probably.</v>

1348
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:01.740
<v Speaker 3>But so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

1349
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 3>I got at one point I got to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion.</v>

1350
01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:04.711
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1351
01:05:04.711 --> 01:05:05.544
<v Speaker 3>well here's the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'S pretty obvious that people need </v>

1352
01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:09.774
<v Speaker 3>belief structures because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a belief structure orients them to </v>

1353
01:05:12.601 --> 01:05:13.950
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1354
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:17.730
<v Speaker 3>So you have to believe that one thing is</v>
<v Speaker 3>more valuable than another just to af.</v>

1355
01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.020
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why did the chicken cross the road?</v>

1356
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:21.523
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because he thought the other side </v>

1357
01:05:22.121 --> 01:05:24.010
<v Speaker 3>of the road was better than this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was on.</v>

1358
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1359
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:30.360
<v Speaker 3>because whenever you're moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the implicit hypothesis of your movement</v>

1360
01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:31.594
<v Speaker 3>is that the thing you're moving towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>is better than the thing you're leaving </v>

1361
01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:35.003
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're self destructive because </v>

1362
01:05:35.981 --> 01:05:39.460
<v Speaker 3>otherwise why bother?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means is you don't move</v>

1363
01:05:39.461 --> 01:05:42.610
<v Speaker 3>without a value structure and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to not have one.</v>

1364
01:05:42.611 --> 01:05:43.121
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1365
01:05:43.121 --> 01:05:44.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1366
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.950
<v Speaker 3>well no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say you don't believe in anything.</v>

1367
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:50.163
<v Speaker 3>So technically you can't make an </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument for what you believe or you </v>

1368
01:05:53.801 --> 01:05:54.634
<v Speaker 3>don't know what you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're not just sitting there </v>

1369
01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.413
<v Speaker 3>vegetating than you believe something </v>
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise because you act it </v>

1370
01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:03.320
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1371
01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1372
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.500
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a belief system</v>

1373
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:12.920
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you fall apart.</v>

1374
01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1375
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:16.420
<v Speaker 3>So your nihilistic or depressed or </v>
<v Speaker 3>hopeless?</v>

1376
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Not certainly like who wants that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>

1377
01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:23.020
<v Speaker 3>It's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depression is no joke.</v>

1378
01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.613
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1379
01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.193
<v Speaker 3>I know someone who had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very serious illness is an illness that </v>

1380
01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:30.913
<v Speaker 3>destroyed parts of this person's body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed their joints and they were </v>

1381
01:06:33.651 --> 01:06:38.540
<v Speaker 3>also had clinical depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I asked this person at one point,</v>

1382
01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:39.320
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to get,</v>

1383
01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.153
<v Speaker 3>you get to have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get rid of the illness that's </v>

1384
01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:42.134
<v Speaker 3>destroying your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they had to be replaced or you can </v>

1385
01:06:44.151 --> 01:06:44.984
<v Speaker 3>get rid of the depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said I'd get rid of the depression </v>

1386
01:06:47.421 --> 01:06:48.254
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

1387
01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.270
<v Speaker 3>So that's where thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1388
01:06:50.271 --> 01:06:52.670
<v Speaker 3>So if you believe nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hopeless,</v>

1389
01:06:52.671 --> 01:06:56.060
<v Speaker 3>you've got no values structure to place </v>
<v Speaker 3>you end up is not good.</v>

1390
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:58.760
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure lots of you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced that.</v>

1391
01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean most people,</v>

1392
01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:03.140
<v Speaker 3>especially the people who are likely to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to this class,</v>

1393
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.810
<v Speaker 3>most people by the time they're your </v>
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>

1394
01:07:05.811 --> 01:07:08.210
<v Speaker 3>I've gone through a dark period or to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1395
01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:11.690
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason relationship breaks </v>
<v Speaker 3>up or maybe you lose the meaning in your</v>

1396
01:07:11.691 --> 01:07:15.240
<v Speaker 3>life for someone betrays you or someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets sick or you get sick or you know,</v>

1397
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.600
<v Speaker 3>some tragedy comes along and knocks you </v>
<v Speaker 3>flat.</v>

1398
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:18.920
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>

1399
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:21.230
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is any of this worthwhile?</v>

1400
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.390
<v Speaker 3>And it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1401
01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:26.090
<v Speaker 3>but you can't go there because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like death.</v>

1402
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:27.800
<v Speaker 3>while then the other problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1403
01:07:27.801 --> 01:07:30.130
<v Speaker 3>let's say you do have a belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1404
01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.640
<v Speaker 3>so what happens if I have a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>one?</v>

1405
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:33.583
<v Speaker 3>What are we supposed to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't give up yours because then </v>

1406
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:38.263
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to give up mine for the </v>

1407
01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:40.154
<v Speaker 3>sAme reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't clear that we can inhabit </v>

1408
01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:46.010
<v Speaker 3>the same part of the earth peacefully if</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't believe the same things.</v>

1409
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:48.410
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I sorted that oUt,</v>

1410
01:07:48.411 --> 01:07:48.830
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1411
01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:50.270
<v Speaker 3>well that'S it man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're baSically,</v>

1412
01:07:50.271 --> 01:07:51.140
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'Re done.</v>

1413
01:07:51.141 --> 01:07:55.400
<v Speaker 3>Because you can't not have a belief </v>
<v Speaker 3>system and if you have one you can't not</v>

1414
01:07:55.401 --> 01:08:00.080
<v Speaker 3>fight and we're too well armed to fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and we're not jUSt going to collapse</v>

1415
01:08:00.081 --> 01:08:00.914
<v Speaker 3>into nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although you know that happens quite a </v>

1416
01:08:02.151 --> 01:08:03.860
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So games over.</v>

1417
01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turned out that that was wrong,</v>

1418
01:08:07.611 --> 01:08:08.444
<v Speaker 3>thank god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it took me an awful long time to </v>

1419
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:10.543
<v Speaker 3>even begin to understand how it could </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly be wrong because as far as I </v>

1420
01:08:12.981 --> 01:08:14.570
<v Speaker 3>could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those were the options.</v>

1421
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.413
<v Speaker 3>So another thing we're going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out is not only you know exactly </v>

1422
01:08:20.631 --> 01:08:21.464
<v Speaker 3>why it people have belief systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what a belief system is and why </v>

1423
01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:28.370
<v Speaker 3>they compete and why you can't just get </v>
<v Speaker 3>rid of them,</v>

1424
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:32.150
<v Speaker 3>but we're also going to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is that you might be able to do about</v>

1425
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:32.984
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you're going to inhabit </v>
<v Speaker 3>places with people who don't have </v>

1426
01:08:35.091 --> 01:08:38.330
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same belief system as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

1427
01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:41.860
<v Speaker 3>And in some sense it's really the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with social being right.</v>

1428
01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 3>And creatures have been trying to solve </v>
<v Speaker 3>this problem ever since.</v>

1429
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know for how long I like to use</v>

1430
01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:48.914
<v Speaker 3>lobsters as an example because lobsters </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrange themselves into dominance </v>

1431
01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:55.700
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies and they have very complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>social behavior and they don't have much</v>

1432
01:08:55.701 --> 01:08:57.560
<v Speaker 3>of a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can.</v>

1433
01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:00.910
<v Speaker 3>You can have pretty damn complex social </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior without having much of a brain.</v>

1434
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:04.010
<v Speaker 3>And lobsters have been around for 400 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years.</v>

1435
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.640
<v Speaker 3>So us roughly speaking because we had To</v>
<v Speaker 3>shared ancestor with a lobster,</v>

1436
01:09:10.221 --> 01:09:11.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very long time ago.</v>

1437
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:12.463
<v Speaker 3>We've been trying to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>coexist with other creatures that don't </v>

1438
01:09:15.411 --> 01:09:16.244
<v Speaker 3>precisely share our belief systems for </v>
<v Speaker 3>400 million years and we'd been </v>

1439
01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.530
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently successful about it so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're both social and here we are.</v>

1440
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:27.650
<v Speaker 3>So obviously there's ways that it can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealt with.</v>

1441
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Although I don't think we necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand them very well and part of.</v>

1442
01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.010
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't want to just understand what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was about belief systems,</v>

1443
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:38.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about their necessity and their function</v>

1444
01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:40.600
<v Speaker 3>and the way that they become </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathologist.</v>

1445
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:41.803
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to figure out if there was also</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pattern to the processes by which </v>

1446
01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.093
<v Speaker 3>belief systems are modified and </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiated so that the belief systems </v>

1447
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:55.190
<v Speaker 3>that have different structures can </v>
<v Speaker 3>coexist in the same place peacefully and</v>

1448
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.360
<v Speaker 3>it's a vital question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1449
01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Because most of you are going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>married successfully or unsuccessfully,</v>

1450
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:01.243
<v Speaker 3>and even if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to live with someone for a </v>

1451
01:10:02.721 --> 01:10:03.554
<v Speaker 3>long period of time and you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find out that they're not like you and </v>

1452
01:10:05.871 --> 01:10:09.170
<v Speaker 3>that's extremely annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what are you going to do?</v>

1453
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:10.423
<v Speaker 3>You're either gonna be a slave or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrant or you're going to negotiate </v>

1454
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:16.063
<v Speaker 3>because those are your options and </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiation is extraordinarily </v>

1455
01:10:18.891 --> 01:10:19.581
<v Speaker 3>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1456
01:10:19.581 --> 01:10:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Because you have to figure out what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want and probably won't even admit it,</v>

1457
01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.713
<v Speaker 3>and second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to listen to your stupid </v>

1458
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:25.703
<v Speaker 3>partner telling you what they want and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to try to figure out how </v>

1459
01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:30.160
<v Speaker 3>you're going to make both of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly.</v>

1460
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slavery,</v>

1461
01:10:32.751 --> 01:10:33.584
<v Speaker 3>tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's comparatively easy from a </v>

1462
01:10:35.091 --> 01:10:35.924
<v Speaker 3>cognitive perspective compared to </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually trying to figure out How you </v>

1463
01:10:38.391 --> 01:10:40.730
<v Speaker 3>can be mutually satisfied in the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>

1464
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:42.590
<v Speaker 3>but you can do it.</v>

1465
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.053
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a process and it's </v>

1466
01:10:46.941 --> 01:10:47.774
<v Speaker 3>identifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I want to talk to you about belief </v>

1467
01:10:50.421 --> 01:10:52.940
<v Speaker 3>systems and their psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance,</v>

1468
01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:55.190
<v Speaker 3>what they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what function they perform,</v>

1469
01:10:55.191 --> 01:10:59.960
<v Speaker 3>but I also want to talk to you about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>they transform because they do,</v>

1470
01:10:59.961 --> 01:11:00.794
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They changed especially with humans so </v>

1471
01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:03.374
<v Speaker 3>they can change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means they can modify and that </v>

1472
01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:08.000
<v Speaker 3>means at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we could have a dialogue.</v>

1473
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Now dialogue is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's rough,</v>

1474
01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:13.350
<v Speaker 3>but the alternative is war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1475
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:14.803
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly why you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to your enemy because if you </v>

1476
01:11:17.551 --> 01:11:20.390
<v Speaker 3>don't listen to your enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only other thing that you</v>

1477
01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:23.200
<v Speaker 2>can do is fight with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1478
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:38.060
<v Speaker 3>You mean it's the desire for that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>

1479
01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:39.673
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's partly the desire for </v>

1480
01:11:41.421 --> 01:11:42.254
<v Speaker 3>that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is whenever I look at a </v>

1481
01:11:43.461 --> 01:11:46.880
<v Speaker 3>political movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the ideological,</v>

1482
01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:49.340
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1483
01:11:49.341 --> 01:11:53.270
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of things your for fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you against?</v>

1484
01:11:54.170 --> 01:11:55.003
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things that people </v>

1485
01:11:55.941 --> 01:11:59.210
<v Speaker 3>who adopted maybe theological position </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to presume is that all of the right</v>

1486
01:11:59.211 --> 01:12:03.890
<v Speaker 3>is on their side and that makes them </v>
<v Speaker 3>very unconscious up their shadow,</v>

1487
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:04.783
<v Speaker 3>let's say from a union perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The nazis had all sorts of positive </v>

1488
01:12:07.761 --> 01:12:11.510
<v Speaker 3>reasons for what they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1489
01:12:11.511 --> 01:12:12.344
<v Speaker 3>the negative reasons were there too and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could easily make a case that the </v>

1490
01:12:14.661 --> 01:12:16.700
<v Speaker 3>negative reasons were really the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>

1491
01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:18.860
<v Speaker 3>And when I look at ideologues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always think,</v>

1492
01:12:18.861 --> 01:12:19.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1493
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:22.020
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1494
01:12:22.021 --> 01:12:24.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe all the good people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>on your site and be.</v>

1495
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I know that negative motivations are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more powerful than positive ones.</v>

1496
01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.460
<v Speaker 3>So you say you're for things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're against them too.</v>

1497
01:12:31.461 --> 01:12:33.200
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's start with that.</v>

1498
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:38.210
<v Speaker 3>So I thought I started thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this after I read george orwell.</v>

1499
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:40.080
<v Speaker 3>I love george orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

1500
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.620
<v Speaker 3>How many of you know who george orwell </v>
<v Speaker 3>is?</v>

1501
01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1502
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:46.640
<v Speaker 3>That's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many don't?</v>

1503
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:49.181
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>

1504
01:12:49.181 --> 01:12:50.510
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

1505
01:12:50.511 --> 01:12:51.344
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the hell did you learn about george </v>

1506
01:12:52.971 --> 01:12:53.870
<v Speaker 3>orwell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it 19,</v>

1507
01:12:53.871 --> 01:12:56.060
<v Speaker 3>84?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally or animal farm?</v>

1508
01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Animal farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1509
01:12:58.011 --> 01:13:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's good because george orwell,</v>

1510
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.831
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell you,</v>

1511
01:13:00.831 --> 01:13:01.664
<v Speaker 3>george orwell was the first western </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual who figured out what the </v>

1512
01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:08.750
<v Speaker 3>hell was going on in the soviet union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did that in the mid forties,</v>

1513
01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.240
<v Speaker 3>early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1514
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:11.083
<v Speaker 3>it was complicated because we sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew what was happening in the twenties </v>

1515
01:13:14.601 --> 01:13:15.560
<v Speaker 3>and the thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1516
01:13:15.561 --> 01:13:17.060
<v Speaker 3>there was len and then that wasn't so </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1517
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:17.893
<v Speaker 3>There was the russian civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was the idea of universal </v>

1518
01:13:20.691 --> 01:13:23.250
<v Speaker 3>communism that wasn't such a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1519
01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.193
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as people who didn't want to be </v>

1520
01:13:24.861 --> 01:13:25.694
<v Speaker 3>communists were concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was what happened in the </v>

1521
01:13:27.591 --> 01:13:29.330
<v Speaker 3>Ukraine in the 1930.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>

1522
01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:31.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the evidence was starting to pile up.</v>

1523
01:13:31.671 --> 01:13:32.504
<v Speaker 3>But unfortunately what happened was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spanish civil war and the lefties were </v>

1524
01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:39.500
<v Speaker 3>pretty much the good guys in the spanish</v>
<v Speaker 3>civil war.</v>

1525
01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:40.363
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a microcosm of the second </v>

1526
01:13:42.291 --> 01:13:43.124
<v Speaker 3>world war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lefties were fighting the fascists </v>

1527
01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:46.543
<v Speaker 3>and some of the lefties were communists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of them were also people who </v>

1528
01:13:49.251 --> 01:13:50.084
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think genuinely fighting for freedom </v>

1529
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:52.603
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of north american literary </v>
<v Speaker 3>figures went to Spain to fight on the </v>

1530
01:13:56.271 --> 01:13:58.580
<v Speaker 3>side of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1531
01:13:58.581 --> 01:14:00.710
<v Speaker 3>against the fascists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so faIr enough,</v>

1532
01:14:00.711 --> 01:14:01.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fascist,</v>

1533
01:14:01.491 --> 01:14:03.680
<v Speaker 3>we're obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1534
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:05.203
<v Speaker 3>reprehensible clearly and so and so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of muddied the water right because </v>

1535
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:11.500
<v Speaker 3>the fastest were bad.</v>

1536
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.450
<v Speaker 3>And then that sort of means that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are fighting them,</v>

1537
01:14:13.451 --> 01:14:16.090
<v Speaker 3>their guard and some of them are </v>
<v Speaker 3>communists and there was good.</v>

1538
01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:20.980
<v Speaker 3>There is pretty good reason for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be radical socialist at that point in</v>

1539
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:25.330
<v Speaker 3>human history because the plIght of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>working man was relatively unpleasant.</v>

1540
01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:26.493
<v Speaker 3>George orwell wrote a book called road </v>
<v Speaker 3>to wigan pier and he went up to this </v>

1541
01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:31.924
<v Speaker 3>town that was a coal mining town and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he stayed with the coal miners for </v>

1542
01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.600
<v Speaker 3>awhile and just looked at their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here,</v>

1543
01:14:37.601 --> 01:14:42.601
<v Speaker 3>here's pArt of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you basically work a seven and a half</v>

1544
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.200
<v Speaker 3>hour shift when you're a coal miner and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

1545
01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:46.420
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not too bad by 1930 standards.</v>

1546
01:14:46.421 --> 01:14:47.254
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1547
01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:52.810
<v Speaker 3>except you have to go down to the coal </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine tunnels,</v>

1548
01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:56.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like they're not eight feet high and</v>

1549
01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:57.124
<v Speaker 3>carpeted there like four and a half feet</v>
<v Speaker 3>high and rough and poorly lit and the </v>

1550
01:15:00.451 --> 01:15:01.284
<v Speaker 3>air is terrible.</v>

1551
01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:02.463
<v Speaker 3>And so basically you have to chimp walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>or crawl up to three miles just to get </v>

1552
01:15:09.701 --> 01:15:10.534
<v Speaker 3>to work and then you have to do that at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of your shift and you don't get </v>

1553
01:15:14.141 --> 01:15:15.310
<v Speaker 3>paid for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>

1554
01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.130
<v Speaker 3>that's your Commute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1555
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1556
01:15:19.961 --> 01:15:20.794
<v Speaker 3>it was no bloody well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then of course what you're doing </v>

1557
01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:24.430
<v Speaker 3>when you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's absolutely filthy.</v>

1558
01:15:24.431 --> 01:15:27.160
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's brutally difficult.</v>

1559
01:15:27.161 --> 01:15:30.610
<v Speaker 3>He said coal miners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have no teeth because they're like,</v>

1560
01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:31.683
<v Speaker 3>because of their living conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their bodies were absolutely </v>

1561
01:15:33.851 --> 01:15:34.684
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were unbelievably powerful and </v>

1562
01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:40.090
<v Speaker 3>strong because all they did was </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly intense physical labor,</v>

1563
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.430
<v Speaker 3>but it was bloody rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ANd the housing,</v>

1564
01:15:42.431 --> 01:15:47.431
<v Speaker 3>those people had like</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 families for one outhouse,</v>

1565
01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:48.853
<v Speaker 3>that's probably good enough to describe </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and often they were row houses and </v>

1566
01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:53.194
<v Speaker 3>the row houses had no back doors that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had no paths between them and all </v>

1567
01:15:56.591 --> 01:15:57.940
<v Speaker 3>the old houses were at the back.</v>

1568
01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.240
<v Speaker 3>So that meant if you were with like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>below and it was the winter and you were</v>

1569
01:16:01.241 --> 01:16:02.074
<v Speaker 3>sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you get to go all the way around </v>

1570
01:16:02.951 --> 01:16:03.784
<v Speaker 3>the block to your damn outhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe there'S only one there and you </v>

1571
01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:08.290
<v Speaker 3>light up with 50 people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that you know.</v>

1572
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So an orwell,</v>

1573
01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.350
<v Speaker 3>he was orwell was an upper class guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically,</v>

1574
01:16:14.351 --> 01:16:15.184
<v Speaker 3>and he was trying to help themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>overcome these upper class prejudices </v>

1575
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:19.363
<v Speaker 3>and who is a real documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the terrible working conditions </v>

1576
01:16:22.601 --> 01:16:23.434
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1577
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:24.303
<v Speaker 3>of working class people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he wrote this book called road to </v>

1578
01:16:26.711 --> 01:16:30.190
<v Speaker 3>wigan pier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that orwell said,</v>

1579
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:33.490
<v Speaker 3>he wrote this story about these poor god</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn coal miners.</v>

1580
01:16:33.491 --> 01:16:35.200
<v Speaker 3>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah.</v>

1581
01:16:35.201 --> 01:16:36.034
<v Speaker 3>It's like how about some social </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation so that these people In </v>

1582
01:16:38.451 --> 01:16:41.770
<v Speaker 3>their children aren't just absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>brutalized nonstop?</v>

1583
01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:42.683
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then he wrote the last half of the </v>

1584
01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:46.690
<v Speaker 3>book and he wrote it for the left book </v>
<v Speaker 3>club,</v>

1585
01:16:46.691 --> 01:16:49.480
<v Speaker 3>which was a socialist group that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>publisher book every month or so.</v>

1586
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:53.650
<v Speaker 3>And what he did was he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a critique of socialism,</v>

1587
01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:56.080
<v Speaker 3>a pretty socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1588
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:57.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this sucks man.</v>

1589
01:16:57.791 --> 01:17:01.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like we should be on The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry to these working people,</v>

1590
01:17:01.211 --> 01:17:02.044
<v Speaker 3>but the socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're not on the side of the </v>

1591
01:17:03.311 --> 01:17:04.144
<v Speaker 3>working people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like tweed wearing middle class </v>

1592
01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:07.653
<v Speaker 3>hyper intellectuals who never go </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere near the working class because </v>

1593
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:11.143
<v Speaker 3>of their class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prejudice isn't for all sorts of other </v>

1594
01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:14.390
<v Speaker 3>reasons and they don't like the poor at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1595
01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.313
<v Speaker 3>They just hate the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought I'd been a member of the </v>

1596
01:17:18.891 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 3>ndp for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At that point.</v>

1597
01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:23.610
<v Speaker 3>It was always something a little off </v>
<v Speaker 3>about is especially the more radical and</v>

1598
01:17:23.611 --> 01:17:24.444
<v Speaker 3>that works with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it just doesn't look like </v>

1599
01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:31.340
<v Speaker 3>benevolence as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of whining and complaining</v>

1600
01:17:31.341 --> 01:17:32.420
<v Speaker 3>and resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1601
01:17:32.421 --> 01:17:33.530
<v Speaker 3>whAt's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that about?</v>

1602
01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.890
<v Speaker 3>I read orwell and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1603
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:40.243
<v Speaker 3>if you hate the successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you hate the rich who were rich by </v>

1604
01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:44.690
<v Speaker 3>the way is whoever has more money than </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1605
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:49.700
<v Speaker 3>That's how you defined rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the best way to mask your resentment</v>

1606
01:17:49.701 --> 01:17:51.560
<v Speaker 3>is to pretend that you're on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poor.</v>

1607
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:55.250
<v Speaker 3>And are I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that's exactly right.</v>

1608
01:17:55.251 --> 01:17:56.084
<v Speaker 3>And then that's part of also what made </v>
<v Speaker 3>me psychoanalytically oriented because </v>

1609
01:17:58.821 --> 01:18:03.821
<v Speaker 3>one thing psychoanalysts always do </v>
<v Speaker 3>always is if you say you're,</v>

1610
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:08.930
<v Speaker 3>here's how I'm positively predisposed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The psychoanalyst says,</v>

1611
01:18:10.710 --> 01:18:14.700
<v Speaker 3>how are you using that to mask something</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy and malevolent that you're doing?</v>

1612
01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:17.400
<v Speaker 3>And that's always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very,</v>

1613
01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:19.560
<v Speaker 3>very useful questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not always correct,</v>

1614
01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:20.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1615
01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:25.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's correct a lot more than people </v>
<v Speaker 3>generally like to think,</v>

1616
01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:25.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the mothering him grant the </v>

1617
01:18:26.851 --> 01:18:28.590
<v Speaker 3>mother or the witch in hansel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gretel.</v>

1618
01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.840
<v Speaker 3>You know the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1619
01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.160
<v Speaker 3>This guy gets married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a couple of kids.</v>

1620
01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:36.083
<v Speaker 3>His new wife doesn't relate to the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have 100 times higher chance by the </v>

1621
01:18:39.811 --> 01:18:42.930
<v Speaker 3>way of being abused by a step parent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then biological parent,</v>

1622
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:44.850
<v Speaker 3>just so you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1623
01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.000
<v Speaker 3>the step where they're just like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>

1624
01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:47.834
<v Speaker 3>she tells the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why don't you just go with those </v>

1625
01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:51.090
<v Speaker 3>kids out in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sold out.</v>

1626
01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.010
<v Speaker 3>They go out in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're lost kids,</v>

1627
01:18:53.011 --> 01:18:53.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have nowhere to go.</v>

1628
01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:57.450
<v Speaker 3>So when they're wandering around out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there in the forest and what happens,</v>

1629
01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:01.720
<v Speaker 3>they come across a gingerbread house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

1630
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:03.550
<v Speaker 3>wow man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a starving kid.</v>

1631
01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Gingerbread house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good news,</v>

1632
01:19:06.671 --> 01:19:08.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only is it a house,</v>

1633
01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:09.873
<v Speaker 3>but it's made out of candy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could anything possibly be any </v>

1634
01:19:12.821 --> 01:19:14.590
<v Speaker 3>better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they go,</v>

1635
01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:16.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's this grandmotherly type</v>

1636
01:19:16.871 --> 01:19:17.704
<v Speaker 3>care and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she starts to fatten them up and she </v>

1637
01:19:20.621 --> 01:19:22.630
<v Speaker 3>puts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's handling the cage and</v>

1638
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:27.520
<v Speaker 3>she gets gretel after awhile to </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically work as their scullery maid.</v>

1639
01:19:27.521 --> 01:19:28.354
<v Speaker 3>And it becomes quite obvious to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>children that she's actually fattening </v>

1640
01:19:30.461 --> 01:19:32.590
<v Speaker 3>them up so that she can put them in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oven and eat them.</v>

1641
01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:34.023
<v Speaker 3>And so I think what hansel does is I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think griddle gives him this leg bone </v>

1642
01:19:37.271 --> 01:19:40.450
<v Speaker 3>from some animal and the old witch's </v>
<v Speaker 3>half blind.</v>

1643
01:19:40.451 --> 01:19:42.730
<v Speaker 3>And every time she reaches into sorta </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel his laying,</v>

1644
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.863
<v Speaker 3>he gives her the bone and so like she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just not all that interested in meeting </v>

1645
01:19:47.441 --> 01:19:48.040
<v Speaker 3>them in anyways.</v>

1646
01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:48.873
<v Speaker 3>The kids end up pushing her in the oven </v>
<v Speaker 3>and closing it and getting the hell out </v>

1647
01:19:51.091 --> 01:19:51.924
<v Speaker 3>of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1648
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.490
<v Speaker 3>it's a happy ending as far as fairy tale</v>
<v Speaker 3>skill.</v>

1649
01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.490
<v Speaker 3>But it's an eternal story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1650
01:19:57.250 --> 01:19:59.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a classic story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it needs a whole family.</v>

1651
01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Be bloody wary of people who do too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

1652
01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.793
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if have a mother or any other </v>

1653
01:20:08.821 --> 01:20:09.654
<v Speaker 3>relative for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's fattening you up on mercy and </v>

1654
01:20:14.191 --> 01:20:15.024
<v Speaker 3>candy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The probability that her basic goal is </v>

1655
01:20:18.091 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 3>to eat you enough so that you never </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave.</v>

1656
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.470
<v Speaker 3>The probability is extraordinarily high </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's no joke.</v>

1657
01:20:25.471 --> 01:20:26.304
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you do learn if </v>

1658
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:32.580
<v Speaker 3>you read about the sorts of people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>burst out of their mother's basement and</v>

1659
01:20:32.581 --> 01:20:36.710
<v Speaker 3>go shoot up dawson colleges that often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly the situation that you've</v>

1660
01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:37.830
<v Speaker 3>been in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1661
01:20:37.831 --> 01:20:38.664
<v Speaker 3>They're burning with resentment in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>uselessness down in the basement for </v>

1662
01:20:40.981 --> 01:20:42.150
<v Speaker 3>five or six years.</v>

1663
01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to leave,</v>

1664
01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:46.620
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to become independent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's done for them,</v>

1665
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:49.140
<v Speaker 3>so they never have to do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

1666
01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:54.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's not pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the rules for dealing with</v>

1667
01:20:54.961 --> 01:20:55.794
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know this is actually a rule for </v>

1668
01:20:57.031 --> 01:20:58.540
<v Speaker 3>dealing with elderly people in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1669
01:20:58.650 --> 01:20:59.483
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1670
01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.410
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in hopes for,</v>

1671
01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.980
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for retired people,</v>

1672
01:21:02.981 --> 01:21:05.640
<v Speaker 3>is do not do anything for anyone they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do for themselves.</v>

1673
01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.740
<v Speaker 3>You are stealing from them when you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1674
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:12.360
<v Speaker 3>And it's a great rule of thumb for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like once they can dress themselves,</v>

1675
01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.910
<v Speaker 3>they dress themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they can set the table,</v>

1676
01:21:14.911 --> 01:21:17.430
<v Speaker 3>even if it takes 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're setting the table.</v>

1677
01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:18.443
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing them a favor by helping</v>
<v Speaker 3>them do anything they can do themselves </v>

1678
01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:24.120
<v Speaker 3>and it skips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of harsh,</v>

1679
01:21:24.121 --> 01:21:24.954
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it beats the hell out of the witch </v>

1680
01:21:25.561 --> 01:21:27.390
<v Speaker 3>in hansel and gretel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1681
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:28.620
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1682
01:21:28.621 --> 01:21:29.454
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we're going to look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well as the dark side of positive </v>

1683
01:21:31.951 --> 01:21:33.840
<v Speaker 3>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1684
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:37.050
<v Speaker 3>now how are we going to do this?</v>

1685
01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:38.473
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1686
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:42.820
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you might ask yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1687
01:21:42.821 --> 01:21:44.860
<v Speaker 3>how in the world do you know if </v>
<v Speaker 3>something is true?</v>

1688
01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.193
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I would suggest is that </v>

1689
01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:49.593
<v Speaker 3>the attitude you guys should bring to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this class is that nothing that I tell </v>

1690
01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:54.880
<v Speaker 3>you is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1691
01:21:54.881 --> 01:21:55.714
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that you should be </v>

1692
01:21:57.190 --> 01:22:01.090
<v Speaker 3>arrogantly skeptical because that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate,</v>

1693
01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:07.060
<v Speaker 3>but you should bring every critical </v>
<v Speaker 3>faculty.</v>

1694
01:22:07.061 --> 01:22:07.894
<v Speaker 3>You have to bear on what I tell you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see if you can chip away at it because </v>

1695
01:22:11.410 --> 01:22:12.243
<v Speaker 3>what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to build yourself a body of </v>

1696
01:22:13.691 --> 01:22:14.524
<v Speaker 3>knowledge that you cannot undermine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the way you do that is by trying to </v>

1697
01:22:18.521 --> 01:22:19.354
<v Speaker 3>undermine it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by hacking away at the foundation with </v>

1698
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:22.170
<v Speaker 3>everything you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if,</v>

1699
01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.390
<v Speaker 3>if the ideas can withstand a total </v>
<v Speaker 3>onslaught,</v>

1700
01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:29.080
<v Speaker 3>then you've got something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got a foundation,</v>

1701
01:22:29.081 --> 01:22:32.560
<v Speaker 3>you've got something you could stand on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be there when things get</v>

1702
01:22:32.561 --> 01:22:33.394
<v Speaker 3>rough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I'm going to tell you what I've </v>

1703
01:22:35.411 --> 01:22:36.130
<v Speaker 3>found.</v>

1704
01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:38.320
<v Speaker 3>It's been useful to me when things got </v>
<v Speaker 3>rough,</v>

1705
01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:39.603
<v Speaker 3>but I don't expect you to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna work for you and I don't </v>

1706
01:22:42.101 --> 01:22:45.790
<v Speaker 3>want you to to like I want you to listen</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to think,</v>

1707
01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.430
<v Speaker 3>but I want you to keep your wits about </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1708
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.863
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to tell you how I go about</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to determine whether or not </v>

1709
01:22:52.691 --> 01:22:55.360
<v Speaker 3>something is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1710
01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:56.194
<v Speaker 3>there's different definitions of truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we're gonna basically flipped </v>

1711
01:23:01.931 --> 01:23:02.764
<v Speaker 3>back and forth between two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of truth is an objective definition </v>

1712
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:08.583
<v Speaker 3>and we don't have to talk much about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because you guys already know what </v>

1713
01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:11.194
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's another definition of truth </v>

1714
01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:13.864
<v Speaker 3>that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the best way of defining it is </v>

1715
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:20.490
<v Speaker 3>as pragmatically true and pragmatism is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a branch of american philosophy and it's</v>

1716
01:23:20.651 --> 01:23:22.420
<v Speaker 3>a very sophisticated brands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy.</v>

1717
01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.553
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually think it's the most </v>

1718
01:23:24.491 --> 01:23:25.324
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated brand philosophy part part</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably because it makes the least </v>

1719
01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:33.340
<v Speaker 3>claims and what the pragmatists state </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically is.</v>

1720
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:34.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't really know anything,</v>

1721
01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.273
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have ultimate knowledge about </v>

1722
01:23:37.061 --> 01:23:37.894
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so your knowledge always bought himself </v>

1723
01:23:39.041 --> 01:23:41.200
<v Speaker 3>in ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then the question is,</v>

1724
01:23:41.201 --> 01:23:42.034
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know them if anything is </v>

1725
01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:45.100
<v Speaker 3>true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the pragmatist would say,</v>

1726
01:23:45.101 --> 01:23:45.934
<v Speaker 3>well in a sense you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you know always is if something is </v>

1727
01:23:49.781 --> 01:23:53.650
<v Speaker 3>true enough for a particular function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1728
01:23:53.651 --> 01:23:54.484
<v Speaker 3>your theory about getting to the door </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be that you can stand up and walk </v>

1729
01:23:57.161 --> 01:24:00.160
<v Speaker 3>there and you might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well god only knows what might happen on</v>

1730
01:24:00.161 --> 01:24:01.150
<v Speaker 3>the way there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1731
01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.220
<v Speaker 3>maybe there'll be an earthquake or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ceiling tile fall on you.</v>

1732
01:24:04.221 --> 01:24:05.290
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or who knows,</v>

1733
01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:06.610
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll have a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1734
01:24:06.611 --> 01:24:09.460
<v Speaker 3>so you don't know whether you can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1735
01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:13.510
<v Speaker 3>You can infer from past experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you get there,</v>

1736
01:24:13.511 --> 01:24:14.344
<v Speaker 3>then what you can say is my statement </v>
<v Speaker 3>about truth was sufficient so that the </v>

1737
01:24:18.491 --> 01:24:21.220
<v Speaker 3>outcome was what the theory predicted.</v>

1738
01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:24.250
<v Speaker 3>And so in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the pragmatists are saying is every</v>

1739
01:24:24.251 --> 01:24:27.370
<v Speaker 3>time you make a statement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's related to action,</v>

1740
01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:32.560
<v Speaker 3>that you will offer a theory of truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>along with that statement implicitly,</v>

1741
01:24:32.561 --> 01:24:37.270
<v Speaker 3>which is that this is true enough if </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I predict happen happens.</v>

1742
01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.840
<v Speaker 3>And so it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a binds very nice theory because it</v>

1743
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:41.703
<v Speaker 3>doesn't require you to be omniscient </v>
<v Speaker 3>about anything for things to be true </v>

1744
01:24:45.131 --> 01:24:45.964
<v Speaker 3>enough and you are ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know everything about </v>

1745
01:24:48.371 --> 01:24:49.204
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so obviously you're working in the </v>

1746
01:24:50.561 --> 01:24:55.561
<v Speaker 3>world with partial knowledge and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>works not all the time.</v>

1747
01:24:56.411 --> 01:24:57.550
<v Speaker 3>You get old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get sick,</v>

1748
01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:58.780
<v Speaker 3>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean you're,</v>

1749
01:24:58.810 --> 01:24:59.643
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to work it out </v>

1750
01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:02.980
<v Speaker 3>thoroughly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1751
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:07.990
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to use the pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth framework and we're going to use a</v>

1752
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:08.853
<v Speaker 3>objective truth framework.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the propositions that I'm </v>

1753
01:25:11.921 --> 01:25:12.754
<v Speaker 3>going to make to you is that the stories</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are associated with our deepest </v>

1754
01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:20.314
<v Speaker 3>moral intuitions are pragmatic truths </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that you need pragmatic truths and </v>

1755
01:25:26.501 --> 01:25:27.670
<v Speaker 3>you need objective truth.</v>

1756
01:25:27.670 --> 01:25:32.670
<v Speaker 3>And you need pragmatic trees because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't just need to know what the world's</v>

1757
01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:33.544
<v Speaker 3>made up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to know what to do about the </v>

1758
01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:37.990
<v Speaker 3>fact that the world is made out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1759
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:40.990
<v Speaker 3>And because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings are creatures.</v>

1760
01:25:40.991 --> 01:25:43.690
<v Speaker 3>We act in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We act on the world.</v>

1761
01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:44.913
<v Speaker 3>And so what we need to know is how is it</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you should act on the world and </v>

1762
01:25:49.091 --> 01:25:49.924
<v Speaker 3>that is not a question that can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>addressed by objective methods </v>

1763
01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:52.751
<v Speaker 3>technically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1764
01:25:52.751 --> 01:25:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Because it's actually a value question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What should you do?</v>

1765
01:25:56.530 --> 01:26:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Science by its very methodology refuses </v>
<v Speaker 3>to answer such questions.</v>

1766
01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:02.763
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people confuse the fact that science is </v>

1767
01:26:04.251 --> 01:26:05.084
<v Speaker 3>value free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of with the idea that existence is </v>

1768
01:26:08.631 --> 01:26:10.280
<v Speaker 3>value free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's,</v>

1769
01:26:10.281 --> 01:26:12.860
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's philosophically primitive,</v>

1770
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.903
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because science was actually set up to </v>

1771
01:26:16.221 --> 01:26:19.180
<v Speaker 3>get rid of the value of the subjective </v>
<v Speaker 3>value in its,</v>

1772
01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.210
<v Speaker 3>in its technique.</v>

1773
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.193
<v Speaker 3>So you can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we set this thing up to get rid of </v>

1774
01:26:22.701 --> 01:26:24.170
<v Speaker 3>the value would look all the value </v>
<v Speaker 3>score.</v>

1775
01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:27.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's no value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no,</v>

1776
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.441
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1777
01:26:27.441 --> 01:26:28.274
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put that domain out of the range of </v>

1778
01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:35.000
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</v>

1779
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.700
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a different.</v>

1780
01:26:38.690 --> 01:26:42.170
<v Speaker 3>It requires different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It requires a different philosophy,</v>

1781
01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:43.760
<v Speaker 3>a different outlook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different techniques,</v>

1782
01:26:43.761 --> 01:26:45.950
<v Speaker 3>different tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different methods of proof,</v>

1783
01:26:46.130 --> 01:26:48.860
<v Speaker 3>all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so part of what we're going to do,</v>

1784
01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:53.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to use objective truth as much</v>
<v Speaker 3>as i possibly can because I think that,</v>

1785
01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:55.083
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of what psychology as a </v>

1786
01:26:57.381 --> 01:26:58.214
<v Speaker 3>science has been able to offer in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last hundred years is actually </v>

1787
01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:00.884
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily useful for elucidating </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the issues that we're going to </v>

1788
01:27:04.701 --> 01:27:08.600
<v Speaker 3>discuss because we really have made some</v>
<v Speaker 3>progress and understanding the psyche,</v>

1789
01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:10.070
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially at a,</v>

1790
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.100
<v Speaker 3>I would say at a biological slash </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavioral level.</v>

1791
01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.220
<v Speaker 3>We've got some pretty solid information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not perfect,</v>

1792
01:27:16.221 --> 01:27:18.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1793
01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.200
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to draw on a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sources.</v>

1794
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:24.050
<v Speaker 3>We're drawing stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to draw in literature,</v>

1795
01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.450
<v Speaker 3>we're going to draw on philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to draw on religion,</v>

1796
01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.100
<v Speaker 3>we're going to draw a myth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mythology.</v>

1797
01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:30.440
<v Speaker 3>We're going to draw on biology and </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology.</v>

1798
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:31.603
<v Speaker 3>And there's this idea which you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>have learned about if you're a </v>

1799
01:27:34.821 --> 01:27:38.480
<v Speaker 3>psychologist called multi-method </v>
<v Speaker 3>multitrack matrix.</v>

1800
01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:42.170
<v Speaker 3>So this was invented by a guy back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 19 fifties,</v>

1801
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:43.183
<v Speaker 3>I think it was neil and chronback,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his famous paper that was published in </v>

1802
01:27:46.101 --> 01:27:47.660
<v Speaker 3>the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is supposed to know it.</v>

1803
01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.840
<v Speaker 3>No one ever pays any attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they were interested in was how</v>

1804
01:27:53.031 --> 01:27:57.140
<v Speaker 3>do you know if when you say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>something exists,</v>

1805
01:27:57.141 --> 01:28:00.680
<v Speaker 3>like let's say a anger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does anger exist?</v>

1806
01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer seems self evident.</v>

1807
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's tricky,</v>

1808
01:28:07.730 --> 01:28:11.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because generally no one comes up to you</v>

1809
01:28:11.991 --> 01:28:13.820
<v Speaker 3>and says anger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1810
01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:17.240
<v Speaker 3>they tell you a little story where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>use words relating to anger in the story</v>

1811
01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:18.074
<v Speaker 3>and then you sort of derive what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean by angry from the context and the </v>

1812
01:28:21.891 --> 01:28:25.340
<v Speaker 3>context is important in defining the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

1813
01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't know if that,</v>

1814
01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:29.713
<v Speaker 3>that the central idea anger can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out of the context and then you </v>

1815
01:28:32.421 --> 01:28:33.890
<v Speaker 3>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's a thing.</v>

1816
01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:34.724
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like iron is a thing or like mercury is </v>

1817
01:28:37.101 --> 01:28:37.960
<v Speaker 3>that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1818
01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.113
<v Speaker 3>because maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a pattern or maybe it's </v>

1819
01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:42.530
<v Speaker 3>something that's a convention or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1820
01:28:42.531 --> 01:28:44.010
<v Speaker 3>there may be all sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1821
01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:49.200
<v Speaker 3>that are associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of back in meals,</v>

1822
01:28:49.311 --> 01:28:50.144
<v Speaker 3>fundamental claims was that in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>determine whether or not something </v>

1823
01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:55.184
<v Speaker 3>existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to be able to detect it using </v>

1824
01:28:57.591 --> 01:29:01.070
<v Speaker 3>different methods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's tricky because it's not obvious</v>

1825
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.840
<v Speaker 3>what constitutes a different method,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1826
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:05.363
<v Speaker 3>So you kind of have to make a judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say you use a multi-method </v>

1827
01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:12.930
<v Speaker 3>multitrack means of determining what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>true with your senses.</v>

1828
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:16.860
<v Speaker 3>How many do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six cars.</v>

1829
01:29:16.861 --> 01:29:18.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pro proprioception,</v>

1830
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:19.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1831
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:21.901
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1832
01:29:21.901 --> 01:29:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say for the sake of simplicity,</v>

1833
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:25.680
<v Speaker 3>why one on one?</v>

1834
01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.353
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to increase the likelihood of it being </v>

1835
01:29:29.701 --> 01:29:30.534
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could see something but not be able </v>

1836
01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.633
<v Speaker 4>to touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might be a mirage maybe or a </v>

1837
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:43.050
<v Speaker 4>multiple reasons for it to be pointing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the probability of it.</v>

1838
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.951
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1839
01:29:43.951 --> 01:29:46.470
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you want it to be.</v>

1840
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:50.370
<v Speaker 3>So the sense ideas are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One because you can see that census used</v>

1841
01:29:50.371 --> 01:29:51.540
<v Speaker 3>different modalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1842
01:29:51.541 --> 01:29:52.374
<v Speaker 3>It's like obviously the ice relying on </v>
<v Speaker 3>electromagnetic radiation and the ears </v>

1843
01:29:55.471 --> 01:29:56.304
<v Speaker 3>rely on vibrations in the air and </v>
<v Speaker 3>touches really an atomic phenomena in </v>

1844
01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.260
<v Speaker 3>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1845
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:02.103
<v Speaker 3>because you're feeling the outer </v>
<v Speaker 3>surfaces of electrons with your </v>

1846
01:30:04.651 --> 01:30:08.700
<v Speaker 3>electronic surfaces and there's taste </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is again,</v>

1847
01:30:08.701 --> 01:30:11.480
<v Speaker 3>a molecular level phenomena and smell </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1848
01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:12.590
<v Speaker 3>so our idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>connie,</v>

1849
01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.300
<v Speaker 3>is if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if all five of those things detected,</v>

1850
01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:16.493
<v Speaker 3>it's sufficiently real so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>use it to guide our action and we won't </v>

1851
01:30:19.621 --> 01:30:21.930
<v Speaker 3>be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's five dimensions.</v>

1852
01:30:21.931 --> 01:30:24.510
<v Speaker 3>You need a five dimensional analysis and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's evolved.</v>

1853
01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:25.321
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1854
01:30:25.321 --> 01:30:26.154
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1855
01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:27.083
<v Speaker 3>Let's call that a good estimate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need five ways of detecting </v>

1856
01:30:29.461 --> 01:30:31.650
<v Speaker 3>something before you can be sure it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

1857
01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Now you know when you're learning about </v>
<v Speaker 3>experimental psychology,</v>

1858
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:38.850
<v Speaker 3>they tell you p is less than point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1859
01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:39.693
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1860
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.863
<v Speaker 3>You use a measurement and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>determine whether the probability that </v>

1861
01:30:44.281 --> 01:30:47.840
<v Speaker 3>that has manifested itself exceeds a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain level of chance.</v>

1862
01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.070
<v Speaker 3>If it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the thing exists,</v>

1863
01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:52.680
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually not right.</v>

1864
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:54.833
<v Speaker 3>It's not right for experimental </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology and experimental </v>

1865
01:30:57.091 --> 01:30:59.700
<v Speaker 3>psychologists have known it since the </v>
<v Speaker 3>late fifties.</v>

1866
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:04.080
<v Speaker 3>You have to demonstrate that the damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing exists multiple different ways.</v>

1867
01:31:04.770 --> 01:31:05.603
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What constitutes a different way can be </v>

1868
01:31:07.471 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 3>subject to debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a complicated thing to sort out,</v>

1869
01:31:10.801 --> 01:31:12.540
<v Speaker 3>but you can kind of figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1870
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:15.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you as a physiological measurement</v>

1871
01:31:15.091 --> 01:31:15.924
<v Speaker 3>and self report or something like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you self report and other report or </v>

1872
01:31:19.770 --> 01:31:21.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you don't need five,</v>

1873
01:31:21.661 --> 01:31:24.060
<v Speaker 3>but you probably need three or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

1874
01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on them.</v>

1875
01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:26.363
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm going to do is I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you a story roughly speaking and I </v>

1876
01:31:30.811 --> 01:31:31.644
<v Speaker 3>want to make this story evident at five </v>
<v Speaker 3>or six different levels of analysis and </v>

1877
01:31:35.941 --> 01:31:36.774
<v Speaker 3>I want to show you how the story is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same and all of these levels of </v>

1878
01:31:39.571 --> 01:31:42.570
<v Speaker 3>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the one,</v>

1879
01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:47.010
<v Speaker 3>one of the potential flaws of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>method is this.</v>

1880
01:31:48.150 --> 01:31:51.100
<v Speaker 3>So Joseph Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1881
01:31:51.101 --> 01:31:52.710
<v Speaker 3>he wrote about here on mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1882
01:31:52.711 --> 01:31:53.544
<v Speaker 3>Some of you from undergrad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hero with a thousand faces and one </v>

1883
01:31:56.191 --> 01:31:57.024
<v Speaker 3>of the criticisms of Joseph Campbell and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like him that they read the </v>

1884
01:32:01.301 --> 01:32:05.500
<v Speaker 3>stories of multiple cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have an a priori framework.</v>

1885
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.230
<v Speaker 3>And because of the high priority </v>
<v Speaker 3>framework,</v>

1886
01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 3>they only see what their theory tells </v>
<v Speaker 3>them that they're going to see.</v>

1887
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:13.263
<v Speaker 3>They don't look for the exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a problem with pattern </v>

1888
01:32:15.911 --> 01:32:17.290
<v Speaker 3>recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1889
01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:20.560
<v Speaker 3>You may be able to recognize patterns </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they don't exist.</v>

1890
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:21.903
<v Speaker 3>Now my method could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be criticized on that grounds I </v>

1891
01:32:25.991 --> 01:32:29.470
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way I've tried to protect myself</v>

1892
01:32:29.471 --> 01:32:33.520
<v Speaker 3>against that was to make sure that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>drew from this enough diverse sources so</v>

1893
01:32:33.521 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 3>that the probability that I would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to tell a coherent,</v>

1894
01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:36.813
<v Speaker 3>coherent story across all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>different types of methods is </v>

1895
01:32:40.151 --> 01:32:40.984
<v Speaker 3>vanishingly small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you're going to have to decide if </v>

1896
01:32:43.121 --> 01:32:45.100
<v Speaker 3>you think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1897
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:46.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can,</v>

1898
01:32:47.010 --> 01:32:50.200
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you roughly the dimensions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis.</v>

1899
01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.530
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that I'm going to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you about.</v>

1900
01:32:53.531 --> 01:32:55.990
<v Speaker 3>I've put into practice personally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They worked for me.</v>

1901
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:58.600
<v Speaker 3>They work for the people that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>taught them to.</v>

1902
01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.540
<v Speaker 3>so those are family members often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not only family members,</v>

1903
01:33:01.541 --> 01:33:03.520
<v Speaker 3>lots of other people because I'm also a </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinician.</v>

1904
01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.920
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it seems to work quite nicely.</v>

1905
01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.730
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of people write to me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me that the ideas have worked,</v>

1906
01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:10.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1907
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:11.823
<v Speaker 3>so I've got multi rater reliability </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and then I think it's manifests </v>

1908
01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:20.493
<v Speaker 3>biologically and I think it's manifest </v>
<v Speaker 3>culturally and I think it's manifested </v>

1909
01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:24.664
<v Speaker 3>in these very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very old stories and anthropologically </v>

1910
01:33:27.431 --> 01:33:28.090
<v Speaker 3>and so forth.</v>

1911
01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:29.320
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1912
01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:31.600
<v Speaker 3>make up your own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1913
01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:33.130
<v Speaker 3>you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1914
01:33:33.131 --> 01:33:34.600
<v Speaker 3>and I think the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing,</v>

1915
01:33:34.601 --> 01:33:37.000
<v Speaker 3>and I don't really know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what to make of this,</v>

1916
01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.013
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you have an intuition of </v>

1917
01:33:39.041 --> 01:33:39.874
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1918
01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:43.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like maybe you're describing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem to someone and they say,</v>

1919
01:33:43.630 --> 01:33:44.463
<v Speaker 3>well this seems to be at the heart of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they give you a formulation and </v>

1920
01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:49.000
<v Speaker 3>kinda goes click and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1921
01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:51.430
<v Speaker 3>that's how all those things hang </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

1922
01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pattern recognition mechanism.</v>

1923
01:33:53.771 --> 01:33:54.604
<v Speaker 3>It's insight mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People generally have the feeling that </v>

1924
01:33:57.821 --> 01:33:58.654
<v Speaker 3>when something like that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that something of truth has been </v>

1925
01:34:01.121 --> 01:34:01.954
<v Speaker 3>revealed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now a very common response from the </v>

1926
01:34:06.341 --> 01:34:07.174
<v Speaker 3>students I've had in these courses is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I never tell anyone anything they </v>

1927
01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:13.780
<v Speaker 3>don't already know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1928
01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:16.630
<v Speaker 3>and I think the reason for that is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>hoping the reason is,</v>

1929
01:34:16.631 --> 01:34:19.150
<v Speaker 3>is that what I'm outlining our </v>
<v Speaker 3>archetypal structures,</v>

1930
01:34:19.151 --> 01:34:21.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've drawn a lot of my work from you</v>

1931
01:34:21.190 --> 01:34:23.110
<v Speaker 3>who was very interested in our critical </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures.</v>

1932
01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:25.660
<v Speaker 3>And so what should happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it will happen,</v>

1933
01:34:25.661 --> 01:34:27.520
<v Speaker 3>is when I tell you a story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll think,</v>

1934
01:34:27.521 --> 01:34:28.180
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1935
01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:31.600
<v Speaker 3>that's what that means and I see and </v>
<v Speaker 3>here's all the things that it explains.</v>

1936
01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.390
<v Speaker 3>And so you'll have this sense and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1937
01:34:34.630 --> 01:34:36.940
<v Speaker 3>you talked about your friend with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual awakening.</v>

1938
01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:37.953
<v Speaker 3>Often one of the cognitive phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 3>that accompanies a spiritual awakening </v>

1939
01:34:43.031 --> 01:34:43.864
<v Speaker 3>is the connection of many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many diverse phenomena into a </v>

1940
01:34:47.530 --> 01:34:48.363
<v Speaker 3>overarching unity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you feel that like as a radical </v>

1941
01:34:50.741 --> 01:34:51.574
<v Speaker 3>simplification or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a decrease in entropy or something like </v>

1942
01:34:54.371 --> 01:34:55.450
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a very,</v>

1943
01:34:55.451 --> 01:34:58.610
<v Speaker 3>very powerful sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1944
01:34:58.611 --> 01:35:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's other sources of what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>might call spiritual experience as well,</v>

1945
01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:05.630
<v Speaker 3>but that's certainly one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you can see,</v>

1946
01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:06.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you stories,</v>

1947
01:35:06.861 --> 01:35:07.820
<v Speaker 3>you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>

1948
01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:10.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1949
01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:14.330
<v Speaker 3>how does that story manifest itself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your experience?</v>

1950
01:35:14.650 --> 01:35:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a phenomenal logical level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>

1951
01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:18.584
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the phenomenologists branch of </v>

1952
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:24.620
<v Speaker 3>philosophy started by heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not exactly,</v>

1953
01:35:24.621 --> 01:35:29.621
<v Speaker 3>but let's say extended as well as anyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>extended it by heidegger.</v>

1954
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:32.623
<v Speaker 3>Heidegger thought that western </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy had gone wrong basically </v>

1955
01:35:34.911 --> 01:35:37.670
<v Speaker 3>since the time of socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite a long time,</v>

1956
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:39.283
<v Speaker 3>and he said that we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we became interested in what the world </v>

1957
01:35:41.931 --> 01:35:42.764
<v Speaker 3>was made of and how we knew things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we should have been interested in </v>

1958
01:35:45.591 --> 01:35:46.424
<v Speaker 3>stead was the nature and quality of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being and whaT he meant by being isn't </v>

1959
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:57.070
<v Speaker 3>the objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he meant by being was the manner in</v>

1960
01:35:57.141 --> 01:35:57.974
<v Speaker 3>which you have experience and so there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are elements of being that aren't </v>

1961
01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:07.160
<v Speaker 3>objective elements and so I would say </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain is a phenomenological reality,</v>

1962
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:08.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1963
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:13.130
<v Speaker 3>it's not something you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can Index it objectively,</v>

1964
01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:17.060
<v Speaker 3>but the index is not the phenomena and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1965
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:18.530
<v Speaker 3>is your pain real.</v>

1966
01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:20.380
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

1967
01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:23.330
<v Speaker 3>This is a question for people who think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no such thing as meaning.</v>

1968
01:36:24.730 --> 01:36:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Like you try to argue yourself out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain and see how far you get.</v>

1969
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.791
<v Speaker 3>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1970
01:36:28.791 --> 01:36:30.950
<v Speaker 3>that's not the sort of meaning I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1971
01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:32.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a negative meaning is a place to start,</v>

1972
01:36:32.841 --> 01:36:35.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if something's negative and it's</v>

1973
01:36:35.211 --> 01:36:36.044
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does imply that there's something </v>

1974
01:36:37.161 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 3>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

1975
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:42.260
<v Speaker 3>It might be harder to get ahold of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least it's not pain,</v>

1976
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:43.603
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1977
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.110
<v Speaker 3>but pain descartes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll close with this.</v>

1978
01:36:48.111 --> 01:36:50.000
<v Speaker 3>You guys can have a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Descartes</v>

1979
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:52.363
<v Speaker 3>implemented a method he called radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>doubt when he went on his philosophical </v>

1980
01:36:55.071 --> 01:36:55.904
<v Speaker 3>journey and what descartes looked for </v>
<v Speaker 3>was one thing he couldn't doubt because </v>

1981
01:36:59.751 --> 01:37:03.440
<v Speaker 3>he was probably clinically depressed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just doubting everything.</v>

1982
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.981
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1983
01:37:03.981 --> 01:37:04.814
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I know the world isn't just been </v>

1984
01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.960
<v Speaker 3>mirage made by an evil demon to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1985
01:37:08.961 --> 01:37:09.740
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1986
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.840
<v Speaker 3>to obfuscate reality from me.</v>

1987
01:37:12.710 --> 01:37:13.543
<v Speaker 3>While his conclusion was the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he could not dispute was that he </v>

1988
01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:19.580
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was an could think.</v>

1989
01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.193
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think descartes really meant </v>

1990
01:37:21.921 --> 01:37:26.921
<v Speaker 3>what we meant by think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he meant more what we would mean</v>

1991
01:37:27.021 --> 01:37:31.490
<v Speaker 3>by experience because thought has become</v>
<v Speaker 3>a much more narrowly defined,</v>

1992
01:37:32.230 --> 01:37:35.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>term since the time of descartes.</v>

1993
01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:37.970
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think he meant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think therefore I am.</v>

1994
01:37:37.971 --> 01:37:40.370
<v Speaker 3>I think he meant something like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced.</v>

1995
01:37:40.371 --> 01:37:43.460
<v Speaker 3>I have experienced there for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But regardless of that,</v>

1996
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:46.670
<v Speaker 3>modern people think about it as thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>heidegger was different.</v>

1997
01:37:46.671 --> 01:37:47.504
<v Speaker 3>Heidegger basically said the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can dispute is that that experience </v>

1998
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:55.860
<v Speaker 3>is your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It exists.</v>

1999
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:58.740
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost by definition,</v>

2000
01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the definition of exist.</v>

2001
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:02.243
<v Speaker 1>And then he was interested in what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental elements of existence I've </v>

2002
01:38:05.701 --> 01:38:08.220
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's work and they're not on just like,</v>

2003
01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:09.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fundamental elements of the </v>

2004
01:38:10.771 --> 01:38:11.604
<v Speaker 1>objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more things like pain and for </v>

2005
01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:16.670
<v Speaker 1>me that was the thing that stopped me </v>
<v Speaker 1>from delhi.</v>

2006
01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like a candle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be existence of pain.</v>

2007
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:21.383
<v Speaker 1>It seems real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I might say it seems more real than </v>

2008
01:38:24.151 --> 01:38:24.984
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say you don't believe </v>

2009
01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:28.050
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say,</v>

2010
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you think you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch you when you're in pain.</v>

2011
01:38:32.730 --> 01:38:36.750
<v Speaker 1>And every single one of your actions </v>
<v Speaker 1>will indicate that you believe in it.</v>

2012
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.660
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't not believe in it.</v>

2013
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there and it's there so much that</v>

2014
01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:45.133
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a meaning and so that it's in </v>

2015
01:38:46.881 --> 01:38:50.540
<v Speaker 1>that way that heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part thought of existence as</v>

2016
01:38:50.630 --> 01:38:51.463
<v Speaker 1>or experience as composed of meetings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so part of the reason that this </v>

2017
01:38:54.801 --> 01:38:57.920
<v Speaker 1>course is called maps of meaning is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things we're going to</v>

2018
01:38:57.921 --> 01:38:58.754
<v Speaker 1>look at is the structure of meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to start with negative </v>

2019
01:39:02.121 --> 01:39:04.490
<v Speaker 1>meaning because from my perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2020
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:05.803
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can doubt whether or not good </v>

2021
01:39:06.921 --> 01:39:07.754
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once I'm done telling you about the </v>

2022
01:39:10.431 --> 01:39:11.264
<v Speaker 1>things I know about human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there won't be a single person in this </v>

2023
01:39:13.371 --> 01:39:14.204
<v Speaker 1>room who thinks that evil doesn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think that's a bloody </v>

2024
01:39:17.121 --> 01:39:19.070
<v Speaker 1>horrible thing to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

2025
01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:20.653
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably useful because once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can establish something that you </v>

2026
01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:25.124
<v Speaker 1>cannot deny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can move from that and I think </v>

2027
01:39:28.431 --> 01:39:33.431
<v Speaker 1>you can hypothesize that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of detecting radical evil,</v>

2028
01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you about unit seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>31 at some point or you can look them up</v>

2029
01:39:39.141 --> 01:39:40.790
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

2030
01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:41.653
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

2031
01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Once you can identify radical evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

2032
01:39:46.091 --> 01:39:47.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just beyond a doubt,</v>

2033
01:39:48.010 --> 01:39:48.843
<v Speaker 1>that's reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no justification for that </v>

2034
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:52.000
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what,</v>

2035
01:39:52.570 --> 01:39:54.070
<v Speaker 1>whenever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2036
01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:56.770
<v Speaker 1>then you've got something to stand on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can start thinking,</v>

2037
01:39:56.771 --> 01:39:58.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the absolute opposite of that?</v>

2038
01:39:58.421 --> 01:39:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2039
01:39:59.531 --> 01:40:00.364
<v Speaker 1>it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you could conduct </v>

2040
01:40:02.081 --> 01:40:04.510
<v Speaker 1>yourself so that in your sphere of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

2041
01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.680
<v Speaker 1>the probability like that anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would ever happen is reduced to the</v>

2042
01:40:08.681 --> 01:40:11.110
<v Speaker 1>absolute maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2043
01:40:11.111 --> 01:40:13.110
<v Speaker 1>that's a reasonable moral question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2044
01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:13.750
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2045
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can dispense with,</v>

2046
01:40:16.451 --> 01:40:17.284
<v Speaker 1>with like a casual nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a nihilist can dispense </v>

2047
01:40:21.101 --> 01:40:23.770
<v Speaker 1>with it because he even nihilists </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer.</v>

2048
01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Thank god for that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's their only source of potential </v>

2050
01:40:29.171 --> 01:40:31.240
<v Speaker 1>salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they notice it,</v>

2051
01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:33.340
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm suffering about all this nihilism.</v>

2052
01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that indicates that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something flawed in it.</v>

2053
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It's always possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2054
01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take a break.</v>
