1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.003
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so today we're going to talk about </v>

2
00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:03.564
<v Speaker 1>piaget</v>
<v Speaker 1>and piaget is a constructivist and a </v>

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>constructivist is someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to answer the question,</v>

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.213
<v Speaker 1>where does your personality come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for piaget would be more something </v>

5
00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:22.600
<v Speaker 1>like where do your models of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from,</v>

6
00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:23.434
<v Speaker 1>but his idea of model of the world is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>broad that it's perfectly reasonable to </v>

7
00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:29.314
<v Speaker 1>use personality as a proxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's one of Piaget's initial </v>

8
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.893
<v Speaker 1>propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The common postulate of various </v>

9
00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:38.254
<v Speaker 1>traditional epistemologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Epistemologies are theories of valid </v>

10
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:41.734
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is that knowledge is a fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not a process and that if our </v>

11
00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:46.504
<v Speaker 1>various forms of knowledge are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>incomplete and our various sciences </v>

12
00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:50.764
<v Speaker 1>still imperfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which is acquired is acquired and </v>

13
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:54.544
<v Speaker 1>can therefore be studied statically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence the absolute position of the </v>

14
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is knowledge or how are the various</v>

15
00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:01.654
<v Speaker 1>types of knowledge possible under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>converging influence of a series of </v>

16
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:06.484
<v Speaker 1>factors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're tending more and more today to </v>

17
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:10.150
<v Speaker 1>regard knowledge as a process more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>a state.</v>

18
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Any being or object at sciences attempt </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hold fast dissolves.</v>

19
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Once again in the current of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

20
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.083
<v Speaker 1>It is the last analysis of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and innovate alone that we </v>

21
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:21.934
<v Speaker 1>have the right to state it is a fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we can and should then seek is the </v>

22
00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>law of this process he present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he puts in parentheses,</v>

23
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:30.784
<v Speaker 1>we are well aware of on the other hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fine book by Thomas Kuhn on </v>

24
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 1>scientific revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first aim of genetic epistemology,</v>

25
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>because that's what he called his field </v>
<v Speaker 1>is therefore if one can say so,</v>

26
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:43.144
<v Speaker 1>to take psychology seriously and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>furnish verifications to any question </v>

27
00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 1>which each epistemology necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>raises,</v>

28
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker 1>yet replacing the generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsatisfying,</v>

29
00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:52.354
<v Speaker 1>speculative or implicit psychology with </v>
<v Speaker 1>controllable analysis to know means to </v>

30
00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:02.170
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human knowledge is essentially active to</v>

31
00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:03.004
<v Speaker 1>know is to transform reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to understand how a certain </v>

32
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>state is brought about knowing an object</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not mean copying it.</v>

33
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.023
<v Speaker 1>It means acting upon it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing reality means constructing </v>

34
00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:13.444
<v Speaker 1>systems of transformation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>correspond more or less adequately to </v>

35
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:19.660
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowledge is a system of transformations</v>

36
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 1>that becomes progressively adequate.</v>

37
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all knowledge is always in a state of</v>

38
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.114
<v Speaker 1>development and consists in proceeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one state to a more complete </v>

39
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:30.804
<v Speaker 1>inefficient one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidently it is a question of knowing </v>

40
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>this development and analyzing it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest possible accuracy,</v>

41
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>so here are the sorts of questions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget addressed himself to.</v>

42
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:44.781
<v Speaker 1>They're very fundamental questions upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>what does an individual basis judgments,</v>

43
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.463
<v Speaker 1>what are his norms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that these norms are </v>

44
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.434
<v Speaker 1>validated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the interest of such norms for </v>

45
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:52.464
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of science in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how does the fact that children </v>

46
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>think differently affect our presumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fact itself,</v>

47
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.343
<v Speaker 1>more problems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did children conceptualized number </v>

48
00:03:05.571 --> 00:03:06.404
<v Speaker 1>in space and time and speed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they understand that objects </v>

49
00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:12.590
<v Speaker 1>hidden from view or actually still </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

50
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.053
<v Speaker 1>How do they understand that entities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can transform from one place to </v>

51
00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:18.944
<v Speaker 1>another are the same entities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we understand chance or moral </v>

52
00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:25.670
<v Speaker 1>concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play patterns and dreams are,</v>

53
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.563
<v Speaker 1>and how do we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it that we imitate others and </v>

54
00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:32.850
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean that we can?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

55
00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:36.390
<v Speaker 1>here's a definition of constructivism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from Piaget as well.</v>

56
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Knowledge does not begin in the eye and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not begin in the object.</v>

57
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.933
<v Speaker 1>It begins in the interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reciprocal and simultaneous </v>

58
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 1>construction of the subject on the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and the object on the other.</v>

59
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.850
<v Speaker 1>There is no structure apart from </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction,</v>

60
00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:52.440
<v Speaker 1>either abstract or genetic</v>

61
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.740
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take some of that apart.</v>

62
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.293
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that piaget is pointing </v>
<v Speaker 1>out is that trying to understand what </v>

63
00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:03.854
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is by referring to a body of </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts seems to be somewhat problematic </v>

64
00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:07.604
<v Speaker 1>because facts shift with time and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand facts differently at </v>

65
00:04:11.661 --> 00:04:12.494
<v Speaker 1>different stages of development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though hypothetically we all live </v>

66
00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:16.064
<v Speaker 1>in the same world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that we can get by in some </v>

67
00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:22.040
<v Speaker 1>sense with structures of knowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 1>differ from one another.</v>

68
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.113
<v Speaker 1>I think the easiest way to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is actually to take something like </v>

69
00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:26.204
<v Speaker 1>a pragmatic perspective and pragmatist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think piaget is a pragmatist and </v>

70
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.273
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People basically say that because </v>

71
00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:34.574
<v Speaker 1>they're interested in what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth and of course we know that we </v>

72
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:38.780
<v Speaker 1>don't have absolute truth about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

73
00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:39.614
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have absolute truth about </v>

74
00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:42.104
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know when what you know is </v>

75
00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:44.660
<v Speaker 1>enough?</v>

76
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.493
<v Speaker 1>And the pragmatic answer to that is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>set your own conditions for truth with </v>

77
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:52.910
<v Speaker 1>each of your actions and the way you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is by specifying an outcome.</v>

78
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.870
<v Speaker 1>So if you tell a joke and now outcome is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people should laugh,</v>

79
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if 70 percent of the people laugh,</v>

80
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.313
<v Speaker 1>then that's probably good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say that you've done a </v>

81
00:05:02.931 --> 00:05:03.764
<v Speaker 1>good enough job of matching your social </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge to the circumstance to obtain </v>

82
00:05:06.771 --> 00:05:07.604
<v Speaker 1>your desired end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget's pig piaget's notions of </v>

83
00:05:11.691 --> 00:05:12.524
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>valid knowledge structure seem to be </v>

84
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:16.610
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much pragmatic in origin.</v>

85
00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:17.444
<v Speaker 1>And it's also partly because piaget is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinker who's who's deeply considered </v>

86
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:22.574
<v Speaker 1>the fact of human embodiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact I think Psja has done that </v>

87
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:27.320
<v Speaker 1>more than any of the thinkers that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to.</v>

88
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.890
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for Piaget,</v>

89
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.500
<v Speaker 1>truth is determined inaction.</v>

90
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.320
<v Speaker 1>The next proposition is that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand knowledge,</v>

91
00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:43.154
<v Speaker 1>you should understand the process by </v>
<v Speaker 1>which it's generated rather than the </v>

92
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:46.844
<v Speaker 1>outcome of the knowledge process itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the outcomes transform across </v>

93
00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:50.774
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the nature of the process that you </v>

94
00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 1>engage in to produce knowledge seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be constant across situations.</v>

95
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what is that process?</v>

96
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

97
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.853
<v Speaker 1>that's the next part of constructivism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget you can think of for Piaget in </v>

98
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:06.614
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is a field of latent </v>

99
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>information and interacting with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

100
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>You cold some of it both physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically and abstractly,</v>

101
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>and out of that coding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do you generate yourself,</v>

102
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>but you also generate well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not the object itself,</v>

103
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least your perceptions of the object.</v>

104
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.970
<v Speaker 1>So when you're continually engaged from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pig and perspective and trying to,</v>

105
00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:34.804
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to produce certain </v>

106
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:36.434
<v Speaker 1>transformations in the world and as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce them in an embodied sense </v>

107
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:41.444
<v Speaker 1>because you're acting in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you map the transformations that occur </v>

108
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 1>onto the transformations of your body.</v>

109
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>And that mapping constitutes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical knowledge.</v>

110
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>So for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

111
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:58.631
<v Speaker 1>for Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body of knowledge that guides you is</v>

112
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:00.914
<v Speaker 1>always action predicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to provide you with another </v>

113
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 1>way of understanding Pha so that as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>go through what he has to say,</v>

114
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>we can not only understand what he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

115
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>but we can link it to the other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to talk about.</v>

116
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.133
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a man named Jerome Bruner who </v>

117
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>talked about narrative constructivism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bruner said,</v>

118
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 1>we seem to have no other way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing live time.</v>

119
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.583
<v Speaker 1>Save in the form of a narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to review a little bit for </v>

120
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 1>you what might constitute a basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

121
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:31.844
<v Speaker 1>And then I want to talk to you about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that narratives transformed because </v>

122
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>one of the PSG and propositions is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a given time in development,</v>

123
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.250
<v Speaker 1>you might have a way of interacting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

124
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:44.084
<v Speaker 1>say a Schema that is good enough for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aims that you want to pursue at that </v>

125
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>particular point in time.</v>

126
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 1>But there may come a time when there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations of one sort or another.</v>

127
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 1>That could be specific to you or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could actually happen in the world where</v>

128
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 1>if you continue to perceive an act in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that manner,</v>

129
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

130
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.313
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example from a developmental </v>

131
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're eight years old,</v>

132
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:13.910
<v Speaker 1>it's probably okay for your mother to </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrange play dates for you,</v>

133
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 1>but if that's still happening when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 15,</v>

134
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.323
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem and and so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that the manner in which </v>

135
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 1>someone interacts with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's successful at one point,</v>

136
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:26.144
<v Speaker 1>isn't necessarily successful in the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes there are qualitative </v>

137
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:30.524
<v Speaker 1>transformations in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that the structure that </v>

138
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:33.764
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at the world through has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reconstruct itself to take in more </v>

139
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:42.701
<v Speaker 1>information and then you have to act out</v>
<v Speaker 1>that new body of knowledge that would be</v>

140
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 1>accommodation from a pig and point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>

141
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.323
<v Speaker 1>Piaget assumes that there's two things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening when you're interacting with </v>

142
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:50.264
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that your current body of </v>

143
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:53.294
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is sufficient and all you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do is add to in a rail rather </v>

144
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:56.724
<v Speaker 1>normative way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if any of you know anything about </v>

145
00:08:57.991 --> 00:08:58.824
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Kuhn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is roughly equivalent to Thomas </v>

146
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.143
<v Speaker 1>Kuhn's theory of normal science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So normal science occurs when the body </v>

147
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:07.960
<v Speaker 1>of theory within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

148
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.903
<v Speaker 1>given scientific domain is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>sketched out and what people are doing </v>

149
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>is basically mopping up the details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say that,</v>

150
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now in personality theory,</v>

151
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.183
<v Speaker 1>the psychometric big five models are </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradigmatic and what people are doing </v>

152
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:27.120
<v Speaker 1>is not so much arguing about whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not that structure exists,</v>

153
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 1>but are arguing about something smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what information can you derive</v>

154
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:32.754
<v Speaker 1>from the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take as your set of assumptions </v>

155
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 1>that those five dimensions exist and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see that that's a less comprehensive</v>

156
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>question than do the five dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves exist.</v>

157
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.283
<v Speaker 1>So assimilation is when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of how to act in the world so </v>

158
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:47.970
<v Speaker 1>that things happen the way you want them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

159
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 1>And you can just add more to that in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accommodation occurs when instead the,</v>

160
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.403
<v Speaker 1>the novelty and the transfer formations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've encountered are so large </v>

161
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 1>that you have to reconstitute the theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in order to progress.</v>

162
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.003
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the example I used where when you're </v>

163
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.730
<v Speaker 1>eight or nine years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have play dates arrange,</v>

164
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:11.583
<v Speaker 1>but you can't when you're 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is that you're </v>

165
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>undergoing a series of maturational </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes,</v>

166
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:17.304
<v Speaker 1>a lot of a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a large number of them are </v>

167
00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:19.974
<v Speaker 1>physiological and so you have to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>the assumptions that you use to deal </v>

168
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:25.854
<v Speaker 1>with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the prime assumptions </v>

169
00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 1>might be when you're a child that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay for one of your parents to serve as</v>

170
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 1>a mediator of your social interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the time you hit puberty,</v>

171
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate.</v>

172
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And if you continue to use the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schema,</v>

173
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:41.244
<v Speaker 1>then well then you're not well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're stuck at a developmental </v>

174
00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:46.284
<v Speaker 1>stage that you shouldn't be stuck at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be roughly equivalent to Freud's </v>

175
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:53.100
<v Speaker 1>idea of a fixation to similar idea.</v>

176
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.353
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

177
00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.433
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go back to this little </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schema here and I'm going to </v>

178
00:11:02.711 --> 00:11:05.950
<v Speaker 1>recapitulate the idea that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world,</v>

179
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.873
<v Speaker 1>this is a pragmatic frame of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a cybernetic frame of </v>

180
00:11:09.311 --> 00:11:11.350
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's one of the easiest ways</v>

181
00:11:11.351 --> 00:11:12.184
<v Speaker 1>to understand a head against Schema or </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the beginnings of a Schemata </v>

182
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.713
<v Speaker 1>Schemata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like an arrangement of Schemas </v>

183
00:11:19.511 --> 00:11:24.511
<v Speaker 1>and schemas are like tools to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and the tool that you're using</v>

184
00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:25.834
<v Speaker 1>to deal with the world is the tool that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets you what you want when you act it </v>

185
00:11:28.301 --> 00:11:31.210
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's some propositions with regards</v>

186
00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:33.310
<v Speaker 1>to how those scheme is might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated.</v>

187
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.910
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're somewhere at some point a</v>

188
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.660
<v Speaker 1>and the next is you want some </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation in the world to occur.</v>

189
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.913
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you wouldn't be acting right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have some vision of the outcome </v>

190
00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:45.970
<v Speaker 1>that you wish to obtain.</v>

191
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And then you have a sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

192
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.490
<v Speaker 1>At the most fundamental level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

193
00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:52.324
<v Speaker 1>you have a sequence of embodied that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can apply to the world and hopefully </v>

194
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 1>that produces the transformation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

195
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Now you can take a page from biology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

196
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:02.794
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these schemas or brief </v>

197
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>narratives are embedded in biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

198
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:09.520
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're hungry,</v>

199
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to set up a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schema.</v>

200
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.993
<v Speaker 1>And if you're thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to set up a particular </v>

201
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:15.244
<v Speaker 1>Schema and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human beings are capable of high </v>

202
00:12:17.561 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 1>levels of abstraction so that instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing direct biological goals,</v>

203
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.043
<v Speaker 1>we can perform operations that are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some way conceptually linked to the </v>

204
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:31.441
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment of biological goals in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>social environment across large spans of</v>

205
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:33.544
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a much more complicated </v>

206
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:35.680
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.820
<v Speaker 1>because I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

208
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.440
<v Speaker 1>why are you guys sitting here?</v>

209
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 1>What does that have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological necessity?</v>

210
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.573
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in some sense it's rather tenuous </v>

211
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:48.820
<v Speaker 1>in that it's multiple stages removed </v>
<v Speaker 1>from absolute necessity.</v>

212
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.120
<v Speaker 1>But your hypothesis is instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>foraging around in the frozen ground for</v>

213
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:55.114
<v Speaker 1>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be better to adopt a career </v>

214
00:12:57.041 --> 00:13:02.041
<v Speaker 1>because that'll solve all of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological problems simultaneously.</v>

215
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to repeat that.</v>

216
00:13:03.881 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Speaker 1>So the animals problem is how to fulfill</v>
<v Speaker 1>a motivational state.</v>

217
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Will say your problem is how to fulfill </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple motivational states in a social</v>

218
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 1>environment that's composed of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people doing the same thing in the</v>

219
00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 1>short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medium tournament in the longterm.</v>

220
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.173
<v Speaker 1>And you want to come up with a solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will satisfy all those constraints </v>

221
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.193
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Piaget would regard as a solution </v>

222
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:32.830
<v Speaker 1>like that as an equilibrium state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>equilibrated state is,</v>

223
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:37.390
<v Speaker 1>this is a solution that isn't producing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalies,</v>

224
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:39.820
<v Speaker 1>are novelties when it's enacted in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

225
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.193
<v Speaker 1>and so it's important to understand this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it forms part of the pig and a </v>

226
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.380
<v Speaker 1>theory of morality.</v>

227
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget,</v>

228
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.730
<v Speaker 1>he was a kind of a strange guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a childhood prodigy.</v>

229
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 1>He was studying animals in depth when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a small child.</v>

230
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 1>He published his first scientific paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was 10,</v>

231
00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:00.154
<v Speaker 1>which was on the behavior of mollusks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the next year he was offered to </v>

232
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 1>curatorship of a museum in Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his parents,</v>

233
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 1>given his developmental stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to tell the people who wanted him to</v>

234
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 1>take over the curatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was only 11 and that it probably</v>

235
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

236
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:16.084
<v Speaker 1>when Piaget was an adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went through what you might describe </v>

237
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:19.864
<v Speaker 1>as a messianic crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually regarded messianism Zionism </v>

238
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.933
<v Speaker 1>as a developmental stage that often </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic characterized late </v>

239
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 1>adolescence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at that stage,</v>

240
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:30.694
<v Speaker 1>people are concerned with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between their individual </v>

241
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:37.630
<v Speaker 1>lives in the broader social community </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when he was in that mess scientistic</v>

242
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.270
<v Speaker 1>stage and very much concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality,</v>

243
00:14:40.271 --> 00:14:41.104
<v Speaker 1>he was also suffering from a tension </v>
<v Speaker 1>between scientific and religious points </v>

244
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:46.444
<v Speaker 1>of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he wanted to </v>

245
00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:48.184
<v Speaker 1>do as an adult was to reconcile values </v>
<v Speaker 1>with science or brought more broadly </v>

246
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion with science.</v>

247
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:55.214
<v Speaker 1>But we'll stick to values and morality </v>
<v Speaker 1>with science and I think he got farther </v>

248
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 1>along on that than anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>House.</v>

249
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And the state is one of his most </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent</v>

250
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.563
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an equilibrated state would be </v>

251
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.713
<v Speaker 1>something like.</v>

252
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 1>It could be two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be you in a happy family and it</v>

253
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:22.070
<v Speaker 1>could be the happy family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on your level of analysis,</v>

254
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.293
<v Speaker 1>but you in a happy family are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be celebrated because assuming that </v>

255
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you're as happy as the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

256
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.733
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that you found a </v>
<v Speaker 1>motive operation that simile tediously </v>

257
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 1>works for you and for your family and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher order.</v>

258
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Equilibrated state would be happy you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a happy family,</v>

259
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.880
<v Speaker 1>in a happy city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

260
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>and so there are multiple levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential equilibration and Piaget's.</v>

261
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:49.514
<v Speaker 1>One of Piaget's fundamental claims was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'd equilibrated state was </v>

262
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.673
<v Speaker 1>preferable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a value judgment there to a </v>

263
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.133
<v Speaker 1>disintegrated state and the reason for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was that it took less energy per </v>

264
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:04.520
<v Speaker 1>unit of work to maintain an equilibrium </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

265
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.413
<v Speaker 1>So think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's family and there's family B </v>

266
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.493
<v Speaker 1>and they're competing in a in a local </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and family be as very </v>

267
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 1>disharmonious.</v>

268
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.823
<v Speaker 1>And so in order for the family to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything done or any of the individuals </v>

269
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:20.264
<v Speaker 1>within the family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be a tremendous amount of </v>

270
00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:25.820
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the load is whatever they have to</v>

271
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:26.654
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus the conflict they have to go </v>

272
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 1>through in order to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in many cases,</v>

273
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:33.080
<v Speaker 1>if the situation is disequilibrium good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

274
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:34.303
<v Speaker 1>then the conflict that you have to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through to do whatever it is that you </v>

275
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:40.520
<v Speaker 1>want to do actually requires more energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the thing itself.</v>

276
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:44.330
<v Speaker 1>And so Piaget's point was that whereas </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a happy family will say,</v>

277
00:16:44.331 --> 00:16:48.380
<v Speaker 1>and equilibrated family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both the individuals and the family as a</v>

278
00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 1>unit can move forward without wasting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time in conflict.</v>

279
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:54.740
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget's idea was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:56.750
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a race for success,</v>

281
00:16:56.751 --> 00:16:57.584
<v Speaker 1>however you happen to define success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the equilibrated system is going to </v>

282
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:01.544
<v Speaker 1>outperform the district deliberated </v>
<v Speaker 1>system because the district celebrated </v>

283
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:06.950
<v Speaker 1>system has to waste time and energy on </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement.</v>

284
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a lovely idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

285
00:17:09.211 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a profound idea because what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does is it set up,</v>

286
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.633
<v Speaker 1>it sets up the preconditions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to understand our value </v>

287
00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:18.230
<v Speaker 1>judgements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

288
00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:19.064
<v Speaker 1>and value judgments are outcroppings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories of action because a theory of </v>

289
00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:26.480
<v Speaker 1>action has to do with what you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

290
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's a value judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget would say that the,</v>

291
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.933
<v Speaker 1>the patterns of actually the value </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgements that lead towards a more </v>

292
00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.940
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly equilibrated state are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

293
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Now you can take that a bit further and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say that,</v>

294
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.830
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of akin to piaget's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that children go through stages of</v>

295
00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:49.770
<v Speaker 1>development that are somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable cultures,</v>

296
00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:51.630
<v Speaker 1>although there's a fair bit of debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

297
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.253
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a quite as idea jetty and notion </v>

298
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:56.514
<v Speaker 1>that there only might be a finite number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of deliberated solutions to a set of </v>

299
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:00.560
<v Speaker 1>given problems.</v>

300
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

301
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.260
<v Speaker 1>you pop up on the horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're born and you're a particular kind</v>

302
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:08.094
<v Speaker 1>of entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there are some things that you can </v>

303
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:10.884
<v Speaker 1>do as an entity to continue your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your existence as an entity and there's </v>

304
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:16.164
<v Speaker 1>other things that you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're bounded by a set of </v>

305
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:18.924
<v Speaker 1>limitations and possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the limitation seems to be is </v>

306
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:23.214
<v Speaker 1>that your family has to be sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>well integrated so that you get a </v>

307
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:28.710
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

308
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.873
<v Speaker 1>if babies don't get a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical attention in the first year of </v>

309
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:33.594
<v Speaker 1>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nobody literally touches them and </v>

310
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:36.264
<v Speaker 1>plays with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll often die because their </v>

311
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:43.110
<v Speaker 1>gastrointestinal systems will shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if they don't die,</v>

312
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:43.944
<v Speaker 1>they're so impaired afterwards as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that lack of initial </v>

313
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.053
<v Speaker 1>stimulation that they never recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see right off the bat </v>

314
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:52.703
<v Speaker 1>that one of the preconditions for even </v>
<v Speaker 1>for existence as a human being is that </v>

315
00:18:56.821 --> 00:19:00.040
<v Speaker 1>you have to be born into a familial </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that,</v>

316
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 1>that has certain structures in place.</v>

317
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Now some of them are obvious like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

318
00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:06.084
<v Speaker 1>you should be fed and you have to be fed</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you need to be fat and you have to </v>

319
00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:13.821
<v Speaker 1>be protected and sheltered and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

320
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you have to be exposed to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of information flow and so on.</v>

321
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:18.743
<v Speaker 1>So your physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious physical needs have to be taken </v>

322
00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:21.654
<v Speaker 1>care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there are less obvious things </v>

323
00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 1>that you need from your local </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

324
00:19:25.951 --> 00:19:26.784
<v Speaker 1>like physical attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally touch and play and social </v>

325
00:19:33.031 --> 00:19:33.864
<v Speaker 1>interaction and language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if any of those are lacking in </v>

326
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.800
<v Speaker 1>the initial developmental stages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on the stage,</v>

327
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.590
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be so crippled that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't be able to.</v>

328
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to survive and thrive </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

329
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.313
<v Speaker 1>So then you can think that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that there's a set of </v>

330
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:52.794
<v Speaker 1>constraints that define the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>within which you can thrive as an </v>

331
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:56.844
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

332
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

333
00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.973
<v Speaker 1>there's a set of constraints within </v>
<v Speaker 1>which a family can survive as a family </v>

334
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:04.434
<v Speaker 1>without blowing apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you put multiple families </v>

335
00:20:07.171 --> 00:20:08.004
<v Speaker 1>together in some sort of community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a set of constraints that have </v>

336
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:14.520
<v Speaker 1>to be met for those families to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in relative harmony and so on.</v>

337
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Speaker 1>All the way up the levels of complexity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a properly equilibrated state,</v>

338
00:20:19.081 --> 00:20:19.914
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be one where you're thriving in a </v>

339
00:20:21.361 --> 00:20:24.450
<v Speaker 1>thriving family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a thriving community and so forth,</v>

340
00:20:24.451 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 1>all the way up the all the way up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chain of complexity.</v>

341
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

342
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:33.840
<v Speaker 1>very smart idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can also imagine that one of the</v>

343
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:34.674
<v Speaker 1>things that that means is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of moral systems might </v>

344
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:43.680
<v Speaker 1>have some similarities across cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know this is true already because</v>

345
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:48.681
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of human universals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if take individuals and you put them</v>

346
00:20:49.271 --> 00:20:50.104
<v Speaker 1>in geographical area a and you take </v>
<v Speaker 1>different individuals and you put them </v>

347
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:56.590
<v Speaker 1>in geographical area B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the nature of the constraints</v>

348
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.573
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that there is some </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively limited subset of solutions </v>

349
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:05.800
<v Speaker 1>that will satisfy everyone at each of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those levels of analysis,</v>

350
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:06.873
<v Speaker 1>you're going to expect relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar moral systems to develop in </v>

351
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 1>different cultures.</v>

352
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 1>And so it's also a powerful argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>against moral relativism.</v>

353
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 1>relativism is a tricky thing because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

355
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

356
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:21.310
<v Speaker 1>are people the same or are they </v>
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>

357
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.353
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it depends on what you mean when </v>

358
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 1>you ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:27.004
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not being sarcastic about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That question is not answerable without </v>

360
00:21:31.781 --> 00:21:35.050
<v Speaker 1>some additional information about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're up to because it's like saying,</v>

361
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.860
<v Speaker 1>well our human languages the same or </v>
<v Speaker 1>different and the answer is,</v>

362
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:40.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the same and different.</v>

363
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.620
<v Speaker 1>There are levels of analysis at which </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the same and there are levels of</v>

364
00:21:44.621 --> 00:21:45.454
<v Speaker 1>analysis at which they're different and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you consider the levels of </v>

365
00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:49.324
<v Speaker 1>analysis with the similarities more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important than the levels of analysis </v>

366
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.073
<v Speaker 1>with the differences is going to depend </v>
<v Speaker 1>on what you want as a consequence of </v>

367
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:57.430
<v Speaker 1>asking the question.</v>

368
00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.013
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that there are broad and </v>

369
00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:06.331
<v Speaker 1>identifiable similarities across people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't seem to be merely biological.</v>

370
00:22:06.941 --> 00:22:09.910
<v Speaker 1>They're also biological and cultural and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:14.440
<v Speaker 1>you can see examples of that pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly by the fact that,</v>

372
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are going to be more </v>

373
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:20.890
<v Speaker 1>smartphones in the world next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there are people and so it's pretty</v>

374
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:21.724
<v Speaker 1>obvious that there's a universal market </v>
<v Speaker 1>for smartphones and that says something </v>

375
00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:25.450
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 1>that says something about the makeup of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people themselves regardless of culture.</v>

377
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.083
<v Speaker 1>Because people find tools that </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate social communication </v>

378
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:34.923
<v Speaker 1>desirable and they find tools that </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate information gathering </v>

379
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:43.081
<v Speaker 1>desirable and they don't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught to desire that they are just like</v>

380
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:46.550
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

381
00:22:46.551 --> 00:22:47.384
<v Speaker 1>so like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget is a good antidote to moral </v>

382
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 1>relativism because the idea that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

383
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:56.530
<v Speaker 1>think about it this way because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>another way to understand it.</v>

384
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you two examples.</v>

385
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:01.803
<v Speaker 1>There were multiplayer online games in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the early stages of multiplayer online </v>

386
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:10.900
<v Speaker 1>games that collapsed into anarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they had to be shut down.</v>

387
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that was that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't playable games.</v>

388
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.093
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some flaw in their underlying </v>

389
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:17.524
<v Speaker 1>set of assumptions that made them </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsustainable as a meeting place for </v>

390
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:23.710
<v Speaker 1>multiple human beings across large </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods of time.</v>

391
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.113
<v Speaker 1>Others are more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others are more calibrated and people </v>

392
00:23:26.831 --> 00:23:29.410
<v Speaker 1>will play them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can also think about a game as an</v>

393
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:31.750
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium state for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

394
00:23:31.751 --> 00:23:34.180
<v Speaker 1>and Piaget is quite smart about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>

395
00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:37.180
<v Speaker 1>So let's say a monopoly game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

396
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 1>is it an equivalent rated state?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the answer to that is yes,</v>

397
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:45.040
<v Speaker 1>in so far as all the players finished </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game and then you might.</v>

398
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the players finished the game and </v>

399
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:48.670
<v Speaker 1>they're still friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

400
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.533
<v Speaker 1>because that would be another level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>specification or constraint that you </v>

401
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:52.664
<v Speaker 1>could put on it.</v>

402
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.893
<v Speaker 1>But it's also interesting if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider something like an enjoyable </v>

403
00:23:57.801 --> 00:23:58.634
<v Speaker 1>game as an equilibrated estate that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have competition within an </v>

404
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:04.940
<v Speaker 1>equilibrated status social community </v>
<v Speaker 1>with no problem.</v>

405
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:08.570
<v Speaker 1>As long as everybody agrees on what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules for the competition are,</v>

406
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:09.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

407
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:14.501
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget actually regarded competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>as necessary element of games because he</v>

408
00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:18.410
<v Speaker 1>said that game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very so interesting.</v>

409
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:22.790
<v Speaker 1>He actually thought of competition in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense as a necessary as necessarily</v>

410
00:24:22.791 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 1>tied in with with cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example,</v>

411
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.410
<v Speaker 1>take a hockey game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we could say,</v>

412
00:24:30.411 --> 00:24:32.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our people in the playing hockey,</v>

413
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 1>are they competing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they cooperating?</v>

414
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.100
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

415
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:37.934
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty hard to distinguish because </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the players within a given team are </v>

416
00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:44.420
<v Speaker 1>cooperating in so far as they're given </v>
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

417
00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:45.254
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that each player </v>
<v Speaker 1>is trying to climb the hierarchy of </v>

418
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:50.114
<v Speaker 1>competence within the team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time maximizing the </v>

419
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 1>probability that the team will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful across multiple games.</v>

420
00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.113
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that there's a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints around how that player has </v>

421
00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:03.590
<v Speaker 1>to interact with his teammates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

422
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.800
<v Speaker 1>He has to work in a manner that enables </v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of his teammates because</v>

423
00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:12.260
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a psychopathic strategy,</v>

424
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad longterm strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

425
00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:16.130
<v Speaker 1>okay fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

426
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 1>people are cooperating within the team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about between teams?</v>

427
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:23.240
<v Speaker 1>And then the answer to that is while </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cooperating,</v>

428
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.120
<v Speaker 1>insofar as they follow the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

429
00:25:25.121 --> 00:25:25.954
<v Speaker 1>and that they don't bring a basketball </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the hockey game or a set a chess set </v>

430
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:31.243
<v Speaker 1>to the hockey game because obviously you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't play chess in hockey at the same </v>

431
00:25:34.191 --> 00:25:35.024
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everybody's agreed to act out a </v>

432
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 1>certain set of behavioral risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints.</v>

433
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.310
<v Speaker 1>And in so far as they're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a cooperative.</v>

434
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a cooperative maneuver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty.</v>

435
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:47.203
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty interesting to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget actually believed that children </v>

436
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:55.331
<v Speaker 1>couldn't become social until so at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earliest stages of development as far as</v>

437
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:56.843
<v Speaker 1>piaget was concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children in some sense we're playing by </v>

438
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:01.304
<v Speaker 1>themselves and the reason they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is because they're not very </v>

439
00:26:03.651 --> 00:26:04.484
<v Speaker 1>organized yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their bodies are sort of not completely </v>

440
00:26:06.141 --> 00:26:06.974
<v Speaker 1>under their control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could think of a child as a non </v>

441
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:14.681
<v Speaker 1>equilibrated set of quasi functional and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I unified knowledge subsystems.</v>

442
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.553
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a child is born and they're laying </v>

443
00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:24.884
<v Speaker 1>on their back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their arms are kind of floating around </v>

444
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:29.810
<v Speaker 1>like this and the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>their arms aren't myelinated yet.</v>

445
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.830
<v Speaker 1>The but babies kind of myelinated from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system perspective in the center</v>

446
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 1>of its body and its mouth is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>wired up,</v>

447
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:37.603
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of it isn't very formed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what the child has to do is </v>

448
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.413
<v Speaker 1>integrate him or herself as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual entity and bring all those </v>

449
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:46.703
<v Speaker 1>subsystems online and into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of integrated across </v>

450
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:51.810
<v Speaker 1>reasonable lengths of time.</v>

451
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 1>And then the next goal is to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone else.</v>

452
00:26:54.631 --> 00:26:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's about three years old when </v>
<v Speaker 1>social place starts.</v>

453
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.880
<v Speaker 1>So then if you and I are playing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're playing,</v>

454
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.560
<v Speaker 1>say pretend play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to say,</v>

455
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:04.590
<v Speaker 1>well we're going to do x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll lay out the ground rules,</v>

456
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:07.980
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do x and we can compete </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get to towards x.</v>

457
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.070
<v Speaker 1>But if we couldn't have unified our </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>

458
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:11.904
<v Speaker 1>so unified these frames of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be able to compete in the </v>

459
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:14.964
<v Speaker 1>same space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things piaget is </v>

460
00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:17.994
<v Speaker 1>pointing out is that it's clearly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case that a competitive game can </v>

461
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.013
<v Speaker 1>facilitate cooperation and in fact the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment of such games might </v>

462
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 1>actually be absolutely fundamental to </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialization itself.</v>

463
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.290
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because well,</v>

464
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:33.900
<v Speaker 1>you don't just want a game that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody can play.</v>

465
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.123
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's sufficiently </v>

466
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:39.000
<v Speaker 1>motivating for people you want to game </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone can play,</v>

467
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:39.834
<v Speaker 1>that everyone has a chance at winning </v>
<v Speaker 1>because playing is something that's for </v>

468
00:27:43.831 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

469
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.890
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a good game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just playing it as interesting.</v>

470
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:52.070
<v Speaker 1>But winning is also something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that places another constraint on</v>

471
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:57.830
<v Speaker 1>those games that people find that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are willing to voluntarily play.</v>

472
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:59.023
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of the things that you can think </v>

473
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:00.594
<v Speaker 1>about with regards to the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the 20th century was an </v>

474
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:09.531
<v Speaker 1>experiment in producing games that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on rational assumptions about</v>

475
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.020
<v Speaker 1>the nature of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

476
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:16.230
<v Speaker 1>the Communists said well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from each,</v>

477
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.580
<v Speaker 1>according to his ability to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to his need,</v>

478
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:23.040
<v Speaker 1>which sounds like a pretty reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>

479
00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:23.874
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should work as hard as you can </v>

480
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:25.974
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and give what you can to the community </v>

481
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:30.360
<v Speaker 1>and if you need something from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community than it should be given to you</v>

482
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:31.051
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

483
00:28:31.051 --> 00:28:31.884
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a pretty positive </v>

484
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.480
<v Speaker 1>presumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

485
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.420
<v Speaker 1>when there were other presumptions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>went along with the theory as well.</v>

486
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Like the fact that private property was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was a scourge and,</v>

487
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.720
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be eliminated.</v>

488
00:28:45.721 --> 00:28:46.620
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:51.830
<v Speaker 1>lots of societies set that game up as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment in some sense.</v>

490
00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And we found out very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly that it didn't work.</v>

491
00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So all games are not equally playable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>

492
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.570
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a proposition that you can use to orient</v>

493
00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:07.404
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a world where people talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the relativism of different moral </v>

494
00:29:10.651 --> 00:29:11.484
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously there's some relativism </v>

495
00:29:12.991 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 1>because in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

496
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.673
<v Speaker 1>you can do perfectly well playing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plumber game or playing the lawyer game </v>

497
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.550
<v Speaker 1>and the plumber game and a lawyer Gamer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously different.</v>

498
00:29:22.551 --> 00:29:25.070
<v Speaker 1>It all sorts of levels of analysis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.730
<v Speaker 1>those are modes of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of them in some senses.</v>

500
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Moral systems and both of them can </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate in the same environment.</v>

501
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.333
<v Speaker 1>So even in an elevated state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's room for a fair bit of </v>

502
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:38.100
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's variability within boundaries.</v>

503
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.233
<v Speaker 1>Just like the play when you're playing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex game is variable within </v>

504
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:43.360
<v Speaker 1>boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:46.600
<v Speaker 1>in most games that are enjoyable to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple times,</v>

506
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 1>set out some pretty serious constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But within that system of constraints,</v>

507
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 1>they enable a lot of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

508
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

509
00:29:56.111 --> 00:29:58.620
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an overview of Piagetian theory.</v>

510
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.463
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm particularly interest with regards </v>

511
00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 1>to this course in Piaget's theories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral development.</v>

512
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:06.130
<v Speaker 1>And I outlined them in some sense right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

513
00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:06.964
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

514
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.833
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that would happen is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that once a Nyquil abraded state is set </v>

515
00:30:10.781 --> 00:30:11.614
<v Speaker 1>up at multiple levels of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child's job is to interact with the </v>

516
00:30:15.521 --> 00:30:19.040
<v Speaker 1>environment in a manner that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupt,</v>

517
00:30:19.041 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 1>celebrate the systems that the child is </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of.</v>

518
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:23.320
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialization,</v>

519
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so for,</v>

520
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.680
<v Speaker 1>in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

521
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.233
<v Speaker 1>the only reason that this class can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead without interruption is that </v>

522
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.290
<v Speaker 1>you're all playing and equilibrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

523
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.600
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be here,</v>

524
00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:38.620
<v Speaker 1>but you are.</v>

525
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.233
<v Speaker 1>And there's a whole large number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unwritten procedural rules for being </v>

526
00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:47.710
<v Speaker 1>here and you're all following them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

527
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 1>when you can think about that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of some degree of tyranny.</v>

528
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.430
<v Speaker 1>And people have made that comment about </v>
<v Speaker 1>classrooms and sometimes it's true,</v>

529
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:55.623
<v Speaker 1>but you can also think about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty successful equilibrated state </v>

530
00:30:58.721 --> 00:31:01.930
<v Speaker 1>because universities have been around </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a thousand years,</v>

531
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've continued to cross time.</v>

532
00:31:04.121 --> 00:31:06.310
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a pretty good game.</v>

533
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.160
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trick is,</v>

534
00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:14.161
<v Speaker 1>is that the value systems emerge as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of multiple constraints laid</v>

535
00:31:14.921 --> 00:31:15.754
<v Speaker 1>down by the fact that there are multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of reality that have to be </v>

536
00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:19.744
<v Speaker 1>harmoniously working simultaneously and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're biologically celebrated </v>

537
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.870
<v Speaker 1>system in so far as you're healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

538
00:31:25.871 --> 00:31:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

539
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.053
<v Speaker 1>none of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of your DNA has decided to make a </v>

540
00:31:30.311 --> 00:31:33.130
<v Speaker 1>go of it on its own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically what happens when you</v>

541
00:31:33.131 --> 00:31:33.964
<v Speaker 1>develop cancer and so it's a stacking of</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems on top of one another so that </v>

542
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.270
<v Speaker 1>each is nested in the other and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all working together and it's,</v>

543
00:31:42.271 --> 00:31:43.600
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very,</v>

544
00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:44.434
<v Speaker 1>very tight set of constraints and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly lots of situations </v>

545
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:48.970
<v Speaker 1>where none of those are going to be met.</v>

546
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:50.613
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

547
00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.313
<v Speaker 1>what's your motivation for learning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fits very well into cybernetic </v>

548
00:32:03.741 --> 00:32:05.420
<v Speaker 1>models of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of learning as well.</v>

549
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.493
<v Speaker 1>While you're motivated to learn what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do doesn't produce what you want it to </v>

550
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.540
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another,</v>

551
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.200
<v Speaker 1>that's another description of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatism.</v>

552
00:32:15.201 --> 00:32:16.034
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remember this is an action oriented </v>

553
00:32:18.111 --> 00:32:18.944
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're specifying the outcome and then </v>

554
00:32:20.601 --> 00:32:21.434
<v Speaker 1>you're acting on the world in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it about and if it doesn't work </v>

555
00:32:23.721 --> 00:32:26.900
<v Speaker 1>then you have to reexamine your </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions and then.</v>

556
00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Or it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to reexamine your assumptions,</v>

557
00:32:31.341 --> 00:32:32.174
<v Speaker 1>which would be part of a combination </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'd be shifting around the </v>

558
00:32:34.401 --> 00:32:36.680
<v Speaker 1>assumptions of the theory within which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're operating,</v>

559
00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 1>but you're also going to be assimilating</v>
<v Speaker 1>information to.</v>

560
00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

561
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:42.554
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're 15 or 16 and you've tried </v>

562
00:32:44.811 --> 00:32:49.520
<v Speaker 1>to establish a relationship with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have a romantic interest in and</v>

563
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:51.170
<v Speaker 1>that's failed multiple times.</v>

564
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Well the first thing is it's obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>

565
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.490
<v Speaker 1>you're the set of assumptions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bringing to bear on the situation</v>

566
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.320
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are inaccurate,</v>

567
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:01.640
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

568
00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:03.410
<v Speaker 1>what's the evidence that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>inaccurate?</v>

569
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.660
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

570
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.470
<v Speaker 1>you aren't engaging in any romantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and that's the whole point</v>

571
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:10.304
<v Speaker 1>of the theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're inaccurate in so far as </v>

572
00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:13.820
<v Speaker 1>they're not producing the desired </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

573
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>

574
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:17.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you do about that?</v>

575
00:33:17.001 --> 00:33:17.834
<v Speaker 1>And one would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you could gather some more </v>

576
00:33:19.281 --> 00:33:20.114
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I do with my </v>

577
00:33:21.321 --> 00:33:22.340
<v Speaker 1>clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

578
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 1>if they happen to be terrified of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite sex,</v>

579
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:25.874
<v Speaker 1>which is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally is a very high probability a </v>

580
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:31.843
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often get them to go to speed dating </v>

581
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.833
<v Speaker 1>games because they can interact with 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in this space of an hour or two </v>

582
00:33:40.881 --> 00:33:45.881
<v Speaker 1>and it expands their knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions and also their knowledge of</v>

583
00:33:45.981 --> 00:33:48.380
<v Speaker 1>the variability of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dealing with.</v>

584
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.840
<v Speaker 1>And so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of exposure.</v>

585
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 1>So you could say if you're using the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of habituation theory,</v>

586
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:54.891
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

587
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:56.750
<v Speaker 1>they're just getting accustomed to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

588
00:33:56.751 --> 00:33:58.910
<v Speaker 1>but that's rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what they're doing at all.</v>

589
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.103
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is going in there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're interacting and each time they </v>

590
00:34:02.631 --> 00:34:03.464
<v Speaker 1>interact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gather more information and then </v>

591
00:34:05.331 --> 00:34:09.290
<v Speaker 1>what did they do with that information </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they build it into themselves.</v>

592
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.303
<v Speaker 1>And that means that they start behaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently and they start </v>

593
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:15.680
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing themselves in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

594
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.860
<v Speaker 1>And so some of it's built in at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedural level,</v>

595
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:24.010
<v Speaker 1>which means maybe they become more fluid</v>
<v Speaker 1>and less awkward in their nonverbal self</v>

596
00:34:24.011 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 1>presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

597
00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:27.224
<v Speaker 1>they're also incorporating abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that's going to help them </v>

598
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:34.190
<v Speaker 1>expand their domain of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for Piaget,</v>

599
00:34:34.191 --> 00:34:37.460
<v Speaker 1>the motive is if it doesn't work well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should be motivated to fix it.</v>

600
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.293
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work under all </v>

601
00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:43.430
<v Speaker 1>circumstances because sometimes if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work,</v>

602
00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:45.380
<v Speaker 1>it crushes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

603
00:34:45.381 --> 00:34:46.214
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's something else we'll talk </v>

604
00:34:47.481 --> 00:34:48.314
<v Speaker 1>about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

605
00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.393
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this little diagram kind of points </v>

606
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:55.940
<v Speaker 1>out a little more complicated version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

607
00:34:55.941 --> 00:34:59.570
<v Speaker 1>So you're going from point a which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unbearable present to point b,</v>

608
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.613
<v Speaker 1>and there's more or less two things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can happen and one is what you want to </v>

609
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:08.360
<v Speaker 1>have happened and the other is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than you want happens.</v>

610
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the thing that you,</v>

611
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.360
<v Speaker 1>that happens that you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen is minor,</v>

612
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.883
<v Speaker 1>in which case you can just modify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to change your whole </v>

613
00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:21.860
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just modify one tiny sub element</v>

614
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:23.900
<v Speaker 1>of it and you'll get where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

615
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.123
<v Speaker 1>if I wanted to walk towards that set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doors there and I was going to do it </v>

616
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.100
<v Speaker 1>blindfolded and I wasn't aware of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

617
00:35:31.101 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I would walk forward until I encountered</v>
<v Speaker 1>a desk say,</v>

618
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.623
<v Speaker 1>and then I could just feel my way around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desk and continue forward so I </v>

619
00:35:38.281 --> 00:35:39.960
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have to disrupt the whole plan.</v>

620
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I would just have to alter my core </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of it.</v>

621
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm going to med school </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically and I write the AMCAP and</v>

622
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:47.904
<v Speaker 1>I get 30th percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which 30 percent of the people get or </v>

623
00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:52.254
<v Speaker 1>lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

624
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Then you're not going to medical school </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that requires a radical revamping</v>

625
00:35:58.351 --> 00:36:03.351
<v Speaker 1>of the of the system that you're using </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Schema ties your world and you know,</v>

626
00:36:03.481 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that would be motivating to.</v>

627
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.660
<v Speaker 1>That would motivate you to see what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did wrong and to change it.</v>

628
00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:12.690
<v Speaker 1>So you could go to medical school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's just hopeless.</v>

629
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.003
<v Speaker 1>What you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a radical act of accommodation </v>

630
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:16.914
<v Speaker 1>is you do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you might go through an </v>

631
00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:21.510
<v Speaker 1>intervening period of tremendous chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

632
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:26.630
<v Speaker 1>every thing has fallen apart into its </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidiary elements and you have no idea</v>

633
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 1>how to unify that once again into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>calibrated state,</v>

634
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:31.343
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the diagram here shows you point a </v>

635
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:34.680
<v Speaker 1>and point b.</v>

636
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 1>It says when you're going to point a </v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you want can happen and that's</v>

637
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:39.684
<v Speaker 1>great because you move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you validate the whole theory or </v>

638
00:36:43.471 --> 00:36:44.304
<v Speaker 1>you can move forward and something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't unexpect don't expect happens </v>

639
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:52.080
<v Speaker 1>and you don't understand it and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stops you and if it's bad enough,</v>

640
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.500
<v Speaker 1>it invalidates the whole theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask,</v>

641
00:36:55.501 --> 00:36:56.334
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between a small </v>

642
00:36:57.301 --> 00:36:58.134
<v Speaker 1>disruption and a large disruption?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very complicated thing to </v>

643
00:37:01.441 --> 00:37:02.274
<v Speaker 1>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it took me a long time to figure </v>

644
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:07.740
<v Speaker 1>this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it probably took 20 years is</v>

645
00:37:07.741 --> 00:37:11.220
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine that each of your,</v>

646
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.293
<v Speaker 1>your Schema,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your systems about adaptation work in a </v>

647
00:37:16.021 --> 00:37:19.590
<v Speaker 1>given area and across a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

648
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:20.873
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you could say the most fundamental </v>

649
00:37:22.861 --> 00:37:23.694
<v Speaker 1>assumptions that you have are the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>that for you have worked across the </v>

650
00:37:27.691 --> 00:37:32.310
<v Speaker 1>broadest possible range of situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and time spans.</v>

651
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 1>So they work when you're alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work with,</v>

652
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:35.873
<v Speaker 1>when you're with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work in the short term and they </v>

653
00:37:37.921 --> 00:37:42.921
<v Speaker 1>work in the longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you disrupt a Schema that Schema that</v>

654
00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:47.550
<v Speaker 1>has oriented you across wide swaths of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and space,</v>

655
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.250
<v Speaker 1>then that's really going to dysregulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>you emotionally.</v>

656
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you disrupt the Schema that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>only locally operating,</v>

657
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 1>like the table example that I gave you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it doesn't spread much.</v>

658
00:37:58.411 --> 00:37:59.244
<v Speaker 1>It's you can make a minor adjustment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's only relevant to this time and </v>

659
00:38:02.161 --> 00:38:04.680
<v Speaker 1>place and it produced a little burst of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

660
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes even positive emotion because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just get curious about it instead of</v>

661
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.040
<v Speaker 1>frightened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

662
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:12.103
<v Speaker 1>and I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you as we proceed a little </v>

663
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:17.250
<v Speaker 1>more formal way of Schema enticing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because when you're reading piaget,</v>

664
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:18.084
<v Speaker 1>you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well at what point does assimilation </v>

665
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 1>become accommodation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer that I just provided,</v>

666
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:26.850
<v Speaker 1>which I hope is reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible is,</v>

667
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:28.560
<v Speaker 1>is the best I can provide.</v>

668
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Here's a more concrete way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

669
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.063
<v Speaker 1>You're a premed student or let's do </v>
<v Speaker 1>prelaunch because let's pick on the pre </v>

670
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Speaker 1>law students instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a pre law student.</v>

671
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:40.510
<v Speaker 1>So we can imagine that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions that go into that.</v>

672
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Think about them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're reasonably intelligent,</v>

673
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:49.150
<v Speaker 1>you're reasonably verbally intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do well on the Lsat,</v>

674
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.860
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a career as a lawyer</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for you if you do well.</v>

675
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.173
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a lawyer is a perfectly valid way </v>

676
00:38:58.931 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 1>of being in the world from a moral and </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical perspective.</v>

677
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.033
<v Speaker 1>Being a lawyer is better than any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of being in the world because other </v>

678
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:06.183
<v Speaker 1>for you anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise why wouldn't you pick </v>

679
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:08.980
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

680
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:11.650
<v Speaker 1>so those are pretty fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions and then you can think,</v>

681
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.813
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of your Schema do they </v>

682
00:39:14.921 --> 00:39:16.180
<v Speaker 1>underlie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

683
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.820
<v Speaker 1>your judgement about your intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's say also your relative ability</v>

684
00:39:21.821 --> 00:39:24.580
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability isn't only intelligence,</v>

685
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:25.870
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

686
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.910
<v Speaker 1>You bring that with you pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you go.</v>

687
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.070
<v Speaker 1>There may be some domains where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

688
00:39:30.071 --> 00:39:31.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as smart as I could be there,</v>

689
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:33.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's usually quite a general </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption.</v>

690
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.940
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say you write the Olsat sat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just bomb out.</v>

691
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.033
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like you're not as smart as you </v>

692
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:43.060
<v Speaker 1>thought you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then what do you do about that?</v>

693
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rough because you not only do have </v>

694
00:39:45.941 --> 00:39:48.160
<v Speaker 1>to reconstitute your vision of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

695
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.390
<v Speaker 1>but you have to reconstitute your vision</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the present and the past.</v>

696
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.060
<v Speaker 1>All those times that you thought you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were so smart,</v>

697
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:55.943
<v Speaker 1>it turns out you weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that that's because of </v>

698
00:39:59.311 --> 00:40:02.530
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those presuppositions are so fundamental</v>

699
00:40:02.531 --> 00:40:06.010
<v Speaker 1>that disrupting them is going to produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair degree of negative emotion.</v>

700
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.090
<v Speaker 1>So and you can tell from from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram,</v>

701
00:40:10.091 --> 00:40:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you imagine that when you're moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward from point a to point b,</v>

702
00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:14.044
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>

703
00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:14.963
<v Speaker 1>There are obstacles that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter that you know of and you can </v>

704
00:40:17.141 --> 00:40:17.974
<v Speaker 1>just put a detour in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there obstacles that emerged that </v>

705
00:40:19.871 --> 00:40:22.090
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea how to conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever?</v>

706
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.493
<v Speaker 1>That often happens to people if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop the symptoms of a very serious </v>

707
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:27.994
<v Speaker 1>disease or if someone they love develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>severe the symptoms of a very serious </v>

708
00:40:31.241 --> 00:40:32.074
<v Speaker 1>disease because not only are you not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going where you thought you were with </v>

709
00:40:36.461 --> 00:40:38.260
<v Speaker 1>the person that you thought you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

710
00:40:38.261 --> 00:40:40.690
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in the interim.</v>

711
00:40:40.691 --> 00:40:43.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to accommodate to that.</v>

712
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:47.440
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget missed,</v>

713
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:48.274
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's often catastrophic </v>

714
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:54.190
<v Speaker 1>discontinuity in this stage progression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

715
00:40:54.191 --> 00:40:55.024
<v Speaker 1>and he was looking at little kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they put their cognitive schema </v>

716
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:57.904
<v Speaker 1>together and generally they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely distraught and destroyed by </v>

717
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.680
<v Speaker 1>the necessity for transformation into </v>
<v Speaker 1>purely cognitive realm.</v>

718
00:41:05.681 --> 00:41:06.514
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

719
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:14.190
<v Speaker 1>well I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you my nephew,</v>

720
00:41:14.191 --> 00:41:16.540
<v Speaker 1>his dream about the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I tell you that?</v>

721
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:17.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

722
00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:18.274
<v Speaker 1>So he was going through a stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition at that point because while </v>

723
00:41:20.901 --> 00:41:21.734
<v Speaker 1>there were two things happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one was that he was going off to </v>

724
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:25.510
<v Speaker 1>kindergarten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

725
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 1>And then there was some instability in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his family.</v>

726
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And so he had to figure out how to cope </v>
<v Speaker 1>with both of those,</v>

727
00:41:32.171 --> 00:41:33.004
<v Speaker 1>and one of the ways of coping was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become more of an individual and his </v>

728
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:38.990
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

729
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 1>laid out for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem,</v>

730
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:41.803
<v Speaker 1>the problem was there were problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all the little bitey things </v>

731
00:41:44.631 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 1>that were jumping up on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their problems.</v>

732
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:51.260
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that the problems keep</v>

733
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.990
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only are there problems,</v>

734
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:54.824
<v Speaker 1>but there's an indefinite number of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's something that generates </v>

735
00:41:57.621 --> 00:41:57.980
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

736
00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:58.813
<v Speaker 1>It's like the hydro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember the Hydra in ancient </v>

737
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:01.694
<v Speaker 1>mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got seven had to see cut off one </v>

738
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:04.730
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven more heads grow.</v>

739
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's life.</v>

740
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 1>So you know what do you do under those </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations?</v>

741
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:10.154
<v Speaker 1>And he had this symbolic notion first in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream or the white triggered that </v>

742
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:14.800
<v Speaker 1>with my questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was what?</v>

743
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:15.653
<v Speaker 1>You go right for the source of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and you do something about </v>

744
00:42:18.201 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

745
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:20.743
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that Piaget thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the study of knowledge was best </v>

746
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.183
<v Speaker 1>construed as the study of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquisition of knowledge is because you </v>

747
00:42:28.371 --> 00:42:28.941
<v Speaker 1>could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

748
00:42:28.941 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 1>here's the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what to do?</v>

749
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

750
00:42:33.231 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 1>I say great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem in that situation,</v>

751
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.393
<v Speaker 1>but then I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the situation and you don't know </v>

752
00:42:40.371 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a problem,</v>

753
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:43.514
<v Speaker 1>but that's also the problem of life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's the solution to the set of </v>

754
00:42:46.881 --> 00:42:47.714
<v Speaker 1>problems that you have no answer to and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is assimilation and </v>

755
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:53.540
<v Speaker 1>accommodation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>

756
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.430
<v Speaker 1>assimilation and accommodation.</v>

757
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Now when the little guy and the dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>went down the dragons throat,</v>

758
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.013
<v Speaker 1>he went to where the fire came out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that if a dragon is </v>

759
00:43:02.631 --> 00:43:03.464
<v Speaker 1>belching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and smoke and that's turning into </v>

760
00:43:04.521 --> 00:43:05.340
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.700
<v Speaker 1>beat demons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the fire box,</v>

762
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:11.210
<v Speaker 1>which is a place of transformation seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the core of the problem.</v>

763
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:12.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to the core of the problem and </v>

764
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:15.680
<v Speaker 1>he cut part of it out and then you use </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a shield.</v>

765
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:17.023
<v Speaker 1>Now that it's a brilliant solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>because basically what it proposes is </v>

766
00:43:20.151 --> 00:43:20.984
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's enough information in the world </v>

767
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:25.423
<v Speaker 1>and you're a good enough information </v>
<v Speaker 1>processor so that if you use all the </v>

768
00:43:28.701 --> 00:43:29.534
<v Speaker 1>information that's lying latent in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world against the set of all possible </v>

769
00:43:32.991 --> 00:43:37.180
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will work and I would say,</v>

770
00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:38.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have lots of clinical evidence that </v>

771
00:43:39.141 --> 00:43:39.974
<v Speaker 1>that's the case because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things we do for people in clinical </v>

772
00:43:42.351 --> 00:43:45.410
<v Speaker 1>psychology all the time is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

773
00:43:45.411 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 1>they have a problem.</v>

774
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.550
<v Speaker 1>We unpack it into the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping them that they don't think they</v>

775
00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:50.384
<v Speaker 1>can master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we put them in a situation </v>

776
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:55.280
<v Speaker 1>where they're asked to develop mastery </v>
<v Speaker 1>over just those situations.</v>

777
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:56.443
<v Speaker 1>And it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do an analysis of why it </v>

778
00:43:59.421 --> 00:44:00.860
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly that.</v>

779
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:04.160
<v Speaker 1>They become less afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say somebody is agoraphobic and</v>

780
00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:07.400
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to go in an elevator and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you teach them to go into the elevator.</v>

781
00:44:07.401 --> 00:44:08.061
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

782
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 1>they're less afraid of the elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not exactly right.</v>

783
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:12.523
<v Speaker 1>What they are is more confident in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to be the sort of creature that </v>

784
00:44:15.621 --> 00:44:20.090
<v Speaker 1>can overcome fears and prevail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore go in the elevator.</v>

785
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.520
<v Speaker 1>So instead of the world getting less </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

786
00:44:22.521 --> 00:44:23.354
<v Speaker 1>they get braver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a much better solution because </v>

787
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:28.160
<v Speaker 1>the world is just not going to get any </v>
<v Speaker 1>less dangerous.</v>

788
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:29.563
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the knowledge acquisition process is </v>

789
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.073
<v Speaker 1>explore in the face of novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the novelty is technically when you </v>

790
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:40.770
<v Speaker 1>lay out something that you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

791
00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:42.420
<v Speaker 1>and something else happens in step.</v>

792
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:43.913
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

793
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:50.980
<v Speaker 1>this is a set of ideas that's in keeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

794
00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:51.880
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

795
00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Piaget's pragmatic viewpoint because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

796
00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:59.440
<v Speaker 1>sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

797
00:44:59.441 --> 00:45:00.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

798
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:01.743
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

799
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.740
<v Speaker 1>if you're basing your theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge on action,</v>

800
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.860
<v Speaker 1>what are the elements of that theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge?</v>

801
00:45:10.861 --> 00:45:11.694
<v Speaker 1>Because they're not exactly objects </v>
<v Speaker 1>because objects or something that sort </v>

802
00:45:14.161 --> 00:45:17.130
<v Speaker 1>of exist outside the realm of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do with them.</v>

803
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.180
<v Speaker 1>At least in principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the presuppositions of science is</v>

804
00:45:21.181 --> 00:45:24.840
<v Speaker 1>that the object exists independently of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its value.</v>

805
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.520
<v Speaker 1>But if your cognitive schemer are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>or less action predicated,</v>

806
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 1>then that isn't exactly how the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself to you,</v>

807
00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.840
<v Speaker 1>not as an objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's a way of looking at it.</v>

808
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:37.674
<v Speaker 1>You're going from point a to point b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what do you see while you can look </v>

809
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:43.140
<v Speaker 1>at it in different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

810
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:44.153
<v Speaker 1>these are ideas that are taking taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>from an ecological approach to visual </v>

811
00:45:48.451 --> 00:45:50.820
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was written byj dot j dot Gibson,</v>

812
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:51.654
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has constructivist elements in his </v>

813
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:54.420
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

814
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.480
<v Speaker 1>So he would say that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the world,</v>

815
00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:02.130
<v Speaker 1>what you see are things that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate your movement forward.</v>

816
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are tools,</v>

817
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.050
<v Speaker 1>although he would have called them </v>
<v Speaker 1>affordances.</v>

818
00:46:07.051 --> 00:46:10.350
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a broader category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one knows what affordances means.</v>

819
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:15.351
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to use tools and the later </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists like Jeffrey Gray pointed out</v>

820
00:46:17.581 --> 00:46:20.220
<v Speaker 1>that if you see something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitates movement forward,</v>

821
00:46:20.221 --> 00:46:23.610
<v Speaker 1>that produces positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

822
00:46:23.611 --> 00:46:28.611
<v Speaker 1>if I want to go up to that exit sign and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that pathway clear as it is now,</v>

823
00:46:30.781 --> 00:46:32.640
<v Speaker 1>that's going to produce a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>

824
00:46:32.641 --> 00:46:33.474
<v Speaker 1>Activation in me and make me feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas if people have put six or seven </v>

825
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.120
<v Speaker 1>pack sacks in the way and I look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

826
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:39.954
<v Speaker 1>that's going to produce a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion right away because the </v>

827
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:44.970
<v Speaker 1>other thing that you see in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>are obstacles,</v>

828
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.360
<v Speaker 1>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitators,</v>

829
00:46:48.361 --> 00:46:49.194
<v Speaker 1>affordances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you look at it and </v>

830
00:46:50.881 --> 00:46:51.714
<v Speaker 1>obstacles and you manifest positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion to the tools and negative </v>

831
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:55.494
<v Speaker 1>emotion to the obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another class which is </v>

832
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:02.190
<v Speaker 1>things that you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't,</v>

833
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.233
<v Speaker 1>things you aren't able to classify as </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools or obstacles but that aren't </v>

834
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:09.510
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a class of unexpected things.</v>

835
00:47:09.511 --> 00:47:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with tools and obstacles,</v>

836
00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:15.330
<v Speaker 1>there's another rule which is you ignore</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everything,</v>

837
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ignore almost everything.</v>

838
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:18.383
<v Speaker 1>So most things have no value at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the value is actually dependent to </v>

839
00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:24.090
<v Speaker 1>some degree on the Schema that you lay </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the situation.</v>

840
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.580
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

841
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:27.713
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

842
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you about this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a.</v>

843
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:36.543
<v Speaker 1>here's a more elaborated description of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to you when you run into </v>

844
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:41.710
<v Speaker 1>something that you don't know what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

845
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.573
<v Speaker 1>Because remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to deal with the things that </v>

846
00:47:44.591 --> 00:47:48.610
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very peculiar problem because</v>

847
00:47:48.611 --> 00:47:49.444
<v Speaker 1>obviously you don't know how well what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is that your body has default </v>

848
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:58.051
<v Speaker 1>responses and one of the default </v>
<v Speaker 1>responses is that you freeze because you</v>

849
00:47:58.421 --> 00:47:59.254
<v Speaker 1>tend to respond to anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected as if it has a predatory </v>

850
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:03.220
<v Speaker 1>impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

851
00:48:03.221 --> 00:48:05.380
<v Speaker 1>so you're back on the Velt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

852
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:09.120
<v Speaker 1>6 million years ago and you hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>something rustling in the bushes.</v>

853
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:09.993
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a or in the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a pretty good idea to </v>

854
00:48:12.191 --> 00:48:13.024
<v Speaker 1>freeze because perhaps it's a Predator </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to attract its </v>

855
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:16.294
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that your body </v>

856
00:48:18.941 --> 00:48:19.840
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things.</v>

857
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:20.673
<v Speaker 1>You don't expect this to treat them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're predatory and you as if </v>

858
00:48:24.341 --> 00:48:25.174
<v Speaker 1>you're prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you freeze and then you ramp up your </v>

859
00:48:28.391 --> 00:48:30.460
<v Speaker 1>physiology so your heart rate will go </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

860
00:48:30.461 --> 00:48:31.600
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>

861
00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:32.434
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your heart rate goes up because you're </v>

862
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:33.970
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

863
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.090
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't why your heart rate goes up.</v>

864
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:38.163
<v Speaker 1>Your heart rate goes up so that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart pumps blood to your muscles and </v>

865
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.670
<v Speaker 1>when you're afraid you want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood pumped to your muscles because you</v>

866
00:48:45.671 --> 00:48:48.670
<v Speaker 1>want to use the damn things for running </v>
<v Speaker 1>away or fighting if you have to.</v>

867
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.310
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

868
00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:53.170
<v Speaker 1>if you do psychophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments,</v>

869
00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:54.004
<v Speaker 1>you can't just assume that raised heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate rate means fear because it might </v>

870
00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.570
<v Speaker 1>mean excitement or any number of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

871
00:48:58.840 --> 00:48:59.673
<v Speaker 1>What it really means is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparing to act well and so how do you </v>

872
00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:04.474
<v Speaker 1>prepare to act if you don't know what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and the answer is you pretty much </v>

873
00:49:06.581 --> 00:49:11.581
<v Speaker 1>prepared to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really hard on you and if you</v>

874
00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:12.874
<v Speaker 1>stay in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stay in the mode of preparing to </v>

875
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:19.144
<v Speaker 1>do anything for a long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you age and you're more likely to </v>

876
00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:25.504
<v Speaker 1>become diabetic and you're more likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to become obese and you're more likely </v>

877
00:49:27.491 --> 00:49:30.310
<v Speaker 1>to get cancer and infectious diseases </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on and so forth.</v>

878
00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

879
00:49:31.151 --> 00:49:31.984
<v Speaker 1>partly because your body suppresses your</v>
<v Speaker 1>immune system while you're in the state </v>

880
00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.280
<v Speaker 1>of not knowing what to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know if,</v>

881
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.840
<v Speaker 1>if you have to fight with the tiger in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next five minutes,</v>

882
00:49:40.841 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really matter if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>die of smallpox in a year,</v>

883
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.850
<v Speaker 1>so your body just shuts off everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't useful,</v>

884
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.193
<v Speaker 1>so and then you might think about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as stress and that's pretty good way of </v>

885
00:49:50.771 --> 00:49:54.760
<v Speaker 1>thinking about stress and then you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>assimilate that to dominance hierarchies</v>

886
00:49:54.761 --> 00:49:57.910
<v Speaker 1>and here's how you could do it at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the dominance hierarchy.</v>

887
00:49:57.911 --> 00:49:58.744
<v Speaker 1>Everything you do works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you were at the top of the </v>

888
00:50:01.271 --> 00:50:03.880
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy at the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

889
00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:04.893
<v Speaker 1>Nothing you do works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're at the bottom of the </v>

890
00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:08.260
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

891
00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:10.270
<v Speaker 1>that might be the fault of the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

892
00:50:10.271 --> 00:50:11.104
<v Speaker 1>but as far as you're concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's irrelevant because the point is </v>

893
00:50:13.721 --> 00:50:14.554
<v Speaker 1>what's it doing to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is if you're at the </v>

894
00:50:16.241 --> 00:50:17.074
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's going to happen </v>

895
00:50:20.021 --> 00:50:20.854
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're always in a state of </v>

896
00:50:21.911 --> 00:50:22.744
<v Speaker 1>chronic preparation for activity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you die sooner and you're </v>

897
00:50:26.651 --> 00:50:29.660
<v Speaker 1>more likely to develop infectious </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases and all sorts of things.</v>

898
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's even true if you control for </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute income.</v>

899
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:34.063
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

900
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.180
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

901
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of what this diagram </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates.</v>

902
00:50:46.521 --> 00:50:47.354
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is similar to the initiation </v>

903
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:51.374
<v Speaker 1>rituals that we talked about before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in a Schema and something comes </v>

904
00:50:54.981 --> 00:50:57.290
<v Speaker 1>along and knocks out one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>

905
00:50:57.291 --> 00:50:58.124
<v Speaker 1>So what you're doing doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're going to fall into an </v>

906
00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:01.964
<v Speaker 1>intermediate period of chaos and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos is going to be proportionate to </v>

907
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:10.370
<v Speaker 1>the importance of the proposition that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was disrupted and the importance is</v>

908
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:11.204
<v Speaker 1>going to be proportionate to how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>you use that axiom across multiple </v>

909
00:51:14.781 --> 00:51:17.890
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

910
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a scientific example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may remember,</v>

911
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:22.063
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a report from someone in </v>

912
00:51:24.141 --> 00:51:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Europe that they had managed faster than</v>
<v Speaker 1>light communication.</v>

913
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Now the right response to that was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

914
00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:33.524
<v Speaker 1>because that means the most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical theory we have that's passed </v>

915
00:51:37.221 --> 00:51:39.740
<v Speaker 1>like 50,000 other tests is wrong.</v>

916
00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:41.300
<v Speaker 1>So when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

917
00:51:41.301 --> 00:51:44.180
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary claims require </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary evidence.</v>

918
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:45.223
<v Speaker 1>But had it been true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been earth shattering </v>

919
00:51:47.661 --> 00:51:48.494
<v Speaker 1>because it would mean that the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that physicists use not only to </v>

920
00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:53.504
<v Speaker 1>ramp up their career but to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the world had a fundamental </v>

921
00:51:56.271 --> 00:51:58.270
<v Speaker 1>axiomatic error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

922
00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:00.650
<v Speaker 1>and it turned out that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with their measurements,</v>

923
00:52:00.651 --> 00:52:01.690
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

924
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:04.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems when something </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected occurs,</v>

925
00:52:04.071 --> 00:52:05.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know if it's some damn trivial</v>

926
00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:06.554
<v Speaker 1>thing because you haven't calibrated the</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine properly or whether you've just </v>

927
00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:10.110
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

928
00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:12.230
<v Speaker 1>when new part of the secret to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

929
00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.513
<v Speaker 1>So generally you should assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've calibrated your machine </v>

930
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:16.664
<v Speaker 1>improperly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I should also tell you something </v>

931
00:52:18.831 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 1>about something that's akin to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

932
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:27.190
<v Speaker 1>with regards to a self protective mode </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reconstructing your Schema.</v>

933
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:32.000
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed people is something like this.</v>

934
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.850
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they go out and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

935
00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:37.280
<v Speaker 1>they try to have a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone in a coffee shop and you know,</v>

936
00:52:37.281 --> 00:52:39.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe that person's having a horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>day or maybe you know,</v>

937
00:52:39.561 --> 00:52:41.300
<v Speaker 1>they're very disagreeable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted,</v>

938
00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:42.134
<v Speaker 1>which makes them kind of narcissistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there route and the depressed </v>

939
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:49.550
<v Speaker 1>person thinks I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk to people.</v>

940
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.370
<v Speaker 1>It's bad people that can't bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless people,</v>

941
00:52:52.371 --> 00:52:54.200
<v Speaker 1>can't talk to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bad,</v>

942
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:56.360
<v Speaker 1>useless person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been a bad,</v>

943
00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:58.310
<v Speaker 1>useless person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>

944
00:52:58.311 --> 00:52:59.144
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless person as far as I can see into </v>

945
00:53:00.951 --> 00:53:02.840
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

946
00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.280
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

947
00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:05.900
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's true.</v>

948
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:06.763
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the reason the person won't talk </v>

949
00:53:08.631 --> 00:53:11.840
<v Speaker 1>to you is because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just wrong in a million different</v>

950
00:53:11.841 --> 00:53:16.250
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's not jump to conclusions.</v>

951
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.863
<v Speaker 1>So the rule there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mental hygiene rule is picked the </v>

952
00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:20.714
<v Speaker 1>simplest possible explanation and until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you disprove that accepted and one of </v>

953
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:26.670
<v Speaker 1>them would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

954
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 1>that person's probably not having such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good day,</v>

955
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:31.710
<v Speaker 1>or maybe that person's not having such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good day,</v>

956
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:32.843
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe if I smiled at them a little </v>

957
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.980
<v Speaker 1>more brightly and somewhat less </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologically,</v>

958
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 1>they would have talked to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

959
00:53:39.961 --> 00:53:43.830
<v Speaker 1>So this is important to remember when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make mistakes in your life,</v>

960
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 1>don't start out with generic high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticisms.</v>

961
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:49.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pathway to self-destruction,</v>

962
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:54.630
<v Speaker 1>assume minor alterable changes until </v>
<v Speaker 1>proven until it's proven otherwise.</v>

963
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:58.650
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big problem because it's not that</v>

964
00:53:58.651 --> 00:53:59.484
<v Speaker 1>easy to figure out why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the mistake is when you make a </v>

965
00:54:02.041 --> 00:54:03.930
<v Speaker 1>mistake that stops you from getting what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

966
00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:04.764
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

967
00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.640
<v Speaker 1>yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the alchemist razor on the value on</v>

968
00:54:09.641 --> 00:54:12.550
<v Speaker 1>the value side of the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assume a small error.</v>

969
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Assume a small repairable error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if that doesn't work out,</v>

970
00:54:18.041 --> 00:54:20.740
<v Speaker 1>then as soon as slightly large </v>
<v Speaker 1>repairable error.</v>

971
00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:21.933
<v Speaker 1>And I'll show you a Schema for </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that in a minute that's </v>

972
00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.640
<v Speaker 1>akin to Piaget's construction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world from the bottom up.</v>

973
00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:32.750
<v Speaker 3>So let me show you that</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

974
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a very helpful diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I can find it.</v>

975
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:50.123
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

976
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.460
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go at this a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>

977
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:56.970
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the top</v>

978
00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.950
<v Speaker 1>diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hierarchy,</v>

979
00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:01.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

980
00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:03.910
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean</v>

981
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.700
<v Speaker 1>to be a good person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

982
00:55:09.701 --> 00:55:10.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

983
00:55:10.901 --> 00:55:11.734
<v Speaker 1>that's an empirical question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from the [inaudible] or the </v>

984
00:55:14.681 --> 00:55:15.514
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly right because what </v>

985
00:55:17.741 --> 00:55:18.574
<v Speaker 1>being a good person is and is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract representation of an </v>

986
00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:22.923
<v Speaker 1>aggregation of action oriented behaviors</v>
<v Speaker 1>in presuppositions that have the </v>

987
00:55:29.381 --> 00:55:34.030
<v Speaker 1>similarity across context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to decompose it.</v>

988
00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.553
<v Speaker 1>So this is for say an adult of about 35.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's one element of being a good </v>

989
00:55:40.511 --> 00:55:42.850
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you might say being a good parent,</v>

990
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not a necessary element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

991
00:55:45.371 --> 00:55:46.990
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the ones that would fit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

992
00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:49.060
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>parent?</v>

993
00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:49.923
<v Speaker 1>While you could say roughly speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have a good job and that you </v>

994
00:55:53.201 --> 00:55:55.840
<v Speaker 1>take care of your family and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

995
00:55:55.841 --> 00:55:56.674
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to take care of your </v>

996
00:55:57.461 --> 00:55:58.031
<v Speaker 1>family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

997
00:55:58.031 --> 00:56:02.050
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I would like you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>note is that these are abstractions,</v>

998
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:03.303
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

999
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good parent,</v>

1000
00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:08.650
<v Speaker 1>take care of your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are abstractions.</v>

1001
00:56:08.651 --> 00:56:09.484
<v Speaker 1>The question is what do they represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>or what are those abstractions made up </v>

1002
00:56:12.281 --> 00:56:12.671
<v Speaker 1>of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1003
00:56:12.671 --> 00:56:13.504
<v Speaker 1>lots of the abstractions that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we use are made up of descriptions </v>

1004
00:56:16.631 --> 00:56:20.020
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so scientific categories are like that,</v>

1005
00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 1>but these aren't scientific categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are categories,</v>

1006
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:28.780
<v Speaker 1>so they're actually made up of actions </v>
<v Speaker 1>not have object facts,</v>

1007
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:29.623
<v Speaker 1>objective facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not made out of objective </v>

1008
00:56:33.101 --> 00:56:35.620
<v Speaker 1>material at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a whole different thing.</v>

1009
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good parent,</v>

1010
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:39.970
<v Speaker 1>take care of your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1011
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:42.370
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to take care of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family?</v>

1012
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things that means,</v>

1013
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:48.280
<v Speaker 1>but one of them might be your cooked </v>
<v Speaker 1>meals and you play with the baby.</v>

1014
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then,</v>

1015
00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to complete a meal?</v>

1016
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:52.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like in this example you're </v>

1017
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 1>cooking corn.</v>

1018
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 1>So what do you have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to cut it.</v>

1019
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:01.240
<v Speaker 1>You have to set the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do dishes.</v>

1020
00:57:01.241 --> 00:57:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Now you can imagine you could decompose </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two.</v>

1021
00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:05.290
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to do if you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dishes?</v>

1022
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to grip a dish.</v>

1023
00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.820
<v Speaker 1>You have to move your hand in a twisting</v>
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>

1024
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:12.580
<v Speaker 1>You have to push this arm forward and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn on the tap.</v>

1025
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's cool about that is you can see</v>

1026
00:57:15.851 --> 00:57:16.684
<v Speaker 1>where the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the part of us that's capable </v>

1027
00:57:20.891 --> 00:57:24.100
<v Speaker 1>of abstract considerations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meets the body,</v>

1028
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:26.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people are always wondering,</v>

1029
00:57:26.951 --> 00:57:28.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you solve the mind body problem?</v>

1030
00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:30.100
<v Speaker 1>While this is one of the ways you solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1031
00:57:30.101 --> 00:57:30.934
<v Speaker 1>you assume that abstract categories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually abstract representations of </v>

1032
00:57:34.241 --> 00:57:35.074
<v Speaker 1>patterns of action and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>decompose them till you get to that </v>

1033
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:39.070
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1034
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.440
<v Speaker 1>how do you go underneath this?</v>

1035
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.500
<v Speaker 1>What's next on the hierarchy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1036
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:46.600
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious of it anyways.</v>

1037
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:48.330
<v Speaker 1>It's muscle movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cell,</v>

1038
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.070
<v Speaker 1>it's electrical information that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells are sharing.</v>

1039
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:54.700
<v Speaker 1>It's completely irrelevant to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not part of your consciousness.</v>

1040
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:58.930
<v Speaker 1>This is you can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't move a thing.</v>

1041
00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.793
<v Speaker 1>You know you can't move an identifiable </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger myself because you don't know </v>

1042
00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:02.644
<v Speaker 1>which ones they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things piaget would point </v>

1043
00:58:06.191 --> 00:58:07.024
<v Speaker 1>out is that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the characteristics of a baby </v>

1044
00:58:09.371 --> 00:58:11.440
<v Speaker 1>when the baby's first born is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>

1045
00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.453
<v Speaker 1>It can do these sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes equipped to do these sorts of </v>

1046
00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:17.410
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are basic reflexes.</v>

1047
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.273
<v Speaker 1>Now there are more basic than this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a child can do this and can stick </v>

1048
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:23.374
<v Speaker 1>out its tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really helpful because that </v>

1049
00:58:24.431 --> 00:58:26.860
<v Speaker 1>means that it can mouth everything in </v>
<v Speaker 1>its vicinity,</v>

1050
00:58:26.861 --> 00:58:27.694
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what a child does and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason it does that is because this </v>

1051
00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:32.013
<v Speaker 1>little exploratory apparatus here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite wired up and so what the child </v>

1052
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:36.603
<v Speaker 1>assumes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak first is the world is a </v>

1053
00:58:38.591 --> 00:58:42.130
<v Speaker 1>place to put in your mouth and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>why babies are always putting everything</v>

1054
00:58:42.131 --> 00:58:43.030
<v Speaker 1>they can in their mouth.</v>

1055
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Now you know the tongue is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered with sensory and motor nerves,</v>

1056
00:58:47.171 --> 00:58:52.171
<v Speaker 1>so it's unbelievably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably fast style exploratory tool</v>

1057
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:53.703
<v Speaker 1>and so the child starts to extract out </v>
<v Speaker 1>information about the world by using </v>

1058
00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.073
<v Speaker 1>its.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Its oral reflex is to a large degree to </v>

1059
00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:02.620
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it can also move its eyes,</v>

1060
00:59:02.621 --> 00:59:03.454
<v Speaker 1>although it's not really quite so good </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that and you know because it's </v>

1061
00:59:05.561 --> 00:59:06.690
<v Speaker 1>eyes cross a fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beth.</v>

1062
00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It takes a while to get both of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinated.</v>

1063
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:12.220
<v Speaker 1>You can hear things and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a sense of touch.</v>

1064
00:59:12.221 --> 00:59:13.054
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's equipped to start operating on </v>

1065
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 1>the world at the highest resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis.</v>

1066
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:25.200
<v Speaker 1>So we could say think about it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you move up a chain of abstractions,</v>

1067
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:29.660
<v Speaker 1>your representations get lower and lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>in resolution.</v>

1068
00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1069
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:37.720
<v Speaker 1>being a good person is a much lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution description than picking up a</v>

1070
00:59:38.361 --> 00:59:40.340
<v Speaker 1>fork prior to setting it on the table.</v>

1071
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Although picking up a fork is a micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of being a good person.</v>

1072
00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:45.943
<v Speaker 1>So that's a high resolution description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another thing that you can know is </v>

1073
00:59:49.131 --> 00:59:49.964
<v Speaker 1>that if you make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to decompose the problem into high </v>

1074
00:59:53.031 --> 00:59:56.330
<v Speaker 1>resolution representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's lazy not to,</v>

1075
00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.670
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insulting.</v>

1076
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.880
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come home and maybe your partner has</v>

1077
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>agreed to make a meal and the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like scorched to death,</v>

1078
01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you say you are not a good </v>

1079
01:00:07.851 --> 01:00:08.684
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've never been a good person and </v>

1080
01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to be a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1081
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.240
<v Speaker 1>well they're not a good person in so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they weren't able to,</v>

1082
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the meal.</v>

1083
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.410
<v Speaker 1>But you could start with a micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

1084
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:23.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like why exactly did that burn </v>
<v Speaker 1>since that's not the desired outcome,</v>

1085
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can help the person </v>

1086
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>disentangle the sequence and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out where the error occurred.</v>

1087
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe they were distracted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else or whatever.</v>

1088
01:00:33.621 --> 01:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very difficult analytic process.</v>

1089
01:00:36.321 --> 01:00:37.154
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain an equilibrium state with </v>

1090
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:42.254
<v Speaker 1>yourself and with people around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay away from the low resolution </v>

1091
01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:46.274
<v Speaker 1>abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're discussing something </v>

1092
01:00:47.361 --> 01:00:49.730
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go down to the micro level,</v>

1093
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:51.043
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example that you might </v>

1094
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>consider with regards to children as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they develop.</v>

1095
01:00:55.021 --> 01:00:58.370
<v Speaker 1>So the baby's laying on his crib on its </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1096
01:00:58.371 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's trying to get its act together</v>

1097
01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to organize its arms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>its got to organize its legs and its got</v>

1098
01:01:03.841 --> 01:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to move them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just hitting them,</v>

1099
01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>hitting itself in the head with its </v>
<v Speaker 1>arms.</v>

1100
01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Piaget would say child will be laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and go like this.</v>

1101
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>And that'll sort of startle them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the things they'll do is</v>

1102
01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:16.340
<v Speaker 1>try to do it again.</v>

1103
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>So in that way the child uses imitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of itself to start building up the basis</v>

1104
01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>of predictability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bloody brilliant idea,</v>

1105
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1106
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:29.023
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of the groundwork that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the child lays to start understanding </v>

1107
01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:32.564
<v Speaker 1>the world is going to be putting things </v>
<v Speaker 1>in its mouth and then it's gonna notice </v>

1108
01:01:34.551 --> 01:01:35.384
<v Speaker 1>similarities between the way something </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels and how it feels when it's in the </v>

1109
01:01:38.871 --> 01:01:43.250
<v Speaker 1>mouth and it's going to notice that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>motion is good for grabbing bottles,</v>

1110
01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:45.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's also good for grabbing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>teddy bears.</v>

1111
01:01:45.561 --> 01:01:49.070
<v Speaker 1>So maybe teddy bears and bottles are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same category to begin with.</v>

1112
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>And the category is things you can grab </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bring close to you,</v>

1113
01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a perfectly reasonable </v>

1114
01:01:55.251 --> 01:01:56.084
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not an objective category and </v>

1115
01:01:58.161 --> 01:01:58.994
<v Speaker 1>the child is changing all these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and developing more and more </v>

1116
01:02:01.341 --> 01:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated abilities with its body.</v>

1117
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time because it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>more facile with its body,</v>

1118
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.210
<v Speaker 1>it can analyze the world at a higher and</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher level of resolution.</v>

1119
01:02:11.211 --> 01:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the circular process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Information in development of tools,</v>

1120
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>expansion of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

1121
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>development of tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion of knowledge.</v>

1122
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:22.343
<v Speaker 1>You sort of boost yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally and you do it from the </v>

1123
01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1124
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:28.403
<v Speaker 1>let's say you've got a three year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good example of how children </v>

1125
01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>different different developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>stages,</v>

1126
01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>so maybe have a 15 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1127
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>clean up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1128
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>That is a low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations.</v>

1129
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Now when you use that low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation on the 15 year old,</v>

1130
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you assume that they know the following </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1131
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to put that aside for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

1132
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Now you're talking to a three year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're in their room and the room is</v>

1133
01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>scattered with junk because they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>played and you say,</v>

1134
01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 1>now it's time to clean up your room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you leave and then you come back in</v>

1135
01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:02.850
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes and what's happened?</v>

1136
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:05.323
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child is playing with some toy and </v>

1137
01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:06.960
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1138
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.793
<v Speaker 1>didn't you hear what I said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is while I heard </v>

1139
01:03:10.501 --> 01:03:11.334
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't have any idea what you </v>

1140
01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:12.804
<v Speaker 1>meant and the reason that I didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any idea what humanity is because I </v>

1141
01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:18.000
<v Speaker 1>don't have the microprocesses embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>in me.</v>

1142
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.100
<v Speaker 1>So they need to take the three year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

1143
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:23.250
<v Speaker 1>do you see your bare?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the child goes,</v>

1144
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:24.263
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they've got seeing down you </v>

1145
01:03:27.121 --> 01:03:29.040
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can see what you're pointing at.</v>

1146
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a little micro routine.</v>

1147
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.620
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't you go pick up that bear?</v>

1148
01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:35.454
<v Speaker 1>And they know that one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they'll go pick up the bear and </v>

1149
01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 1>then you might point to a spa space on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shelf that's empty.</v>

1150
01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:41.933
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well could you put that bear in that </v>

1151
01:03:43.831 --> 01:03:44.280
<v Speaker 1>space?</v>

1152
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.113
<v Speaker 1>And they've got that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you want to help them clean up </v>

1153
01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:49.800
<v Speaker 1>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to do it for them.</v>

1154
01:03:49.801 --> 01:03:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

1155
01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:54.420
<v Speaker 1>You build up all the micro routines and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's painstaking,</v>

1156
01:03:54.421 --> 01:03:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a parent,</v>

1157
01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.810
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well go play all cleaned up the room.</v>

1158
01:03:57.811 --> 01:03:58.644
<v Speaker 1>But then you'll be cleaning it up until </v>
<v Speaker 1>the child is 15 because they won't </v>

1159
01:04:01.431 --> 01:04:02.264
<v Speaker 1>develop the micro routines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might as well just start right </v>

1160
01:04:04.621 --> 01:04:05.454
<v Speaker 1>off the bat and go through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>painstaking process of building up the </v>

1161
01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:09.474
<v Speaker 1>procedural knowledge as the ground for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the abstract conceptions because the </v>

1162
01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:17.390
<v Speaker 1>next time the child you want the child </v>
<v Speaker 1>to clean up the room,</v>

1163
01:04:17.410 --> 01:04:18.243
<v Speaker 1>you could start by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up the toys on the floor and put </v>

1164
01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:22.224
<v Speaker 1>them where there is space on the shelf </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they've generalized across </v>

1165
01:04:26.611 --> 01:04:27.750
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1166
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:29.663
<v Speaker 1>more concrete instances of cleaning up </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they can use the abstract </v>

1167
01:04:33.241 --> 01:04:35.370
<v Speaker 1>representation to govern themselves.</v>

1168
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:36.203
<v Speaker 1>So this also helps you figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it means for something to mean </v>

1169
01:04:39.931 --> 01:04:42.300
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might say,</v>

1170
01:04:42.301 --> 01:04:45.360
<v Speaker 1>well that's meaningful for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1171
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.553
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that partly it means that you </v>

1172
01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:48.864
<v Speaker 1>have the underlying structure so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take the abstract utterance and </v>

1173
01:04:52.201 --> 01:04:55.170
<v Speaker 1>decompose it into actionable sequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

1174
01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:56.423
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes meaningful also means you </v>

1175
01:04:58.381 --> 01:04:59.214
<v Speaker 1>could use the information to rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>configure the abstractions that you use </v>

1176
01:05:02.971 --> 01:05:06.000
<v Speaker 1>to guide action in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a bit more complicated.</v>

1177
01:05:06.001 --> 01:05:09.660
<v Speaker 1>But you get the point now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason we can communicate,</v>

1178
01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.453
<v Speaker 1>and this is quite interesting and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is sort of in keeping with Piaget's </v>

1179
01:05:13.561 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I kind of knew what you know now.</v>

1180
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Why do I know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1181
01:05:18.911 --> 01:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's not because I know you</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't,</v>

1182
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:27.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's because you're like me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean physiologically we're not clones,</v>

1183
01:05:28.421 --> 01:05:29.254
<v Speaker 1>but the similarities are obviously there</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can assume that you have some </v>

1184
01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:38.350
<v Speaker 1>relationship with your body that more or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less parallel is the relationship I have</v>

1185
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:43.351
<v Speaker 1>with my body and then I can also assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>that since that the environment you grew</v>

1186
01:05:44.681 --> 01:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>up in was sufficiently similar to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that I grew up in,</v>

1187
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.433
<v Speaker 1>so that the Schema of actions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractions that constitutes your </v>

1188
01:05:55.271 --> 01:05:56.104
<v Speaker 1>personality is similar enough to mind so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can use abstractions and you'll </v>

1189
01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:01.180
<v Speaker 1>know what they mean.</v>

1190
01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:06.610
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a very complex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated theory of communication,</v>

1191
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:07.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it assumes that,</v>

1192
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is the meaning in a word?</v>

1193
01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:12.813
<v Speaker 1>The word is embedded in the phrase and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the phrase is embedded in that sentence </v>

1194
01:06:14.921 --> 01:06:16.420
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's complicated,</v>

1195
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.673
<v Speaker 1>but the meaning is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I compress a whole sequence of </v>

1196
01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:26.281
<v Speaker 1>action strategies and representational </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schema is into a phrase and I toss it to</v>

1197
01:06:27.041 --> 01:06:30.250
<v Speaker 1>you and you decompose it and then you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got the meaning,</v>

1198
01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some,</v>

1199
01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:35.290
<v Speaker 1>some like you can't do something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1200
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:38.140
<v Speaker 1>how do you play the piano while you sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of it?</v>

1201
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Move your hands up and down the keys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1202
01:06:40.391 --> 01:06:41.224
<v Speaker 1>That's too low resolution to be useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially if I know that you don't </v>

1203
01:06:46.781 --> 01:06:48.070
<v Speaker 1>know how to play the piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>

1204
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:48.933
<v Speaker 1>if I can assume sufficient shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and shared biological </v>

1205
01:06:52.181 --> 01:06:53.014
<v Speaker 1>commonality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can use high level abstractions </v>

1206
01:06:54.821 --> 01:06:57.550
<v Speaker 1>and we can exchange information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1207
01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.460
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the PSD and notion,</v>

1208
01:07:03.461 --> 01:07:04.750
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

1209
01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.113
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly and you're doing that in </v>

1210
01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:14.431
<v Speaker 1>order to extract out from the world what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need and to increase your competence</v>

1211
01:07:14.741 --> 01:07:16.810
<v Speaker 1>at getting what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1212
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's a cool idea too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1213
01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:22.960
<v Speaker 1>and here is a way of understanding that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of understanding,</v>

1214
01:07:22.961 --> 01:07:25.330
<v Speaker 1>of celebrated states at a high level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>

1215
01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.810
<v Speaker 1>So think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1216
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.370
<v Speaker 1>your kids in a soccer game and uh,</v>

1217
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:37.143
<v Speaker 1>let's say trip someone in elbows with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and the referee doesn't catch on </v>

1218
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:41.733
<v Speaker 1>and their team wins the game and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>their team wins the game because he </v>

1219
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:47.020
<v Speaker 1>tripped him and elbowed him and the kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes off the court,</v>

1220
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.090
<v Speaker 1>the pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1221
01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:53.380
<v Speaker 1>And says we won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you say?</v>

1222
01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:54.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're like 30 percent of the soccer </v>

1223
01:07:56.591 --> 01:07:58.360
<v Speaker 1>parents I saw you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good job,</v>

1224
01:07:58.361 --> 01:08:00.040
<v Speaker 1>you should have kicked them again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

1225
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.900
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what you shouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1226
01:08:01.901 --> 01:08:02.734
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't say that's no way to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the question might be what in </v>

1227
01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:10.870
<v Speaker 1>the world do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as far as the child's concerned,</v>

1228
01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:13.240
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just one.</v>

1229
01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:16.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say that's no way to win,</v>

1230
01:08:16.981 --> 01:08:18.570
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1231
01:08:18.571 --> 01:08:19.404
<v Speaker 1>think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the definition of winning at </v>

1232
01:08:25.361 --> 01:08:26.194
<v Speaker 1>soccer?</v>

1233
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one question is well,</v>

1234
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:30.770
<v Speaker 1>winning the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1235
01:08:30.771 --> 01:08:31.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of,</v>

1236
01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:34.860
<v Speaker 1>that's a little too high resolution for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the current purposes.</v>

1237
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.713
<v Speaker 1>Like how about um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing your skill as a physical </v>

1238
01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:40.634
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1239
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:41.833
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Developing your skill in a physical </v>

1240
01:08:43.341 --> 01:08:44.174
<v Speaker 1>being as a physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in a manner that will translate </v>

1241
01:08:47.121 --> 01:08:49.820
<v Speaker 1>into success in other domains of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1242
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:51.373
<v Speaker 1>that's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to be well developed physically </v>

1243
01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:53.893
<v Speaker 1>and it works more places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about developing your physical </v>

1244
01:08:57.351 --> 01:08:58.184
<v Speaker 1>abilities in a manner that ensures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people invite you to play games </v>

1245
01:09:01.461 --> 01:09:05.390
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good deal.</v>

1246
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:07.400
<v Speaker 1>And so when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1247
01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:08.720
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter whether you win or </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose,</v>

1248
01:09:08.721 --> 01:09:09.554
<v Speaker 1>it matters how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is the proper </v>

1249
01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:14.570
<v Speaker 1>equilibrated status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not victory within a game.</v>

1250
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.883
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1251
01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.053
<v Speaker 1>the ability to play many games and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract value from each instance of </v>

1252
01:09:22.141 --> 01:09:22.974
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you went across huge swaths of </v>

1253
01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.180
<v Speaker 1>time instead of sacrificing that to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>trivial local victory.</v>

1254
01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's another example of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality emerges from the bottom up,</v>

1255
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:36.263
<v Speaker 1>from the games that people play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's actions and then there's the </v>

1256
01:09:40.081 --> 01:09:40.914
<v Speaker 1>integration of actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And schema within yourself as an </v>

1257
01:09:42.691 --> 01:09:43.524
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you kind of got your act together </v>

1258
01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:46.283
<v Speaker 1>as a two to four year old and you better</v>
<v Speaker 1>have your act together by the time </v>

1259
01:09:49.231 --> 01:09:50.064
<v Speaker 1>you're for enough so that other children</v>
<v Speaker 1>will play with you because otherwise </v>

1260
01:09:53.011 --> 01:09:53.844
<v Speaker 1>you're basically screwed for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot be fixed after that and </v>

1261
01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:57.984
<v Speaker 1>there's endless amounts of evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that so he kind of got yourself </v>

1262
01:10:01.231 --> 01:10:05.460
<v Speaker 1>together by the time year two to four </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that other people can tolerate</v>

1263
01:10:05.461 --> 01:10:06.294
<v Speaker 1>you and then you start playing games </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and the Games are cooperative </v>

1264
01:10:09.061 --> 01:10:12.180
<v Speaker 1>and competitive and if you're good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing,</v>

1265
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.390
<v Speaker 1>which means you are fair across multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>instances of the game,</v>

1266
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.433
<v Speaker 1>then you'll have lots of friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to play with them and </v>

1267
01:10:18.361 --> 01:10:19.194
<v Speaker 1>then you'll have a whole network of </v>
<v Speaker 1>games which has all the games you play </v>

1268
01:10:23.431 --> 01:10:25.560
<v Speaker 1>with all your friends and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different circumstances.</v>

1269
01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.590
<v Speaker 1>And then you're going to learn how to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good player across all those games.</v>

1270
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.633
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully the environment that </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes the shared elements of that </v>

1271
01:10:34.321 --> 01:10:37.890
<v Speaker 1>set of games is similar to the adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

1272
01:10:37.891 --> 01:10:38.724
<v Speaker 1>That constitutes a whole set of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll do when you're an adult and </v>

1273
01:10:42.541 --> 01:10:46.170
<v Speaker 1>that'll mean that you're socialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to start to develop some autonomy</v>

1274
01:10:46.171 --> 01:10:51.060
<v Speaker 1>and individuality and independence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all emerging from the bottom up.</v>

1275
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not a top down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not instantiated from the top down.</v>

1276
01:10:54.601 --> 01:10:55.434
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural progression of moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>systematizing in society as a whole and </v>

1277
01:11:00.331 --> 01:11:05.331
<v Speaker 1>also a natural progression of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptations to that system as you mature</v>

1278
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.433
<v Speaker 1>and that in 90 minutes or thereabouts is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the essence of Piagetian theory and </v>

1279
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>there's some elements of a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn if you take piaget,</v>

1280
01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:17.124
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking is stage theory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to what piaget was really up </v>

1281
01:11:20.161 --> 01:11:20.360
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1282
01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.193
<v Speaker 1>Stage theory is pretty much irrelevant </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what I laid out for you today </v>

1283
01:11:23.971 --> 01:11:27.660
<v Speaker 1>was really what he was up to and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that he was doing in the multiple</v>

1284
01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:28.494
<v Speaker 1>publications that he laid out were </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to determine how does society </v>

1285
01:11:32.851 --> 01:11:33.684
<v Speaker 1>organizes itself from the bottom up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how does the individual do the same </v>

1286
01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:37.284
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's extremely useful way of </v>

1287
01:11:38.911 --> 01:11:40.430
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1288
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:41.303
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it will close with this from a </v>

1289
01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:45.264
<v Speaker 1>practical perspective because I try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>only teach you things that I think have </v>

1290
01:11:47.941 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 1>practical utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means if you know them,</v>

1291
01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.613
<v Speaker 1>you'll understand yourself and others </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and you'll get along with them </v>

1292
01:11:55.531 --> 01:12:00.120
<v Speaker 1>better and that the consequences of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be that you're better placed in the</v>

1293
01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 1>social world and that'll make the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>world somewhat better.</v>

1294
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:05.280
<v Speaker 1>So what's the take home message from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

1295
01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is the most important one I think is</v>

1296
01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:11.453
<v Speaker 1>don't use high level negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractions to characterize your </v>

1297
01:12:14.851 --> 01:12:16.860
<v Speaker 1>behavior or that of others.</v>

1298
01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:19.860
<v Speaker 1>What you have to do is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>

1299
01:12:19.861 --> 01:12:23.280
<v Speaker 1>is that if you have someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1300
01:12:23.281 --> 01:12:24.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have a roommate who can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>cook,</v>

1301
01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:25.763
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you are that roommate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like in order to help someone like </v>

1302
01:12:29.161 --> 01:12:29.994
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to decompose the process until </v>

1303
01:12:32.191 --> 01:12:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you hit the level at which they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>competent.</v>

1304
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:40.430
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach them how to integrate those things</v>

1305
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:43.650
<v Speaker 1>that they know into the next stage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

1306
01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:47.280
<v Speaker 1>So it's a complex decomposition and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were actually helpful.</v>

1307
01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:48.114
<v Speaker 1>And now you'll find when you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship with someone that </v>

1308
01:12:50.611 --> 01:12:54.120
<v Speaker 1>you want to last over the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a couple of hands.</v>

1309
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:58.140
<v Speaker 1>One is do not use high level negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractions.</v>

1310
01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.513
<v Speaker 1>They'll hate you and for good reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're criticizing them in a </v>

1311
01:13:03.331 --> 01:13:07.230
<v Speaker 1>generic and stupid manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you want to do is first of all,</v>

1312
01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:08.064
<v Speaker 1>help them identify the problem at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest level of resolution necessary </v>

1313
01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:15.990
<v Speaker 1>and then implement a solution that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually solve the problem.</v>

1314
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:17.003
<v Speaker 1>Now that often takes a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict and a fair bit of immediate </v>

1315
01:13:20.311 --> 01:13:21.144
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult and so people will avoid </v>

1316
01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:24.420
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do that,</v>

1317
01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:28.770
<v Speaker 1>every time you do that and it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem you'll never have again</v>

1318
01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good deal.</v>

1319
01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:34.770
<v Speaker 1>So it beats the hell out of ignoring it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hoping that it'll go away.</v>

1320
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.880
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see you</v>

1321
01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:41.483
<v Speaker 1>Thursday.</v>
