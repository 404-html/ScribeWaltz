1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.973
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how to conceptualize yourself in </v>

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 1>union terms.</v>

3
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.923
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>The part of you that you consider you </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking young,</v>

5
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:16.974
<v Speaker 1>considered the ego and you might think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that as the most individual part </v>

6
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>of your cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physiological being,</v>

7
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.043
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.513
<v Speaker 1>the difference between individual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective in that sense is that you </v>

9
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:38.870
<v Speaker 1>share very many attributes with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

10
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Obviously your physical form is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much like that of other people.</v>

11
00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:43.844
<v Speaker 1>And then you share attributes with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>living creatures way back down the </v>

12
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.780
<v Speaker 1>phylogenetic chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in that regard,</v>

13
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing specifically individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>

14
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

15
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>But the part of you that you identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>with most completely and that you regard</v>

16
00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:04.880
<v Speaker 1>as unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the union ego.</v>

17
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Now young sort of conceptualized your </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche as a,</v>

18
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.553
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say as a place I suppose that </v>

19
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 1>many spirits could inhabit and you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about a spirit.</v>

20
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.150
<v Speaker 1>From,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the union perspective as</v>

22
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.690
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

23
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>a personality that can inhabit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>

24
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.243
<v Speaker 1>And so like all of the psychoanalysts </v>
<v Speaker 1>young regarded the psyche as a </v>

25
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>relatively loose collection of partially</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated personalities.</v>

26
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 1>And each of those personalities had </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own perspective,</v>

27
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.683
<v Speaker 1>their own thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like their own way of looking at the </v>

28
00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:52.210
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the perspective,</v>

29
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>their own thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own emotions,</v>

30
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 1>their own habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own actions.</v>

31
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And those are roughly aggregated into </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of unity.</v>

32
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the ego.</v>

33
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.693
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

34
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 1>ego has a public face and the public </v>
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

35
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.114
<v Speaker 1>you don't call it the persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persona means mask and the persona is </v>

36
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:17.374
<v Speaker 1>both that part of you that you showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people instead of the part that </v>

37
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:26.941
<v Speaker 1>you hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also to some degree it might be</v>

38
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 1>the form that your ego takes even to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

39
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a naive person,</v>

40
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>you might think that your public face is</v>
<v Speaker 1>all there is a view</v>

41
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.773
<v Speaker 1>that the rough difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ego and the persona might be </v>

42
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize this way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there are things that you think</v>

43
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>that you won't say in public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not even in private.</v>

44
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.813
<v Speaker 1>Some of those things you're pretty aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>of and those would be thoughts that are </v>

46
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:01.624
<v Speaker 1>relevant to the ego but not the persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some of them you don't even </v>

47
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:06.424
<v Speaker 1>really want to be aware of and young </v>
<v Speaker 1>would consider those more associated </v>

48
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>with the shadow now.</v>

49
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.830
<v Speaker 1>The Shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existence of the shadow.</v>

51
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.040
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to remember that the best</v>

52
00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:22.874
<v Speaker 1>way to conceptualize umes archetypical</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructions is in some sense as </v>

53
00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:29.564
<v Speaker 1>metaphors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say that while you thought </v>

54
00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:35.810
<v Speaker 1>that it was useful to separate up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche into persona,</v>

55
00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:36.644
<v Speaker 1>an ego and then shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that there aren't other ways </v>

56
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:41.894
<v Speaker 1>that it could be broken up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but breaking it up this way is useful </v>

57
00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:47.504
<v Speaker 1>for certain purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yoni regarded this terminology as </v>

58
00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:53.840
<v Speaker 1>particularly useful from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic perspective and also from</v>

59
00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:56.420
<v Speaker 1>a historical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

60
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.260
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the divisions could have be </v>
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>

61
00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:01.094
<v Speaker 1>could be made otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are many ways of looking at </v>

62
00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:06.770
<v Speaker 1>archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is sufficiently useful to</v>

63
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.170
<v Speaker 1>progress with.</v>

64
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.993
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

65
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>people's personas are generally somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmless and somewhat socialized.</v>

66
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.520
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know how to act in public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a well crafted persona.</v>

67
00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:28.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you are going to be the kinds of</v>

68
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.593
<v Speaker 1>relatively deep thinking intellectuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>who think that small talk is nonsense </v>

69
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.073
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some utility in that thinking </v>

70
00:04:38.421 --> 00:04:41.510
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a philosophical sense,</v>

71
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:42.344
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't know how to make small </v>

72
00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:45.524
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what that means is that you </v>

73
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:50.480
<v Speaker 1>have a poorly developed persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that'll mean is that you're not</v>

74
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:51.314
<v Speaker 1>going to do very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least at the beginning of social in </v>

75
00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:56.474
<v Speaker 1>social engagements because you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to convince people that you're </v>

76
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.613
<v Speaker 1>basically civilized and social before </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even reasonable for them to go </v>

77
00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 1>beyond pleasantries with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ability to exchange pleasantries</v>

78
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.753
<v Speaker 1>in a relatively banal way in a variety </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different circumstances is part of </v>

79
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:14.630
<v Speaker 1>having a persona.</v>

80
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want to denigrate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility of that because you need it.</v>

81
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you progress in your careers,</v>

82
00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:24.104
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be thrust into </v>

83
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:27.860
<v Speaker 1>situations where you don't really know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>

84
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.083
<v Speaker 1>And the purpose of the gathering is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiarize a large number of people </v>

85
00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:35.294
<v Speaker 1>with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a skill that's associated </v>

86
00:05:38.661 --> 00:05:42.800
<v Speaker 1>with that that's somewhat Glib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social ability.</v>

87
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.070
<v Speaker 1>The unions would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

88
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.340
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a persona,</v>

89
00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you're just a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

90
00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:56.030
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be only persona because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the possibilities is that the ego</v>

91
00:05:56.031 --> 00:05:56.864
<v Speaker 1>can identify with persona and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person thinks that they are what they </v>

92
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>show the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that,</v>

93
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>at least from the union perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

94
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.993
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a people are a lot more than the </v>

95
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot more than the ego and be</v>

96
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.120
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the things that make them more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than mere persona or mere that more than</v>

97
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:23.444
<v Speaker 1>mere ego are not necessarily things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are acceptable in casual public </v>

98
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>gatherings.</v>

99
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.183
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of your psychophysiological </v>

100
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:36.584
<v Speaker 1>makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all have the capacity for </v>

101
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

102
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:42.794
<v Speaker 1>a lot of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that are more </v>

103
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 1>agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say that even it's either that</v>

104
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:54.371
<v Speaker 1>that capacity for aggression has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>underdeveloped because you've identified</v>

105
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:55.874
<v Speaker 1>with a certain mode of social being or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say perhaps if to the degree </v>

106
00:06:58.701 --> 00:06:59.534
<v Speaker 1>that agreeableness is temperamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the aggressive tendency isn't as </v>

107
00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:04.034
<v Speaker 1>powerful in you as it is and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that might lead you to make </v>

108
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 1>judgements like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure some of you,</v>

109
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.553
<v Speaker 1>perhaps some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you who had an angry parent or </v>

110
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.004
<v Speaker 1>particularly an angry father have </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided at some point in your life that </v>

111
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>to be aggressive is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be angry is wrong,</v>

112
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to be aggressive is wrong.</v>

113
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:26.624
<v Speaker 1>It's morally wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens in </v>

114
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:29.624
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy very frequently though is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people come into psychotherapy for </v>

115
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>a variety of reasons.</v>

116
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.653
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are merely practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're having problems in adaptation </v>

117
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:38.684
<v Speaker 1>because their lives have got very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated and they really don't </v>

118
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:41.384
<v Speaker 1>know what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they go into psychotherapy </v>

119
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:44.654
<v Speaker 1>because they have very high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion and that can be </v>

120
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:47.924
<v Speaker 1>associated with the first problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But very often they come into therapy </v>

121
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:51.794
<v Speaker 1>because they're getting pushed around </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly and they really don't have </v>

122
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:56.144
<v Speaker 1>anything that's a sufficiently well </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed personal identity and </v>

123
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:00.824
<v Speaker 1>generally those that happens by the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>most more often with women than it does </v>

124
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:06.224
<v Speaker 1>with men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because women are by </v>

125
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more agreeable than men.</v>

126
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:12.860
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps also by socialization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

127
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.770
<v Speaker 1>temperament certainly plays a big role </v>
<v Speaker 1>often then they,</v>

128
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.613
<v Speaker 1>the goal of therapy is assertiveness </v>
<v Speaker 1>training and assertiveness training you </v>

129
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:22.184
<v Speaker 1>could think of as the behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists equivalent to </v>

130
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 1>incorporating the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

131
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may think,</v>

132
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a necessary part of existence to be</v>

133
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 1>nice to other people.</v>

134
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>And there's some truth in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

135
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.203
<v Speaker 1>It's a very shallow way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world because nice is not a very </v>

136
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:42.164
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if that's the word that you do </v>

137
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:47.240
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should also be nice to yourself.</v>

138
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.523
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes what that means is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to put forward your own wishes </v>

139
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 1>and desires in a manner that causes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of conflict.</v>

140
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 1>And in order to withstand that conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have,</v>

141
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.473
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to draw on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources of aggression that in some </v>

142
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>sensor are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

143
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>are a deep part of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your inbuilt set of possibilities.</v>

144
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.384
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason that's necessary in part </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a biological perspective is that </v>

145
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 1>people are often afraid of engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict because they're afraid because?</v>

146
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because conflict can be real trouble and</v>

147
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.993
<v Speaker 1>anger inhibits fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't have a well developed </v>

148
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:31.734
<v Speaker 1>capacity for while we could say rage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't overcome your fear and </v>

149
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:40.370
<v Speaker 1>then you can't stand up for yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to get run over.</v>

150
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with that is is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get run over enough,</v>

151
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.813
<v Speaker 1>it'll make you resentful and then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will make you aggressive except it'll </v>

152
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.863
<v Speaker 1>make you aggressive and sneaky </v>
<v Speaker 1>underground and somewhat unconscious </v>

153
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 1>ways that are much less likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

154
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.903
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a frank exchange of viewpoints and some </v>

155
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:05.601
<v Speaker 1>conscious negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I do in therapy for</v>

156
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:07.824
<v Speaker 1>people who need assertiveness training </v>
<v Speaker 1>is I get them to pay attention to their </v>

157
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:11.334
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And resentment is often a good avenue </v>

158
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:14.934
<v Speaker 1>into the shadow because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment is a pretty destructive </v>

159
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extremely useful emotion,</v>

160
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 1>but it can be very destructive cause it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives rise to,</v>

161
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.683
<v Speaker 1>well first of all sense of victimization</v>
<v Speaker 1>and second then the underground growth </v>

162
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:29.514
<v Speaker 1>of all sorts of ideas of revenge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vengeance and and also a kind of </v>

163
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.590
<v Speaker 1>stubborn non cooperativeness because </v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

164
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 1>who wants to cooperate when they feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken advantage of.</v>

165
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.353
<v Speaker 1>And so part of young's idea with regards</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the shadow is that obviously the </v>

166
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:48.924
<v Speaker 1>social world wants you to be peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and predictable and maybe even easy to </v>

167
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:54.264
<v Speaker 1>get along with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't necessarily mean that </v>

168
00:10:57.061 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 1>peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable and easy to get along with a</v>

169
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 1>are the only virtues because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not.</v>

170
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>And one thing we know about virtues is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they're taken to two,</v>

171
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:08.310
<v Speaker 1>great at an extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become vices.</v>

172
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.623
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certainly not the only </v>

173
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:12.600
<v Speaker 1>virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

174
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:15.540
<v Speaker 1>there are what you might call darker </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtues,</v>

175
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:16.643
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There they're more dangerous virtues in </v>

176
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:20.034
<v Speaker 1>some sense because they harness forces </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be very destructive if they're </v>

177
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:26.244
<v Speaker 1>not utilized consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And aggression is certainly an example </v>

178
00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:31.104
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's some fundamental rules about </v>

179
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 1>the shadow that you might think about as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move forward through your life.</v>

180
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.040
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of times you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to negotiate on your own behalf.</v>

181
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.203
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of agreeableness and </v>

182
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:48.624
<v Speaker 1>aggression is that you should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up for yourself at least as well </v>

183
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 1>as you would stand up for someone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you care for.</v>

184
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.383
<v Speaker 1>So the problem with the idea of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice to other people is that it doesn't </v>

185
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 1>take you into account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's supposed to be an equation,</v>

186
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>even though it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

187
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 1>nice is a pretty weak philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>

188
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 1>But the fundamental rule is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should certainly include yourself in the</v>

189
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>circle of people who deserve respect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

190
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to advocate for yourself.</v>

191
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And if you're willing to advocate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself for yourself and you want to do</v>

192
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to say no.</v>

193
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.353
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you have to say yes </v>

194
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 1>and then you can't negotiate.</v>

195
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.373
<v Speaker 1>And in order to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have armed yourself with </v>

196
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 1>strategies and plans that enable you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

197
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be dependent.</v>

198
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.520
<v Speaker 1>You can't be afraid of potentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>searching out new opportunities,</v>

199
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.523
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be willing to stand your </v>

200
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:46.234
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very difficult to do that </v>

201
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:52.741
<v Speaker 1>without drawing on some of the deeper </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources of psychological energy that are</v>

202
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.440
<v Speaker 1>part of our psychophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>heritage.</v>

203
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 1>So young would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

204
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:00.544
<v Speaker 1>there's the persona and the ego and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can identify with your persona and then </v>

205
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

206
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.200
<v Speaker 1>you're a kind of a shallow puppet of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

207
00:13:08.201 --> 00:13:13.201
<v Speaker 1>So Pinocchio as the Marionette is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Persona Pinocchio himself as an eagle,</v>

208
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.710
<v Speaker 1>but as a Marionette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the persona.</v>

209
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.260
<v Speaker 1>So anybody who's ideologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed,</v>

210
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:21.094
<v Speaker 1>by the way is a persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they're also possessed by the </v>

211
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:25.000
<v Speaker 1>shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they don't know it.</v>

212
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.133
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell when someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically possessed because you can </v>

213
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 1>predict whatever they're going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>once you know,</v>

214
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Speaker 1>a few axioms of their particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiology.</v>

215
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.760
<v Speaker 1>So given ideology probably has four or </v>
<v Speaker 1>five explanatory,</v>

216
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>axioms,</v>

217
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.970
<v Speaker 1>like everything is caused by economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>disparity.</v>

218
00:13:42.971 --> 00:13:45.050
<v Speaker 1>That might be one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

219
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.660
<v Speaker 1>or success is due to hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be another,</v>

220
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 1>and those are broad enough statements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're in opposition to one</v>

221
00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:54.964
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those statements are broad </v>

222
00:13:55.931 --> 00:13:58.030
<v Speaker 1>enough so you can virtually explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything with them.</v>

223
00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.133
<v Speaker 1>The problem with it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you can predict what the </v>

224
00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:04.120
<v Speaker 1>explanation is going to be before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>even have to talk to the person.</v>

225
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And whenever you're talking to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can predict exactly what they're</v>

226
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:10.150
<v Speaker 1>going to say because they're using some </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>

227
00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:10.984
<v Speaker 1>logically mediated structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know perfectly well that </v>

228
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:14.134
<v Speaker 1>they've identified with the persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also know that they're likely to be </v>

229
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:18.184
<v Speaker 1>possessed by a pretty vicious shadow </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know that the shadow of </v>

230
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:26.191
<v Speaker 1>ideological possession is repression and</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

231
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.863
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the psychoanalysts is </v>

232
00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 1>that whenever they see something good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always looking for the dark side</v>

233
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:37.240
<v Speaker 1>of it and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

234
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 1>whenever they see anything dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for the good side of it.</v>

235
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And so they're very unlikely to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything at face value.</v>

236
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.490
<v Speaker 1>And so if someone comes up to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

237
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.060
<v Speaker 1>I stand for some good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you ask,</v>

238
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 1>you're a psychoanalytically minded is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

239
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean that you hate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a reasonable probability</v>

240
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 1>that even though you think that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing for something,</v>

241
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of what's motivating you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the desire to be against something.</v>

242
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's particularly the case when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with,</v>

243
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.380
<v Speaker 1>with negative emotions because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>more powerful than positive emotions.</v>

244
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell,</v>

245
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:19.490
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the 20th century's great </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti Edea logs,</v>

246
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.563
<v Speaker 1>published a book in the 1940s Thirties </v>
<v Speaker 1>forties called up road to Wigan pier </v>

247
00:15:25.641 --> 00:15:29.630
<v Speaker 1>where he went to stay with some coal </v>
<v Speaker 1>miners in the north of England.</v>

248
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 1>And those coal miners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

249
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:31.604
<v Speaker 1>they had a hard life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some of them had to crawl three </v>

250
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:34.874
<v Speaker 1>quarters of a mile to work in tunnels in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning in tunnels where they </v>

251
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 1>couldn't stand up just to get to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and then they do,</v>

252
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:43.604
<v Speaker 1>they're like 10 hour shift in the coal </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine digging out call and then they'd </v>

253
00:15:46.191 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 1>have to crawl back three quarters of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile underground,</v>

254
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:51.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they had very,</v>

255
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.540
<v Speaker 1>very hard lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

256
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:54.374
<v Speaker 1>Orwell was pretty unimpressed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions in which they were forced to </v>

257
00:15:58.461 --> 00:15:59.294
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he wrote an essay for the English </v>

258
00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 1>left book club and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a socialist publishing house,</v>

259
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:06.674
<v Speaker 1>but he upended another essay to it where</v>
<v Speaker 1>he criticized the socialists who are </v>

260
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:11.084
<v Speaker 1>most likely to read that sort of book as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more oriented towards hating the </v>

261
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then then loving the poor as devastating</v>

262
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:20.660
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>

263
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.000
<v Speaker 1>And the left book club didn't even want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to publish his book,</v>

264
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 1>but they ended up publishing has become </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very famous essay,</v>

265
00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:26.924
<v Speaker 1>but it lays out a general principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you have identified with a </v>

266
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:33.290
<v Speaker 1>given persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a,</v>

267
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.500
<v Speaker 1>a social machine in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think you're all good because of</v>

268
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:40.910
<v Speaker 1>what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might ask,</v>

269
00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:43.400
<v Speaker 1>well where'd all the parts of you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't good go?</v>

270
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.323
<v Speaker 1>Because unless you think that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>saint and that everyone who thinks </v>

271
00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:51.941
<v Speaker 1>differently than you is Satan himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're missing a chunk of yourself.</v>

272
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.950
<v Speaker 1>You're not taking a chunk of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>into account.</v>

273
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:55.784
<v Speaker 1>And that's the part that is nowhere near</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well behaved or as benevolent as you </v>

274
00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 1>might think or that you actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any reason to believe,</v>

275
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that has struck</v>

276
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:12.761
<v Speaker 1>me as a consequence of analyzing 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century history and,</v>

277
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.023
<v Speaker 1>and often through a union lens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's not much evidence that </v>

278
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.860
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of atrocities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize the Soviet Union,</v>

279
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

280
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:24.703
<v Speaker 1>and Nazi Germany were the result of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few extremely corrupt people at the top </v>

281
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:29.954
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing everyone down into slavery and </v>

282
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:34.430
<v Speaker 1>then making them do terrible things.</v>

283
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very weak explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

284
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's wrong.</v>

285
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I think the historical record is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear that it's wrong.</v>

286
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in East Germany for example,</v>

287
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 1>one third of the people government </v>
<v Speaker 1>informers.</v>

288
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.340
<v Speaker 1>So that means if you had a family of </v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

289
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.150
<v Speaker 1>two of your family members were </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting on you to the government.</v>

290
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.910
<v Speaker 1>So when you look at human capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>destructiveness,</v>

291
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.540
<v Speaker 1>if you don't regard yourself as one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the agents of that destructiveness,</v>

292
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.360
<v Speaker 1>or at least one of the potential agents </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that destructiveness,</v>

293
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.400
<v Speaker 1>then from the union perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least there's a high probability that</v>

294
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:19.890
<v Speaker 1>you're part of the problem rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the solution.</v>

295
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:21.923
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't necessarily mean that you </v>

296
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:23.844
<v Speaker 1>should be blamed for it because blame </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to come from another person and it </v>

297
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:32.940
<v Speaker 1>isn't obviously clear that like I get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>blame you for being potentially violent.</v>

298
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 1>That's I think is a complete mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

299
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.203
<v Speaker 1>if you familiarize yourself with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of human capability and then you </v>

300
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:44.304
<v Speaker 1>regard yourself as human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that you have to </v>

301
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:51.291
<v Speaker 1>regard yourself as a creature that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of what human beings are capable</v>

302
00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

303
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.333
<v Speaker 1>And human beings are capable of a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and some of them are absolutely </v>

304
00:18:57.241 --> 00:18:58.140
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

305
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.990
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more remarkable than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being on the planet.</v>

306
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can do amazing things.</v>

307
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:07.410
<v Speaker 1>But the downside of that is that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do absolutely horrible things.</v>

308
00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's not obvious that it's only the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological people who do that.</v>

309
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:12.234
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

310
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.630
<v Speaker 1>it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not reasonable to assume that.</v>

311
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 1>So the shadow for young was a very big </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal,</v>

312
00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:22.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he believed in some sense,</v>

313
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:24.090
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the idea is get </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal.</v>

314
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 1>He believed that the ideas of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

315
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil twin of the king or the evil </v>

316
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:32.124
<v Speaker 1>twin of God for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be Satan and Christian </v>

317
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:36.180
<v Speaker 1>theology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

318
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was as real a representation of the</v>

319
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.150
<v Speaker 1>human and transpersonal human capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>for evil as there was.</v>

320
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:50.250
<v Speaker 1>And he believed that if you look deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough into your own follow motivations,</v>

321
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 1>and if you look far enough down that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be looking,</v>

322
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:55.260
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into hell itself,</v>

323
00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 1>and you'd find the main controller of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell deep inside your psyche.</v>

324
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:05.210
<v Speaker 1>So it was no journey for the timid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll also believe that,</v>

325
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.153
<v Speaker 1>and this is what separates him from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new age thinker because he's often </v>

326
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:11.544
<v Speaker 1>accused of being a new age thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Age thinkers tell you things like </v>

327
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 1>follow your bliss and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:20.370
<v Speaker 1>you'll run into utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own counter utopia.</v>

329
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.233
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what the unions </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially young said about his process </v>

330
00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:27.774
<v Speaker 1>of individuation at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that if you follow what's </v>

331
00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:32.580
<v Speaker 1>meaningful and you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

332
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.030
<v Speaker 1>it will take you somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really do not want to go.</v>

333
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.373
<v Speaker 1>And until you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll never be able to climb up higher </v>

334
00:20:40.441 --> 00:20:41.274
<v Speaker 1>on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that provides a real impediment </v>

335
00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:47.250
<v Speaker 1>for enlightenment because for </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment,</v>

336
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.093
<v Speaker 1>there's a price to be paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at architectural </v>

337
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 1>representations of the cost of </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment,</v>

338
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 1>you often find that the person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes enlightened has,</v>

339
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.700
<v Speaker 1>is damaged in some profound way before </v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens.</v>

340
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:01.923
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ancient Egyptian stories of </v>

341
00:21:04.151 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Horace and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus,</v>

342
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.360
<v Speaker 1>horace loses an eye when he has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter set who's the ancient Egyptian</v>

343
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:13.420
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of sate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's no joke.</v>

344
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.360
<v Speaker 1>It's seriously no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

345
00:21:16.361 --> 00:21:17.194
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

346
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of one of young's propositions </v>

347
00:21:21.811 --> 00:21:26.811
<v Speaker 1>essentially was that the human race will</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to be plagued by phenomena like</v>

348
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:33.790
<v Speaker 1>the outbreak of the genocidal Nazi and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet ideologies.</v>

349
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Until people realize that the Nazis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets are them,</v>

350
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:44.400
<v Speaker 1>that it isn't someone else's problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't other people who weren't you,</v>

351
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.730
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were there,</v>

352
00:21:47.731 --> 00:21:49.740
<v Speaker 1>it would've been you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

353
00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:50.251
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

354
00:21:50.251 --> 00:21:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I would have been a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

355
00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:55.523
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

356
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.850
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they were rare.</v>

357
00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:58.684
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you have real reason to think </v>

358
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:00.934
<v Speaker 1>that you could have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's safer to think that you </v>

359
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:04.804
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have and wouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then there's a responsibility </v>

360
00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:09.334
<v Speaker 1>that goes along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the responsibility is to broaden </v>

361
00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:13.924
<v Speaker 1>your capacity of who you are so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the possibility of controlling the </v>

362
00:22:17.651 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 1>parts of your psyche that are very dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

363
00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:22.480
<v Speaker 1>let me give you some examples of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

364
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a philosopher named Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

365
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:28.720
<v Speaker 1>and most of you are resilience without </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing it.</v>

366
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.960
<v Speaker 1>And Russo basically made the following </v>
<v Speaker 1>propositions.</v>

367
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.660
<v Speaker 1>He said that human beings were basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

368
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.513
<v Speaker 1>but they were corrupted by culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So human essential human nature was </v>

369
00:22:41.231 --> 00:22:42.064
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the corrupting influence was was </v>

370
00:22:44.051 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's true,</v>

371
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:48.124
<v Speaker 1>but it's only half true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a philosopher named hobbs </v>

372
00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:51.370
<v Speaker 1>who said exactly the opposite thing.</v>

373
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.990
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no human beings are base and violent and</v>

374
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:56.883
<v Speaker 1>uncontrollable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unless we have society structuring </v>

375
00:23:00.131 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 1>their interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was more like Freud structuring their</v>

376
00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:03.814
<v Speaker 1>interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would be constantly at one </v>

377
00:23:05.141 --> 00:23:07.930
<v Speaker 1>another's throat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you think,</v>

378
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's right,</v>

379
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Russo or hobbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

380
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:14.230
<v Speaker 1>they're both right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they say the opposite thing.</v>

381
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.393
<v Speaker 1>And second while you look around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and you tell me whether there are </v>

382
00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:21.270
<v Speaker 1>more hobbsy and states are resilient </v>
<v Speaker 1>states announcer,</v>

383
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.400
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most countries are disastrous.</v>

384
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Authoritarian dictatorships in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>people where people live and suffer,</v>

385
00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:30.603
<v Speaker 1>and the places where civilization has </v>
<v Speaker 1>has become stable enough so that people </v>

386
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:39.850
<v Speaker 1>can live peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively peaceful and productive lives</v>

387
00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:40.684
<v Speaker 1>are very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more common than they were in </v>

388
00:23:42.251 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 1>the past and they seem to be getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>more common all time.</v>

389
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a lot easier to be disorganized</v>

390
00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:53.930
<v Speaker 1>and brutal that it is to be organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive and free.</v>

391
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:55.483
<v Speaker 1>So now you believe that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shadow is something that kind of </v>

392
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:03.620
<v Speaker 1>comes apart when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you face it.</v>

393
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:04.603
<v Speaker 1>So it's a blurry black mass and in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense before you start to differentiate </v>

394
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:11.204
<v Speaker 1>it and so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell what the shadow is as far </v>

395
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:19.130
<v Speaker 1>as any one of you is concerned because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

396
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:24.730
<v Speaker 1>you can start to notice how you aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you act,</v>

397
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.323
<v Speaker 1>especially when you act around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act around people that you're trying to </v>

398
00:24:28.731 --> 00:24:32.060
<v Speaker 1>impress or people whose opinions you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think are important to you.</v>

399
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 1>You have to pay attention to it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

400
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to see that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between what you say because</v>

401
00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:43.850
<v Speaker 1>you're saying something in order to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>something turnout the way you want it to</v>

402
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:48.851
<v Speaker 1>turn out and what you actually think and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shadows at work in two ways.</v>

403
00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:53.030
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way is that it's convincing you that</v>

404
00:24:53.031 --> 00:24:53.864
<v Speaker 1>using your speech and actions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate the world in a conscious </v>

405
00:24:57.201 --> 00:24:59.510
<v Speaker 1>manner is a good idea and it's not.</v>

406
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:00.853
<v Speaker 1>And the second is that you'll see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are counter thoughts to what you </v>

407
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

408
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.513
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you find yourself in the position of </v>

409
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.160
<v Speaker 1>being too nice to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a boss for example,</v>

410
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:15.020
<v Speaker 1>who's bit of a tire it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 1>and you don't feel that you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position to say anything,</v>

412
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.353
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your only defense against his or her </v>

413
00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:22.784
<v Speaker 1>bullying tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequence of that is that you'll </v>

414
00:25:25.311 --> 00:25:26.144
<v Speaker 1>think all sorts of dark and dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts about that person in your own </v>

415
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 1>fantasies when you're not interacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

416
00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:34.424
<v Speaker 1>And if you catch a hold of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies and you let them play </v>

417
00:25:37.701 --> 00:25:38.534
<v Speaker 1>themselves out consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that they take you to very </v>

418
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:44.180
<v Speaker 1>dark places now,</v>

419
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.350
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

420
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Or at least to places that you regard is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dark.</v>

421
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:50.963
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

422
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:54.240
<v Speaker 3>w</v>

423
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.073
<v Speaker 1>young's notion essentially is that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to uncover those elements of </v>

424
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:00.734
<v Speaker 1>yourself that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fit comfortably within your ideas </v>

425
00:26:05.761 --> 00:26:06.594
<v Speaker 1>about yourself is that you discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about yourself that are also </v>

426
00:26:10.411 --> 00:26:11.244
<v Speaker 1>potentially very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says if you threw the baby out with </v>

427
00:26:15.391 --> 00:26:17.940
<v Speaker 1>the bath water when you were setting up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality.</v>

428
00:26:17.941 --> 00:26:18.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

429
00:26:18.781 --> 00:26:19.614
<v Speaker 1>earlier I talked about people who may </v>
<v Speaker 1>have decided very early in their life </v>

430
00:26:22.801 --> 00:26:24.990
<v Speaker 1>that they're just not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

431
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

432
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.590
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to throw away.</v>

433
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.233
<v Speaker 1>It might instead be something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to bring within the realm of your </v>

434
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:43.480
<v Speaker 1>personality so that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can express itself consciously and in</v>

435
00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:47.700
<v Speaker 1>an articulated manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because without anger,</v>

436
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:50.040
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any power,</v>

437
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.820
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that no one needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be afraid of you.</v>

438
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.050
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

439
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.800
<v Speaker 1>people shouldn't be afraid of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a union might ask,</v>

440
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the world would ever lead you to</v>

441
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 1>believe that</v>

442
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.713
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>

443
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.710
<v Speaker 1>The distinction between being respected </v>
<v Speaker 1>and being feared is not clear.</v>

444
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.070
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that you don't respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone</v>

445
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:23.803
<v Speaker 1>whom you couldn't imagine fearing if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided to make that their </v>

446
00:27:27.381 --> 00:27:28.214
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>

447
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:30.643
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

448
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:36.170
<v Speaker 1>without the capacity for aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get any respect.</v>

449
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.590
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that people have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear you,</v>

450
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.310
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate your capacity for aggression</v>

451
00:27:43.311 --> 00:27:46.460
<v Speaker 1>enough so that they would fear you if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted them to.</v>

452
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes a lot more sense for memorial</v>

453
00:27:51.141 --> 00:27:51.974
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the argument that you should be </v>

454
00:27:53.781 --> 00:27:54.614
<v Speaker 1>nice to everyone because if you're nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>to everyone because you don't have any </v>

455
00:27:57.951 --> 00:28:01.160
<v Speaker 1>choice because you're weak and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ineffectual and harmless,</v>

456
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.460
<v Speaker 1>then that's not a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

457
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.530
<v Speaker 1>you just can't do anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

458
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:07.693
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're harmless by default and harmless </v>

459
00:28:11.241 --> 00:28:13.700
<v Speaker 1>and virtuous are by no means the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

460
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:14.893
<v Speaker 1>If by contrast you're capable of causing</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of terrible trouble and you </v>

461
00:28:20.151 --> 00:28:20.984
<v Speaker 1>know it and you know how and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide not to do it because you can </v>

462
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.580
<v Speaker 1>articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>

463
00:28:28.581 --> 00:28:29.414
<v Speaker 1>articulate a different route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you have the possibility of </v>

464
00:28:32.631 --> 00:28:36.260
<v Speaker 1>virtue because without the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sin,</v>

465
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.040
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no virtue in not doing it.</v>

466
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:41.983
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a young man who feels that </v>

467
00:28:50.191 --> 00:28:55.191
<v Speaker 1>sleeping around is wrong but never has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to do it,</v>

468
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.850
<v Speaker 1>then you can hardly attribute that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your virtue.</v>

469
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.480
<v Speaker 1>So a good union would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

470
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:05.730
<v Speaker 1>you're just making a virtue out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>

471
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just rationalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with,</v>

472
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.213
<v Speaker 1>with virtue.</v>

473
00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:14.163
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

474
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.153
<v Speaker 1>Now if you are attractive to people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you decide that that attraction should </v>

475
00:29:20.801 --> 00:29:24.190
<v Speaker 1>only manifest itself within certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>tight boundaries.</v>

476
00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:29.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's a voluntary choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different issue.</v>

477
00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you claims,</v>

478
00:29:33.221 --> 00:29:34.054
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you throw the baby out with the </v>

479
00:29:35.681 --> 00:29:40.681
<v Speaker 1>bath water when you're trying to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>and become a socially personality,</v>

480
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:45.123
<v Speaker 1>that happens in a different way as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as he's concerned for each of the </v>

481
00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 1>genders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the prices young would say</v>

482
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:52.954
<v Speaker 1>that we pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that this is a very modern idea in </v>

483
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:58.510
<v Speaker 1>some ways for growing up</v>

484
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.713
<v Speaker 1>as a distinctly gendered society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's very easy for men to </v>

485
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.113
<v Speaker 1>suppress and fail to develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to develop those elements of their </v>

486
00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:12.540
<v Speaker 1>character that might be considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>classically feminine.</v>

487
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.123
<v Speaker 1>And it's difficult for women to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and express those aspects of their </v>

488
00:30:18.001 --> 00:30:22.950
<v Speaker 1>personality that might be classically </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered masculine.</v>

489
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.433
<v Speaker 1>And but so young believed that Nastad </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the shadow in some sense where </v>

490
00:30:28.531 --> 00:30:32.430
<v Speaker 1>the contra sexual capacities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

491
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.433
<v Speaker 1>for a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given what we knew about the </v>

492
00:30:35.821 --> 00:30:38.190
<v Speaker 1>temperamental difference between men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

493
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.500
<v Speaker 1>it may be that men could be more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could develop the capacity.</v>

494
00:30:43.501 --> 00:30:48.450
<v Speaker 1>For true compassion and care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they,</v>

495
00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:50.503
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

496
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:51.913
<v Speaker 1>They could find that ability within what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've thrown out in the shadow and </v>

497
00:30:55.761 --> 00:30:59.540
<v Speaker 1>women for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could find the capacity to be aggressive</v>

498
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.613
<v Speaker 1>and assertive because that's part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they threw out during their stage </v>

499
00:31:04.461 --> 00:31:06.620
<v Speaker 1>of their course of development because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

500
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:11.240
<v Speaker 1>because of it's a priori categorization </v>
<v Speaker 1>as inappropriate behavior.</v>

501
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean that you thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was,</v>

502
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.710
<v Speaker 1>that people should be raised without any</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity.</v>

503
00:31:18.711 --> 00:31:19.544
<v Speaker 1>That issue never came up for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just thought that once you had </v>

504
00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:26.000
<v Speaker 1>established a personality that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently</v>

505
00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:32.740
<v Speaker 1>develop to be acceptable socially and </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional on the individual level,</v>

506
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.570
<v Speaker 1>then you could have the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>expand that personality and to take into</v>

507
00:31:38.571 --> 00:31:43.571
<v Speaker 1>yourself elements of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of perception and thought and behavior</v>

508
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:45.503
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

509
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have had the sophistication</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to handle at an earlier stage</v>

510
00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:54.184
<v Speaker 1>of development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So young would say perhaps that if </v>

511
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:00.154
<v Speaker 1>you're a male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to become masculine before you </v>

512
00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 1>could become feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you are a female,</v>

513
00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:05.404
<v Speaker 1>the reverse is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that if your development only star </v>

514
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 1>stops with a narrow and categorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

515
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.080
<v Speaker 1>then there are elements that of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

516
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.153
<v Speaker 1>of being that you could draw on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't at your disposal and that will </v>

517
00:32:21.911 --> 00:32:22.744
<v Speaker 1>make you weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the shadow breaks up into the Anima </v>

518
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.350
<v Speaker 1>ananymous and the Anima is the female </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the mail,</v>

519
00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:33.184
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the animus is the male inside the </v>

520
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:36.334
<v Speaker 1>female and you and believe that he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>see those partial spirits manifesting </v>

521
00:32:41.091 --> 00:32:41.924
<v Speaker 1>themselves in people's behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he talked about a couple of </v>

522
00:32:45.621 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 1>typical behaviors that he thought were </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated either with anema possession.</v>

523
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:51.164
<v Speaker 1>So that would be in the case of a man or</v>
<v Speaker 1>animus possession in the case of a </v>

524
00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:56.180
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he would regard,</v>

525
00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.373
<v Speaker 1>if you ever talk to someone who's female</v>
<v Speaker 1>who seems to respond to all of your </v>

526
00:33:02.181 --> 00:33:03.014
<v Speaker 1>propositions with nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>argumentation for the sake of </v>

527
00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:07.244
<v Speaker 1>argumentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human would regard that as a </v>

528
00:33:09.201 --> 00:33:12.230
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of possession by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animus.</v>

529
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 1>And if you ever talked to a man who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

530
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.780
<v Speaker 1>irrationally possessed by</v>

531
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

532
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:24.583
<v Speaker 1>second rate and few tile emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he would regard that as possession </v>

533
00:33:29.001 --> 00:33:29.834
<v Speaker 1>by the anima.</v>

534
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

535
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:36.220
<v Speaker 1>So and you can see that if you watch for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and if you believe in such things,</v>

536
00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:37.403
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

537
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:38.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

538
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.383
<v Speaker 1>The best thing to do when confronted </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone who's Animus possessed is </v>

539
00:33:41.761 --> 00:33:45.240
<v Speaker 1>just shut up because you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make any headway.</v>

540
00:33:45.241 --> 00:33:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Because the point of the argument of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Animus,</v>

541
00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:52.380
<v Speaker 1>inspired argument is to get you to argue</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to win.</v>

542
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Because by getting you to argue the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animus wins.</v>

543
00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:57.653
<v Speaker 1>So and then behind those two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the shadow and the anima and the </v>

544
00:34:01.561 --> 00:34:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Animus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a final archetype,</v>

545
00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:06.690
<v Speaker 1>which is the archetype of the self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's young,</v>

546
00:34:06.691 --> 00:34:10.200
<v Speaker 1>believed that the self was what you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a totality.</v>

547
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's a hard thing to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

548
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.340
<v Speaker 1>but you could think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think about the self as the,</v>

549
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.863
<v Speaker 1>as the total of what you are now plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>the total of all those things that you </v>

550
00:34:23.101 --> 00:34:26.340
<v Speaker 1>could still be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would be you as a reality.</v>

551
00:34:26.341 --> 00:34:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Plus you as potential.</v>

552
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's a strange idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

553
00:34:30.361 --> 00:34:31.194
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't really know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the idea of potential as </v>

554
00:34:34.501 --> 00:34:39.501
<v Speaker 1>modern and empirical people because </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential virtually by definition is not</v>

555
00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:40.944
<v Speaker 1>yet manifest and also not a straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward thing to either measure or </v>

556
00:34:45.751 --> 00:34:48.270
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the same token,</v>

557
00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:54.060
<v Speaker 1>everybody acts as if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have potential unrealized potential</v>

558
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.313
<v Speaker 1>and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generated up a category to account for </v>

559
00:34:59.971 --> 00:35:04.971
<v Speaker 1>that which he felt was expressed in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of symbolic weight.</v>

560
00:35:05.161 --> 00:35:08.850
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wise old man,</v>

561
00:35:08.851 --> 00:35:09.684
<v Speaker 1>like like the wizards in the movies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of you have seen in the last five </v>

562
00:35:13.561 --> 00:35:15.480
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always the same wizard.</v>

563
00:35:15.481 --> 00:35:16.314
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's even the same actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's an archetype of the </v>

564
00:35:19.321 --> 00:35:24.321
<v Speaker 1>wise old man and for young Christ was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype of the self as well.</v>

565
00:35:25.561 --> 00:35:26.394
<v Speaker 1>And I told you why that was to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree and it's partly because the </v>

566
00:35:30.091 --> 00:35:30.924
<v Speaker 1>phoenix is also an archetype of the self</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Phoenix is something that </v>

567
00:35:33.721 --> 00:35:35.040
<v Speaker 1>can die and be reborn.</v>

568
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And so the Phoenix stands for the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your that can let one thing go.</v>

569
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.270
<v Speaker 1>One part of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an ally live part,</v>

570
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.343
<v Speaker 1>can let that go and burn up so to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that something new can be born </v>

571
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:52.430
<v Speaker 1>because you very seldom gain something </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you let something else go.</v>

572
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.533
<v Speaker 1>That's partly because what you already </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume can be the worst impediment that </v>

573
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to work to learning something </v>
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>

574
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's complicated because sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you know worked in the past,</v>

575
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can think about that.</v>

576
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.473
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a perfectly well adapted 11</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old and you're still acting that </v>

577
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:14.550
<v Speaker 1>way when you're 15 it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

578
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.163
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to let that go because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked and you put a lot of effort into </v>

579
00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unless you let it go,</v>

580
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:23.940
<v Speaker 1>the new personality isn't going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to manifest itself.</v>

581
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:25.163
<v Speaker 1>So you have to stop being a child before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be an adult and there's a </v>

582
00:36:28.531 --> 00:36:29.364
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice that goes along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a sacrifice that parents have </v>

583
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:32.371
<v Speaker 1>to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

584
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:33.204
<v Speaker 1>Because in order for a parent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage you to adopt the </v>

585
00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:37.704
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities of an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to allow you as a child to </v>

586
00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:42.714
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Freud's observation on that </v>

587
00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:48.384
<v Speaker 1>phenomena was that many parents and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed this was particularly </v>

588
00:36:52.831 --> 00:36:57.831
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of mothers because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their tight bond with their children and</v>

589
00:36:59.101 --> 00:36:59.934
<v Speaker 1>the dependency that that implies that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was particularly difficult for a mother </v>

590
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:04.914
<v Speaker 1>to let her child die so that an adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>could manifest itself in that child's </v>

591
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:10.134
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's fundamentally in many ways </v>

592
00:37:13.861 --> 00:37:16.650
<v Speaker 1>the oedipal complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

593
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:18.870
<v Speaker 1>so now I'm going to show you some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things again,</v>

594
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:19.704
<v Speaker 1>because the thing about young is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to understand what he has </v>

595
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:27.810
<v Speaker 1>to say and it's not a simple thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain it.</v>

596
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.003
<v Speaker 1>And his books are complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I don't think there are any </v>

597
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:36.150
<v Speaker 1>more complicated than they have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think young is obscure.</v>

598
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.780
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then beyond difficult,</v>

599
00:37:39.781 --> 00:37:40.614
<v Speaker 1>he's actually frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of reasons that people </v>

600
00:37:43.231 --> 00:37:44.064
<v Speaker 1>don't like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that he's difficult and </v>

601
00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:51.270
<v Speaker 1>frightening are probably the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>foremost objections.</v>

602
00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:52.104
<v Speaker 1>I think the other thing that happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that maybe slowed his acceptance as </v>

603
00:37:57.271 --> 00:38:01.170
<v Speaker 1>an intellectual was that many of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>students were women,</v>

604
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:05.850
<v Speaker 1>like his primary students and the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who developed his ideas.</v>

605
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Many of the people who identity I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

606
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.810
<v Speaker 1>continued to develop his ideas after he </v>
<v Speaker 1>died were women.</v>

607
00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:13.644
<v Speaker 1>And that was perhaps not the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective way of making headway in the </v>

608
00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:21.450
<v Speaker 1>academic world at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time that he was alive.</v>

609
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:23.183
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at some things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you some things from </v>

610
00:38:24.961 --> 00:38:29.961
<v Speaker 1>the lion king because the lion king</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows you archetypes everywhere.</v>

611
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this first.</v>

612
00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:15.323
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

613
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:19.363
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that I would like to </v>

614
00:39:20.151 --> 00:39:23.660
<v Speaker 1>point out here is that this takes place </v>
<v Speaker 1>at daybreak.</v>

615
00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And daybreak is when the sun re-emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from an architectural perspective,</v>

616
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.260
<v Speaker 1>the sun re-emerges from a terrible Babel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had had with the thing that devours</v>

617
00:39:33.261 --> 00:39:36.980
<v Speaker 1>the sun at night and it comes up again </v>
<v Speaker 1>triumphant in the morning.</v>

618
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:38.263
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the dawn of consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not that idea that the sun </v>

619
00:39:41.451 --> 00:39:42.284
<v Speaker 1>undergoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This battle is associated with the idea </v>

620
00:39:44.601 --> 00:39:47.810
<v Speaker 1>that you descend into unconsciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you sleep.</v>

621
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.823
<v Speaker 1>And magically you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we reemerge from it in the morning and </v>

622
00:39:50.871 --> 00:39:53.570
<v Speaker 1>you do that in accordance with the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for you,</v>

623
00:39:53.571 --> 00:39:57.260
<v Speaker 1>darkness is a time of unconsciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a tight relationship between</v>

624
00:39:57.261 --> 00:40:00.170
<v Speaker 1>unconsciousness and darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so young would say,</v>

625
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:01.723
<v Speaker 1>people projected that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an idea that was in there in </v>

626
00:40:04.491 --> 00:40:06.920
<v Speaker 1>their imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that unconsciousness and darkness,</v>

627
00:40:06.921 --> 00:40:08.060
<v Speaker 1>we're tightly aligned.</v>

628
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:09.343
<v Speaker 1>And so they use their imagination to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain the world and conceptualize the </v>

629
00:40:12.471 --> 00:40:13.304
<v Speaker 1>sun in those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

630
00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.173
<v Speaker 1>in those terms of imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that if you analyze the terms of </v>

631
00:40:16.971 --> 00:40:17.804
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get some understanding into the </v>

632
00:40:19.671 --> 00:40:22.820
<v Speaker 1>structure of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one of them.</v>

633
00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness and light are the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

634
00:40:25.011 --> 00:40:26.480
<v Speaker 1>illumination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment,</v>

635
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:27.763
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because we're primarily </v>

636
00:40:29.901 --> 00:40:32.720
<v Speaker 1>visual creatures and were conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the day.</v>

637
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.850
<v Speaker 1>And so this is a new beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new day,</v>

638
00:40:34.851 --> 00:40:35.684
<v Speaker 1>which is something that everyone also </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences because sleep washes away </v>

639
00:40:38.841 --> 00:40:41.720
<v Speaker 1>the carers of the previous day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

640
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:42.723
<v Speaker 1>and it does revitalize you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know perfectly well that if you </v>

641
00:40:44.991 --> 00:40:47.240
<v Speaker 1>deprive people of sleep for any length </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>

642
00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

643
00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:49.753
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

644
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.990
<v Speaker 1>it derails them entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deranged ranges them entirely.</v>

645
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:59.440
<v Speaker 1>So there is a reason that this movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>opens with the dawn of the day.</v>

646
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:03.923
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

647
00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:29.663
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's another re casting of the </v>

648
00:41:31.471 --> 00:41:32.460
<v Speaker 1>same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

649
00:41:32.461 --> 00:41:33.294
<v Speaker 1>Except the also indicated that there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>an association between the dawn of self </v>

650
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:42.200
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and the emergence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>light because the lyrics were,</v>

651
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:43.034
<v Speaker 1>when we step the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stepped onto the planet and stepped </v>

652
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:47.810
<v Speaker 1>out blinking into the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

653
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.273
<v Speaker 1>there's a transition from </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciousness to consciousness </v>

654
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:52.214
<v Speaker 1>metaphor underlying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the statements that film </v>

655
00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:57.824
<v Speaker 1>is making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or one of the ways that the film is </v>

656
00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:01.064
<v Speaker 1>trying to set you up to understand this </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a story about the emergence of </v>

657
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:08.120
<v Speaker 1>consciousness into the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

658
00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:10.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the film makers know all this?</v>

659
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.630
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by no,</v>

660
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:20.060
<v Speaker 1>which is really of critical factor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of discussion and b,</v>

661
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

662
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.003
<v Speaker 1>and the re the way they manifested the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that they knew it is because they </v>

663
00:42:24.531 --> 00:42:25.940
<v Speaker 1>knew when things fit together.</v>

664
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.250
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're writing a story or something</v>

665
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:29.084
<v Speaker 1>like that or reading a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when the story is going well </v>

666
00:42:31.641 --> 00:42:32.151
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

667
00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:33.440
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

668
00:42:33.441 --> 00:42:34.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't even notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

669
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:37.250
<v Speaker 1>You just assume that everything's fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it makes sense.</v>

670
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't jar you out of the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people are perfectly capable,</v>

671
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.530
<v Speaker 1>especially if they concentrated on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for long periods of time of assembling a</v>

672
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:46.364
<v Speaker 1>narrative with images that make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they may not know why it makes </v>

673
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:51.741
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

674
00:42:51.741 --> 00:42:52.574
<v Speaker 1>if they're actually artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know why it makes sense </v>

675
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.430
<v Speaker 1>because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ix,</v>

676
00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.920
<v Speaker 1>they're expanding their capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehend and explain things well.</v>

677
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 1>They're producing what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing.</v>

678
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:03.224
<v Speaker 1>They have to be moving beyond what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know cause otherwise they're just </v>

679
00:43:05.571 --> 00:43:07.730
<v Speaker 1>producing propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

680
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:08.564
<v Speaker 1>when there were elements of many Disney </v>
<v Speaker 1>films that sync now and then into </v>

681
00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:14.390
<v Speaker 1>propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of conscious moralizing.</v>

682
00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:17.000
<v Speaker 1>But when the films are really working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing that at all.</v>

683
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.133
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

684
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.740
<v Speaker 1>when they are consciously moralizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're boring very quickly.</v>

685
00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Plus they date extremely rapidly.</v>

686
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.343
<v Speaker 3>Si.</v>

687
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.063
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a brilliant piece of film </v>

688
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:06.164
<v Speaker 1>editing there because the the filmmaker </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweep your eye along and then make </v>

689
00:44:11.031 --> 00:44:15.200
<v Speaker 1>something appear as a revelation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it at exactly the same time that</v>

690
00:44:15.201 --> 00:44:16.034
<v Speaker 1>the music swells to a climax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's indicating to you that </v>

691
00:44:18.021 --> 00:44:21.350
<v Speaker 1>something of tremendous importance is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to be revealed.</v>

692
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.310
<v Speaker 1>And so you see two things here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you see is what's called</v>

693
00:44:25.311 --> 00:44:27.440
<v Speaker 1>pride rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

694
00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:28.573
<v Speaker 1>is a roughly peer middle shape at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>to triangular shape that emerges in the </v>

695
00:44:32.311 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 1>middle of the landscape that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>serves symbolically as the center of the</v>

696
00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:37.164
<v Speaker 1>kingdom are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that as an Egyptian </v>

697
00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:41.760
<v Speaker 1>pyramid or you could think about it as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

698
00:44:41.761 --> 00:44:44.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's both of those things.</v>

699
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.203
<v Speaker 1>It's also the thing on which the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the animals are subjugated to </v>

700
00:44:48.421 --> 00:44:49.940
<v Speaker 1>stands right?</v>

701
00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.773
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's where the king is and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>king happens to be a lion and the lion </v>

702
00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 1>is a solar beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been a solar beast.</v>

703
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:56.454
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with the sun and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the king of beasts because it's an apex </v>

704
00:44:59.671 --> 00:45:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at the top of the hierarchy and for</v>

705
00:45:02.431 --> 00:45:03.264
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although obviously the lions in the </v>

706
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:08.360
<v Speaker 1>animated movie are there are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually lions.</v>

707
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:09.203
<v Speaker 1>It's important to remember that while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're analyzing the film because it's </v>

708
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:15.270
<v Speaker 1>very easy to just think of them as lines</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though clearly they're not.</v>

709
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Now you also see this little character </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the right hand corner,</v>

710
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.390
<v Speaker 1>left hand corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that zoo,</v>

711
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.313
<v Speaker 1>right and Zazu is the eye of the king </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the king is on top of the </v>

712
00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:27.684
<v Speaker 1>pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the king's eyes free from the king </v>

713
00:45:30.091 --> 00:45:30.924
<v Speaker 1>and the kid go where all over the place </v>
<v Speaker 1>even where the pyramid can't see and </v>

714
00:45:34.351 --> 00:45:36.240
<v Speaker 1>that's the eye on the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid.</v>

715
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.460
<v Speaker 1>You've seen that symbol everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>

716
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:39.503
<v Speaker 1>It's the symbol that's on the back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the American dollar bill and there's a </v>

717
00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:42.684
<v Speaker 1>reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because the eye of the king is not </v>

718
00:45:44.731 --> 00:45:45.564
<v Speaker 1>part of the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eye of the king is something that's </v>

719
00:45:47.791 --> 00:45:52.791
<v Speaker 1>always free of the hierarchy and can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can fly over all hierarchies and that's,</v>

720
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:56.933
<v Speaker 1>that's equivalent to the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could make its way up any hierarchy in </v>

721
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:03.300
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the same as horace though.</v>

722
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 1>The God of vision in the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian stories.</v>

723
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:12.933
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

724
00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:18.021
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are,</v>

725
00:46:18.021 --> 00:46:21.020
<v Speaker 1>we've got the king and we will see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on top of the Rock,</v>

726
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:22.063
<v Speaker 1>which is where the king belongs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also in full sunlight even though </v>

727
00:46:25.731 --> 00:46:27.950
<v Speaker 1>that's not characteristic of any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals.</v>

728
00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.293
<v Speaker 1>He's got his little bird there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells them things because the king is </v>

729
00:46:32.271 --> 00:46:33.104
<v Speaker 1>someone who pays attention because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>king who doesn't pay attention is a </v>

730
00:46:36.201 --> 00:46:41.201
<v Speaker 1>tyrant and then the wind is blowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the king's hair because the wind</v>

731
00:46:42.861 --> 00:46:46.250
<v Speaker 1>is spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the king is also something that's</v>

732
00:46:46.251 --> 00:46:47.084
<v Speaker 1>associated with the everlasting spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>PNEUMA PNEUMA is the breath of air and </v>

733
00:46:52.311 --> 00:46:53.720
<v Speaker 1>it's also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

734
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.930
<v Speaker 1>the essence of life from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural perspective.</v>

735
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.273
<v Speaker 1>So to be inspired is like risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Respiring to be inspired is to take in </v>

736
00:47:02.001 --> 00:47:02.834
<v Speaker 1>spirit and the kind of spirit that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>king takes in is associated with the </v>

737
00:47:06.531 --> 00:47:11.531
<v Speaker 1>image of the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you got to look at his face.</v>

738
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.193
<v Speaker 1>You remember before I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause the animators do a very good job </v>

739
00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:18.334
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave him a very mature face and a </v>

740
00:47:20.951 --> 00:47:25.600
<v Speaker 1>mature phase is something out of which </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is coming instead of something</v>

741
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:26.463
<v Speaker 1>into which something is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see that the move Fossa is </v>

742
00:47:30.761 --> 00:47:33.910
<v Speaker 1>always looking like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very intent and focused and,</v>

743
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:36.370
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidating.</v>

744
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Whereas his son right up until he </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes</v>

745
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:43.103
<v Speaker 3>mmm</v>

746
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:48.210
<v Speaker 1>initiated is like this always as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 1>he becomes initiated.</v>

747
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:49.744
<v Speaker 1>And I'll show you that in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his face hardens and it isn't until his </v>

748
00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:52.804
<v Speaker 1>face hardens that he can go back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight scar who's basically a figure of </v>

749
00:47:55.931 --> 00:47:56.764
<v Speaker 1>the shadow.</v>

750
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:05.613
<v Speaker 1>Now originally this character we're Fiki</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to be one of those typical </v>

751
00:48:10.451 --> 00:48:15.451
<v Speaker 1>sort of Disney kick buffoons that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out so well in the narrative.</v>

752
00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:16.684
<v Speaker 1>And he ended up as a symbol of the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Stan and Rick Fiki is obviously a </v>

753
00:48:20.651 --> 00:48:25.120
<v Speaker 1>showman and he's the part of the psyche </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guides its transformation.</v>

754
00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:28.930
<v Speaker 1>So here's another way of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self is very interesting idea.</v>

755
00:48:28.931 --> 00:48:32.290
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you go through life,</v>

756
00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:33.293
<v Speaker 1>there was going to be triumphs and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes and when there's a </v>

757
00:48:35.561 --> 00:48:36.394
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe the psyche falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe it gathers its resources </v>

758
00:48:40.901 --> 00:48:44.440
<v Speaker 1>back together and pulls itself together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going like this.</v>

759
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Well young would say the self is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>guiding that process.</v>

760
00:48:49.151 --> 00:48:49.984
<v Speaker 1>So the ego feels it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's triumphant catastrophe and </v>

761
00:48:52.991 --> 00:48:55.840
<v Speaker 1>triumph and catastrophe or tragedy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

762
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 1>But the self is the thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath all of it,</v>

763
00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:01.090
<v Speaker 1>allowing those transformations to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

764
00:49:01.091 --> 00:49:04.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's where Fiki and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's associated as well with the sun.</v>

765
00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:20.370
<v Speaker 1>So when he's a good king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's in touch with the self.</v>

766
00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.760
<v Speaker 1>So that makes him not something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>either serving his persona or his ego.</v>

767
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.133
<v Speaker 1>But you could say that what are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>serving is a manner of ruling that </v>

768
00:49:31.561 --> 00:49:32.394
<v Speaker 1>allows for the appropriate amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability and transformation to take </v>

769
00:49:38.401 --> 00:49:41.520
<v Speaker 1>place in the kingdom so that it remains </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable,</v>

770
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:45.630
<v Speaker 1>but also adapting to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the king has guided,</v>

771
00:49:45.631 --> 00:49:46.464
<v Speaker 1>did not buy the little bird who tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>him what's going on in those places he </v>

772
00:49:48.991 --> 00:49:49.824
<v Speaker 1>can't see.</v>

773
00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Now that's clearly a Madonna and child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The image.</v>

774
00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

775
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:07.610
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is quite simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

776
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.781
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

777
00:50:08.781 --> 00:50:11.210
<v Speaker 1>why would the idea of the Madonna and </v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

778
00:50:11.211 --> 00:50:15.080
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is a far older idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the Christian representation of it,</v>

779
00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.840
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of fingers of Madonna's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cha,</v>

780
00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Madonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madonna's and children.</v>

781
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the ancient Egyptian art,</v>

782
00:50:22.401 --> 00:50:24.590
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the Isis with horace.</v>

783
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:25.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that that's an archetype is </v>

784
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.333
<v Speaker 1>any society who doesn't regard the dyad </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mother and infant as something </v>

785
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.373
<v Speaker 1>sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would mean of highest value is </v>

786
00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:36.434
<v Speaker 1>doomed obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because without that being held as a </v>

787
00:50:41.001 --> 00:50:43.850
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the society will cease to propagate.</v>

788
00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:44.923
<v Speaker 1>And that will be the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the society isn't structured so </v>

789
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:48.314
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that that dyad is up among the </v>

790
00:50:52.851 --> 00:50:57.700
<v Speaker 1>highest of values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the society is become ungovernable.</v>

791
00:50:57.701 --> 00:50:58.534
<v Speaker 1>He corrupt.</v>

792
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.013
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

793
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:17.973
<v Speaker 1>So you see refuke you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just anointed the little king </v>

794
00:51:21.911 --> 00:51:25.990
<v Speaker 1>with something that was orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was something like the sun.</v>

795
00:51:25.991 --> 00:51:26.824
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that the film is expressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's some sunlike substance </v>

796
00:51:30.851 --> 00:51:35.851
<v Speaker 1>that's being associated with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this new born son of the king,</v>

797
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:38.290
<v Speaker 1>and that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

798
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:39.403
<v Speaker 1>a dramatic manifestation of his destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And an indication that he asked also be </v>

799
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:46.003
<v Speaker 1>in cultured because what Rafiq he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing as a cultural act before he's </v>

800
00:51:49.211 --> 00:51:50.200
<v Speaker 1>going to be complete.</v>

801
00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Now the sand is also an indication that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's mortal.</v>

802
00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Now watch what happens here because this</v>
<v Speaker 1>film makers,</v>

803
00:52:07.361 --> 00:52:08.194
<v Speaker 1>I think they just nail this part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to do the sweeping </v>

804
00:52:10.541 --> 00:52:14.830
<v Speaker 1>thing again and the music rises to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate climax of the song.</v>

805
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:20.250
<v Speaker 1>And what's happening here is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self is presenting this the sun.</v>

806
00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.413
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a presentation of the savior </v>

807
00:52:22.871 --> 00:52:23.704
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that has just been </v>

808
00:52:25.511 --> 00:52:26.650
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hero.</v>

809
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:27.873
<v Speaker 1>And when the hero is presented and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sun breaks open wide and shines on </v>

810
00:52:31.961 --> 00:52:33.970
<v Speaker 1>immune would call that a synchronous </v>
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

811
00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:35.163
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is there's an emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with that which you will </v>

812
00:52:37.661 --> 00:52:38.494
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's at that time that all the </v>

813
00:52:39.581 --> 00:52:42.040
<v Speaker 1>animals bow down and they do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously.</v>

814
00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:42.874
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that there's a hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and the little boy in the sun is </v>

815
00:52:48.011 --> 00:52:48.844
<v Speaker 1>the highest element of the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when that it manifests itself and </v>

816
00:52:52.181 --> 00:52:56.560
<v Speaker 1>you can see beyond the facade facade to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's divine behind it,</v>

817
00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:00.640
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of that will be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous bursting forth of law.</v>

818
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:03.370
<v Speaker 1>And I really think the filmmakers nailed</v>
<v Speaker 1>out here.</v>

819
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

820
00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they hit that pretty hard there.</v>

821
00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:03.853
<v Speaker 1>So there's also a nuclear family thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the background that you </v>

822
00:54:06.741 --> 00:54:11.741
<v Speaker 1>might have noticed because of course the</v>
<v Speaker 1>little king has a mother and a father.</v>

823
00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:17.240
<v Speaker 1>That's partly because that works better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also partly because the,</v>

824
00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:21.440
<v Speaker 1>the archetypical hero is the son of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture had nature.</v>

825
00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:23.660
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's a,</v>

826
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:24.950
<v Speaker 1>here's a shadow figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

827
00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Here he's represented here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much a symbol as shadow,</v>

828
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 1>although he's part of Simba Shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's represented as Mufasa is shouting.</v>

829
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.810
<v Speaker 1>And so it's quite a complex idea because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it says is when,</v>

830
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:43.980
<v Speaker 1>when a king like organization grows up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means any organization,</v>

831
00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:46.650
<v Speaker 1>anything that's a hierarchy and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

832
00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:47.723
<v Speaker 1>there's a shadow element to it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tends towards totalitarianism and </v>

833
00:54:51.781 --> 00:54:52.614
<v Speaker 1>tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's represented often by the </v>

834
00:54:55.381 --> 00:54:58.560
<v Speaker 1>king's evil brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very common motif in,</v>

835
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.053
<v Speaker 1>in mythologically based stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the king is generally blind to his </v>

836
00:55:04.171 --> 00:55:07.680
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so often willfully blind.</v>

837
00:55:07.681 --> 00:55:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Although that doesn't really seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case in the lion king,</v>

838
00:55:09.991 --> 00:55:10.824
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is clearly the case that move well </v>

839
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:18.080
<v Speaker 1>fossa underestimates the danger posed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>his usually older and smarter brother.</v>

840
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.023
<v Speaker 1>It's and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the miss very often make the case </v>

841
00:55:23.251 --> 00:55:27.690
<v Speaker 1>that the evil king is the older one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the one that's more intelligent.</v>

842
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:31.230
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I can tell,</v>

843
00:55:31.231 --> 00:55:36.210
<v Speaker 1>is that intelligence is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can go very wrong if it goes wrong.</v>

844
00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:41.211
<v Speaker 1>And one of its big temptations is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it produces models of the world and then</v>

845
00:55:41.221 --> 00:55:42.054
<v Speaker 1>falls in love with the models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it falls in love with the </v>

846
00:55:44.431 --> 00:55:45.264
<v Speaker 1>models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it totalitarian because it </v>

847
00:55:47.101 --> 00:55:47.934
<v Speaker 1>believes that its constructions are good</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that there doesn't need to be </v>

848
00:55:51.361 --> 00:55:52.194
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it eliminates the necessity of the </v>

849
00:55:53.941 --> 00:55:54.774
<v Speaker 1>transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's definitely a characteristic </v>

850
00:55:56.611 --> 00:55:59.100
<v Speaker 1>of any totalitarian system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

851
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:01.980
<v Speaker 1>this is everything we need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

852
00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:07.010
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to suffer or if you happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to openly rebel against the system,</v>

853
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:08.484
<v Speaker 1>then you're regarded as an enemy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth and then it's fine to do with you </v>

854
00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:14.454
<v Speaker 1>whatever might be done because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything worth doing is already been </v>

855
00:56:18.301 --> 00:56:19.134
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

856
00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:20.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

857
00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:34.373
<v Speaker 1>Now he's got an interesting facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression and it's really worth </v>

858
00:56:38.551 --> 00:56:43.551
<v Speaker 1>watching facial expressions in animated </v>
<v Speaker 1>cartoons because they're not faces,</v>

859
00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:45.173
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they are is the consequence of the </v>

860
00:56:47.941 --> 00:56:48.774
<v Speaker 1>observations of extremely talented </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists about how's people's faces </v>

861
00:56:52.531 --> 00:56:55.380
<v Speaker 1>configure themselves over very long </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods of time.</v>

862
00:56:55.381 --> 00:56:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Because these people are high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>

863
00:56:57.301 --> 00:56:58.134
<v Speaker 1>they know what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're able to distill down </v>

864
00:57:00.451 --> 00:57:03.450
<v Speaker 1>certain facial expressions to describe a</v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

865
00:57:03.451 --> 00:57:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Now this guy's obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's whiny,</v>

866
00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:08.970
<v Speaker 1>he's got this supercilious and arrogant </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>

867
00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.410
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

868
00:57:10.411 --> 00:57:11.244
<v Speaker 1>he's arrogant beyond belief and he all </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also hard done by and resentful and </v>

869
00:57:15.091 --> 00:57:15.924
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe he has a reason he's got a </v>

870
00:57:17.701 --> 00:57:20.040
<v Speaker 1>scar or something happened to them that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't good,</v>

871
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.233
<v Speaker 1>but he's taken on this attitude as </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful victim who really deserves to </v>

872
00:57:25.291 --> 00:57:28.950
<v Speaker 1>rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If only everyone could see how wonderful</v>

873
00:57:28.951 --> 00:57:30.900
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he has all sorts of reasons why</v>

874
00:57:30.901 --> 00:57:34.650
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he isn't powerful has </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with his own shortcomings,</v>

875
00:57:56.530 --> 00:58:01.530
<v Speaker 3>passes on his way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He</v>

876
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:13.020
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're looking at me that way.</v>

877
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:22.743
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

878
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:33.290
<v Speaker 1>well as we can tell the eyes of the king</v>
<v Speaker 1>and scarred not friends.</v>

879
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's because scar doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see what's going on.</v>

880
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Now here's an interesting little </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype.</v>

881
00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.073
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

882
00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:24.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's quite interesting.</v>

883
00:59:24.451 --> 00:59:26.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a variety of statements there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are very,</v>

884
00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:28.830
<v Speaker 1>very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of them is</v>

885
00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.313
<v Speaker 1>the kingdom is a bounded place and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's playing off the idea of explored </v>

886
00:59:37.861 --> 00:59:42.120
<v Speaker 1>territory versus unexplored territory or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the known versus the unknown.</v>

887
00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And the proposition there is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the dominance hierarchy happens</v>

888
00:59:45.781 --> 00:59:48.450
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a limited domain of</v>

889
00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.153
<v Speaker 1>a limited domain of competence and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of competence is defined by </v>

890
00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:57.943
<v Speaker 1>everything that the light touches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is actually something that you </v>

891
01:00:01.491 --> 01:00:03.140
<v Speaker 1>can notice in your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

892
01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.983
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see that if you move into a new </v>

893
01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>place or a new neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you do anything new at all,</v>

894
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>that nothing that you haven't attended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two is actually yours.</v>

895
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:17.623
<v Speaker 1>It will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will stay foreign in a sense and </v>

896
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:21.463
<v Speaker 1>unfamiliar to you until you interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it with a substantial amount of </v>

897
01:00:25.611 --> 01:00:26.444
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because while you're </v>

898
01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>attending to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an act of conscious swill,</v>

899
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

900
01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:34.123
<v Speaker 1>you're modifying your perceptions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts and your actions and your </v>

901
01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:41.570
<v Speaker 1>emotions to take it into account as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>

902
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you're competent </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

903
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.033
<v Speaker 1>And it takes conscious effort to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>competent because you have to practice </v>

904
01:00:50.031 --> 01:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>being competent at a new domain.</v>

905
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>And until you've practiced being </v>
<v Speaker 1>competent in a new domain,</v>

906
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:56.023
<v Speaker 1>it's not yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this clip is showing what's </v>

907
01:00:59.421 --> 01:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>basically an eternal truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that your territory is whatever</v>

908
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:07.910
<v Speaker 1>you've mastered and it's demarcated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you haven't mastered.</v>

909
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:11.540
<v Speaker 1>And in this particular representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with,</v>

910
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.823
<v Speaker 1>with death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also associated in some bizarre </v>

911
01:01:15.771 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>sense with paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of course,</v>

912
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Simba encounters the elephants grave out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in no man's land,</v>

913
01:01:22.641 --> 01:01:25.370
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when he runs away across the desert,</v>

914
01:01:25.371 --> 01:01:26.204
<v Speaker 1>he also finds paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a paradoxical idea there </v>

915
01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:29.474
<v Speaker 1>that the unknown contains death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you need to make your life </v>

916
01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:35.953
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile.</v>

917
01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Here comes the anima.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

918
01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see that cocky?</v>

919
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>He's a cocky little rat here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

920
01:02:04.561 --> 01:02:09.561
<v Speaker 1>So he's very confident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's egotism and also persona.</v>

921
01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder he's confident.</v>

922
01:02:11.281 --> 01:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>He's the son of the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

923
01:02:12.751 --> 01:02:13.584
<v Speaker 1>And the fact is that he has a position </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dominance that he doesn't deserve </v>

924
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>merely because he was born into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's him.</v>

925
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Shallow and arrogant and possessed by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>persona.</v>

926
01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.183
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little figure who is basically an </v>

927
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>anima figure always knocks him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A peg continually knocks him down a peg.</v>

928
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>How many of you seen groundhog day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

929
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember in Groundhog Day,</v>

930
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Bill Murray's character is a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a jackass at the beginning.</v>

931
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>He's very arrogant and he's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>unskilled.</v>

932
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:46.583
<v Speaker 1>And then he gets stuck in the same day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty funny because that is </v>

933
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>what happens to you if you're arrogant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and unskilled,</v>

934
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>you end up in the same damn day.</v>

935
01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.773
<v Speaker 1>That's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in that day he becomes </v>

936
01:02:58.111 --> 01:02:58.944
<v Speaker 1>attracted to this woman who's an anima </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure and for for years as far as the </v>

937
01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:04.074
<v Speaker 1>films concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time he approaches her in his </v>

938
01:03:06.721 --> 01:03:09.360
<v Speaker 1>arrogant and clumsy way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she slaps him.</v>

939
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:10.703
<v Speaker 1>So there's one scene in the movie where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it lasts for about 30 seconds </v>

940
01:03:13.591 --> 01:03:14.424
<v Speaker 1>and it's nothing but clips of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>slapping him probably 30 times at that </v>

941
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:19.734
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen him go through the same day </v>

942
01:03:21.241 --> 01:03:22.074
<v Speaker 1>and the continually painful way that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does and she slaps him in those longer </v>

943
01:03:24.961 --> 01:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>clips and after a while the film maker </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets tired of that,</v>

944
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:30.030
<v Speaker 1>just shows you nothing but the slaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

945
01:03:30.031 --> 01:03:30.864
<v Speaker 1>eventually he's brought so far down as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of being stuck in the same </v>

946
01:03:35.491 --> 01:03:39.030
<v Speaker 1>day and continually being slapped that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he falls completely apart.</v>

947
01:03:39.031 --> 01:03:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he tries to kill himself.</v>

948
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:41.803
<v Speaker 1>And one of the very comical things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie is that that doesn't work </v>

949
01:03:44.101 --> 01:03:44.640
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

950
01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.550
<v Speaker 1>He just wakes up at the same day again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

951
01:03:47.551 --> 01:03:51.150
<v Speaker 1>what that means in some sense is that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too damn stubborn to change,</v>

952
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:54.990
<v Speaker 1>you will keep running into the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing over and over continually.</v>

953
01:03:54.991 --> 01:03:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you're in the same day </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you won't let go of it.</v>

954
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And that might drive you even to </v>
<v Speaker 1>question the value of your own being.</v>

955
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.310
<v Speaker 1>But that's also not a very useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptive strategy,</v>

956
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.413
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't till he starts to take his </v>

957
01:04:07.471 --> 01:04:12.120
<v Speaker 1>rejection seriously that he starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually build some real character,</v>

958
01:04:12.121 --> 01:04:12.954
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he starts paying attention to </v>

959
01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:15.354
<v Speaker 1>the day and finds out that there's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things that he can do during </v>

960
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:19.104
<v Speaker 1>that day to make it rich and meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as he does that enough and </v>

961
01:04:22.921 --> 01:04:24.540
<v Speaker 1>becomes an expert at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

962
01:04:24.541 --> 01:04:28.620
<v Speaker 1>he gets out of the the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same horrible day.</v>

963
01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:33.750
<v Speaker 1>And they saw that horrible day is also a</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of tier of the tyranny of</v>

964
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:36.870
<v Speaker 1>the state because the state is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's static.</v>

965
01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:38.730
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now la,</v>

966
01:04:38.731 --> 01:04:39.564
<v Speaker 1>she's</v>

967
01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:46.773
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

968
01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:00.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

969
01:05:00.311 --> 01:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>they're not paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They end up in the shadows,</v>

970
01:05:02.621 --> 01:05:04.840
<v Speaker 1>outside the kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

971
01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:07.323
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's that image of scar transforming </v>

972
01:05:11.771 --> 01:05:12.604
<v Speaker 1>himself essentially first into Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because there's a lot of Nazi </v>

973
01:05:15.671 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>imagery in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this clip,</v>

974
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>but also into a sate tannic figure at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>

975
01:05:21.131 --> 01:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>you'll see he's associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crescent moon.</v>

976
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>So we turns into the horn demon of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night essentially.</v>

977
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:34.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got</v>

978
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:40.830
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

979
01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all images of hell obviously.</v>

980
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on board talks back.</v>

981
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Slide</v>
<v Speaker 3>my words.</v>

982
01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:10.183
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happened to </v>

983
01:06:11.331 --> 01:06:12.164
<v Speaker 1>people like stolen for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Stellan had nothing but contempt for </v>

984
01:06:14.901 --> 01:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>people and he thought all they ever did </v>
<v Speaker 1>was lie.</v>

985
01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to Stellan is that he's,</v>

986
01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>he became surrounded by people</v>

987
01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:26.143
<v Speaker 1>with to whom he could demonstrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>contempt and who never did anything to </v>

988
01:06:29.211 --> 01:06:30.044
<v Speaker 1>them except lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the reason for that was they were </v>

989
01:06:32.061 --> 01:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>so terrified of them that they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>never tell him the truth about anything.</v>

990
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:38.420
<v Speaker 1>And so he got into this spiral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of the spiral of the,</v>

991
01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:39.613
<v Speaker 1>of a paranoid psychopath where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>distrust you so badly and set things up </v>

992
01:06:44.091 --> 01:06:44.924
<v Speaker 1>so that you'll be punished so hard if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever deviate from the appropriate </v>

993
01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:48.980
<v Speaker 1>line that you'll do nothing but lie to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

994
01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>And so then I'm fully justified my </v>
<v Speaker 1>contempt and sort of,</v>

995
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:55.310
<v Speaker 1>it's like Peter pan in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>king of the lost boys.</v>

996
01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:58.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well who do you want to be king of while</v>

997
01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>the route that scar took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the negative archetype.</v>

998
01:07:01.701 --> 01:07:02.534
<v Speaker 1>The shadow root means that he's king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know he's King of Hell and all </v>

999
01:07:05.631 --> 01:07:06.464
<v Speaker 1>he's God are these brainless minions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know he's King of people he </v>

1000
01:07:10.641 --> 01:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't want to associate with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly a,</v>

1001
01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:16.923
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly,</v>

1002
01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:03.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm about</v>
<v Speaker 3>to</v>

1003
01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.070
<v Speaker 3>start quizzing me.</v>

1004
01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:45.110
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1005
01:08:45.111 --> 01:08:45.944
<v Speaker 1>you may remember or you may not remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>that or who may not know that Hitler of </v>

1006
01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:54.791
<v Speaker 1>course set up the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest meeting arena that the world</v>

1007
01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:59.240
<v Speaker 1>had ever seen for the Nuremberg Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>party rallies.</v>

1008
01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to see.</v>

1009
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.170
<v Speaker 1>They were filmed quite brilliantly in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>film called will to power.</v>

1010
01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:07.853
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leni Riefenstahl and what Hitler has </v>

1011
01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.214
<v Speaker 1>arrayed in front of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our blocks of thousands of soldiers </v>

1012
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:20.480
<v Speaker 1>everywhere as far as you can see an </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely perfect</v>

1013
01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.670
<v Speaker 1>uniformity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the idea,</v>

1014
01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:28.120
<v Speaker 1>because if you're already right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing has to be different.</v>

1015
01:09:28.121 --> 01:09:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Everything can be the same as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect thing.</v>

1016
01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:34.870
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and things have to change.</v>

1017
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:35.913
<v Speaker 1>And Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a master of the use of fire as </v>

1018
01:09:38.111 --> 01:09:40.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also put as displays on at night.</v>

1019
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And so he took all the Luftwaffe is </v>
<v Speaker 1>error craft spotting spotlights,</v>

1020
01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.650
<v Speaker 1>which were huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive lights,</v>

1021
01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe they must have been 20 feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>across,</v>

1022
01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.093
<v Speaker 1>and he had them all lined up behind him </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the stage and they would shine miles </v>

1023
01:09:57.791 --> 01:09:58.624
<v Speaker 1>up into the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he would address these thousands </v>

1024
01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.870
<v Speaker 1>and thousands of people in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>nighttime ritual with a curtain of light</v>

1025
01:10:04.871 --> 01:10:09.040
<v Speaker 1>behind him that was several miles high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievably powerful pageant.</v>

1026
01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:12.640
<v Speaker 1>And the people who made this film or </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing on on that</v>

1027
01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:15.840
<v Speaker 1>to produce these images.</v>

1028
01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Modern people will say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1029
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.963
<v Speaker 1>the idea of hell is just a superstition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you watch this and it makes </v>

1030
01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:19.494
<v Speaker 1>sense and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well hell is where Satan himself rules </v>

1031
01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:25.164
<v Speaker 1>and nothing happens but the body's </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning death and that's exactly what </v>

1032
01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:29.244
<v Speaker 1>happened during the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so thinking that these sorts of </v>

1033
01:11:32.281 --> 01:11:33.114
<v Speaker 1>archetipal ideas are superstitious is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extraordinarily foolish and naive </v>

1034
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.943
<v Speaker 1>because they represent possibilities of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being that continually manifest </v>

1035
01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>themselves and everyone knows about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1036
01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:47.580
<v Speaker 1>So you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1037
01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.473
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the implicit idea here is that if you </v>

1038
01:11:50.851 --> 01:11:54.660
<v Speaker 1>take the path that scar torque,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of resentment and deceit as</v>

1039
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:57.370
<v Speaker 1>well as arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are three major motive,</v>

1040
01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.240
<v Speaker 1>major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major shadow motivators,</v>

1041
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 1>then you'll end up at best ruling over </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

1042
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:06.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's not a superstition.</v>

1043
01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:08.140
<v Speaker 1>The stories are trying to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1044
01:12:08.141 --> 01:12:11.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that his mode of being is the pathway to</v>

1045
01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:11.994
<v Speaker 1>perdition and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the things that happen there </v>

1046
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:14.993
<v Speaker 1>are so terrible and so deep that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only way you can really express them is </v>

1047
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.673
<v Speaker 1>using the kind of imagery that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to associate with religious and </v>

1048
01:12:23.011 --> 01:12:28.011
<v Speaker 1>religious imagery in a sense is imagery </v>
<v Speaker 1>that cannot be made more powerful.</v>

1049
01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes it archetipal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a limit.</v>

1050
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.140
<v Speaker 1>You can't go past it in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1051
01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:39.410
<v Speaker 1>And so when you represent the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>destiny of evil as eternal hell,</v>

1052
01:12:40.321 --> 01:12:41.154
<v Speaker 1>where all the bodies burned forever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing there except demonic </v>

1053
01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:44.543
<v Speaker 1>chatter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about as far as you can go in </v>

1054
01:12:46.861 --> 01:12:49.230
<v Speaker 1>terms of your capacity to represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1055
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.820
<v Speaker 1>But it's representing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you can say,</v>

1056
01:12:53.821 --> 01:12:55.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an eternal place,</v>

1057
01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:58.530
<v Speaker 1>while that's because this possibility's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always there,</v>

1058
01:12:58.531 --> 01:13:01.500
<v Speaker 1>it never goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always there.</v>

1059
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's also what makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal.</v>

1060
01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.073
<v Speaker 1>And do you know that because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be able to understand the </v>

1061
01:13:09.521 --> 01:13:12.970
<v Speaker 1>story and everyone knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise this story wouldn't be,</v>

1062
01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I still believe it's one of the top 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>grossing films of all time.</v>

1063
01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>So obviously it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1064
01:13:21.671 --> 01:13:24.190
<v Speaker 1>well I'd like to show you a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1065
01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.640
<v Speaker 1>but I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see you Thursday.</v>

1066
01:13:33.501 --> 01:13:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to post some sample questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the website</v>

1067
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:41.660
<v Speaker 1>very soon tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly tomorrow morning,</v>

1068
01:13:41.661 --> 01:13:44.090
<v Speaker 1>possibly somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So check it out.</v>

1069
01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Neil gets some sense of what the exam's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be like.</v>
