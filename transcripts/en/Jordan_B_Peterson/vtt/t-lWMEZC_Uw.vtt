1
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you so much for giving us some </v>

2
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

3
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in Kentucky.</v>

4
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

5
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm there as part of my 12 rules for </v>

6
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.371
<v Speaker 2>life tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I think expanding to hit about </v>

7
00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:07.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe 80 cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

8
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was very keen to have a follow</v>

9
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:16.151
<v Speaker 1>up chat after the conversation that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had together when you're in </v>

10
00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>and in particular to frame that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who might be listening to this </v>

12
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.881
<v Speaker 1>conversation at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had not seen you in front of a live </v>

13
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>audience the evening of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

14
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:34.221
<v Speaker 1>After that conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that opportunity at chatswood one </v>

15
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:37.731
<v Speaker 1>of the seven talks that you gave in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia put together by Sam Mcclellan </v>

16
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a Melbourne,</v>

17
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>every one of them or sell out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to say,</v>

18
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether the biggest issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me is what I learned by watching </v>

19
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the questions that arise out of it.</v>

20
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>But the first thing I'd say is I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned at the time that you and I had</v>

21
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>had a very long conversation that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be too long for people when we put it on</v>

22
00:01:58.381 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>the website and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

23
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>John won't be young people especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>are hungry for content.</v>

24
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Put it all up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will listen to it.</v>

25
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young people looking for content.</v>

26
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.070
<v Speaker 2>It is absolutely amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

27
00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:18.071
<v Speaker 2>So well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean some of the big youtube stars </v>

28
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.691
<v Speaker 2>like Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're constantly putting out three </v>

29
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 2>hour podcasts and people listened to all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

30
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:26.961
<v Speaker 2>Long haul truckers listen to them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys driving forklifts and and young </v>

31
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:32.151
<v Speaker 2>people and couples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a massive hunger for real </v>

32
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 2>for Ed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for high quality educational material.</v>

33
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be underestimated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean one of the things that seems </v>

34
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.271
<v Speaker 2>to be the case with these people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube that are making a splash,</v>

35
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 2>let's say in this alternate media </v>
<v Speaker 2>format,</v>

36
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:51.561
<v Speaker 2>is that they fully have full respect for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intelligence of their audience and </v>

37
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 2>they don't pull any punches in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>content or lakes.</v>

38
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's where the come back to that.</v>

39
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 1>But as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.710
<v Speaker 1>it's just extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pull up a field station out in the </v>

41
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>country town near where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>and somebody gets out of the car next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

43
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>a follow of about 35,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

44
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>and he looks at me and he just says </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight up before he even says hello,</v>

45
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just been listening to you and </v>

46
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.591
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everywhere I go now that's what </v>

47
00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>people say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank you for the opportunity.</v>

48
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>You made the comment there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the for every,</v>

49
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube visit,</v>

50
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>they'd be up to 11 podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what you said.</v>

51
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast market is absolutely </v>

52
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.151
<v Speaker 2>exploding and you're actually seeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeding this start to effect book </v>

53
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:40.020
<v Speaker 2>publishing because audio books have </v>
<v Speaker 2>become extraordinarily popular and </v>

54
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.701
<v Speaker 2>people are discovering that they can use</v>
<v Speaker 2>their phone time when they're commuting </v>

55
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:44.701
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

56
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 2>or exercising or walking or doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>dishes,</v>

57
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to engage themselves in high quality.</v>

58
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high quality educational material,</v>

59
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.020
<v Speaker 2>books and podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a real revolution it.</v>

60
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.920
<v Speaker 2>And it really is a revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People young people to you,</v>

61
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.030
<v Speaker 2>not instead of listening to music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really something because </v>

62
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 2>music's been a predominant cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>force for a very long time,</v>

63
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 2>so it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing technological revolution</v>

64
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 2>and I really appreciated our </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation by the way.</v>

65
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 2>I think we had a great conversation.</v>

66
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it immensely and it seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that this is a sort of modern version</v>

67
00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:21.120
<v Speaker 1>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is terrific,</v>

68
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:23.520
<v Speaker 1>if I'm understanding correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they all da da way.</v>

69
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.880
<v Speaker 1>People who perhaps had another great </v>
<v Speaker 1>formal education had access to good </v>

70
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 1>quality literature and so forth put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together by whether it was penguin or a.</v>

71
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every man's book,</v>

72
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>so every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every diet books,</v>

73
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>whatever they were called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even reader's digest to Mike.</v>

74
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:39.630
<v Speaker 1>That education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that learning the classics and so forth,</v>

75
00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:43.650
<v Speaker 1>available widely and now this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern version of it perhaps.</v>

76
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think what's happening,</v>

77
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.270
<v Speaker 2>it's a main street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They underestimate the,</v>

78
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.890
<v Speaker 2>the moral quality of their viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They underestimate their intelligence.</v>

79
00:04:55.891 --> 00:05:00.891
<v Speaker 2>They underestimate their persistence and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've also become quite manipulative </v>

80
00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:04.050
<v Speaker 2>in their use of editing and message </v>
<v Speaker 2>massaging,</v>

81
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.170
<v Speaker 2>spin really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that's really good </v>

82
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.560
<v Speaker 2>about these sorts of conversations is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that what you see is what you get.</v>

83
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.440
<v Speaker 2>They're bare bones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not high tech.</v>

84
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Well they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their highest tech in some sense,</v>

85
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:18.540
<v Speaker 2>but not on the production end or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>editing end.</v>

86
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:21.840
<v Speaker 2>So people can trust them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine conversations.</v>

87
00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:25.200
<v Speaker 2>They're not designed to craft a message </v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything like that.</v>

88
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:27.050
<v Speaker 2>They're not manipulative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

89
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.070
<v Speaker 2>and that's a big deal in youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube particularly doesn't respond </v>

90
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.390
<v Speaker 2>well to manipulation as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell.</v>

91
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Andrea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that conversations are enormously.</v>

93
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I've been stunned by the response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

94
00:05:38.941 --> 00:05:41.160
<v Speaker 1>it's gone very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very widely as you know,</v>

95
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both on your site and Oman.</v>

96
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to come back to that die later that </v>

97
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.150
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got one of the talks of the,</v>

98
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the seven that you gave in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia chatswood.</v>

99
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very kindly allowed to compare it </v>

100
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.851
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one thing that 19 years in public </v>

101
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.931
<v Speaker 1>life taught me is to have a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at your audience and summarize </v>

102
00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:04.931
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

103
00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:08.370
<v Speaker 1>it was a pretty amazing experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing had happened was that </v>

104
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.370
<v Speaker 1>you worked on for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said a word,</v>

105
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you'd got a standing ovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something unheard of in this </v>

106
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they did a 90 minutes top.</v>

107
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I gave you another standing ovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

108
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>you left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came for a few minutes,</v>

109
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 1>came back on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took 30 minutes of questions,</v>

110
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they responded in the same way.</v>

111
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Let me just say a couple of things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that audience.</v>

112
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>firstly,</v>

113
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:33.791
<v Speaker 1>I've got to say pretty heavily impacted </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I looked out there and recognized </v>

114
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>that there was an enormous hunger to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear what you had to say.</v>

115
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Even though you mentioned it was perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>best described as tough love.</v>

116
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>You weren't ginger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ring them up with a soft story.</v>

117
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:47.600
<v Speaker 1>You were really pushing you or really </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging them.</v>

118
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.110
<v Speaker 1>The second thing that struck me is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said many times since I reckon 50 </v>

119
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.521
<v Speaker 1>percent of the people in that room at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night where young Australian men under </v>

120
00:06:57.521 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 1>the age of probably 35.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

121
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>the third thing that struck me was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>

122
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.120
<v Speaker 1>it was a cross section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

123
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>I would say many of them were university</v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

124
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>but all university graduates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many,</v>

125
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>many will not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fourth thing that,</v>

126
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>it just goes back to something you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>a moment ago,</v>

127
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.540
<v Speaker 1>they knew what you were signing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a clinical psychologist in a </v>

128
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.231
<v Speaker 1>highly educated person to suggest that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't understand would be very </v>

129
00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>patronizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ain't got what you're on about.</v>

130
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

131
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.120
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt about that.</v>

132
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

133
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 2>those lectures aren't interesting unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand them and there's just no </v>

134
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:32.950
<v Speaker 2>doubt that that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

135
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the mistakes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists have made,</v>

136
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.360
<v Speaker 2>especially the more popular ones over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last three or four decades,</v>

137
00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:42.120
<v Speaker 2>is to try to convince people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're okay the way they are.</v>

138
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like the self esteem movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

139
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.680
<v Speaker 2>you should love yourself the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

140
00:07:46.681 --> 00:07:48.810
<v Speaker 2>You should feel good about yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way you are.</v>

141
00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:53.811
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually not a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimistic message for people because </v>

142
00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 2>people are generally sensible enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>not be particularly satisfied with the </v>

143
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.640
<v Speaker 2>way that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to be who they could be.</v>

144
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 2>They want to have something noble Tane </v>
<v Speaker 2>map and,</v>

145
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.160
<v Speaker 2>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make that case for very strong that </v>

146
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.930
<v Speaker 2>you should more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

147
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 2>what aligned and on board with who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be then with who you are and who you</v>

148
00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:14.910
<v Speaker 2>can be.</v>

149
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Isn't the person who has endless rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

150
00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:22.731
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or as the member of a privileged or </v>

151
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.280
<v Speaker 2>underprivileged group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be who you should be,</v>

152
00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:27.720
<v Speaker 2>should be an individual who's willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take on full responsibility for the,</v>

153
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 2>for the catastrophe of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for the malevolence that's part of </v>

154
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.540
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And See,</v>

155
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I think people are responding to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all because everyone who has </v>

156
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.871
<v Speaker 2>any sense knows that life is a tragic </v>
<v Speaker 2>business and that everyone is </v>

157
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:44.640
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to be trail and malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their own part.</v>

158
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:49.641
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a consequence of the actions of </v>

159
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:49.770
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our existential predicament.</v>

160
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.430
<v Speaker 2>And I think people also know in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep sense that the to that isn't </v>

161
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:58.310
<v Speaker 2>security or safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

162
00:08:58.311 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 2>and it's not envy or bitterness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the willingness to try to work,</v>

163
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 2>to make the world a better place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start with yourself,</v>

164
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 2>take responsibility for yourself.</v>

165
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.560
<v Speaker 2>And then to take responsibility for your</v>
<v Speaker 2>family and then to take responsibility </v>

166
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.851
<v Speaker 2>for your community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone knows that the people they </v>

167
00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 2>admire are exactly the people that do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

168
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.660
<v Speaker 2>And we also all know that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets you out of bed on a rough morning.</v>

169
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.260
<v Speaker 2>It's that you've got something important</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vital to do and it's not an easy </v>

170
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't necessarily even something that</v>

171
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:33.201
<v Speaker 2>makes you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's meaningful and </v>

172
00:09:33.201 --> 00:09:35.751
<v Speaker 2>necessary to fight back against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy and the malevolence of the </v>

173
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people know that deeply.</v>

174
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.070
<v Speaker 2>It's deeply rooted inside their souls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

175
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 2>And a call to that is very meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people,</v>

176
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 2>including me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

177
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:50.871
<v Speaker 2>I include myself in my audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I'm lecturing to them </v>

178
00:09:50.871 --> 00:09:54.801
<v Speaker 2>precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a conversation with them </v>

179
00:09:54.801 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 2>about how we can step the world right </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we are setting it right.</v>

180
00:09:56.191 --> 00:10:01.191
<v Speaker 2>Things are getting better very rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world and we can really push </v>

181
00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:01.710
<v Speaker 2>that forward in the decades to come if </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

182
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:07.370
<v Speaker 2>if we made a conscious effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think this is a very exciting </v>

183
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.370
<v Speaker 2>message for people.</v>

184
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.910
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that are outside about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australians is I got the world's best </v>

185
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.600
<v Speaker 1>bulldust detectors by recognize </v>
<v Speaker 1>authenticity,</v>

186
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:18.380
<v Speaker 1>authenticity very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not authentic,</v>

187
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.790
<v Speaker 1>they won't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think in part they were responding.</v>

188
00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:24.590
<v Speaker 1>If I can pay you a compliment by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you were talking about you,</v>

189
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.310
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

190
00:10:28.311 --> 00:10:33.311
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing where we are all together as </v>

191
00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:37.841
<v Speaker 1>human beings and in why it was designed </v>
<v Speaker 1>you assigning to get to the good news.</v>

192
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.590
<v Speaker 1>You've actually got to go through what </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be called the valley of death.</v>

193
00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:47.591
<v Speaker 1>You've got to face yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be realistic about </v>

194
00:10:47.591 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the world that you live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

195
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.200
<v Speaker 1>all those young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was almost as though they were saying</v>

196
00:10:51.201 --> 00:10:54.680
<v Speaker 1>was sick to death of a therapy culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A culture that offers a sort of.</v>

197
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a relief to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

198
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a dictum that Carl young derived</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the great outcome of sex Mr Colinas</v>

199
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:07.100
<v Speaker 2>inventory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it means what you most want will be </v>

200
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.681
<v Speaker 2>found where you least want to look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you most need will be found where </v>

201
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:15.091
<v Speaker 2>you least want to look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that people know that know everyone </v>

202
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.860
<v Speaker 2>knows that they are tired of naive </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimism,</v>

203
00:11:17.861 --> 00:11:19.270
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not optimism.</v>

204
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Optimism doesn't have to be naive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know perfectly well that the way to</v>

205
00:11:22.871 --> 00:11:27.871
<v Speaker 2>set themselves right is to take careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>stock of themselves and to pay very </v>

206
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 2>careful attention to the errors that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know they're making and to and to </v>

207
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.661
<v Speaker 2>grow up and to mature and to and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adopt the responsibilities of a </v>

208
00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:41.131
<v Speaker 2>forthright citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think people are sick to death of </v>

209
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 2>too much discussion of rights and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>too much discussion of self esteem and </v>

210
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

211
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.950
<v Speaker 2>All that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that discussion that goes along with</v>

212
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 2>what everyone owes you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's just not helpful to </v>

213
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.421
<v Speaker 2>people because it isn't your rights that</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you meaning in life and you need a </v>

214
00:11:58.591 --> 00:12:02.130
<v Speaker 2>meaning to set against the tragedy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows that.</v>

215
00:12:02.131 --> 00:12:05.190
<v Speaker 2>The way that you find that meaning is by</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopting responsibility.</v>

216
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Obviously for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to take care of yourself,</v>

217
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:14.210
<v Speaker 2>your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you want to be a good person to </v>

218
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.971
<v Speaker 2>your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be a good person to your </v>

219
00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:18.891
<v Speaker 2>siblings and your children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly and you have to bear some </v>

220
00:12:18.891 --> 00:12:22.620
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for your community and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really firing on all cylinders,</v>

221
00:12:22.621 --> 00:12:24.480
<v Speaker 2>you do all those things at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

222
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and I do believe,</v>

223
00:12:26.641 --> 00:12:28.560
<v Speaker 2>and I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that the world,</v>

224
00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:30.510
<v Speaker 2>if the tragic and malevolent place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

225
00:12:30.511 --> 00:12:33.470
<v Speaker 2>many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that the way forward through that is</v>

226
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:38.810
<v Speaker 2>is to do everything you can to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself on the side of what's good and </v>

227
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:43.391
<v Speaker 2>to aim high and that that's where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the dignity that enables you to to </v>

228
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:46.550
<v Speaker 2>bear life without becoming corrupt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows this is true.</v>

229
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Who's gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Argue with that?</v>

230
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Having found yourself on having of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>like and being realistic about yourself </v>

231
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.250
<v Speaker 1>on recognizing we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this last time.</v>

232
00:12:56.251 --> 00:12:59.850
<v Speaker 1>A dividing line between good and evil is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not between black and white or whatever.</v>

233
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:05.090
<v Speaker 1>A captor and Jayla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an old man and woman at somewhere </v>

234
00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:11.181
<v Speaker 1>across every human heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having recognized that and you can then </v>

235
00:13:11.181 --> 00:13:13.110
<v Speaker 1>go on and help build a stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairer and more just more humane society</v>

236
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:18.290
<v Speaker 1>rather than what seems to be the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>people approach it at the moment and </v>

237
00:13:18.501 --> 00:13:19.080
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

238
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:24.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that somehow rather you society can fix </v>

239
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.470
<v Speaker 1>your problems.</v>

240
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's it and I mean for young </v>

241
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.600
<v Speaker 2>people in particular at skidsteer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a very depressing message for </v>

242
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.661
<v Speaker 2>young people to hear that it's time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to get involved in political </v>

243
00:13:32.661 --> 00:13:35.961
<v Speaker 2>activism because any young person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>has any sense knows perfectly well and </v>

244
00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:37.960
<v Speaker 2>if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're 18 or so,</v>

245
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>19 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is they don't know a damn thing.</v>

246
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't started a business.</v>

247
00:13:42.991 --> 00:13:47.991
<v Speaker 2>They haven't started a family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a permanent </v>

248
00:13:47.991 --> 00:13:47.991
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not educated.</v>

249
00:13:47.991 --> 00:13:49.710
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for someone to come and say,</v>

250
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:51.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a position to change the world</v>

251
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.250
<v Speaker 2>is nothing but a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of disenchanting them with adult wisdom.</v>

252
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're not ready to change the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

253
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.170
<v Speaker 2>You've got a lot to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can learn it.</v>

254
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:06.470
<v Speaker 2>And in learning it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will become much more powerful and </v>

255
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.991
<v Speaker 2>much more charismatic and much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate and much more wise and </v>

256
00:14:08.991 --> 00:14:13.491
<v Speaker 2>sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the way forward to to being </v>

257
00:14:13.491 --> 00:14:13.491
<v Speaker 2>much more than you are.</v>

258
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.510
<v Speaker 2>And young people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

259
00:14:15.511 --> 00:14:18.870
<v Speaker 2>when you're 18 and you have 60 years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life ahead of you,</v>

260
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.240
<v Speaker 2>what you want to hear above all else is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's way more of you yet to come</v>

261
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.810
<v Speaker 2>because what else are you going with </v>
<v Speaker 2>those 60 years?</v>

262
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a message.</v>

263
00:14:30.591 --> 00:14:32.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard message because it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

264
00:14:32.421 --> 00:14:37.421
<v Speaker 2>you're not everything you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a deeply optimistic message </v>

265
00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:41.321
<v Speaker 2>because it's because the idea is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be way more than you are </v>

266
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:44.150
<v Speaker 2>incomparably more than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do believe that.</v>

267
00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:48.020
<v Speaker 2>And what's so fun about this is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people keep telling me that,</v>

268
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.270
<v Speaker 2>keep people keep telling me that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

269
00:14:50.271 --> 00:14:51.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have people,</v>

270
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 2>endless people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got one kid come up to me the other</v>

271
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so fun.</v>

272
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.100
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year and a half ago,</v>

273
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 2>I had just got out of jail and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>homeless.</v>

274
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.610
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started listening to your lectures and</v>

275
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got married this year,</v>

276
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 2>I have a vagina and I just bought my </v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment.</v>

277
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow man,</v>

278
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.010
<v Speaker 2>good work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.250
<v Speaker 2>you did that in a year and a half and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

280
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I was in la the other about a month ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

281
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.260
<v Speaker 2>this was in a rough part of La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>downtown La near the Apollo theater.</v>

282
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:29.261
<v Speaker 2>And I'd given a talk there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife and I were walking down the </v>

283
00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 2>street and this car pulled up and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid hopped out and he was about 19 or so</v>

284
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.200
<v Speaker 2>good luck and Hispanic kid ran over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked me if I was Dr Peterson.</v>

285
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 2>I said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was all excited.</v>

286
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:42.911
<v Speaker 2>He said it'd been watching my videos for</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a year and a half and they really </v>

287
00:15:42.911 --> 00:15:43.730
<v Speaker 2>helped him straighten out his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just smiling the way.</v>

288
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

289
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:49.661
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he ran back to his car and he came </v>

290
00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:51.650
<v Speaker 2>back out with his dad and his dad was </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing there,</v>

291
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have their arms around each </v>

292
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:56.860
<v Speaker 2>other and they were just grinning like </v>
<v Speaker 2>mad and the kid said,</v>

293
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.310
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really put my relationship together</v>

294
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:03.340
<v Speaker 2>with my father and were really on board </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this together and they were just </v>

295
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:03.470
<v Speaker 2>like so happy you couldn't believe it.</v>

296
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:08.470
<v Speaker 2>And that just happens over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it happens I would say four or five</v>

297
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:14.021
<v Speaker 2>times a day in restaurants or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>airports through while you've been </v>

298
00:16:14.021 --> 00:16:14.270
<v Speaker 2>experiencing that to some degree in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia you said,</v>

299
00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:16.100
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so good.</v>

300
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.820
<v Speaker 2>And the mainstream media that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>covering what I've been doing,</v>

301
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just missed this completely because</v>

302
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:27.161
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like everything that </v>

303
00:16:27.161 --> 00:16:29.090
<v Speaker 2>constitutes news in our society has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be political and group oriented.</v>

304
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 2>This isn't political and it's not group </v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented.</v>

305
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.990
<v Speaker 2>What I'm trying to do as a good clinical</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist and perhaps a good educator</v>

306
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.080
<v Speaker 2>and I mean good striving to be good in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral sense is to help people </v>

307
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.320
<v Speaker 2>develop as individuals and they are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really working.</v>

308
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:51.380
<v Speaker 2>And it's a thrill to be on this tour </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's all I hear and now no one</v>

309
00:16:51.721 --> 00:16:54.270
<v Speaker 2>talks to me about the political issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>or very,</v>

310
00:16:54.271 --> 00:16:59.271
<v Speaker 2>very rarely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all because I also think that </v>

311
00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:01.020
<v Speaker 2>the battle against collective is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

312
00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:04.890
<v Speaker 2>the battle against identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't to be had in the political realm.</v>

313
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.090
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's a secondary issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the way that you,</v>

314
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:14.420
<v Speaker 2>that you fight for the sovereignty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual is by getting your act </v>

315
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.320
<v Speaker 2>together and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and right locally,</v>

316
00:17:16.321 --> 00:17:21.321
<v Speaker 2>right where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and starting to take advantage of </v>

317
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:21.321
<v Speaker 2>everything that you have in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

318
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.890
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you do no harm that way.</v>

319
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.950
<v Speaker 2>All you do is make yourself less bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>

320
00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:30.450
<v Speaker 2>what's the harm in that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing</v>

321
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.040
<v Speaker 1>to some extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the battle here is almost one of</v>

322
00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:36.520
<v Speaker 1>statism or collectivism versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual liberty,</v>

323
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.720
<v Speaker 1>who's going to shape who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got the whole,</v>

324
00:17:40.721 --> 00:17:43.390
<v Speaker 1>the sort of push from the lift identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

325
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.440
<v Speaker 1>victimhood policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

326
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.060
<v Speaker 1>approaches and what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We owe these people what have you.</v>

327
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 1>So the state has control and shapes </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals and helps them forward.</v>

328
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the different view that says,</v>

329
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 1>now the state should be shaped by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who make up the state.</v>

330
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is a sum total of individuals </v>

331
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 1>who are Australian and they ought to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaping the public square,</v>

332
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.050
<v Speaker 1>not having the public square of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>local,</v>

333
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.010
<v Speaker 1>the public sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaping them.</v>

334
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.510
<v Speaker 2>The whole argument is about what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

335
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:18.230
<v Speaker 2>What's the primary unit of analysis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's everything.</v>

336
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.170
<v Speaker 2>What's the primary unit of analysis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the West,</v>

337
00:18:21.171 --> 00:18:26.171
<v Speaker 2>the primary unit of the analysis has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been the logos and that something like </v>

338
00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:29.831
<v Speaker 2>divine individual consciousness and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that ground that we developed our </v>

339
00:18:29.831 --> 00:18:33.220
<v Speaker 2>idea of individual sovereignty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizenship and you know,</v>

340
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 2>we don't talk about a citizen is someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who adopts the responsibilities of an </v>

341
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.850
<v Speaker 2>ethical being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a citizen.</v>

342
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.810
<v Speaker 2>We don't talk about that even in schools</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tell people that look,</v>

343
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.450
<v Speaker 2>the meaning in your life is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>found.</v>

344
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:52.260
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be proportionate to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree that you take responsibility for </v>

345
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.190
<v Speaker 2>positively shaping your experience and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience of the people around you.</v>

346
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.940
<v Speaker 2>And this isn't like be good in some in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some week,</v>

347
00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:03.020
<v Speaker 2>be inoffensive and harmless sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that at all.</v>

348
00:19:03.021 --> 00:19:06.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like get your spine straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your aggression integrated,</v>

349
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.110
<v Speaker 2>pick a heavy goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a heavy high goal,</v>

350
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:14.480
<v Speaker 2>something you can barely tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting and struggled along with it.</v>

351
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's where you'll find yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect and people know that it's,</v>

352
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.640
<v Speaker 2>it's fun to watch the working class guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>respond to this too,</v>

353
00:19:22.641 --> 00:19:24.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they know this.</v>

354
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Most of those guys worked like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

355
00:19:26.841 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 2>and they know that there's no ability in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and,</v>

356
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:34.540
<v Speaker 2>and there is and so it's well and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>also say,</v>

357
00:19:34.541 --> 00:19:39.541
<v Speaker 2>well that they're happy to come to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>lectures or even read the book because </v>

358
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm helping them find words to express </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that they already knew to be </v>

359
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.861
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those things that they know to be </v>

360
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:46.960
<v Speaker 2>true are the bedrock axioms of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

361
00:19:46.961 --> 00:19:51.961
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things we got right in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the West was the idea of the sovereign </v>

362
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 2>responsible individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the person with rights and certainly</v>

363
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:58.770
<v Speaker 2>not the person with rights granted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them by the state.</v>

364
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.740
<v Speaker 2>That's not part of the English common </v>
<v Speaker 2>law tradition.</v>

365
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.540
<v Speaker 2>You're the locus of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

366
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.620
<v Speaker 2>but only in some sense because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the locus of ultimate responsibility.</v>

367
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.040
<v Speaker 2>I guess part of what I've been trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell people is that there's no </v>

368
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.040
<v Speaker 2>difference between meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

369
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.050
<v Speaker 2>They're the same thing.</v>

370
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

371
00:20:18.211 --> 00:20:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

372
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 1>As I looked at that audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought to myself,</v>

373
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.410
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a lot of talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war in this country.</v>

374
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:30.411
<v Speaker 1>60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australians died out of a very small </v>

375
00:20:30.411 --> 00:20:33.000
<v Speaker 1>population in that horrendous event and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we celebrate the bribery those young and</v>

376
00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Zach's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call them who went off to college and</v>

377
00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:39.960
<v Speaker 1>then to the western front and were </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in some of the critical battles</v>

378
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:44.961
<v Speaker 1>of the first world war every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australians turnout and extraordinary </v>

379
00:20:44.961 --> 00:20:49.150
<v Speaker 1>numbers and more and more young </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australians turnout to have you like pay</v>

380
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:54.151
<v Speaker 1>tribute to the courage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I looked out across a wide </v>

381
00:20:54.151 --> 00:20:54.151
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

382
00:20:54.151 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people here that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>willingly,</v>

383
00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.880
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would choose to be with in the </v>

384
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.181
<v Speaker 1>trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are essentially people who want to </v>

385
00:21:03.181 --> 00:21:07.581
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To use the word you did just a moment </v>

386
00:21:07.581 --> 00:21:07.581
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noble to the best of their ability,</v>

387
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 1>but I live in a culture somehow that </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

388
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:11.290
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all nonsense.</v>

389
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:16.291
<v Speaker 1>That's not where you want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed to me that they'd deeply </v>

390
00:21:16.291 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 1>resenting and deeply keen to reject</v>

391
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.170
<v Speaker 2>that approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>

392
00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Speaker 2>here's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this idea that,</v>

393
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pushed very hard in the </v>

394
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.661
<v Speaker 2>universities by the postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neo Marxists types and before anybody </v>

395
00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:32.530
<v Speaker 2>objects I know perfectly well that </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically speaking,</v>

396
00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism in Neo Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neo Marxism aren't commensurate,</v>

397
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:39.770
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't stop people from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from joining them together.</v>

398
00:21:39.771 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Speaker 2>It theologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in any case,</v>

399
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.180
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that the West is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally an oppressive patriarchy,</v>

400
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.720
<v Speaker 2>which it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's partly an oppressive society </v>

401
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.630
<v Speaker 2>because every society is partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressive and flawed,</v>

402
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.270
<v Speaker 2>but fundamentally the West is not an </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressive patriarchy.</v>

403
00:21:56.271 --> 00:21:57.970
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you buy that line,</v>

404
00:21:57.971 --> 00:22:02.971
<v Speaker 2>then the next thing that comes along is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anything you do that contributes to</v>

405
00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:07.210
<v Speaker 2>that patriarchy is also oppressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyrannical.</v>

406
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:12.211
<v Speaker 2>And so that's extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>demoralizing for people who are trying </v>

407
00:22:12.211 --> 00:22:15.391
<v Speaker 2>to make their way in the world because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to hoist the </v>

408
00:22:15.391 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities up on their shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 2>and become competent,</v>

409
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.400
<v Speaker 2>contributing adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're criticized to death for </v>

410
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:23.400
<v Speaker 2>being oppressive tyrants.</v>

411
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.190
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a conflation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>competence with tyranny and you can't do</v>

412
00:22:27.191 --> 00:22:29.590
<v Speaker 2>anything to anyone that's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>demoralizing,</v>

413
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:31.610
<v Speaker 2>not you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that Nisha said,</v>

414
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.280
<v Speaker 2>if you want to punish someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punish them for their virtues.</v>

415
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 2>And so they're tired of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so demoralizing.</v>

416
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 2>You don't like it appeals to the part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>each man,</v>

417
00:22:41.231 --> 00:22:46.231
<v Speaker 2>let's say an each woman for that matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>who will wants to avoid responsibility </v>

418
00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:47.080
<v Speaker 2>because you can rationalize it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

419
00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:52.081
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to take responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that just makes me a tyrant and </v>

420
00:22:52.081 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 2>an an agent of the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a.</v>

421
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.850
<v Speaker 2>That sort of thing leads people down a </v>
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>

422
00:22:55.851 --> 00:22:59.210
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen that my friends and in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical practice it.</v>

423
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.240
<v Speaker 2>So instead we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like our culture has problems.</v>

424
00:23:02.241 --> 00:23:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Every culture does and it needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

425
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has to be awake so that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't slip at every level of our social </v>

426
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.810
<v Speaker 2>being into something like a blind </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism,</v>

427
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.910
<v Speaker 2>but the way that that happens is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>waking up and taking responsibility once</v>

428
00:23:16.911 --> 00:23:21.911
<v Speaker 2>again for for yourself and your family </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your community and that that and </v>

429
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:23.240
<v Speaker 2>that's noble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a word you never hear.</v>

430
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:28.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like a human being has to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>noble creature to withstand the tragedy </v>

431
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.790
<v Speaker 2>of existence without becoming corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so and and that,</v>

432
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.250
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that coal is to the best in people</v>

433
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.210
<v Speaker 1>and Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a.</v>

434
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.380
<v Speaker 1>We should wrap up on that part of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that evening night,</v>

435
00:23:39.381 --> 00:23:42.250
<v Speaker 1>but there was one other thing when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of questions on.</v>

436
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 1>There will full marks in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They land up 20 deep at eight.</v>

437
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:49.891
<v Speaker 1>We got to seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the seventh question was from a </v>

438
00:23:49.891 --> 00:23:53.140
<v Speaker 1>lady who asked a very intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>question about what parents bring to </v>

439
00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.731
<v Speaker 1>their children and and in particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>were they things that mothers bought to </v>

440
00:23:57.731 --> 00:24:02.111
<v Speaker 1>their children that women do best and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things that fathers bring to their</v>

441
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:05.060
<v Speaker 1>children that are best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gave a very rousing answer.</v>

442
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.300
<v Speaker 1>The issue of fathering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as I say,</v>

443
00:24:08.301 --> 00:24:13.301
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of men there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gather that your audience is the </v>

444
00:24:13.301 --> 00:24:15.941
<v Speaker 1>demographics of broadened out now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was a very young man centric </v>

445
00:24:15.941 --> 00:24:17.350
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

446
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.060
<v Speaker 1>and you hammered the importance as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard it.</v>

447
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll fathering.</v>

448
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

449
00:24:23.111 --> 00:24:26.300
<v Speaker 2>the empirical literature on this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely clear.</v>

450
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

451
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:31.130
<v Speaker 2>we have this idea that's being pushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward that all families are equal.</v>

452
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:35.270
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a grain of truth in that in that</v>

453
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.070
<v Speaker 2>people who are struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

454
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.170
<v Speaker 2>mightily to raise their children </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly are,</v>

455
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.330
<v Speaker 2>are worthy of respect whether they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>single or in couples,</v>

456
00:24:44.331 --> 00:24:48.330
<v Speaker 2>but the empirical literature is </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely clear that that stable,</v>

457
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:53.340
<v Speaker 2>intact father families with fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're produced children who do way </v>

458
00:24:53.461 --> 00:24:57.060
<v Speaker 2>better on almost every possible measure </v>
<v Speaker 2>and even more than that,</v>

459
00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 2>that in communities where fathers tend </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be at home or when you know,</v>

460
00:25:02.341 --> 00:25:05.700
<v Speaker 2>as part of the stable family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the communities themselves do better.</v>

461
00:25:05.701 --> 00:25:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Even those kids that don't have fathers </v>
<v Speaker 2>at home.</v>

462
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.350
<v Speaker 2>So the role of father there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably important.</v>

463
00:25:11.351 --> 00:25:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Then the question is what particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>role does a father plan?</v>

464
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:19.170
<v Speaker 2>I just had a good conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Warren Farrell about that and part of,</v>

465
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:24.670
<v Speaker 2>part of my research should indicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>that men are particularly useful in </v>

466
00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:29.080
<v Speaker 2>initiating rough and tumble play and </v>
<v Speaker 2>play with their children in general and </v>

467
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.230
<v Speaker 2>feral extended that by noting that men </v>
<v Speaker 2>could use the opportunity to play as a </v>

468
00:25:33.871 --> 00:25:37.260
<v Speaker 2>reward for delaying gratification among </v>
<v Speaker 2>their children.</v>

469
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.610
<v Speaker 2>That's a really big deal because one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things you have to do to help people</v>

470
00:25:41.611 --> 00:25:44.340
<v Speaker 2>matures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to teach them to delay gratification and</v>

471
00:25:44.341 --> 00:25:49.341
<v Speaker 2>to sustain attention and it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>men that the pleasure that children get </v>

472
00:25:50.281 --> 00:25:54.170
<v Speaker 2>in playing with their fathers rough and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tumble play,</v>

473
00:25:54.171 --> 00:25:59.171
<v Speaker 2>but other forms of play as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The primary reward that can be used to </v>

474
00:25:59.171 --> 00:26:03.881
<v Speaker 2>help children learn to make the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifices and regulate their impulses </v>

475
00:26:03.881 --> 00:26:04.820
<v Speaker 2>over the longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

476
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.420
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.380
<v Speaker 2>and I think fathers now of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>mothers can do this too,</v>

478
00:26:09.381 --> 00:26:11.090
<v Speaker 2>but I think fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

479
00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.740
<v Speaker 2>are because mothers are generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>charged with the fundamental care of </v>

480
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.210
<v Speaker 2>infants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a tension between that and </v>

481
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.940
<v Speaker 2>encouraging children to step forward out</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the world as,</v>

482
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.460
<v Speaker 2>as courageous beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

483
00:26:23.461 --> 00:26:25.650
<v Speaker 2>mothers are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very attached to their infants and their</v>

484
00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:30.651
<v Speaker 2>infants are very fragile and so often </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard for them to make the transition </v>

485
00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:34.101
<v Speaker 2>from primary security provider and </v>
<v Speaker 2>caregiver too forthright,</v>

486
00:26:34.351 --> 00:26:39.351
<v Speaker 2>encourager of adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's certainly something that </v>

487
00:26:39.351 --> 00:26:42.801
<v Speaker 2>fathers can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's better to construe life as an </v>

488
00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:46.221
<v Speaker 2>adventure rather than as an enterprise </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's there to make you feel secure or </v>

489
00:26:46.221 --> 00:26:51.081
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great adventure and a dangerous </v>

490
00:26:51.081 --> 00:26:52.320
<v Speaker 2>one at that because everyone's life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>at stake in this adventure,</v>

491
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were unbelievably tough creatures if we,</v>

492
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.910
<v Speaker 2>if we put ourselves out fully.</v>

493
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you said something very interesting </v>

494
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.870
<v Speaker 1>and very important than my view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talked about empirical evidence in </v>

495
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:07.830
<v Speaker 1>relation to the importance of fathering </v>
<v Speaker 1>empirical evidence,</v>

496
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:13.070
<v Speaker 1>reason evidenced based decision making </v>
<v Speaker 1>come thoughtful deliberation rather than</v>

497
00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:20.061
<v Speaker 1>emotion and other words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between thinking and </v>

498
00:27:20.061 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 1>feeling seems to me to be incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

499
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:22.830
<v Speaker 1>We should follow the facts the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>take us,</v>

500
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 1>but we're confronted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bought seems to be.</v>

501
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned and you said they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>related,</v>

502
00:27:26.971 --> 00:27:31.971
<v Speaker 1>but we taught them together a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural Marxism and postmodernism.</v>

503
00:27:32.011 --> 00:27:37.011
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me the cultural Marxist will</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberately distort the truth because </v>

504
00:27:37.011 --> 00:27:38.970
<v Speaker 1>of their agendas or hide the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of their agendas,</v>

505
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.430
<v Speaker 1>the postmodernists to fallen into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>trap of if you like,</v>

506
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.570
<v Speaker 1>moral relativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's good for you is true for you </v>

507
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:51.381
<v Speaker 1>and what's good familiar is true for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they really painting black is </v>

508
00:27:51.381 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 1>white and white is black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that a problem?</v>

509
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.380
<v Speaker 2>It's worse than that in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not even.</v>

510
00:27:56.381 --> 00:28:00.580
<v Speaker 2>What's true for you is true for you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's true for me is true for me.</v>

511
00:28:00.581 --> 00:28:05.380
<v Speaker 2>It's why it's true for your group is </v>
<v Speaker 2>only good for your group and what's true</v>

512
00:28:05.381 --> 00:28:10.150
<v Speaker 2>for my group is only good for my group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that sets this off often in group</v>

513
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.690
<v Speaker 2>conflict and in tribal sort of way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

514
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

515
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.960
<v Speaker 2>the real radical types who are swallowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>up by this ideology believe that science</v>

516
00:28:20.181 --> 00:28:23.720
<v Speaker 2>itself is nothing but a euro centric </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal construct.</v>

517
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dispense completely with the fact </v>

518
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.121
<v Speaker 2>that scientific discovery has given us </v>
<v Speaker 2>this incredible technological power </v>

519
00:28:31.121 --> 00:28:35.861
<v Speaker 2>that's lifted the entire world out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>abject poverty in a period of about a </v>

520
00:28:35.861 --> 00:28:40.170
<v Speaker 2>hundred and 50 years for that for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason that doesn't constitute </v>

521
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:44.291
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you bring up evidence that </v>

522
00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:47.270
<v Speaker 2>there's hand waving because the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who dispute this sort of thing rarely </v>

523
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.400
<v Speaker 2>know the details of the literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just write it off and say,</v>

524
00:28:49.401 --> 00:28:51.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole scientific enterprise,</v>

525
00:28:51.411 --> 00:28:56.411
<v Speaker 2>that's just part of the way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>eurocentric males dominate and destroy </v>

526
00:28:56.411 --> 00:28:58.550
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all power games for these people.</v>

527
00:28:58.551 --> 00:29:03.551
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reality at the bottom of it </v>

528
00:29:03.551 --> 00:29:03.890
<v Speaker 2>outside of the power gate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's uh,</v>

529
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.320
<v Speaker 2>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me,</v>

530
00:29:06.321 --> 00:29:06.850
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

531
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.440
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a viewpoint that leads inevitably</v>

532
00:29:09.441 --> 00:29:11.980
<v Speaker 2>to tribal conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

533
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:12.800
<v Speaker 2>That's what it does.</v>

534
00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be able to help me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was George Orwell who made a </v>

535
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.471
<v Speaker 1>reference to an ID being so utterly </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid that only a member of the </v>

536
00:29:21.471 --> 00:29:25.521
<v Speaker 1>intelligentsia could believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No sensible person in the street would </v>

537
00:29:25.521 --> 00:29:27.030
<v Speaker 1>accept it for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bit of there that night.</v>

538
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I would have thought you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>might've comment quite a a.</v>

539
00:29:30.591 --> 00:29:35.591
<v Speaker 1>I thought a very astute remark that </v>
<v Speaker 1>about something that an absolutely </v>

540
00:29:35.591 --> 00:29:38.150
<v Speaker 1>obvious and then you follow finished it </v>
<v Speaker 1>by saying you would have thought someone</v>

541
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.160
<v Speaker 1>in a university somewhere might've </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed now always been an academic at </v>

542
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.251
<v Speaker 1>any university in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have realized that I needed to </v>

543
00:29:47.251 --> 00:29:49.570
<v Speaker 1>wake up to myself because the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifted the roof off the place with their</v>

544
00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:54.571
<v Speaker 1>applause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are highly skeptical about what is </v>

545
00:29:54.571 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 1>happening now in our educational </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

546
00:29:56.141 --> 00:30:01.141
<v Speaker 1>There is no other way to read that </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience of a thousand decent </v>

547
00:30:01.141 --> 00:30:05.821
<v Speaker 1>Australians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are very skeptical about the value </v>

548
00:30:05.821 --> 00:30:07.600
<v Speaker 1>for money we're getting now out of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>tertiary education sector.</v>

549
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's the whole education sector to </v>

550
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.311
<v Speaker 2>I would say increasingly from </v>
<v Speaker 2>kindergarten all the way through </v>

551
00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:15.311
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

552
00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:18.701
<v Speaker 2>I think that I'm embarrassed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly embarrassed to be a member </v>

553
00:30:18.701 --> 00:30:22.001
<v Speaker 2>of the academy because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was reading this book today by a </v>

554
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Norwegian called progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good book.</v>

555
00:30:24.651 --> 00:30:29.651
<v Speaker 2>I would highly recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very straightforward and all it is is a </v>

556
00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:32.951
<v Speaker 2>compendium of empirical facts about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much better the world has been getting </v>

557
00:30:32.951 --> 00:30:35.780
<v Speaker 2>for the last hundred and 50 years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just every possible way,</v>

558
00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 2>300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people a week or being hooked to the </v>

559
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Electrical Power Grid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

560
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.660
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've reduced,</v>

561
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:46.990
<v Speaker 2>we've almost eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starvation throughout the world </v>

562
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:50.351
<v Speaker 2>except for political reasons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>starvation was a big problem in places </v>

563
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:52.640
<v Speaker 2>like Sweden and Italy less than 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

564
00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Orland</v>

565
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:59.610
<v Speaker 2>people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have access to fresh water and </v>

566
00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.520
<v Speaker 2>the fastest growing economies in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world are in Subsaharan Africa and we're</v>

567
00:31:01.521 --> 00:31:06.521
<v Speaker 2>just making progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Progress on every possible front and </v>

568
00:31:06.521 --> 00:31:09.970
<v Speaker 2>everything that people learn in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>education system seems to be associated </v>

569
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.400
<v Speaker 2>with the idea that human beings are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancerous growth on the planet,</v>

570
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:18.700
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to hell in a handbasket</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that we're going to burn ourselves </v>

571
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.170
<v Speaker 2>out in the next 50 years and dye and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be our fault too.</v>

572
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.150
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not the case.</v>

573
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.740
<v Speaker 2>It's simply not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

574
00:31:24.741 --> 00:31:29.450
<v Speaker 2>we have problems in front of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a deep anti human ethos that</v>

575
00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:31.010
<v Speaker 2>permeates that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

576
00:31:31.011 --> 00:31:34.670
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's still a hangover from our </v>
<v Speaker 2>pessimism from the Cold War,</v>

577
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everyone was truly terrified for</v>

578
00:31:37.701 --> 00:31:40.940
<v Speaker 2>about five decades that we were going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put everything to the torch,</v>

579
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe we still haven't really </v>

580
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:46.440
<v Speaker 2>recovered from that and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprising because it was brutal.</v>

581
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:51.970
<v Speaker 2>But reading this book on progress just </v>
<v Speaker 2>made me think again how badly we're </v>

582
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.291
<v Speaker 2>educated because people just don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much things are getting better and </v>

583
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:58.010
<v Speaker 2>why free markets are a huge part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Private properties,</v>

584
00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.040
<v Speaker 2>a huge part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's all associated with the idea </v>

585
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.280
<v Speaker 2>of the sovereign individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this really works.</v>

586
00:32:04.281 --> 00:32:07.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true that Europe got rich first,</v>

587
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.120
<v Speaker 2>but that's only been 100 most at most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 50 years.</v>

588
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Not even that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really since about 18,</v>

589
00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:16.010
<v Speaker 2>95 and Europe first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Man,</v>

590
00:32:16.011 --> 00:32:18.110
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no one's starving in China.</v>

591
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:23.260
<v Speaker 2>There's no one's starving in India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Southeast Asia has enough food and </v>

592
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Subsaharan Africa is growing like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we have these,</v>

593
00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 2>we have these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have our education system that </v>

594
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 2>trumpets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

595
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in a patriarchy that we should </v>

596
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 2>all identify with our tribal groups and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the right way of Inter,</v>

597
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:41.360
<v Speaker 2>of viewing history is victimizer group </v>
<v Speaker 2>against victim group.</v>

598
00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 2>So like it's no wonder people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptical of that.</v>

599
00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:47.480
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a profoundly anti western ethos.</v>

600
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.900
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is about the west is we </v>
<v Speaker 2>got the sovereign individual,</v>

601
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:52.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>

602
00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's the responsibility part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

603
00:32:54.671 --> 00:32:59.671
<v Speaker 2>Not the rights part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the rights rights are necessary </v>

604
00:32:59.671 --> 00:33:03.001
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only the rights are there so that </v>

605
00:33:03.001 --> 00:33:04.450
<v Speaker 2>you can express your responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

606
00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:05.590
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole point.</v>

607
00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's come to this issue of our own</v>

608
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.190
<v Speaker 1>almost loading now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have our own beliefs and values.</v>

609
00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm here in Australia now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're having a,</v>

610
00:33:16.591 --> 00:33:21.591
<v Speaker 1>an extraordinary to going on a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy and a lockable on us soil </v>

611
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:27.410
<v Speaker 1>philanthropists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cold Pole Ramsay who was very active in </v>

612
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.800
<v Speaker 1>the hill center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left a very large amount of money to me,</v>

613
00:33:28.801 --> 00:33:33.801
<v Speaker 1>might available to set up a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an academy for the study of Western </v>

614
00:33:33.801 --> 00:33:38.241
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wanted it to be done in one of </v>

615
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:38.241
<v Speaker 1>our major universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

616
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:41.580
<v Speaker 1>one of our most acclaimed universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended into deep negotiations.</v>

617
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

618
00:33:42.421 --> 00:33:47.421
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the education union got involved and </v>

619
00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:47.421
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

620
00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:47.421
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be terrible.</v>

621
00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:49.860
<v Speaker 1>It will be all about European audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>of European supremacy.</v>

622
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:55.170
<v Speaker 1>So that same university has sent us for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic studies for indigenous studies.</v>

623
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.790
<v Speaker 1>They are not particularly autonomous in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense that,</v>

624
00:33:58.791 --> 00:33:59.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university.</v>

625
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

626
00:34:00.151 --> 00:34:05.151
<v Speaker 1>they're not particularly controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems by the university they do </v>

627
00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:07.941
<v Speaker 1>pretty much their own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all now you can't have a center for </v>

628
00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:10.791
<v Speaker 1>the study of Western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will fill us up with all sorts of </v>

629
00:34:10.791 --> 00:34:13.020
<v Speaker 1>racist ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a supremacist ideas.</v>

630
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.680
<v Speaker 1>This is really worrying if we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand our own past.</v>

631
00:34:16.681 --> 00:34:17.820
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very wise,</v>

632
00:34:17.821 --> 00:34:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I Asian said here the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted them to understand,</v>

633
00:34:20.821 --> 00:34:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I Asian cultures understand you for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own first.</v>

634
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means to me it's just,</v>

635
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.090
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

636
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.240
<v Speaker 2>in some sense I'm less worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening with the universities </v>

637
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.260
<v Speaker 2>than I was because I think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to destroy themselves completely.</v>

638
00:34:37.261 --> 00:34:42.261
<v Speaker 2>If they continue the way they are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all that's going to happen is that </v>

639
00:34:42.261 --> 00:34:45.501
<v Speaker 2>people will take the genuine value in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wisdom of the past and presented an </v>

640
00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:50.000
<v Speaker 2>alternative forms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just steal it out from underneath </v>

641
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.340
<v Speaker 2>the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say to the philanthropist,</v>

642
00:34:50.341 --> 00:34:52.050
<v Speaker 2>if the universities don't want the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

643
00:34:52.051 --> 00:34:54.090
<v Speaker 2>then they should set up an institute on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own.</v>

644
00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:00.060
<v Speaker 2>That my very well be a good course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go directly to the people now,</v>

645
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for now.</v>

646
00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:03.100
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

647
00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.210
<v Speaker 2>if I want a lecture now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can lecture on anything I want,</v>

648
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.160
<v Speaker 2>whenever I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with no bureaucratic restrictions and I </v>

649
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.440
<v Speaker 2>have an audience of people who are only </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening because they want to listen.</v>

650
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:23.070
<v Speaker 2>That's where the university is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The university is where there's an </v>

651
00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.721
<v Speaker 2>audience of people who are only </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening because they want to be </v>

652
00:35:25.721 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 2>educated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the university.</v>

653
00:35:26.091 --> 00:35:27.380
<v Speaker 2>The buildings are irrelevant.</v>

654
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's build on that from Abbott because </v>

655
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.141
<v Speaker 1>what's in this debate unfold in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia were listening to academic </v>

656
00:35:35.141 --> 00:35:38.551
<v Speaker 1>signing on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we've got to preserve our </v>

657
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:38.551
<v Speaker 1>academic integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

658
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:42.800
<v Speaker 1>and we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here to protect our policies of </v>

659
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.280
<v Speaker 1>diversity and inclusiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

660
00:35:44.281 --> 00:35:49.281
<v Speaker 1>and all of those sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somebody topic pointed out actually </v>

661
00:35:49.281 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 1>we thought they were there to teach our </v>
<v Speaker 1>young people how to think for themselves</v>

662
00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 1>primarily</v>

663
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:57.140
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what they're there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's predicated on the idea </v>

664
00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.191
<v Speaker 2>that there are sovereign individuals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can actually think for </v>

665
00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:03.931
<v Speaker 2>themselves as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole idea here is that you're not </v>

666
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:04.690
<v Speaker 2>an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the member of a group.</v>

667
00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.420
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're serious about this.</v>

668
00:36:07.421 --> 00:36:10.930
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a trivial objection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fundamental objection.</v>

669
00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:12.580
<v Speaker 2>But I would also say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

670
00:36:12.581 --> 00:36:16.630
<v Speaker 2>there's a new testament statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't cast pearls before swine.</v>

671
00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.550
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that usually has to do with words,</v>

672
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:25.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't waste words of wisdom and those </v>

673
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.621
<v Speaker 2>who will not here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can also just look at it </v>

674
00:36:27.621 --> 00:36:30.111
<v Speaker 2>literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have pearls and you're trying to </v>

675
00:36:30.111 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 2>give them to someone and they won't take</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

676
00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.310
<v Speaker 2>then go find someone else to give the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pearls to.</v>

677
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:39.610
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to give money to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>university to do something great and </v>

678
00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:43.411
<v Speaker 2>they won't take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious that they don't want to do </v>

679
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:44.200
<v Speaker 2>anything great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so don't give them the money.</v>

680
00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:45.520
<v Speaker 2>It's the wrong people.</v>

681
00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

682
00:36:47.671 --> 00:36:50.430
<v Speaker 1>let's tease this out a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom.</v>

683
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.640
<v Speaker 1>You've mentioned the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like knowledge and accumulated </v>

684
00:36:57.361 --> 00:37:01.470
<v Speaker 1>cleverness and what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wisdom.</v>

685
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Surely there's a difference because to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go back again to Chatswood,</v>

686
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.020
<v Speaker 1>I would say a good chunk of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>there were not university educated,</v>

687
00:37:10.021 --> 00:37:13.740
<v Speaker 1>but they were smart and I would say like</v>
<v Speaker 1>odd side more.</v>

688
00:37:13.741 --> 00:37:14.730
<v Speaker 1>They will wise.</v>

689
00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.050
<v Speaker 2>They were striving for wisdom and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>where wisdom is.</v>

690
00:37:18.051 --> 00:37:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Wisdom is in the striving for wisdom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom is really act.</v>

691
00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Wisdom isn't a collection of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisdom is knowledge of how to conduct </v>

692
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.200
<v Speaker 2>yourself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a.</v>

693
00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.750
<v Speaker 2>it's an action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an existential issue.</v>

694
00:37:31.751 --> 00:37:32.630
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

695
00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.810
<v Speaker 2>it's truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As revealed in action.</v>

696
00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:35.890
<v Speaker 2>That's wisdom.</v>

697
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Where's the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how understands consequences?</v>

698
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in.</v>

699
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.950
<v Speaker 2>It's sophisticated in its understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>of consequences because you think,</v>

700
00:37:44.951 --> 00:37:46.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the consequences?</v>

701
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.400
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

702
00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:53.610
<v Speaker 2>there's the consequences for you now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you next week and next month and </v>

703
00:37:53.621 --> 00:37:58.621
<v Speaker 2>five years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the consequences are you and future </v>

704
00:37:58.621 --> 00:37:59.500
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's an iterated game,</v>

705
00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:04.890
<v Speaker 2>but the consequences are also for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>family now and in the future and for </v>

706
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.910
<v Speaker 2>your community now and in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wisdom is the ability to consider </v>

707
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.350
<v Speaker 2>all of those consequences as part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

708
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:16.120
<v Speaker 2>as part of what guides your vision and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your and your and your operations in the</v>

709
00:38:16.121 --> 00:38:18.370
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's character.</v>

710
00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:22.660
<v Speaker 2>And then nobility of character is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take all of those things into account.</v>

711
00:38:22.661 --> 00:38:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Simultaneously.</v>

712
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.920
<v Speaker 1>As I watched the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it to some extent,</v>

713
00:38:25.921 --> 00:38:27.820
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems you've got here see </v>
<v Speaker 1>us Louis.</v>

714
00:38:27.821 --> 00:38:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Mater of a pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pride,</v>

715
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:35.870
<v Speaker 1>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting in the way of people having </v>

716
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.121
<v Speaker 1>sufficient humility to recognize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nonsense say paddling is simply </v>

717
00:38:38.121 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 1>unconvincing in terms of what you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>call the pub test.</v>

718
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:46.980
<v Speaker 1>What would pass the pub test out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people have common sense and can </v>

719
00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 1>see when people are being real and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not being real?</v>

720
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to dispense with that.</v>

721
00:38:51.501 --> 00:38:56.501
<v Speaker 2>You just develop sufficient contempt for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the common person and then you don't </v>

722
00:38:56.501 --> 00:39:00.731
<v Speaker 2>have to worry about what they think and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's and that's when you confuse being</v>

723
00:39:01.011 --> 00:39:04.310
<v Speaker 2>smart with being wise and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

724
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between them.</v>

725
00:39:06.921 --> 00:39:09.650
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean intelligence is a great gift,</v>

726
00:39:09.651 --> 00:39:14.651
<v Speaker 2>but it can go terribly wrong and it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly turned into a kind of </v>

727
00:39:14.651 --> 00:39:15.170
<v Speaker 2>intellectual arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

728
00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:20.120
<v Speaker 2>That blinds you to do your own ignorance</v>
<v Speaker 2>and humility is the antidote to that and</v>

729
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:20.750
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

730
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.960
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the humility of the element of humility </v>

731
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.051
<v Speaker 2>there that's necessary is to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that what you don't know is more </v>

732
00:39:29.051 --> 00:39:30.740
<v Speaker 2>important than what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're an India log,</v>

733
00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you dispense with all that because you </v>

734
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:35.860
<v Speaker 2>already know everything.</v>

735
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reminded of that front I chatswood</v>

736
00:39:37.741 --> 00:39:39.120
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you've probably gathered,</v>

737
00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.840
<v Speaker 1>it had a big impact on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a powerful reminder to me that </v>

738
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.310
<v Speaker 1>familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems very important to recognize </v>

739
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:49.310
<v Speaker 1>that there's a sense in which the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn,</v>

740
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:53.661
<v Speaker 1>the more you realize you don't know him </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much and there's a lot more to </v>

741
00:39:53.661 --> 00:39:53.661
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

742
00:39:53.661 --> 00:39:53.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

743
00:39:53.851 --> 00:39:54.720
<v Speaker 2>in north,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

744
00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.210
<v Speaker 2>being with an audience can help with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that too because if you're,</v>

745
00:39:58.211 --> 00:40:03.211
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking to an audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can check to see if your message is </v>

746
00:40:03.211 --> 00:40:03.211
<v Speaker 2>being received.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

747
00:40:03.211 --> 00:40:07.881
<v Speaker 2>when you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well these people just can't understand </v>

748
00:40:07.881 --> 00:40:07.881
<v Speaker 2>what I have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

749
00:40:07.881 --> 00:40:08.580
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably can if you,</v>

750
00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:11.880
<v Speaker 2>if you formulated it carefully and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually talked to them.</v>

751
00:40:11.881 --> 00:40:16.881
<v Speaker 2>Individual individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I try to do in my </v>

752
00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:16.881
<v Speaker 2>lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not talking to the mob,</v>

753
00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking to the group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never talked to the group when I'm </v>

754
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:21.540
<v Speaker 2>lecturing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always pick people in the audience and</v>

755
00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:24.420
<v Speaker 2>speak right to them and they reflect the</v>
<v Speaker 2>audit.</v>

756
00:40:24.421 --> 00:40:29.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they reflect the entire group but they </v>

757
00:40:29.421 --> 00:40:30.480
<v Speaker 2>only reflect it because the group is </v>
<v Speaker 2>made up of individuals like them.</v>

758
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:36.590
<v Speaker 1>So let's just go back to something you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said earlier that it struck me as very </v>

759
00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:36.870
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is that young people don't want</v>

760
00:40:36.871 --> 00:40:40.320
<v Speaker 1>to be involved in political activism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get himself sorted out first.</v>

761
00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Many of those young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

762
00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I think one of behave nobly and help </v>
<v Speaker 1>build a better society,</v>

763
00:40:45.301 --> 00:40:50.301
<v Speaker 1>a strongest civic square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can put it that way and good on </v>

764
00:40:50.301 --> 00:40:50.301
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrific.</v>

765
00:40:50.301 --> 00:40:53.550
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very disillusioned with politics</v>

766
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:58.880
<v Speaker 1>and yet we have to govern our country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to make certain that the rules </v>

767
00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:58.880
<v Speaker 1>are set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

768
00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we maximize everybody's </v>

769
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.021
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to live in freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurity when young people have,</v>

770
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:11.390
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grounded themselves and feel ready to </v>

771
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.390
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody in the public square,</v>

772
00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:14.490
<v Speaker 1>what should they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can they make a difference?</v>

773
00:41:14.491 --> 00:41:16.320
<v Speaker 1>They want to make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I go about it?</v>

774
00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more more power to them I think.</v>

775
00:41:18.981 --> 00:41:19.970
<v Speaker 2>But I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

776
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:24.660
<v Speaker 2>they start by realizing they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and by starting to learn and if</v>

777
00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.050
<v Speaker 2>they learn and work and disciplined </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

778
00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.320
<v Speaker 2>the opportunities to expand will come </v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally because people will notice </v>

779
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:32.510
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

780
00:41:32.511 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you with competent people,</v>

781
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:39.221
<v Speaker 2>hyper competent people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you learn is that </v>

782
00:41:39.221 --> 00:41:40.220
<v Speaker 2>hyper competent people are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for young people to mentor.</v>

783
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

784
00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:44.700
<v Speaker 2>starving and hoping that someone will </v>
<v Speaker 2>come along who,</v>

785
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:49.940
<v Speaker 2>who has a lot of potential and then what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do is offer them a and </v>

786
00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.571
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep my eye out at the university and </v>

787
00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:56.430
<v Speaker 2>in my private work as well all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>for young people who've got something to</v>

788
00:41:56.431 --> 00:41:57.150
<v Speaker 2>contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

789
00:41:57.151 --> 00:41:58.530
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look like you're sharp.</v>

790
00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:00.960
<v Speaker 2>That's find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a task.</v>

791
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you go try this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they come back and knock it out of </v>

792
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:06.350
<v Speaker 2>the park and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

793
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:08.670
<v Speaker 2>that's good because I got 20 more things</v>
<v Speaker 2>here that need doing that I can't do.</v>

794
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.340
<v Speaker 2>I've got more opportunities that I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do with.</v>

795
00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the thing is is that if you </v>

796
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.161
<v Speaker 2>develop your confidence and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline yourself and you start to </v>

797
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:22.440
<v Speaker 2>make that manifest in any hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's even vaguely competent,</v>

798
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:24.690
<v Speaker 2>you'll have more opportunities come your</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

799
00:42:24.691 --> 00:42:28.980
<v Speaker 2>then you'll know what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all happened organically.</v>

800
00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.510
<v Speaker 2>So and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

801
00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.100
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the way of the world,</v>

802
00:42:32.101 --> 00:42:37.101
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that isn't happening in the </v>

803
00:42:37.101 --> 00:42:39.321
<v Speaker 2>organization that you're working with </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're working diligently and you </v>

804
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:42.861
<v Speaker 2>have your art together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's time to find a different </v>

805
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:42.861
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But generally speaking,</v>

806
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:45.540
<v Speaker 2>most organizations aren't that corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some are</v>

807
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.090
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that Australia is.</v>

808
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 1>We worship youth culture and why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I've noticed about</v>

809
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:58.061
<v Speaker 1>youth is that overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have the opportunity to tap into </v>

810
00:42:59.421 --> 00:43:01.880
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom of an older person to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentored,</v>

811
00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 1>they go looking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very keen for it.</v>

812
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the part of the human </v>

813
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:11.540
<v Speaker 2>proclivity to admire and imitate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

814
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.680
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that draws us forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't only learn by facts,</v>

815
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hardly learned by facts and all.</v>

816
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:22.280
<v Speaker 2>We learn by stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we learn by invitation and we,</v>

817
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.390
<v Speaker 2>they imitate those we admire and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>admire those who are competent.</v>

818
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:31.870
<v Speaker 2>And so if you find someone who knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you don't and can operate </v>

819
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:32.840
<v Speaker 2>effectively in the world in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would like to,</v>

820
00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:35.150
<v Speaker 2>but town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to admire them.</v>

821
00:43:35.151 --> 00:43:40.151
<v Speaker 2>And if you admire them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to open the door to have </v>

822
00:43:40.151 --> 00:43:40.151
<v Speaker 2>them mentor you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

823
00:43:40.151 --> 00:43:44.740
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really fundamental to human </v>

824
00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:44.740
<v Speaker 2>cognition and human psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

825
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.430
<v Speaker 2>It's the catalyst for human development </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're deeply imitative.</v>

826
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:55.030
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the thing that distinguishes us </v>

827
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.891
<v Speaker 2>from other creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps even more than even more </v>

828
00:43:56.891 --> 00:43:57.220
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally than language use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I watch you,</v>

829
00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.750
<v Speaker 2>if you know how to do something and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch you do it,</v>

830
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:05.050
<v Speaker 2>I can learn to do it without having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go through all the pain that you had to </v>

831
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.500
<v Speaker 2>go through to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a gift.</v>

832
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:09.840
<v Speaker 1>That's why history is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our personal history,</v>

833
00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you locked out family history.</v>

834
00:44:12.901 --> 00:44:17.901
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking the other day that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather made a mistake with my </v>

835
00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:20.310
<v Speaker 1>father on the farm that I'm determined </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can learn from that,</v>

836
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.010
<v Speaker 1>not to repeat with my own son on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>farm.</v>

837
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's of course the broader </v>

838
00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:28.570
<v Speaker 1>cultural history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I believe,</v>

839
00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.690
<v Speaker 1>and I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're not share this view,</v>

840
00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.720
<v Speaker 1>we to learn from our history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ought to learn from the horrors of </v>

841
00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.560
<v Speaker 1>collectivism in Soviet Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ought to be honest about it.</v>

842
00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:39.930
<v Speaker 1>We should teach our young people at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>

843
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 1>as we're honest about the watson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own cultural history,</v>

844
00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:45.710
<v Speaker 1>but we're also honest about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobility.</v>

845
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.960
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mighty pushed to abolish slavery.</v>

846
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Surely the greatest human rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement of all time.</v>

847
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.920
<v Speaker 1>We ought to know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's noble.</v>

848
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:56.880
<v Speaker 1>It was led by noble people who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggled against extraordinary odds for</v>

849
00:44:56.881 --> 00:44:57.750
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>

850
00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

851
00:44:59.031 --> 00:45:01.350
<v Speaker 2>And in slavery was a human universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an,</v>

852
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.800
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>miraculous attainment.</v>

853
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.530
<v Speaker 2>It's miraculous attainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

854
00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:11.980
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're supposed to be doing in new </v>

855
00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:11.980
<v Speaker 2>universities is separating the wheat </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the chaff,</v>

856
00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:17.080
<v Speaker 2>not dispensing with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As if it's because we don't want to put </v>

857
00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.790
<v Speaker 2>in the effort to discriminate and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easier.</v>

858
00:45:19.791 --> 00:45:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just all corrupt.</v>

859
00:45:21.141 --> 00:45:21.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

860
00:45:21.681 --> 00:45:26.681
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People aren't starving to death anymore </v>

861
00:45:26.681 --> 00:45:29.560
<v Speaker 2>and societies are increasingly free and </v>
<v Speaker 2>children are dying in the massive </v>

862
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.400
<v Speaker 2>numbers that they want to start in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are.</v>

863
00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:35.510
<v Speaker 2>People's life expectancy has doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like things are going pretty well.</v>

864
00:45:35.511 --> 00:45:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Don't mock it up and we need to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out why and we need to take stock of the</v>

865
00:45:40.311 --> 00:45:43.250
<v Speaker 2>things that we didn't pass that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong obviously,</v>

866
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.020
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone did in the past was wronged.</v>

867
00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.060
<v Speaker 2>That stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not thinking,</v>

868
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:55.270
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just reflexive resentment </v>

869
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.910
<v Speaker 2>masquerading as intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>superiority.</v>

870
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:58.640
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

871
00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been incredibly generous with </v>

872
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:04.720
<v Speaker 1>your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we wrap up,</v>

873
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.420
<v Speaker 1>let's just think through what would we </v>
<v Speaker 1>say in terms of people looking for </v>

874
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:07.950
<v Speaker 1>solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

875
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:13.150
<v Speaker 1>in academia and the media in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we,</v>

876
00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:18.820
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop the movement to reclaim what you </v>

877
00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:23.351
<v Speaker 1>called evidence based empirical decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidenced in decision making.</v>

878
00:46:23.631 --> 00:46:27.160
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to think again and stop being so,</v>

879
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:30.320
<v Speaker 1>so emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a place for emotion,</v>

880
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:31.880
<v Speaker 1>but there's a place for thinking.</v>

881
00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.580
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

882
00:46:33.581 --> 00:46:37.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're a university student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you want to note is that</v>

883
00:46:37.031 --> 00:46:41.380
<v Speaker 2>you're there to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think and to write and to read and to</v>

884
00:46:41.381 --> 00:46:46.381
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're there to do and the </v>

885
00:46:46.381 --> 00:46:48.481
<v Speaker 2>reason you're there to do that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that makes you incredibly </v>

886
00:46:48.481 --> 00:46:51.421
<v Speaker 2>competent because you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to communicate with people for the rest </v>

887
00:46:51.431 --> 00:46:54.400
<v Speaker 2>of your life and if your communication </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has the depth and clarity,</v>

888
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.640
<v Speaker 2>then you can see your way forward and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can bring other people aboard and </v>

889
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.430
<v Speaker 2>you can do great things and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>super.</v>

890
00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:05.820
<v Speaker 2>It's super useful to get a real liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts education because it can make you </v>

891
00:47:07.751 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Speaker 2>into a great communicator and thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to university,</v>

892
00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:16.860
<v Speaker 2>read the great books and you'll continue</v>
<v Speaker 2>confined professors who will teach you </v>

893
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.200
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what you're there to do.</v>

894
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.200
<v Speaker 2>You're there to spend four years </v>
<v Speaker 2>immersing yourself in the imitation of </v>

895
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.380
<v Speaker 2>the greatest people that our culture has</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced,</v>

896
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:24.940
<v Speaker 2>and if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

897
00:47:24.941 --> 00:47:29.941
<v Speaker 2>there were no great people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you might as well not through </v>

898
00:47:29.941 --> 00:47:32.881
<v Speaker 2>the university because university is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>storehouse of the thoughts of great </v>

899
00:47:32.881 --> 00:47:37.561
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then if you dispense with the whole </v>

900
00:47:37.561 --> 00:47:37.561
<v Speaker 2>notion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>notion of great,</v>

901
00:47:37.561 --> 00:47:39.010
<v Speaker 2>then maybe you're there to become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political activist,</v>

902
00:47:39.011 --> 00:47:44.011
<v Speaker 2>but that's not university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something else that's like an </v>

903
00:47:44.011 --> 00:47:45.340
<v Speaker 2>ideological cult and maybe that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

904
00:47:45.341 --> 00:47:45.730
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

905
00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:50.410
<v Speaker 2>and I mean you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll pay the price for that one way or</v>

906
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:54.730
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even as a university student,</v>

907
00:47:54.731 --> 00:47:58.030
<v Speaker 2>you have to take on the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 2>educating yourself to a large degree,</v>

908
00:47:58.031 --> 00:48:03.031
<v Speaker 2>but you have to decide that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want and that that's what you need </v>

909
00:48:03.031 --> 00:48:06.960
<v Speaker 2>in terms of your own personal life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a program that I developed with </v>

910
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 2>my colleagues called the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoring program.</v>

911
00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:14.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a self authoring Dotcom and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>helps people develop a vision for their </v>

912
00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 2>life along about six fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensions,</v>

913
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:22.300
<v Speaker 2>family education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental and physical health,</v>

914
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:27.010
<v Speaker 2>career avoidance of temptation like drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>and alcohol use.</v>

915
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tried to parse out a use of time,</v>

916
00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.130
<v Speaker 2>you productive and meaningful use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time outside of work.</v>

917
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:38.550
<v Speaker 2>We tried to parameterize a decent life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then to guide people through the </v>

918
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:42.811
<v Speaker 2>process of imagining what their life </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be like if they put it together </v>

919
00:48:42.811 --> 00:48:46.321
<v Speaker 2>properly and you need to develop a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision for your life and a sense of who </v>

920
00:48:46.321 --> 00:48:48.420
<v Speaker 2>you could be if you were the character </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could be and,</v>

921
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:51.580
<v Speaker 2>and thinking through that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulating it is actually part of,</v>

922
00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:55.630
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be part of a classic </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal arts education because the whole</v>

923
00:48:55.631 --> 00:48:58.660
<v Speaker 2>point of education apart from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical end,</v>

924
00:48:58.661 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 2>which is important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to produce a noble citizen.</v>

925
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:07.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to produce a bloody political </v>

926
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:07.500
<v Speaker 2>activists.</v>

927
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just,</v>

928
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:13.410
<v Speaker 2>we should keep in mind though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because even the chatswood that not a </v>

929
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:15.600
<v Speaker 2>lot of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them are not at university,</v>

930
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.230
<v Speaker 2>so they're not excluded either from in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any way,</v>

931
00:49:19.231 --> 00:49:21.450
<v Speaker 2>shape or form from broadening their </v>
<v Speaker 2>horizon.</v>

932
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>important things like working men,</v>

933
00:49:24.811 --> 00:49:26.880
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working people in general.</v>

934
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're working at a diner as a </v>

935
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:34.791
<v Speaker 2>waiter or they're they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're laying bricks or working a </v>

936
00:49:34.791 --> 00:49:36.430
<v Speaker 2>forklift or they're plumbers or these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are bloody important.</v>

937
00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:41.431
<v Speaker 2>They build the infrastructure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge difference between a </v>

938
00:49:41.431 --> 00:49:45.540
<v Speaker 2>craftsman who takes pride in caring what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing and contributes to his family</v>

939
00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:50.500
<v Speaker 2>and the community in that nobility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and someone who does a slipshod and</v>

940
00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 2>haphazard job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's great nobility and genuine work.</v>

941
00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:59.020
<v Speaker 2>So and I believe that you have just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much power,</v>

942
00:49:59.021 --> 00:50:00.850
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as much authority,</v>

943
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:06.030
<v Speaker 2>as much clout as a forthright and honest</v>
<v Speaker 2>working person as you do as an </v>

944
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 2>intellectual and I mean you can be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful as a working person if you.</v>

945
00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:15.840
<v Speaker 2>If you're diligent and honest and </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed and competent and aiming up </v>

946
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:20.910
<v Speaker 2>because it looked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that each person is the </v>

947
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Speaker 2>center of the world and you have what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need right at that center,</v>

948
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.750
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you're not intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're good with your hands and your</v>

949
00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:28.550
<v Speaker 2>practical and solid and people can rely </v>
<v Speaker 2>on you.</v>

950
00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:29.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

951
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:34.810
<v Speaker 2>that's a big deal because then when </v>
<v Speaker 2>their roof blows off in the middle of a </v>

952
00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:35.930
<v Speaker 2>storm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can call you up and you're there in</v>

953
00:50:35.931 --> 00:50:38.000
<v Speaker 2>an hour and you put the damn thing back </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and,</v>

954
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hooray for.</v>

955
00:50:39.741 --> 00:50:43.130
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things are important.</v>

956
00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:48.780
<v Speaker 2>And so there's great nobility and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>working class work as far as I'm </v>

957
00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:48.780
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

958
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

959
00:50:49.661 --> 00:50:50.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

960
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:53.690
<v Speaker 1>a fascinating conversation from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective and uh,</v>

961
00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:59.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tremendous to be able to interact </v>

962
00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.251
<v Speaker 1>with somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares passionately because that's </v>

963
00:51:01.251 --> 00:51:01.251
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're picking up.</v>

964
00:51:01.251 --> 00:51:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're actually trying to make a </v>

965
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.750
<v Speaker 1>difference for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

966
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.820
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing this unready disturbed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way in which some of these movements</v>

967
00:51:08.821 --> 00:51:11.130
<v Speaker 1>were seeing at the moment of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>divide men from women.</v>

968
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people getting men are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting this idea that somehow their </v>

969
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:17.970
<v Speaker 1>masculinity is toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

970
00:51:17.971 --> 00:51:18.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

971
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:23.990
<v Speaker 1>we don't say that when the brave young </v>
<v Speaker 1>French policeman takes a bullet for a </v>

972
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.340
<v Speaker 1>young woman and her daughter in a French</v>
<v Speaker 1>supermarket,</v>

973
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:31.290
<v Speaker 1>we celebrate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think that not all,</v>

974
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:34.830
<v Speaker 1>but the great majority of men want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>noble.</v>

975
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:39.630
<v Speaker 1>They know their floors as you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got to be honest about them.</v>

976
00:51:39.631 --> 00:51:44.631
<v Speaker 1>We all know to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also have a big part of them </v>

977
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:46.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe like that divine spike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to speak,</v>

978
00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:51.650
<v Speaker 1>divine spark that leads them to want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be responsible.</v>

979
00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Noble people.</v>

980
00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

981
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:59.390
<v Speaker 2>that's what women want from men too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unless they've been damaged in their </v>

982
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:01.290
<v Speaker 2>relationship so that they don't trust </v>
<v Speaker 2>men at all.</v>

983
00:52:01.291 --> 00:52:03.900
<v Speaker 2>And then ours are prepared to dispense </v>
<v Speaker 2>with all of them,</v>

984
00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:06.510
<v Speaker 2>which is helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

985
00:52:06.511 --> 00:52:11.511
<v Speaker 2>men and women need to call to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobility in each other and that is what </v>

986
00:52:11.511 --> 00:52:13.410
<v Speaker 2>they both want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you want a stalwart companion by</v>

987
00:52:13.411 --> 00:52:15.590
<v Speaker 2>your side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a man.</v>

988
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:20.591
<v Speaker 2>You want someone you can trust and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can rely on to help guide you and </v>

989
00:52:20.591 --> 00:52:23.580
<v Speaker 2>and and care for you and to care for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your children and all of that,</v>

990
00:52:23.581 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 2>and to make a life with if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>

991
00:52:25.761 --> 00:52:28.630
<v Speaker 2>you want a man that you can rely on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to help you,</v>

992
00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:33.940
<v Speaker 2>help you deal with the children and with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the excess fragility that you have </v>

993
00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:34.870
<v Speaker 2>because of your pronounced roll and </v>
<v Speaker 2>record production,</v>

994
00:52:34.871 --> 00:52:39.560
<v Speaker 2>and that is what we want and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>denigrate and to split men and women.</v>

995
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:44.560
<v Speaker 2>A part is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is too damaged humanity itself because </v>

996
00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.680
<v Speaker 2>it's not like we're all men or all </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

997
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:51.040
<v Speaker 2>I have sisters and a mother and a white </v>
<v Speaker 2>and women have husbands and sons and </v>

998
00:52:52.071 --> 00:52:56.150
<v Speaker 2>fathers were not separate and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 2>split us apart on,</v>

999
00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.120
<v Speaker 2>on the basis of sex is well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1000
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:00.240
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1001
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:05.280
<v Speaker 2>it's this pathological as a suicidal </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulse or a murderous impulse or a </v>

1002
00:53:05.481 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 2>genocidal impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that's good.</v>

1003
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:12.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're a hell of a lot better off </v>

1004
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.490
<v Speaker 2>than we were and things are getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>better and we can do better yet.</v>

1005
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a way better story.</v>

1006
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.310
<v Speaker 1>We'll look forward very much to having </v>
<v Speaker 1>you back on these shores.</v>

1007
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Very nice speaking with you again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for the opportunity.</v>

1008
00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Thanks so much.</v>
