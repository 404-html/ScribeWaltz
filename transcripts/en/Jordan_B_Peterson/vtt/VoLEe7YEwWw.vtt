<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back on February 20th I announced that I</v>

3
00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:06.424
<v Speaker 2>was going to go to 12 different cities </v>
<v Speaker 2>in North America and talk about my new </v>

4
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:13.330
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 rules for life and a variety of other</v>

5
00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:14.164
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we arranged theaters and put </v>

6
00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:21.340
<v Speaker 2>those tickets up for sale and they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>proved very popular.</v>

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.233
<v Speaker 2>I did the first one this week on Sunday </v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York at the beacon theater to an </v>

8
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 2>audience of about 3000 people and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to go very well.</v>

9
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 2>The consequence of that is that I'm now </v>
<v Speaker 2>announcing another 20 cities and this is</v>

10
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:38.134
<v Speaker 2>the video to make that announcement.</v>
