WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And I'm so sorry.</v>

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:03.783
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>so momentarily we're going to return to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic story</v>

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.220
<v Speaker 1>and I want to talk to you today about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how your brain organizes your</v>

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>perceptions and then I want to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about how that's represented in</v>

6
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:28.371
<v Speaker 1>hematology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First thing I'd like to point out is</v>

7
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>that we talked about the difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between Darwinian,</v>

8
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>the Newtonian viewpoints a while back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the,</v>

9
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.690
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

10
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>one claim that you might make if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were a Darwinian is that whatever your</v>

11
00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:48.460
<v Speaker 1>brain is adapted to his reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

12
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean that seems to me to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>central claim of Darwinian evolution is</v>

13
00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:58.681
<v Speaker 1>that you can't define reality any more</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately than that which selects.</v>

14
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to tell you about how I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain is organized and then I want</v>

15
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 1>to show you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that the way fundamental</v>

16
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>narratives work can be mapped onto that</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain structure.</v>

17
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that implies that there's</v>

18
00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:28.840
<v Speaker 1>something right about the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives because otherwise why would</v>

19
00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 1>they map onto the brain structures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have evolved to adapt as to the</v>

20
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>environment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't.</v>

21
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.270
<v Speaker 1>People think about reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know subjective terms and they think</v>

22
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 1>about it as decomposable into tiny sub</v>
<v Speaker 1>units.</v>

23
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>But I think that that's a limited</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint,</v>

24
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>a powerful but limited viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's much more realistic to</v>

25
00:01:55.271 --> 00:02:00.271
<v Speaker 1>assume that whatever reality is is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a continual interplay,</v>

26
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 1>a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex patterns.</v>

27
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.193
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

28
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you could make the case that</v>
<v Speaker 1>those patterns are ultimately made out</v>

29
00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:11.620
<v Speaker 1>of particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's even,</v>

30
00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:16.621
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly true because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles have to be arrayed in space.</v>

31
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of the atomic theory is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's not just particles,</v>

32
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 1>subatomic particles and atomic</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>

33
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>but if they're arrayed in space and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are rate in space,</v>

34
00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:30.670
<v Speaker 1>that means the manner in which they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>are rate can be informative.</v>

35
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you reduce the phenomena to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>particle without taking into account the</v>

36
00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:41.770
<v Speaker 1>patterning of the array of particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's levels and levels and</v>

37
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:46.630
<v Speaker 1>levels of information that you lose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those information that those levels of</v>

38
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 1>information are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may not be relevant for our</v>

39
00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:55.060
<v Speaker 1>physical understanding of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the makeup of atomic and subatomic</v>

40
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>particles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're definitely relevant to</v>

41
00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>whether or not we can walk across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

42
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.130
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're related to reality properly,</v>

43
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>the kind of information that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>processing is precisely the kind of</v>

44
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>information that allows you to cross the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street properly and to do all the other</v>

45
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>things during your day and your weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your months that you have to in</v>

46
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.290
<v Speaker 1>order to stay alive and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

47
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>and fundamentally in some sense to</v>
<v Speaker 1>propagate.</v>

48
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

49
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>so we'll start with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological argument.</v>

50
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Now we've already established the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these little frames of reference or</v>

51
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>maps or stories or whatever you call</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

52
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll call them stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think from here on in our little goal</v>

53
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>directed units.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are units of conception and</v>

54
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>emotion and perception and behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their little subpersonalities and</v>

55
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>there's some personality has an initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting point and a destination point.</v>

56
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And then it can implement behaviors to</v>
<v Speaker 1>transform the starting point into the</v>

57
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>destination point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

58
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what forms these little</v>

59
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is very complex,</v>

60
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>but one answer is fundamental motivate</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>

61
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>And so I arranged the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations on this particular</v>

62
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.470
<v Speaker 1>diagram pointed out that you can roughly</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider motivations as those that</v>

63
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>maintain you and those that propagate</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

64
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Now it's just a heuristic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a way of thinking about it.</v>

65
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under self maintenance there's thermal</v>

66
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 1>regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirst,</v>

67
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 1>hunger and elimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of other things as</v>

68
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those will do for the time being.</v>

69
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>And then under self propagation there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>affiliate of desire and sexual desire.</v>

70
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing that's quite interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all this is that you know,</v>

71
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.700
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are brain structures that underlie</v>

72
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 1>these fundament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manifestation of these fundamental</v>

73
00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people tend to think about them</v>

74
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>either as motivations or emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a use and other</v>

75
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 1>useful heuristic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that you could say roughly speaking,</v>

76
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>that a motivation pops up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an entire frame of reference and an</v>

77
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 1>emotion tends to orient you within that</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame of reference.</v>

78
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.900
<v Speaker 1>But that's only a conceptual</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplification because what you see when</v>

79
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>you look at the actual brain structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like there isn't an emotion</v>

80
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a bunch of micro units in the</v>

81
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

82
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>And each of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are separable micro units for</v>

83
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>different emotions and different</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations and they don't necessarily</v>

84
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Speaker 1>have that much in common in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their locale except that they tend to be</v>

85
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:45.160
<v Speaker 1>relatively deep in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some are hypothalamic and summer in</v>

86
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 1>the Amygdala in summer in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>periaqueductal gray,</v>

87
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be responsible for pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>responses and so we can classify things</v>

88
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>as motivations and emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't map one to one on the</v>

89
00:05:55.871 --> 00:06:00.871
<v Speaker 1>underlying brain structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think what we'll do with regards</v>

90
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>to talking about the brain is we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>start from the bottom up and it's</v>

91
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>appropriate to start from the bottom up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are more dependent on your</v>

92
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>ancient brain structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you are on your modern brain</v>

93
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>structures in that if you damage your</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern brain structures,</v>

94
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>and I mean relatively modern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the ones that have really</v>

95
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>evolved in great detail over the last 2</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years,</v>

96
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>the cortical cap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular the prefrontal Cortex,</v>

97
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the visual Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you damage that,</v>

98
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 1>you can pretty much go on.</v>

99
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Now you know you're going to have one</v>
<v Speaker 1>impairment or another impairment,</v>

100
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>but you can still stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

101
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>there are structures that are lower down</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you damage,</v>

102
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 1>that's the end of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

103
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>the ascending reticular activating</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

104
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>which is the thing that wakes you up</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're asleep at night,</v>

105
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a noise occurs that shouldn't</v>

106
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:49.600
<v Speaker 1>occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

107
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be the activating center for</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

108
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way deep down in the brain.</v>

109
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>It's way down at the top of the spinal</v>
<v Speaker 1>cord,</v>

110
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you twist your head in a car</v>

111
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 1>accident a little bit too roughly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you shear off they ascending fibers,</v>

112
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 1>then you're in a coma permanently and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing can wake you up.</v>

113
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

114
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 1>that consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we think of again,</v>

115
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our tendency is to think about that as a</v>

116
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 1>function of the higher cortical systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>is dependent completely on something</v>

117
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>that's unbelievably ancient.</v>

118
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.801
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>and it begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well at exactly what level of neuronal</v>

120
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 1>complexity do you have to be before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some consciousness.</v>

121
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the relationship between</v>

122
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and neuronal structure is</v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely complex.</v>

123
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:41.261
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have very neurone neuron heavy</v>

124
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 1>structures in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cerebellum,</v>

125
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:47.430
<v Speaker 1>which has about as many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a very rough outer coding like</v>

126
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>the cortex and it has about as many</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurons as the cortical she does.</v>

127
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.730
<v Speaker 1>And yet you can take it out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't seem to show any impairment</v>

128
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

129
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.621
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:07:57.621 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 1>they get a tax sick and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>control their behavior that well.</v>

131
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>They have a hard time guiding it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seems to be more or less it now</v>

132
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>it isn't because there is other things</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cerebellum does,</v>

133
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:12.401
<v Speaker 1>but my point is you can have massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>massively neuron heavy structures that</v>

134
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>seem to be related in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in very minimal ways to our experience</v>

135
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness.</v>

136
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your autonomic nervous system is sort</v>

137
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:21.500
<v Speaker 1>of like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of neurons in your</v>

138
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>autonomic nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's a mistake to say that</v>

139
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>we're precisely conscious of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomic nervous system,</v>

140
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 1>although now and then we're conscious of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its outputs,</v>

141
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it governs our,</v>

142
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>the operation of our organs and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are so complex that we</v>

143
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 1>aren't allowed to mess with them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious beings,</v>

144
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's not conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then while somehow some neurons are</v>

145
00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:44.660
<v Speaker 1>conscious and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>

146
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>we don't know anything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

147
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>We really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a clue.</v>

148
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:53.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's probably because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulating the question wrong.</v>

149
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people are people who are</v>

150
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 1>materialists reductionists and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that consciousness is an</v>

151
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>emergent property of the underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuronal neuronal function.</v>

152
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that philosophy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's predicated on the assumption</v>

153
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 1>that they understand what the matter is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's making up that neuronal</v>

154
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 1>substrate.</v>

155
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.260
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you that by the time we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were able to reduce consciousness to its</v>

156
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 1>underlying material structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll think of whatever matter is in a</v>

157
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>way that's completely different than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way we think of it now.</v>

158
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there might be an eventual reduction,</v>

159
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time there's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transformation of the theories.</v>

160
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that we don't understand</v>

161
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 1>material that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly because when you go down</v>

162
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:35.820
<v Speaker 1>into the underlying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:39.210
<v Speaker 1>the tiny underlying substructures at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subatomic level,</v>

164
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 1>it behaves in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very peculiar manner.</v>

165
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

166
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all bets are off with regards to</v>

167
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also does seem to be something</v>

168
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 1>that's likely very ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:52.770
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 1>there are people who've attributed</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness to insects.</v>

171
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Insects by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to go out of their way to take</v>

172
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting.</v>

173
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Flyer Garrett for example,</v>

174
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 1>is a mushroom that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the famous red and white mushroom</v>

175
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:11.400
<v Speaker 1>that you always see in fairy tales and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Super Mario brothers and like it pops</v>

176
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:14.520
<v Speaker 1>up everywhere and flies will come and</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a bite of it.</v>

177
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 1>And then they fall unconscious beside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mushroom and they stay there for</v>

178
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 1>like 10 or 15 minutes and then they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

179
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:23.760
<v Speaker 1>But they'll go eat it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And reindeer really like them too.</v>

180
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:25.510
<v Speaker 1>And they get blitzed out of their mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>on m,</v>

181
00:10:25.511 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Anita miscarriers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>

182
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

183
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence for the desire to</v>
<v Speaker 1>transform states of consciousness way,</v>

184
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 1>way down in the animal kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way farther than you'd think.</v>

185
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows and then you think,</v>

186
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big brain is necessary,</v>

187
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 1>but you consider something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

188
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Irene Pepperberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

189
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.830
<v Speaker 1>African gray parrot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which died a couple of years ago,</v>

190
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:53.880
<v Speaker 1>a famous animal which could speak better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a three year old kid,</v>

191
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 1>four year old kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had a good,</v>

192
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.310
<v Speaker 1>good vocabulary.</v>

193
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 1>More than 500 words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it could put together meaningful</v>

194
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:01.890
<v Speaker 1>phrases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could speak better than a chimpanzee.</v>

195
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.090
<v Speaker 1>They use sign language of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like this was one smart bird.</v>

196
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 1>And if they think about a bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

197
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.370
<v Speaker 1>it has no brain a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a brain like this big.</v>

198
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.520
<v Speaker 1>And now I know a bird isn't very big and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually makes a difference.</v>

199
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that that much intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be packed into that small an area</v>

200
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 1>means as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't really understand very</v>

201
00:11:23.071 --> 00:11:28.071
<v Speaker 1>much about how the brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we do understand some things and</v>

202
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>most of the things we understand have</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually been discovered by animal</v>

203
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:33.510
<v Speaker 1>experimentalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

204
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:35.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a useful thing to know because</v>

205
00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>of course there's lots of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think that animal experimentation</v>

206
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:41.100
<v Speaker 1>is a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or that we could substitute computer</v>

207
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course a Spec,</v>

208
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly idiotic theory.</v>

209
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously if we had accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer models,</v>

210
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:50.130
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't need to do the animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimentation,</v>

211
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're not going to build a computer</v>

212
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 1>model that's better than our current</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>

213
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 1>at least not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet.</v>

214
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>We May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may in the future.</v>

215
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of the basic elements,</v>

216
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 1>the basic structures that are producing</v>
<v Speaker 1>these little subpersonalities,</v>

217
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

218
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.270
<v Speaker 1>as the output of fundamental biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems are their motivations or</v>

219
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 1>emotions and the structure that appears</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be most responsible for this sort of</v>

220
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least initially is the hypothalamus.</v>

221
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>And I should show you a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus,</v>

222
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.660
<v Speaker 1>just so you kind of have a sense of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

223
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not very big and you see in this</v>

224
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 1>diagram that it sits right on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

225
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 1>of the spinal cord and the base part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>

226
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's just that little bitty area</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

227
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:38.951
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:42.160
<v Speaker 1>it looks from the diagram to be maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

229
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 1>1% of the entire brain mass or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

230
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:48.220
<v Speaker 1>And I think I mentioned to you before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you take a cat and you take all</v>

231
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:50.470
<v Speaker 1>of its brain off except the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>

232
00:12:50.471 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's a female cat in a</v>

233
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 1>restricted environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can pretty much live a cat life</v>

234
00:12:57.101 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 1>except that it's hyper exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I do think is quite remarkable.</v>

235
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you'd think it would just lay</v>

236
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:04.440
<v Speaker 1>there passively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right with,</v>

237
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 1>since it doesn't have a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

238
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus,</v>

239
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 1>and I'll show you some more pictures</v>
<v Speaker 1>here about types.</v>

240
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:15.070
<v Speaker 1>They all must.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a rat hypothalamus and this</v>

241
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:19.930
<v Speaker 1>is a diagram from Larry Swanson who's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real genius and well worth reading,</v>

242
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.450
<v Speaker 1>although very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

243
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.740
<v Speaker 1>he's a developmental neuro anatomist if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember correctly.</v>

244
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And he's interested in how the brain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>folds across the course of feet of fetal</v>

245
00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>development and all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

246
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that by doing that in part you</v>

247
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 1>can track the evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also understand the</v>

248
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:39.880
<v Speaker 1>relationship between one brain part in</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

249
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Now what you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see all those little subunits of the</v>

250
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

251
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.600
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're um,</v>

252
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.670
<v Speaker 1>indicated in orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green and black.</v>

253
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.720
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing that you can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the hypothalamus is not one</v>

254
00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:57.040
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of,</v>

255
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.570
<v Speaker 1>what do you call those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

256
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Ganglia I think is the correct name for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamic sub organs.</v>

257
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And so it's called a hypothalamus sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of for convenience sake.</v>

258
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

259
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 1>you can identify it anatomically and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a good shorthand for,</v>

260
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rough description of the,</v>

261
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.830
<v Speaker 1>of the macro structure of the brain.</v>

262
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.480
<v Speaker 1>But of course the problem with the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

263
00:14:19.481 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

264
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:24.070
<v Speaker 1>it's pattern one at this level and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern to at this level it's pattern</v>

265
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:25.540
<v Speaker 1>three at this level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

266
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 1>you can go a long ways down before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>run out of complexity and a cell is an</v>

267
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.320
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably complicated thing and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

268
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how many of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your brain I think,</v>

269
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly what the latest</v>
<v Speaker 1>estimates are,</v>

270
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:42.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's in the hundreds of billions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of those cells is like,</v>

271
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.830
<v Speaker 1>it's complex as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a factory in some,</v>

272
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 1>like a really complex factory and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>full.</v>

273
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.920
<v Speaker 1>They're full of these little molecular</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines that are doing things that are</v>

274
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.960
<v Speaker 1>so complicated and amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't believe it when you,</v>

275
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 1>computer animations of some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures and operation there.</v>

277
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.730
<v Speaker 1>The complexity of what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:04.490
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take the DNA molecule apart and men</v>

279
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.060
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

280
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 1>And then to rebuild it little bit by</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit and to do error correction at</v>

281
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:11.540
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I,</v>

282
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.910
<v Speaker 1>it just boggles the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

283
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.250
<v Speaker 1>you cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot see how you can possibly</v>

284
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:18.260
<v Speaker 1>account for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using a straight,</v>

285
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.140
<v Speaker 1>sort of Newtonian deterministic model</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

286
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of clockwork behavior.</v>

287
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:26.060
<v Speaker 1>The stuff is so sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:29.300
<v Speaker 1>it looks more like advanced robotics</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it does like the,</v>

289
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:31.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interaction of tiny little</v>

290
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:33.830
<v Speaker 1>molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are molecules that work with the</v>

291
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 1>DNA that can walk and as they walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they carry other molecules.</v>

292
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:42.050
<v Speaker 1>And not only can they think things walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can walk over obstacles.</v>

293
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

294
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.070
<v Speaker 1>they're like made out of 10 molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

295
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

296
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just beyond belief.</v>

297
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of these little nucleus nuclei</v>

298
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they're called,</v>

299
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:55.610
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclei in the hypothalamus.</v>

300
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 1>They're all doing slightly different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

301
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:00.530
<v Speaker 1>So there's subserving while they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>radically different things,</v>

302
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>although they have a commonality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

303
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 1>And so roughly what you could say is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one half of the hypothalamus is</v>

304
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:12.290
<v Speaker 1>devoted to popping up these little</v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities that are devoted to</v>

305
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

306
00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:15.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

307
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Speaker 1>satiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the satisfaction of fundamental</v>

308
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 1>biological requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

309
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious what a fundamental</v>

310
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:27.860
<v Speaker 1>biological requirement is because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a heuristic.</v>

311
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:30.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not a club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a category,</v>

312
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.420
<v Speaker 1>but we can agree it's a fuzzy category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can agree on some of its</v>

313
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>contents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so of course thirst and hunger and</v>

314
00:16:37.731 --> 00:16:40.790
<v Speaker 1>the need to breathe would be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we might also add pain and</v>

315
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 1>sexual desire and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the need for play,</v>

316
00:16:45.201 --> 00:16:49.040
<v Speaker 1>although that's a separate circuit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not mediated by hypothalamic</v>

317
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.320
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a different circuit for play,</v>

318
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.341
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slash,</v>

319
00:16:52.341 --> 00:16:53.174
<v Speaker 1>affiliation.</v>

320
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but roughly speaking,</v>

321
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:02.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what an animal basically chases and</v>

322
00:17:02.361 --> 00:17:07.361
<v Speaker 1>requires on a day to day and week to</v>
<v Speaker 1>week basis is mediated in large part by</v>

323
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:11.000
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hypothalamus is also a crucial</v>

324
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:16.060
<v Speaker 1>nexus in the brain for identifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the body and then</v>

325
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:19.100
<v Speaker 1>telling the brain what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

326
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus is the thing that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hungry and the thing that makes you</v>

327
00:17:21.981 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 1>thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it does that because it monitors</v>

328
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.650
<v Speaker 1>levels of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

329
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.070
<v Speaker 1>of substances such as sugar in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream.</v>

330
00:17:29.071 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also,</v>

331
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which you're hydrated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

334
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustain tiny little bits of damage to</v>

335
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:42.260
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus with unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme consequences.</v>

336
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get unlucky,</v>

337
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:49.450
<v Speaker 1>you can develop hyperphosphatemia or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't remember the technical for it,</v>

338
00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:53.280
<v Speaker 1>but uncontrollable thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if that part of your hypothalamus</v>

339
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:56.400
<v Speaker 1>is damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just can't keep you away from</v>

340
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:57.170
<v Speaker 1>water supplies.</v>

341
00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.060
<v Speaker 1>He'll just drink and drink and drink and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink and drink and drink and drink</v>

342
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:02.280
<v Speaker 1>until you drown and you can't control</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

343
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.180
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamus is no joke in</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperphagic has the same thing except in</v>

344
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:08.520
<v Speaker 1>relationship to food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

345
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 1>and on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been reports of people who've</v>

346
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.120
<v Speaker 1>developed all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew a guy in Montreal who,</v>

347
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 1>who used to work at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name was Frank Irvin,</v>

348
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.450
<v Speaker 1>and he did some of the earliest studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

349
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.450
<v Speaker 1>in the world on the physiology of</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent crime.</v>

350
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 1>And frank had identified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

351
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.410
<v Speaker 1>the role of epilepsy as a progenitor to</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent crimes.</v>

352
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:18:32.401 --> 00:18:35.250
<v Speaker 1>the defensive rage circuit as part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus.</v>

354
00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:36.720
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're unlucky,</v>

355
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you can have a particular form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy that will activate the</v>

356
00:18:40.471 --> 00:18:43.130
<v Speaker 1>defensive rage system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew someone who had,</v>

357
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.560
<v Speaker 1>who had a seizure condition like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they get uncontrollably</v>

358
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:50.064
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>

359
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Now this guy is quite an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

360
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.400
<v Speaker 1>So it first happened to him when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 18 and he was out drinking in a</v>

361
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:01.590
<v Speaker 1>bar and alcohol lowers your seizure</v>
<v Speaker 1>threshold.</v>

362
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:07.140
<v Speaker 1>So it was out drinking in a bar and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden he got up and tore his shirt</v>

363
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:11.370
<v Speaker 1>off and then his friends were coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was in an aggressive stance and</v>

364
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:15.030
<v Speaker 1>backed into the corner and his friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>were coming close to him and he told</v>

365
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:17.550
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go away or I'll hit you.</v>

366
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a very well socialized person.</v>

367
00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:24.480
<v Speaker 1>So I think what happened is that he went</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this defensive rage state,</v>

368
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.990
<v Speaker 1>but because he was so well socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could tell people to stay that way,</v>

369
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.840
<v Speaker 1>stay away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he couldn't stop himself from</v>

370
00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:33.240
<v Speaker 1>hitting them and attacking them if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>got close enough.</v>

371
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.960
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe at that point he slapped a</v>

372
00:19:36.961 --> 00:19:40.170
<v Speaker 1>police officer who came to rescue them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they took him to the hospital.</v>

373
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:45.170
<v Speaker 1>And on the way there he hit his fingers</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the hood of the car and put</v>

374
00:19:45.541 --> 00:19:48.150
<v Speaker 1>dents in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he got up to the hospital,</v>

375
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.430
<v Speaker 1>now I don't remember the particulars of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

376
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:54.750
<v Speaker 1>but he picked up a kidney bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like an enamel covered steel</v>

377
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:57.510
<v Speaker 1>ball and twisted it in an in a figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

378
00:19:57.511 --> 00:19:58.344
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

379
00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.970
<v Speaker 1>try that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so easy.</v>

380
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.590
<v Speaker 1>So in the next time it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in another bar.</v>

381
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.680
<v Speaker 1>And so what Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hypothesis was then was that</v>

382
00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 1>someone had spiked his alcohol with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of drug gay,</v>

383
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:13.560
<v Speaker 1>but he went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was never demonstrated.</v>

384
00:20:13.561 --> 00:20:16.320
<v Speaker 1>But he got off of all that because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>had no record.</v>

385
00:20:16.321 --> 00:20:20.040
<v Speaker 1>He was a perfectly peaceful person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next time it happened,</v>

386
00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:22.460
<v Speaker 1>he was in another bar and he did the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

387
00:20:22.461 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 1>He backed into corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripped off his shirt.</v>

388
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.130
<v Speaker 1>And then he told me that when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking,</v>

389
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.400
<v Speaker 1>he looked down the hallway and all he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could see was fire.</v>

390
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.110
<v Speaker 1>And then a police woman came to to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>him because of the bar phone,</v>

391
00:20:34.111 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 1>the police and he hit her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after that he had eeg testing,</v>

392
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 1>which showed that he was susceptible to</v>
<v Speaker 1>seizures.</v>

393
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.890
<v Speaker 1>And so he swore off alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had another drink and he's</v>

394
00:20:43.891 --> 00:20:46.290
<v Speaker 1>like 35 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had another drink in his life.</v>

395
00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:50.140
<v Speaker 1>And it never happened again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's just a good example of of,</v>

396
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.490
<v Speaker 1>there was a kid at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas at Austin about 30 years ago who</v>

397
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.890
<v Speaker 1>had seemed to have a perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable,</v>

398
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family life and so forth,</v>

399
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 1>reasonable upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he started to become increasingly</v>

400
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 1>violent in his fantasies and he climbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>up onto a tower cause there was a high</v>

401
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:09.100
<v Speaker 1>tower at the University of Texas at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin and he took a high powered rifle</v>

402
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:12.020
<v Speaker 1>and I think he shot 16 people before</v>
<v Speaker 1>they finally got him.</v>

403
00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

404
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.570
<v Speaker 1>when they did an autopsy at a fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing tumor that was pressing on the</v>

405
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:19.840
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamus is no joke.</v>

406
00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:22.480
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for those of you whose introduction</v>

407
00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:26.020
<v Speaker 1>to neuropsychology has made you assumed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Cortex is in control,</v>

408
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cortex is only con in control when</v>

409
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.590
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when all of your other basic</v>

410
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:36.970
<v Speaker 1>requirements are satiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since you're a modern person and you</v>

411
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:40.690
<v Speaker 1>live in luxury that's unparalleled in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of the world,</v>

412
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:45.870
<v Speaker 1>all of your fundamental biological sub</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities are always satiated.</v>

413
00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:50.170
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you think you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

414
00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 1>but you're only like that because you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat,</v>

415
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 1>you never been anywhere where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't like that.</v>

416
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

417
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:01.570
<v Speaker 1>now here's one of the things that's cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the hypothalamus.</v>

418
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.450
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you have these different subsystems</v>

419
00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:07.240
<v Speaker 1>say these different nuclear that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for these different</v>

420
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.940
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities oriented towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>

421
00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:12.700
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards Thurs,</v>

422
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.400
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards temperature regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

423
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think of them as sub personalities</v>

424
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:22.120
<v Speaker 1>because they have a viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want something that they want to go</v>

425
00:22:22.121 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to accomplish it efficiently,</v>

426
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.800
<v Speaker 1>and they have emotions that go along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

427
00:22:26.801 --> 00:22:27.461
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

428
00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:31.300
<v Speaker 1>if you're going for some water and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop a glass or somebody gets in your</v>

429
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:32.530
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the tap is working,</v>

430
00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:35.170
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel frustration and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and irritation.</v>

431
00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 1>So they come fully equipped with</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

432
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.160
<v Speaker 1>They have their own motor outputs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they basically prime.</v>

433
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:44.920
<v Speaker 1>And those would be the motor outputs</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

434
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggregations of habits that you have</v>

435
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:53.450
<v Speaker 1>been able to learn that have the eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you previously in your water</v>

436
00:22:53.451 --> 00:22:55.180
<v Speaker 1>searching behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for us,</v>

437
00:22:55.181 --> 00:22:56.014
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

438
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.840
<v Speaker 1>getting a glass out of the cupboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a gripping issue.</v>

439
00:22:58.841 --> 00:23:02.140
<v Speaker 1>And then a transport issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to turn on the tap.</v>

440
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.110
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Luria who a famous Russian</v>

441
00:23:05.111 --> 00:23:08.350
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologist called those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinetic melodies.</v>

442
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 1>And so if you think about it from a p a</v>
<v Speaker 1>jetty and perspective and alluring in</v>

443
00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:13.720
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

444
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.920
<v Speaker 1>you can think that piaget talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how children put together basic,</v>

445
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motor they're not reflex is exactly</v>

446
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 1>their complex sequences of what started</v>
<v Speaker 1>as reflexes.</v>

447
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And then those can be linked together in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

448
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:29.500
<v Speaker 1>in a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this sort of dance that you're always</v>

449
00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:32.830
<v Speaker 1>doing with your body and each of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>little dances,</v>

450
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think water seeking,</v>

451
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a set of water</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant dances that you can do that you</v>

452
00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Speaker 1>know your experiences taught you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become expert at.</v>

453
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And when you get thirsty then knows or</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked the dis-inhibited.</v>

454
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 1>That's my guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're</v>

455
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Speaker 3>disinhibited and prepared for execution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

456
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:53.720
<v Speaker 3>and then the specifics of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstance that you're in determine</v>

457
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:56.750
<v Speaker 3>which ones are deceiving is inhibited</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to actually run.</v>

458
00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're full of little machines</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're all on there ready to go,</v>

459
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 3>but they're all shut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all like held in status in some</v>

460
00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 3>sense by cortical inhibition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

461
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I like to think of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like a nuclear reactor,</v>

462
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the core is really active,</v>

463
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:13.670
<v Speaker 3>it's on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you have all these rods going</v>

464
00:24:13.671 --> 00:24:16.470
<v Speaker 3>into the core to keep it from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from uh,</v>

465
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.850
<v Speaker 3>going critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the CORTEX is sort of like that in</v>

466
00:24:19.851 --> 00:24:21.790
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the lower parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

467
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 3>Those parts of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

468
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.200
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're alive.</v>

469
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.930
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like the titans of mythology.</v>

470
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:28.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're sitting down there,</v>

471
00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:31.760
<v Speaker 3>these fundamental forces and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready to leap into action at,</v>

472
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:32.870
<v Speaker 3>at a moment's notice.</v>

473
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.670
<v Speaker 3>But the cortex basically keeps them</v>
<v Speaker 3>inhibited and it seems to do that.</v>

474
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that you have a vision of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your desired future.</v>

475
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a vision of the transformation</v>

476
00:24:44.991 --> 00:24:49.991
<v Speaker 3>stages that you're going to undertake to</v>
<v Speaker 3>move from where you are to that desired</v>

477
00:24:50.751 --> 00:24:51.531
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

478
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:55.640
<v Speaker 3>So then what you're doing is you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>comparing your interpretation of the</v>

479
00:24:55.641 --> 00:25:00.140
<v Speaker 3>present to your interpretation of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>desired future.</v>

480
00:25:00.141 --> 00:25:02.960
<v Speaker 3>And then as long as those two things</v>
<v Speaker 3>match,</v>

481
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.670
<v Speaker 3>which the hippocampus is the hippocampus</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the thing that's determining that,</v>

482
00:25:07.671 --> 00:25:11.960
<v Speaker 3>it's the thing that's computing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>match between your fantasy of what you</v>

483
00:25:11.961 --> 00:25:14.840
<v Speaker 3>want to happen with your fantasy about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is happening.</v>

484
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 3>As long as that matches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the hypothalamus,</v>

485
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:22.070
<v Speaker 3>the hippocampus basically and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we don't know exactly how this</v>

486
00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 3>works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it seems to work to some degree</v>

487
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 3>through modulation of the reticular</v>
<v Speaker 3>activating system,</v>

488
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.920
<v Speaker 3>the match.</v>

489
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.880
<v Speaker 3>If the hippocampus matches what you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>with what's happening,</v>

490
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 3>then all these other little sub systems</v>
<v Speaker 3>are basically shut off and if they,</v>

491
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.690
<v Speaker 3>if the hippocampus detects a mismatch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is when novelty occurs,</v>

492
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.360
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rights like something went wrong,</v>

493
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.170
<v Speaker 3>then you get disinhibition of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reticular activating system.</v>

494
00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:48.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like you wake up and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's primed for action and you</v>

495
00:25:48.951 --> 00:25:52.370
<v Speaker 3>know that solves the problem of what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>should do when you don't know what to</v>

496
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:54.860
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that answer is you should get ready</v>

497
00:25:54.861 --> 00:25:58.190
<v Speaker 3>to do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be on alert and ready to</v>

498
00:25:58.191 --> 00:26:02.210
<v Speaker 3>implement whatever actions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

499
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not even whatever actions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more like you get,</v>

500
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.540
<v Speaker 3>you should be ready to implement</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever subpersonalities the situation</v>

501
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:14.090
<v Speaker 3>seems to call for as soon as you're able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to identify what they are.</v>

502
00:26:14.091 --> 00:26:17.660
<v Speaker 3>But otherwise it's sort of like an army</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all of a sudden gone on alert.</v>

503
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.340
<v Speaker 3>You don't know who's going to be called</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

504
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 3>but everybody should be ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a high stress situation.</v>

505
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

506
00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 3>so part of the hypothalamus is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say for the sake of argument,</v>

507
00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:31.550
<v Speaker 3>it's popping up all these little</v>
<v Speaker 3>subpersonalities that have to do with</v>

508
00:26:31.551 --> 00:26:36.200
<v Speaker 3>basic basic instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The words are all wrong because they're</v>

509
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:41.201
<v Speaker 3>not like an instinct sounds like a drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people aren't driven.</v>

510
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.000
<v Speaker 3>We're not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're much more flexible than that.</v>

511
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Even rats aren't driven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a very,</v>

512
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seminal experiment that was done at the</v>

513
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 3>height of behaviorism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

514
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea with the behavior is perfectly</v>

515
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 3>smart idea was that the way a rat</v>
<v Speaker 3>learned was it would start with a</v>

516
00:26:59.101 --> 00:27:01.250
<v Speaker 3>reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sort of in the Piagetian sense.</v>

517
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.650
<v Speaker 3>And then you could teach it a new</v>
<v Speaker 3>routine,</v>

518
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 3>which was an aggregation of little tiny</v>
<v Speaker 3>reflexes.</v>

519
00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:10.290
<v Speaker 3>You could teach it a new routine by</v>
<v Speaker 3>rewarding it.</v>

520
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 3>So let's say here's what you do with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rat.</v>

521
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:15.810
<v Speaker 3>So you want to teach the route to climb</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ladder and go across it a little</v>

522
00:27:15.811 --> 00:27:19.390
<v Speaker 3>ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the rats sniffing around in the,</v>

523
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.370
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

524
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.680
<v Speaker 3>in that little rat cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it gets close to the ladder.</v>

525
00:27:25.681 --> 00:27:28.530
<v Speaker 3>And so you give it a food palate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it hangs around close to the</v>

526
00:27:28.531 --> 00:27:30.900
<v Speaker 3>ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just cause you've reinforced,</v>

527
00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:35.430
<v Speaker 3>like you really reinforced the</v>
<v Speaker 3>manifestation of those micro behaviors</v>

528
00:27:35.431 --> 00:27:37.940
<v Speaker 3>that are associated with the ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then maybe at some point the rod</v>

529
00:27:37.941 --> 00:27:40.590
<v Speaker 3>puts one little paw up on the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>rung,</v>

530
00:27:40.591 --> 00:27:43.290
<v Speaker 3>you give it a food pellet and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty soon the rats going like this</v>

531
00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:46.050
<v Speaker 3>fairly frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next thing that happens is</v>

532
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 3>it puts two paws up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

533
00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 3>if your patient using reward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get that rap too.</v>

534
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 3>You can get that damn rap to do damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>near anything.</v>

535
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Skinner taught pigeons to navigate</v>
<v Speaker 3>guided missiles by maps in the Second</v>

536
00:27:59.221 --> 00:28:01.170
<v Speaker 3>World War by packing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

537
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.750
<v Speaker 3>they never did use them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really it's pretty impressive.</v>

538
00:28:03.751 --> 00:28:05.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think pigeons are stupid.</v>

539
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 3>They're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can read maps,</v>

540
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:09.750
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty damn amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

541
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:15.260
<v Speaker 3>so the idea was that what the animal is</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is chaining together deterministic</v>

542
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.890
<v Speaker 3>reflexes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

543
00:28:16.891 --> 00:28:20.310
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about a deterministic</v>
<v Speaker 3>reflex is that it's not flexible,</v>

544
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's a deterministic reflex,</v>

545
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 3>it really is a drive action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a initiates action be that initiates</v>

546
00:28:27.481 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

547
00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 3>and it's a fixed action pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some animals do seem to learn that</v>

548
00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:33.900
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's these little animals,</v>

549
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.430
<v Speaker 3>I think their moles that do this or</v>
<v Speaker 3>shrews shrews.</v>

550
00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:43.140
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you teach a shrew to gill from</v>
<v Speaker 3>point a to b by a very</v>

551
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.550
<v Speaker 3>inefficient maze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like route.</v>

552
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.520
<v Speaker 3>But the shrew could just walk straight</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

553
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.350
<v Speaker 3>But once he learns to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he can't figure out that he's going</v>

554
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:58.200
<v Speaker 3>from here to here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you train a right to do this,</v>

555
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.110
<v Speaker 3>the rat will figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

556
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 3>to hell with all this circuitous ness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just going to go straight from</v>

557
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:08.610
<v Speaker 3>point a to point b.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was one of the first that that</v>

558
00:29:08.611 --> 00:29:13.611
<v Speaker 3>finding was part of what indicated to</v>
<v Speaker 3>early neuro,</v>

559
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:19.050
<v Speaker 3>neuro psychological researchers that</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals produced a map of the</v>

560
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:20.040
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

561
00:29:20.041 --> 00:29:23.310
<v Speaker 3>in some sense partly what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about when we're talking about these</v>

562
00:29:23.311 --> 00:29:26.730
<v Speaker 3>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the A to b structure is a map.</v>

563
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:29.310
<v Speaker 3>That's another way you can look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

564
00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.180
<v Speaker 3>so you've got this rat and its behaviors</v>
<v Speaker 3>are all chained together,</v>

565
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:34.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I already told you,</v>

566
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spoiled the story in some sense</v>

567
00:29:36.481 --> 00:29:39.020
<v Speaker 3>because I told you that the rat could</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn to take a shortcut.</v>

568
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:44.030
<v Speaker 3>But one of the earlier demonstrations of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the independence of rat learning from</v>

569
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:47.830
<v Speaker 3>the reflective conditioning was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's say you've trained to rap to</v>

570
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:48.970
<v Speaker 3>run down a maze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

571
00:29:48.971 --> 00:29:53.410
<v Speaker 3>So hypothetically it's using its front</v>
<v Speaker 3>legs and his back legs and it's learning</v>

572
00:29:53.411 --> 00:29:55.660
<v Speaker 3>to chain all that together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Front leg,</v>

573
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:56.620
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leg movement,</v>

574
00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:57.431
<v Speaker 3>turned left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>front,</v>

575
00:29:57.431 --> 00:29:59.050
<v Speaker 3>leg back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leg movement turned right,</v>

576
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:00.040
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

577
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 3>While so then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

578
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 3>what if you put the little rap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tie up his back legs and you put</v>

579
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:07.810
<v Speaker 3>them in a little rap like wheel barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's got wheels instead of legs.</v>

580
00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:11.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like the route zooms through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>maze swell so much for the reflex</v>

581
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:12.041
<v Speaker 3>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

582
00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:17.041
<v Speaker 3>Because obviously you didn't train the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rat to use a cart with its rear end</v>

583
00:30:17.621 --> 00:30:19.660
<v Speaker 3>stuck in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't figured that out all by itself.</v>

584
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:21.190
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

585
00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.570
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

586
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.830
<v Speaker 3>there is a system in you that allows you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to chain reflexes together.</v>

587
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a very primordial learning system</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the behavior got that right.</v>

588
00:30:30.171 --> 00:30:31.810
<v Speaker 3>It's fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

589
00:30:31.811 --> 00:30:34.720
<v Speaker 3>very fast because it requires do neuro</v>
<v Speaker 3>connections.</v>

590
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.360
<v Speaker 3>So there's some advantages to simple</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>

591
00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.900
<v Speaker 3>but once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you get up into the higher,</v>

592
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.010
<v Speaker 3>even the moderately higher cortical and</v>
<v Speaker 3>subcortical functions,</v>

593
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.210
<v Speaker 3>you're past the point of a mirror</v>
<v Speaker 3>reflects chaining.</v>

594
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say for the sake of simplicity,</v>

595
00:30:53.711 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 3>the hypothalamus says you need waters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your current state is you're thirsty</v>

596
00:30:57.461 --> 00:30:59.680
<v Speaker 3>and your desired state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you get to go to the tap,</v>

597
00:30:59.681 --> 00:31:01.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can feel your mouth dry and so</v>

598
00:31:01.481 --> 00:31:04.360
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then some fantasies about drinking,</v>

599
00:31:04.361 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 3>some water start to come into your mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden you're kind of</v>

600
00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:11.260
<v Speaker 3>possessed by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's starting to interfere with</v>

601
00:31:11.261 --> 00:31:13.990
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your conscious goal directed</v>

602
00:31:13.991 --> 00:31:16.990
<v Speaker 3>behavior at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And finally it's insistent enough like</v>

603
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:18.310
<v Speaker 3>something knocking on the doors.</v>

604
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.780
<v Speaker 3>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

605
00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:20.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thirsty.</v>

606
00:31:20.981 --> 00:31:21.910
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

607
00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.840
<v Speaker 3>maybe you even think I'll work better if</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have something to drink.</v>

608
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:30.520
<v Speaker 3>And so you go off to the fountain and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what your campus is doing is you've</v>

609
00:31:30.521 --> 00:31:33.880
<v Speaker 3>got this little idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is your desired future about how</v>

610
00:31:33.881 --> 00:31:36.400
<v Speaker 3>this trip is supposed to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're,</v>

611
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.270
<v Speaker 3>you're watching to see how the trip is</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually going.</v>

612
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:44.620
<v Speaker 3>But that's an interpretation to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then if there's a match between the</v>

613
00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:46.900
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hippocampus just leaves you the hell</v>

614
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:48.340
<v Speaker 3>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get anxious,</v>

615
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:50.710
<v Speaker 3>you don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get knocked off the track.</v>

616
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:54.220
<v Speaker 3>You go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the water that satiates that</v>

617
00:31:54.221 --> 00:31:55.990
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a form of rewards,</v>

618
00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:58.450
<v Speaker 3>satiation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called consumer Tory reward.</v>

619
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.710
<v Speaker 3>And then that system disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes back to the big dungeons from</v>

620
00:32:02.711 --> 00:32:04.960
<v Speaker 3>which it emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in all likelihood,</v>

621
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:06.160
<v Speaker 3>another one pops up.</v>

622
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Now it's an over simplification of human</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior to assume that you just go from</v>

623
00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:15.820
<v Speaker 3>one hypothalamic Lee mediated state to</v>
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

624
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Although I would say that's what two</v>
<v Speaker 3>year olds do.</v>

625
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 3>And in some sense that's what animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

626
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:25.090
<v Speaker 3>And you know the two year olds doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that little creature hasn't gone</v>

627
00:32:25.091 --> 00:32:27.550
<v Speaker 3>any more organized than hypothalamic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

628
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.680
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can see this if you watch two</v>

629
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:31.150
<v Speaker 3>year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're laughing and then</v>

630
00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:33.790
<v Speaker 3>they're crying and then they're hungry</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they're hot and then they need</v>

631
00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:35.590
<v Speaker 3>to go to the bathroom and then they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to play.</v>

632
00:32:35.591 --> 00:32:40.591
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's just one pure motivated</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional state after another.</v>

633
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:43.850
<v Speaker 3>It's quite fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're also relatively hyper</v>

634
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 3>exploratory is as long as and playful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

635
00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.660
<v Speaker 3>But they're cycling through those things</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

636
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

637
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.180
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

638
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.830
<v Speaker 3>you can't say that that's really what an</v>
<v Speaker 3>adult human gods.</v>

639
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.030
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the,</v>

640
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.440
<v Speaker 3>with the pure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the reason that you need a cortex</v>

641
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:07.010
<v Speaker 3>and the other subcortical structures</v>
<v Speaker 3>that aren't hypothalamic is because the</v>

642
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:12.011
<v Speaker 3>world is too complex for those</v>
<v Speaker 3>primordial systems to solve the problems</v>

643
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:16.370
<v Speaker 3>they're supposed to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A in every possible situation,</v>

644
00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:21.580
<v Speaker 3>be across multiple timeframes and see in</v>
<v Speaker 3>an environment that's consists of the</v>

645
00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:25.340
<v Speaker 3>interactions between other very complex</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

646
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.120
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost,</v>

647
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.990
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like an arms race of</v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity in some sense that's driven,</v>

648
00:33:32.991 --> 00:33:37.991
<v Speaker 3>are driven our evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The smarter you get in some sense,</v>

649
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:42.980
<v Speaker 3>the more variable you get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a problem because as I got</v>

650
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:44.750
<v Speaker 3>smarter say over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution,</v>

651
00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:48.710
<v Speaker 3>all you people got smarter too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're all competing and</v>

652
00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:51.260
<v Speaker 3>cooperating with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the whole damn system is getting</v>

653
00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:53.150
<v Speaker 3>more and more and more and more complex.</v>

654
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.710
<v Speaker 3>So you have to grow a brain in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>manage that and at least,</v>

655
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.320
<v Speaker 3>or you keep it simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we didn't keep it simple.</v>

656
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.340
<v Speaker 3>So we decided to grow a brain instead of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

657
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

658
00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.230
<v Speaker 3>you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've looked at a chimpanzee and feel</v>

659
00:34:08.231 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 3>like they don't look a lot like human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings,</v>

660
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:12.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's obviously some things in</v>

661
00:34:12.621 --> 00:34:13.790
<v Speaker 3>common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

662
00:34:13.791 --> 00:34:16.400
<v Speaker 3>their hands are quite human and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>ears are quite human,</v>

663
00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:19.220
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their forehead comes down to about here</v>

664
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.630
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

665
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:23.030
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of shaped like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

666
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:26.900
<v Speaker 3>they're a big round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got a huge round body and</v>

667
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:28.490
<v Speaker 3>whereas a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like,</v>

668
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stick with two sticks coming out of it</v>

669
00:34:31.161 --> 00:34:33.530
<v Speaker 3>and two more sticks were really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really thin.</v>

670
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Hardly any gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And whereas the chimpanzees like it's</v>

671
00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 3>intestinal structures are way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

672
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:40.700
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way longer than ours.</v>

673
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:44.000
<v Speaker 3>And so it has to pack that into this</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge gut to the damn.</v>

674
00:34:44.001 --> 00:34:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Chimpanzees sits around eight hours a</v>
<v Speaker 3>day chewing.</v>

675
00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.400
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is it eats</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaves.</v>

676
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:52.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like you go out in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>need leaves and see how damn many leaves</v>

677
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:56.330
<v Speaker 3>you have to eat before you feel full.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like all the chimp does is sit</v>

678
00:34:56.331 --> 00:35:00.440
<v Speaker 3>there and chew leaves and then it has</v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge guts so that it can extract</v>

679
00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:03.530
<v Speaker 3>some nourishment out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We figured out how to solve that problem</v>

680
00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:08.330
<v Speaker 3>once we discovered fire and hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>because within we could cook pays and</v>

681
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:12.860
<v Speaker 3>then we that enabled us at least in</v>
<v Speaker 3>principle to trade gut for brain,</v>

682
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:16.460
<v Speaker 3>which I think was a pretty pretty useful</v>
<v Speaker 3>trained all things considered,</v>

683
00:35:16.461 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 3>although it's still might get us in</v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>

684
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.890
<v Speaker 3>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause the brain's a very energy hungry</v>

685
00:35:21.891 --> 00:35:24.110
<v Speaker 3>organ and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we very,</v>

686
00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:28.100
<v Speaker 3>very efficient food and it turns out</v>
<v Speaker 3>that cooked food is much more nutritious</v>

687
00:35:28.101 --> 00:35:30.950
<v Speaker 3>from a caloric perspective than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than raw food.</v>

688
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:34.880
<v Speaker 3>And so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can afford to sit around and develop</v>

689
00:35:34.881 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 3>a brain if you've got high quality food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise out there in the,</v>

690
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.270
<v Speaker 3>in the jungle chewing on leaves like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>idiot for like,</v>

691
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.220
<v Speaker 3>they're just about as bad as Pandis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

692
00:35:44.221 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 3>You know why those things are damn near</v>
<v Speaker 3>extinct.</v>

693
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 3>They used to be carnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they eat is bamboo shoots now that's</v>

694
00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing else.</v>

695
00:35:51.151 --> 00:35:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Bamboo shoots and they have no</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition.</v>

696
00:35:53.491 --> 00:35:58.491
<v Speaker 3>So they have to like eat bamboo shoots</v>
<v Speaker 3>all day and then now and then the bamboo</v>

697
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:01.200
<v Speaker 3>crop fails and there aren't any shoots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

698
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much for the parent as it's like if</v>

699
00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:06.950
<v Speaker 3>an animal ever deserved to go extinct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was definitely the panda</v>

700
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.530
<v Speaker 3>hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something yet lazy bastards.</v>

701
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

702
00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:16.800
<v Speaker 3>so now this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I discovered this about the hypothalamus</v>

703
00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:20.340
<v Speaker 3>when I was reading Larry Swanson is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloody well blew me away because,</v>

704
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.590
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see why at least in part.</v>

705
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.650
<v Speaker 3>So half of the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

706
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:28.110
<v Speaker 3>is sort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorta devoted to popping up these basic</v>

707
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:32.100
<v Speaker 3>primal subpersonalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sorts of things that you share with</v>

708
00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:33.810
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you might say,</v>

709
00:36:33.811 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens when one of those doesn't</v>

710
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:37.740
<v Speaker 3>work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is,</v>

711
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:39.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get an anxiety response.</v>

712
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Now the anxiety response is not mediated</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the hypothalamus and neither is pain.</v>

713
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.680
<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're an idiot,</v>

714
00:36:46.681 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 3>you're body tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurts you or tells you or scares you</v>

715
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting about that is</v>

716
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:57.630
<v Speaker 3>that the pain systems and the anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems are not in the hypothalamus.</v>

717
00:36:57.631 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 3>They're separate systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the pain system is old,</v>

718
00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:02.100
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

719
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.530
<v Speaker 3>It may be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's as old as the hypothalamus.</v>

720
00:37:04.531 --> 00:37:08.550
<v Speaker 3>It's way down there in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the anxiety system is a lot newer</v>

721
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.460
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of makes sense because you can</v>

722
00:37:11.461 --> 00:37:14.970
<v Speaker 3>imagine primordial organisms really</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't stop until they ran into</v>

723
00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:16.680
<v Speaker 3>something that was hurting them.</v>

724
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.660
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

725
00:37:18.661 --> 00:37:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I might run into something that will</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt me.</v>

726
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Well you can't think that until roughly</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have an egg.</v>

727
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Della,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

728
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.890
<v Speaker 3>cause the Amygdala seems to be at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's responsible for lots of things and</v>

729
00:37:28.891 --> 00:37:32.040
<v Speaker 3>all these areas are interconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that seems to be</v>

730
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:34.440
<v Speaker 3>responsible for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in part is anxiety.</v>

731
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:39.890
<v Speaker 3>And so when your hippocampus detects a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mismatch between what you want to have</v>

732
00:37:39.961 --> 00:37:43.860
<v Speaker 3>happen and what is happening it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this inhibits the reticular activating</v>

733
00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:45.780
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things it activates is</v>

734
00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 3>the anxiety system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The anxiety system says,</v>

735
00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 3>stop you in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know where you are or what</v>

736
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:53.430
<v Speaker 3>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you should quit before you get</v>

737
00:37:53.431 --> 00:37:55.860
<v Speaker 3>into trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we don't like that feeling very</v>

738
00:37:55.861 --> 00:37:57.270
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That freezes us.</v>

739
00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.650
<v Speaker 3>But it's better than pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

740
00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.180
<v Speaker 3>you feel anxiety so you don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel pain.</v>

741
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:07.260
<v Speaker 3>Now pain seems to occur when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>encounter a stimulus,</v>

742
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:12.350
<v Speaker 3>let's say a situation where the sensory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stimulus magnitude is sufficient to</v>

743
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:18.120
<v Speaker 3>damage those parts of you that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>encountering it.</v>

744
00:38:18.121 --> 00:38:20.610
<v Speaker 3>So too bright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a light to auto flame,</v>

745
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.150
<v Speaker 3>to cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a piece of metal to hot food,</v>

746
00:38:24.151 --> 00:38:25.650
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know if it,</v>

747
00:38:25.651 --> 00:38:28.200
<v Speaker 3>if it's of sufficient magnitude to</v>
<v Speaker 3>damage you,</v>

748
00:38:28.201 --> 00:38:31.980
<v Speaker 3>you get a pain response out of that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pain response is supposed to teach</v>

749
00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 3>the part of you that moves forward not</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that again.</v>

750
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 3>The anxiety system responds to cues of</v>
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>

751
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Now the pain system is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated as well because frustration</v>

752
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 3>is a pain like stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disappointment is a pain like stimulus,</v>

753
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.760
<v Speaker 3>grief and loneliness are paying like</v>
<v Speaker 3>stimuli.</v>

754
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Depression is probably a pain condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even though the pain system is quite</v>

755
00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:59.990
<v Speaker 3>primordial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's grown up like a complex tree and it</v>

756
00:38:59.991 --> 00:39:02.320
<v Speaker 3>subsumes many different functions.</v>

757
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.960
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

758
00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still a very ancient system.</v>

759
00:39:07.001 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the [inaudible] system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is newer,</v>

760
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.720
<v Speaker 3>you've developed over time to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 3>what might hurt you so that you can</v>

761
00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 3>avoid contacting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you've got your hypothalamus and</v>

762
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:19.270
<v Speaker 3>it's telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

763
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:22.420
<v Speaker 3>it's laying out these little</v>
<v Speaker 3>subpersonalities that are helping you</v>

764
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.120
<v Speaker 3>deal with the fundamental necessities of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

765
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:30.010
<v Speaker 3>The pain system is there to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have encountered a situation</v>

766
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 3>that is harmful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anxiety system is there to tell you</v>

767
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.160
<v Speaker 3>when you might be going to encounter</v>
<v Speaker 3>something harmful.</v>

768
00:39:36.161 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing that's activated</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's a mismatch,</v>

769
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:41.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the mismatch says you don't know</v>

770
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:42.940
<v Speaker 3>where you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are you are,</v>

771
00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:45.700
<v Speaker 3>where you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you might get hurt.</v>

772
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Now the other thing that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

773
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:54.880
<v Speaker 3>is that when the hippocampus disinhibit</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reticular activating system that</v>

774
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:58.390
<v Speaker 3>turns the other half of the hypothalamus</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

775
00:39:58.391 --> 00:40:02.290
<v Speaker 3>and this is quite cool because the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>half of the hypothalamus is the place</v>

776
00:40:02.291 --> 00:40:07.291
<v Speaker 3>where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ventral tegmental area is located in the</v>

777
00:40:07.421 --> 00:40:11.110
<v Speaker 3>ventral tegmental area is the part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain from which the dopaminergic</v>

778
00:40:11.111 --> 00:40:12.070
<v Speaker 3>tracts emerge.</v>

779
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:17.070
<v Speaker 3>And those are the tracks that you use a</v>
<v Speaker 3>to explore and be to respond to cues of</v>

780
00:40:18.881 --> 00:40:23.320
<v Speaker 3>conservatory reward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what that means in non technical</v>

781
00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:25.870
<v Speaker 3>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you encounter mismatch,</v>

782
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.630
<v Speaker 3>you get anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you should do.</v>

783
00:40:28.631 --> 00:40:30.760
<v Speaker 3>You should stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's wrong.</v>

784
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 3>And then as long as nothing else happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's painful or threatening,</v>

785
00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:39.400
<v Speaker 3>then that system starts to climatize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Partly because you're looking around and</v>

786
00:40:39.401 --> 00:40:40.234
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

787
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.610
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people often talk about this as</v>

788
00:40:42.611 --> 00:40:45.700
<v Speaker 3>habituation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a stupid idea.</v>

789
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.130
<v Speaker 3>It's habituation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a sea slug,</v>

790
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.550
<v Speaker 3>it's not habituation if you're a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except that very,</v>

791
00:40:51.551 --> 00:40:56.260
<v Speaker 3>very primordial reflects like levels of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nervous system at the higher order</v>

792
00:40:56.261 --> 00:40:58.720
<v Speaker 3>levels that we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's learning.</v>

793
00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.660
<v Speaker 3>And so if you stop and you're anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens?</v>

794
00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally speaking,</v>

795
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.250
<v Speaker 3>you start thinking what the hell might</v>
<v Speaker 3>be going on?</v>

796
00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:09.310
<v Speaker 3>And you're running through all of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different theories and,</v>

797
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:14.170
<v Speaker 3>and part of the way that works is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's partly a consequence of state</v>

798
00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:15.070
<v Speaker 3>dependent learning.</v>

799
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.460
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're anxious,</v>

800
00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:22.960
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be primed to remember</v>
<v Speaker 3>situations that you are anxious in</v>

801
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:26.620
<v Speaker 3>before and why should you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is</v>

802
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.680
<v Speaker 3>anxious things that make you anxious is</v>
<v Speaker 3>at category.</v>

803
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.860
<v Speaker 3>It's actually a category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we tend to think of categories as</v>

804
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:39.110
<v Speaker 3>something that exists in the objective</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

805
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.080
<v Speaker 3>but that is not how your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>categorizes things.</v>

806
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:47.380
<v Speaker 3>You have to learn that really painfully</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make objective categorizations for as</v>

807
00:41:47.961 --> 00:41:50.480
<v Speaker 3>far as your natural nervous system is</v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned.</v>

808
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.230
<v Speaker 3>All things that go bump in the night are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing.</v>

809
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 3>And what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While it's some bloody horrible,</v>

810
00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:00.710
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>predatory Crocodilian dragon like</v>

811
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:04.220
<v Speaker 3>monster that hides under your bed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes out in bites you when you were</v>

812
00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:07.130
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just ran a little paper today about</v>

813
00:42:07.131 --> 00:42:11.780
<v Speaker 3>this kind of cat that lived back when we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were still figuring out how to use</v>

814
00:42:11.781 --> 00:42:16.430
<v Speaker 3>spears and this was a particularly nasty</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of cap and it preyed on us roughly</v>

815
00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:17.264
<v Speaker 3>speaking.</v>

816
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:22.160
<v Speaker 3>And we didn't get eaten by too many cats</v>
<v Speaker 3>because cats really can't bite through</v>

817
00:42:22.161 --> 00:42:23.930
<v Speaker 3>the skull so they could go for your</v>
<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>

818
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:24.880
<v Speaker 3>But that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

819
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.640
<v Speaker 3>they didn't necessarily kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this cat had a mouth that fit right</v>

820
00:42:28.641 --> 00:42:32.510
<v Speaker 3>around your skull and it had two teeth</v>
<v Speaker 3>that went in here and two teeth that</v>

821
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:37.540
<v Speaker 3>went in here and it was a silent killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there is evidence that even children</v>

822
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:42.290
<v Speaker 3>are capable of recognizing the motion</v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern of a predatory cat.</v>

823
00:42:42.291 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 3>And one of the hypothesis is that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>still have,</v>

824
00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of our primate ancestors that didn't</v>

825
00:42:47.871 --> 00:42:50.960
<v Speaker 3>get eaten by that particular cap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty damn good at detecting</v>

826
00:42:50.961 --> 00:42:52.880
<v Speaker 3>cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least have that type.</v>

827
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:53.860
<v Speaker 3>And we seem to have,</v>

828
00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:59.310
<v Speaker 3>what would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conserve that ability at least to some</v>

829
00:42:59.311 --> 00:43:02.190
<v Speaker 3>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think about a category,</v>

830
00:43:02.191 --> 00:43:04.050
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

831
00:43:04.051 --> 00:43:06.480
<v Speaker 3>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's fish and there's birds and</v>

832
00:43:06.481 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's mammals and there's this</v>

833
00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.530
<v Speaker 3>reptiles and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are,</v>

834
00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.890
<v Speaker 3>those are linnaean classifications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're based in some sense on,</v>

835
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:19.330
<v Speaker 3>on evolutionary divergence and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and where they're not on morphology on</v>

836
00:43:19.801 --> 00:43:22.380
<v Speaker 3>the way the animals put together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares about that?</v>

837
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:27.650
<v Speaker 3>Things that eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a category and you need,</v>

838
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.690
<v Speaker 3>you need that category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other category is also</v>

839
00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:33.540
<v Speaker 3>things that mighty you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So things that eat you,</v>

840
00:43:33.541 --> 00:43:36.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are things that can hurt you and</v>

841
00:43:36.181 --> 00:43:38.460
<v Speaker 3>things that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mighty you are things you haven't</v>

842
00:43:38.461 --> 00:43:42.300
<v Speaker 3>classified yet but might be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's your natural,</v>

843
00:43:42.301 --> 00:43:44.790
<v Speaker 3>your brain's natural category one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

844
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:45.960
<v Speaker 3>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

845
00:43:45.961 --> 00:43:50.190
<v Speaker 3>if that's the natural category C,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the sort of thing that,</v>

846
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:55.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who wrote the visual,</v>

847
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.350
<v Speaker 3>an ecological approach to visual</v>
<v Speaker 3>perception,</v>

848
00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.720
<v Speaker 3>he talked about as an affordance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the word I couldn't remember</v>

849
00:44:03.721 --> 00:44:06.870
<v Speaker 3>last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So an affordance is something whose</v>

850
00:44:06.871 --> 00:44:10.650
<v Speaker 3>meaning you instantly perceived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you might say,</v>

851
00:44:10.651 --> 00:44:11.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

852
00:44:11.671 --> 00:44:12.031
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

853
00:44:12.031 --> 00:44:16.020
<v Speaker 3>you see a cat and then you infer that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>might eat you.</v>

854
00:44:16.021 --> 00:44:16.571
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

855
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:16.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

856
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:19.320
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see something that might eat you and</v>

857
00:44:19.321 --> 00:44:21.450
<v Speaker 3>then you might be able to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's a calf,</v>

858
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:23.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might eat you,</v>

859
00:44:23.341 --> 00:44:25.710
<v Speaker 3>that you see first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the damn cat.</v>

860
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:30.810
<v Speaker 3>And so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a fascinating phenomenon.</v>

861
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:35.030
<v Speaker 3>It it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it suggests like the hi to Gary Ins have</v>

862
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:40.040
<v Speaker 3>proposed that what you perceive first in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is meanings and out of the</v>

863
00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:43.920
<v Speaker 3>meanings you extract objects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the other way around.</v>

864
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:47.250
<v Speaker 3>And so if you look at the way your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>is organized,</v>

865
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.060
<v Speaker 3>that's how it works folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the more primordial your brain</v>

866
00:44:51.061 --> 00:44:53.630
<v Speaker 3>system is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means the more ancient it is,</v>

867
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:55.890
<v Speaker 3>the mortar tied it is into your</v>
<v Speaker 3>survival.</v>

868
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.040
<v Speaker 3>The more it's perception is action</v>
<v Speaker 3>predicated,</v>

869
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.720
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

870
00:45:00.721 --> 00:45:03.150
<v Speaker 3>if you hear a loud noise behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you startle,</v>

871
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.810
<v Speaker 3>that's your response while you're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a crouch.</v>

872
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.080
<v Speaker 3>That would make it difficult for a tiger</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bite the front of your neck.</v>

873
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.810
<v Speaker 3>And you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's big man,</v>

874
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:16.200
<v Speaker 3>that's before your it's way before</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking.</v>

875
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 3>It's before you're perceiving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

876
00:45:18.991 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 3>consciously you're not getting images or</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds at that point,</v>

877
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.710
<v Speaker 3>it's so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a,</v>

878
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.990
<v Speaker 3>that's a category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things that make you go like this and</v>

879
00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 3>that's a good category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

880
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.210
<v Speaker 3>the reason I'm making such a case about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that categories,</v>

881
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.750
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the mythological</v>
<v Speaker 3>categories is things that go bump in the</v>

882
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.790
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one of the things that</v>

883
00:45:38.791 --> 00:45:41.070
<v Speaker 3>primordial people were trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out is,</v>

884
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could take up any old animal is</v>

885
00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:48.300
<v Speaker 3>thinking as figuring out how to escape</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a Predator that isn't what human</v>

886
00:45:48.301 --> 00:45:49.620
<v Speaker 3>beings wanting to figure out.</v>

887
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 3>Not once we were able to abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we wanted to do instead was to</v>

888
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:58.290
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to escape from the class</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all things that could eat you.</v>

889
00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.040
<v Speaker 3>Not just any particular old thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all of them at once.</v>

890
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.270
<v Speaker 3>That's the advantage to categorization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we arrange things so that nothing</v>

891
00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:07.650
<v Speaker 3>can eat us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well?</v>

892
00:46:07.651 --> 00:46:09.510
<v Speaker 3>How do you go about doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

893
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.580
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been working on that problem for a</v>

894
00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:12.181
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

895
00:46:12.181 --> 00:46:15.120
<v Speaker 3>very long time and one of the answers we</v>
<v Speaker 3>came up with,</v>

896
00:46:15.121 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 3>we'll get into this later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the idea of sacrifice and sacrifice</v>

897
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:20.880
<v Speaker 3>is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very ancient idea.</v>

898
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:23.100
<v Speaker 3>But I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just give you a bit of a preview.</v>

899
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.680
<v Speaker 3>It took me like 20 years to figure this</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

900
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Human beings discovered sacrifice a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time ago and they acted it out before</v>

901
00:46:32.221 --> 00:46:33.690
<v Speaker 3>they understood it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

902
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Because we act out all sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we understand it.</v>

903
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:37.560
<v Speaker 3>And idea is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

904
00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:40.860
<v Speaker 3>you can make a bargain with God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>

905
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:42.090
<v Speaker 3>well what's God?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we'll,</v>

906
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:45.420
<v Speaker 3>we'll approach that problem later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very complicated problem.</v>

907
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:50.450
<v Speaker 3>But one thing you could think of God as</v>
<v Speaker 3>is God is the anthropomorphic</v>

908
00:46:51.691 --> 00:46:56.250
<v Speaker 3>representation of the entire social</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure across time.</v>

909
00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:59.820
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well God will reward you if you behave</v>

910
00:46:59.821 --> 00:47:01.620
<v Speaker 3>property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what does that mean?</v>

911
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that you could conceive of</v>

912
00:47:03.541 --> 00:47:07.310
<v Speaker 3>everyone who wasn't you as one met a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

913
00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that that met a person is gone</v>

914
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:12.900
<v Speaker 3>and you can make a deal with that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say,</v>

915
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you behave,</v>

916
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.880
<v Speaker 3>if I behave properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mess have being will respond,</v>

917
00:47:17.881 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 3>pause property to me in the future.</v>

918
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

919
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:24.840
<v Speaker 3>You know that if you make a promise to</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone and you keep it,</v>

920
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 3>then something good is likely to happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you in the future.</v>

921
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:31.660
<v Speaker 3>So that was one way that God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's God the father derivation.</v>

922
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:33.700
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's far more complicated than that.</v>

923
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:35.530
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a bad point.</v>

924
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 3>And we kind of figured out that we could</v>
<v Speaker 3>bargain with it across time and that</v>

925
00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 3>that would work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I read a really interesting paper by</v>

926
00:47:43.931 --> 00:47:46.990
<v Speaker 3>someone who's actually a former student</v>
<v Speaker 3>of mine is iem sheriff.</v>

927
00:47:46.991 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 3>And he analyzed the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 3>criminal behavior and belief in hell</v>

928
00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:54.790
<v Speaker 3>across a whole set of countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when it was an exhaustive,</v>

929
00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it was an exhaustive analysis,</v>

930
00:47:56.771 --> 00:48:00.190
<v Speaker 3>correlational analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way more peaceful in countries</v>

931
00:48:00.191 --> 00:48:04.390
<v Speaker 3>where people believe in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know and you think,</v>

932
00:48:04.391 --> 00:48:05.710
<v Speaker 3>well should you believe in hell?</v>

933
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:09.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yes and no.</v>

934
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist arguments aside,</v>

935
00:48:11.831 --> 00:48:15.550
<v Speaker 3>we're not even going to bother with them</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they're kind of moronic so well</v>

936
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.580
<v Speaker 3>the idea here is that there are certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>views,</v>

937
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:23.610
<v Speaker 3>there are certain action patterns that</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you undertake you will be viciously</v>

938
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:25.450
<v Speaker 3>punished in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

939
00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:26.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to happen.</v>

940
00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:30.040
<v Speaker 3>You try lying to everyone that you meet</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you just see how well you do over a</v>

941
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:31.180
<v Speaker 3>20 year period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

942
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.480
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be in such trouble by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of that 20 year period.</v>

943
00:48:34.481 --> 00:48:39.040
<v Speaker 3>That hell will be the only accurate way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to describe where you're situated.</v>

944
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.400
<v Speaker 3>So it's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are real things.</v>

945
00:48:42.401 --> 00:48:44.650
<v Speaker 3>And people came up with these ideas for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a reason.</v>

946
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Now Hell isn't only where other people</v>
<v Speaker 3>put you if you're bad,</v>

947
00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:51.490
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot more profound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the concept of that.</v>

948
00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:52.780
<v Speaker 3>But that's not a bad start.</v>

949
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.870
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sacrificial notion was something</v>

950
00:48:55.871 --> 00:49:00.340
<v Speaker 3>like we could not do what we want to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now and do something else and</v>

951
00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:01.840
<v Speaker 3>that'll make things better in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

952
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about that people,</v>

953
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:07.450
<v Speaker 3>that's the most brilliant idea human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings ever came up with.</v>

954
00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.690
<v Speaker 3>There's this old story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is probably not true about how to</v>

955
00:49:10.691 --> 00:49:13.360
<v Speaker 3>catch a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get this jar,</v>

956
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:18.660
<v Speaker 3>it's got a pretty thin neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just big enough for a monkey to put his</v>

957
00:49:18.671 --> 00:49:20.620
<v Speaker 3>hand in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you fill in with things monkeys</v>

958
00:49:20.621 --> 00:49:23.140
<v Speaker 3>like deed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say like let's say hard candy just for</v>

959
00:49:23.141 --> 00:49:25.720
<v Speaker 3>the sake of argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you put that out there and then the</v>

960
00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 3>monkey goes in and sticks his hand in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and grabs a bunch of candidate,</v>

961
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:32.770
<v Speaker 3>can't get his damn handout because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>only big enough for an input is,</v>

962
00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:34.840
<v Speaker 3>and then so then you can just go pick up</v>
<v Speaker 3>the monkey.</v>

963
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:35.711
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

964
00:49:35.711 --> 00:49:39.010
<v Speaker 3>what's the problem with the monkey?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't sacrifice.</v>

965
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:44.170
<v Speaker 3>It won't sacrifice its grip on the damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>candy for it's future existence.</v>

966
00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's what your parents had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been teaching you ever since you were</v>

967
00:49:47.051 --> 00:49:50.800
<v Speaker 3>little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let go of the candy so that you can live</v>

968
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.380
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's delay of gratification,</v>

969
00:49:53.381 --> 00:49:54.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's conscientiousness,</v>

970
00:49:54.971 --> 00:49:57.880
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the discovery of time and its</v>

971
00:49:57.881 --> 00:50:01.630
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the social environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so brilliant,</v>

972
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.850
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of what people were trying to</v>

973
00:50:03.851 --> 00:50:06.730
<v Speaker 3>figure out when they were developing</v>
<v Speaker 3>these rituals of sacrifices.</v>

974
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think about society as a metta</v>

975
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.010
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's usually represented as male by the</v>

976
00:50:12.011 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not always.</v>

977
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:18.361
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is this a person want?</v>

978
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.440
<v Speaker 3>What you've got to kind of figure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

979
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Partly what it wants is don't eat all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the damn grain today.</v>

980
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Save some for next year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right plan.</v>

981
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Act as if the future exists as part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social contract.</v>

982
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.180
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's such a discovery now.</v>

983
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 3>You know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

984
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:42.010
<v Speaker 3>it's only people who figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean squirrels have kind of it in some</v>

985
00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:43.940
<v Speaker 3>sense because they store up knots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

986
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:45.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean the squirrels and squirrels are</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart.</v>

987
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:48.860
<v Speaker 3>They just kind of got the inkling of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

988
00:50:48.861 --> 00:50:51.890
<v Speaker 3>And I think what squirrels do is they</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat all the nuts they can possibly eat</v>

989
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.050
<v Speaker 3>right now and then they store the rest</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

990
00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:56.930
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't go hungry to store nuts for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future,</v>

991
00:50:56.931 --> 00:50:59.810
<v Speaker 3>but human beings will do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't eat the seed grain.</v>

992
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause then you're going to die next</v>

993
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:03.381
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

994
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:06.170
<v Speaker 3>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so back to the hypothalamus.</v>

995
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:11.410
<v Speaker 3>Now you're doing something you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do and you're tracking how that's going.</v>

996
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Both of those are hypotheses by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden something happens</v>

997
00:51:16.371 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 3>that you don't want to have happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you live in Flint,</v>

998
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Michigan for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you decided to go have some water</v>

999
00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:24.020
<v Speaker 3>and it turns out it's not water at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's land.</v>

1000
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you guys know about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1001
00:51:25.941 --> 00:51:26.990
<v Speaker 3>but it's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite,</v>

1002
00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the sort of thing that makes</v>

1003
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:32.090
<v Speaker 3>your jaw drops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1004
00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:37.240
<v Speaker 3>the state is in big trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michigan and so they appointed an</v>

1005
00:51:37.251 --> 00:51:42.140
<v Speaker 3>auditor to control finances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe at the state level might have</v>

1006
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 3>only been at a city level but doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter,</v>

1007
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:47.090
<v Speaker 3>let's say the state level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the auditor was looking for ways to</v>

1008
00:51:47.091 --> 00:51:52.091
<v Speaker 3>save money and one way they decided to</v>
<v Speaker 3>save money was to re to hook up Flint</v>

1009
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Michigan's water supply to a river</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of to the Great Lake,</v>

1010
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:56.900
<v Speaker 3>which is what it's right beside.</v>

1011
00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:00.770
<v Speaker 3>It turns out since flint was at an</v>
<v Speaker 3>industrial center for forever,</v>

1012
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:05.360
<v Speaker 3>that the water's just plum full of lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now they have like 50,000 lead</v>

1013
00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 3>poisoned people living in Flint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michigan.</v>

1014
00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:11.810
<v Speaker 3>That is not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Led lowers your Iq rapidly and it makes</v>

1015
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:16.811
<v Speaker 3>you violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's for the $10,000 they saved,</v>

1016
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:19.730
<v Speaker 3>they probably cost themselves half a</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars per person.</v>

1017
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.320
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't actually that there was lead</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the water,</v>

1018
00:52:22.321 --> 00:52:24.350
<v Speaker 3>it's that the water was more acidic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1019
00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:26.150
<v Speaker 3>it took the lead out of the pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:27.013
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1021
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1022
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:28.910
<v Speaker 3>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good point.</v>

1023
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not here to complain about Michigan</v>

1024
00:52:32.091 --> 00:52:35.000
<v Speaker 3>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is is that just because</v>

1025
00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:36.830
<v Speaker 3>you think you're out for a drink of</v>
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

1026
00:52:36.831 --> 00:52:40.900
<v Speaker 3>that does not necessarily mean that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on and that's why I said</v>

1027
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.740
<v Speaker 3>you're comparing your vision of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future to what you think is going on</v>

1028
00:52:45.741 --> 00:52:46.520
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

1029
00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you read the the neuropsychologists</v>

1030
00:52:49.821 --> 00:52:52.490
<v Speaker 3>like vinegar Nova in Socal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often Jeffrey Gray,</v>

1031
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:56.270
<v Speaker 3>they're basically behaviorists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what they tell you is this,</v>

1032
00:52:56.271 --> 00:53:00.290
<v Speaker 3>and this is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they tell you is that you have this</v>

1033
00:53:00.291 --> 00:53:03.770
<v Speaker 3>little expectancy map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the map the rat has of his</v>

1034
00:53:03.771 --> 00:53:06.260
<v Speaker 3>surroundings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a spacial temporal map.</v>

1035
00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:09.710
<v Speaker 3>And so when you're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you expect a certain outcome.</v>

1036
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:11.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what?</v>

1037
00:53:11.211 --> 00:53:14.570
<v Speaker 3>You compare that to his reality as it</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfolds.</v>

1038
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could say you've got this map and</v>

1039
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:21.890
<v Speaker 3>then stimuli appeared to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those are objectively real.</v>

1040
00:53:21.891 --> 00:53:22.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1041
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:24.380
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wrong.</v>

1042
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.820
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interpretation everywhere.</v>

1043
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 3>You think you know what's going on right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and you think you know what you</v>

1044
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:32.520
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I'm making such a big</v>

1045
00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:36.900
<v Speaker 3>deal out of this is because look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a rat and you're going about</v>

1046
00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:39.000
<v Speaker 3>your business and something you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want happens,</v>

1047
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:44.210
<v Speaker 3>according to the gray behaviors model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to revamp your map,</v>

1048
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.180
<v Speaker 3>your expectancy map.</v>

1049
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.350
<v Speaker 3>But according to the bottle that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>proposing,</v>

1050
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:52.920
<v Speaker 3>it's way worse than that because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know where the damn mirror is.</v>

1051
00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:55.380
<v Speaker 3>It might be in your map of what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

1052
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 3>not what you expect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a different thing.</v>

1053
00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.090
<v Speaker 3>But it also might be in the map you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1054
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:05.040
<v Speaker 3>that's of the present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just the map that you have,</v>

1055
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a prediction of your actions that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>at fault.</v>

1056
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:10.290
<v Speaker 3>It could easily be the way that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>construing the World Right now.</v>

1057
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 3>And it could be error at any level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

1058
00:54:13.111 --> 00:54:16.020
<v Speaker 3>And so what it means is that when an</v>
<v Speaker 3>anomaly you'll occurs,</v>

1059
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:21.750
<v Speaker 3>it spreads doubt through the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy that we were describing,</v>

1060
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:26.310
<v Speaker 3>including the future and the present and</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the past.</v>

1061
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:27.720
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know this,</v>

1062
00:54:27.721 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 3>you know this perfectly well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see it when you encounter a</v>

1063
00:54:30.991 --> 00:54:35.600
<v Speaker 3>complex and normally so a complex</v>
<v Speaker 3>anomaly would be you have a longterm</v>

1064
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:37.710
<v Speaker 3>relationship and you get betrayed.</v>

1065
00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so betrayed means you've trusted</v>

1066
00:54:40.921 --> 00:54:45.921
<v Speaker 3>someone and they've enticed you to do so</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they exploit that trust and her</v>

1067
00:54:46.351 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 3>view for Dante that betrayers were in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lowest circle of hell.</v>

1068
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:54.720
<v Speaker 3>So it's a particularly nasty thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>to people because in some,</v>

1069
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think about trust as the</v>

1070
00:54:56.761 --> 00:54:58.950
<v Speaker 3>precondition for interpersonal</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships,</v>

1071
00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:02.130
<v Speaker 3>which it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then if someone acts towards you in a</v>

1072
00:55:02.131 --> 00:55:06.930
<v Speaker 3>way that violates your trust in trust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've done you the worst disservice</v>

1073
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.060
<v Speaker 3>that someone could possibly be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1074
00:55:09.061 --> 00:55:10.860
<v Speaker 3>So you get betrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1075
00:55:10.861 --> 00:55:12.480
<v Speaker 3>so bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an anomaly.</v>

1076
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:15.300
<v Speaker 3>What does it imply?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1077
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.570
<v Speaker 3>that's the wrong question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right question is what doesn't it</v>

1078
00:55:19.571 --> 00:55:22.710
<v Speaker 3>imply?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It implies that you just don't have the</v>

1079
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:26.400
<v Speaker 3>foggiest notion of what you're doing or</v>
<v Speaker 3>what human beings are like.</v>

1080
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.990
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1081
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.420
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's a particularly</v>
<v Speaker 3>vicious betrayal,</v>

1082
00:55:30.421 --> 00:55:32.940
<v Speaker 3>maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been suckered by a psychopath.</v>

1083
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:34.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1084
00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:36.870
<v Speaker 3>update your model and account for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

1085
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:40.680
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're naive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the probability that you'll be</v>

1086
00:55:40.681 --> 00:55:45.630
<v Speaker 3>able to reach down into the depths far</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to come up with a coherent</v>

1087
00:55:45.631 --> 00:55:48.240
<v Speaker 3>explanation for why someone would do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is very,</v>

1088
00:55:48.241 --> 00:55:49.590
<v Speaker 3>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1089
00:55:49.591 --> 00:55:52.920
<v Speaker 3>And what I've discovered in my clinical</v>
<v Speaker 3>practice is that if you get betrayed</v>

1090
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:56.310
<v Speaker 3>badly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only language that you can use to</v>

1091
00:55:56.311 --> 00:56:01.170
<v Speaker 3>describe it is fundamentally religious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At some points of of betrayal,</v>

1092
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.680
<v Speaker 3>it's good versus evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's malevolence and them.</v>

1093
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:08.340
<v Speaker 3>It's the malevolence that really</v>
<v Speaker 3>traumatizes people.</v>

1094
00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.400
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the fact that that person was out</v>

1095
00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:12.570
<v Speaker 3>to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1096
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.380
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1097
00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.510
<v Speaker 3>what's a human being like when they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of that?</v>

1098
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:17.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an age old question.</v>

1099
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Now I'll tell you something is weird and</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

1100
00:56:20.281 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 3>So there's this old idea in genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first idea,</v>

1101
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:29.020
<v Speaker 3>one of the first ideas in genesis is you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know that God made people a paradise to</v>

1102
00:56:29.021 --> 00:56:29.830
<v Speaker 3>live in.</v>

1103
00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's just be wild about this for a</v>

1104
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:36.220
<v Speaker 3>moment and assume that you're a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>model when it's going well is a little</v>

1105
00:56:36.221 --> 00:56:37.060
<v Speaker 3>paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1106
00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:39.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like the world's turning out the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way you want it to,</v>

1107
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.700
<v Speaker 3>but there's a snake in there somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that means,</v>

1108
00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.830
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is there a snake?</v>

1109
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a bunch of things you're</v>

1110
00:56:46.811 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 3>not paying attention to while you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going about your business,</v>

1111
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:50.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1112
00:56:50.351 --> 00:56:52.990
<v Speaker 3>there's almost an infinite number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you're not paying attention</v>

1113
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:55.420
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the problem is one of those infinite</v>

1114
00:56:55.421 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 3>number of things that you're not paying</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to.</v>

1115
00:56:57.401 --> 00:57:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Consumers shift on you all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so there's always a snake in the</v>

1116
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 3>garden and then you have to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 3>what to do with it.</v>

1117
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:07.090
<v Speaker 3>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you interact with the snake,</v>

1118
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:10.660
<v Speaker 3>you get more conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem with that is you lose</v>

1119
00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:11.830
<v Speaker 3>your little paradise.</v>

1120
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's worse than that because that</v>

1121
00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.680
<v Speaker 3>story is really old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have no idea how old it is.</v>

1122
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:23.010
<v Speaker 3>It's disseminated all over the world or</v>
<v Speaker 3>it emerged independently in different</v>

1123
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:24.610
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't really know.</v>

1124
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.200
<v Speaker 3>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

1125
00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 3>It's a fundamental enough story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tree plus snake plus people that no</v>

1126
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:33.940
<v Speaker 3>matter where you go with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people have tree snake stories.</v>

1127
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:36.460
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's because we lived in</v>

1128
00:57:36.461 --> 00:57:40.600
<v Speaker 3>trees for like 30 million years and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>got eaten by an awful lot of snakes.</v>

1129
00:57:40.601 --> 00:57:41.680
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1130
00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:45.970
<v Speaker 3>it's a story that really appeals to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every bloody science fiction movie</v>

1131
00:57:45.971 --> 00:57:47.380
<v Speaker 3>you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time,</v>

1132
00:57:47.381 --> 00:57:50.290
<v Speaker 3>if the aliens are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're always reptilian.</v>

1133
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:53.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you don't get Furry Little</v>

1134
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Koala aliens that are chasing you</v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

1135
00:57:55.301 --> 00:57:57.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the ones that alien,</v>

1136
00:57:57.281 --> 00:58:00.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a reptile inside a reptile,</v>

1137
00:58:00.071 --> 00:58:02.860
<v Speaker 3>they're nasty beasts and they come out</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of you even,</v>

1138
00:58:02.861 --> 00:58:05.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is another symbolic idea.</v>

1139
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:06.881
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1140
00:58:06.881 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 3>so you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've always got the damn snake and</v>

1141
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.420
<v Speaker 3>it's popping out to all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing you can do about it</v>

1142
00:58:13.421 --> 00:58:16.450
<v Speaker 3>except get ready to deal with snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No getting rid of them.</v>

1143
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's the first lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting rid of the damn</v>

1144
00:58:19.571 --> 00:58:22.240
<v Speaker 3>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You better learn to deal with them.</v>

1145
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Then the next question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the worst possible snake?</v>

1146
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that happened in</v>

1147
00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was influenced in part by</v>

1148
00:58:31.361 --> 00:58:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Zoroastrianism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the idea of almost an independent</v>

1149
00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.330
<v Speaker 3>eval arose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1150
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact there was a branch of</v>

1151
00:58:38.801 --> 00:58:43.801
<v Speaker 3>Christianity called Mannequin that</v>
<v Speaker 3>construed the world as a battle between</v>

1152
00:58:43.871 --> 00:58:46.960
<v Speaker 3>good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where good and evil had equal reality</v>

1153
00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.860
<v Speaker 3>and they were in this eternal battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that got wiped out by,</v>

1154
00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the standard Christian theory,</v>

1155
00:58:52.751 --> 00:58:55.840
<v Speaker 3>that evil is actually just the absence</v>
<v Speaker 3>of good,</v>

1156
00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 3>which anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have a big debate about that and</v>

1157
00:58:58.661 --> 00:59:00.070
<v Speaker 3>people have for thousands of years.</v>

1158
00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:04.870
<v Speaker 3>But as Christianity developed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this weird mythology that grew</v>

1159
00:59:04.871 --> 00:59:09.871
<v Speaker 3>up around the weird myth in genesis and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weird mythology was that the snake</v>

1160
00:59:09.971 --> 00:59:14.650
<v Speaker 3>in the garden of Eden was also sake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he's the king of all evil.</v>

1161
00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:15.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1162
00:59:15.521 --> 00:59:17.680
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty straight forward.</v>

1163
00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:20.770
<v Speaker 3>What's the worst predator?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1164
00:59:20.771 --> 00:59:22.670
<v Speaker 3>that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst predators,</v>

1165
00:59:22.671 --> 00:59:26.450
<v Speaker 3>a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the worst of all possible snakes</v>

1166
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:30.740
<v Speaker 3>is the most malevolent possible being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly right.</v>

1167
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.690
<v Speaker 3>And that's why that association was</v>
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>

1168
00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:35.300
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's so interesting because it took</v>

1169
00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:38.150
<v Speaker 3>people like thousands of years to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>that association,</v>

1170
00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:40.430
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't really put together well</v>

1171
00:59:40.431 --> 00:59:43.160
<v Speaker 3>until Milton formalized it in paradise</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost.</v>

1172
00:59:43.161 --> 00:59:46.970
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like we kind of observe this</v>
<v Speaker 3>in action.</v>

1173
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there were bad people.</v>

1174
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so bad is a category.</v>

1175
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:55.910
<v Speaker 3>But what is bad entail while mythologies</v>
<v Speaker 3>of eval center in on the central</v>

1176
00:59:55.911 --> 00:59:58.750
<v Speaker 3>features of what constitutes bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1177
00:59:58.751 --> 01:00:01.100
<v Speaker 3>and carnivorous might be one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1178
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Money malevolent out to hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1179
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Be trail lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the cardinal you could take of the</v>

1180
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:08.751
<v Speaker 3>cardinal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1181
01:00:08.751 --> 01:00:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Since that's the worst snake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while it's a psychologize aviation of</v>

1182
01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:15.050
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1183
01:00:15.051 --> 01:00:20.051
<v Speaker 3>it's even more sophisticated than that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because one branch of that theory is</v>

1184
01:00:20.661 --> 01:00:24.970
<v Speaker 3>that the worst Predator is the evil</v>
<v Speaker 3>force outside of you.</v>

1185
01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:29.000
<v Speaker 3>But the next branch of that is that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>worst proud Predator is the evil force</v>

1186
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.710
<v Speaker 3>within you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1187
01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 3>well that's when it gets really</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologized we take,</v>

1188
01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:34.340
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1189
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:36.800
<v Speaker 3>is that superstition?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1190
01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not superstition,</v>

1191
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.360
<v Speaker 3>boys and girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot more intelligent than that.</v>

1192
01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:45.440
<v Speaker 3>It's the most sophisticated theory of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way things work that we have and</v>

1193
01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:48.680
<v Speaker 3>it's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what that means from a metaphysical</v>

1194
01:00:48.681 --> 01:00:51.410
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to talk about that</v>

1195
01:00:51.411 --> 01:00:54.260
<v Speaker 3>because we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can certainly talk about what it</v>

1196
01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:56.780
<v Speaker 3>means in practical Darwinian terms.</v>

1197
01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.800
<v Speaker 3>You better know what's after you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the worst thing that can possibly be</v>

1198
01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:05.120
<v Speaker 3>after you is a fully motivated and</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely malevolent human being.</v>

1199
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:06.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1200
01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.110
<v Speaker 3>skull crushing cats be damned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1201
01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:12.320
<v Speaker 3>all they want to do is eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to torture you.</v>

1202
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:15.320
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you fall into the hands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrong human being,</v>

1203
01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:17.450
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be an excruciating pain for</v>

1204
01:01:17.451 --> 01:01:21.380
<v Speaker 3>the next 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people are very imaginative when they</v>

1205
01:01:21.381 --> 01:01:25.640
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to hurt someone and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can keep it up for a long time and</v>

1206
01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:28.400
<v Speaker 3>they're fully motivated to do so under</v>
<v Speaker 3>some conditions.</v>

1207
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.850
<v Speaker 3>And so you really got to watch out for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1208
01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:33.890
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1209
01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:38.630
<v Speaker 3>so back to the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you have a mismatch between what</v>

1210
01:01:38.631 --> 01:01:43.520
<v Speaker 3>you desire and what you're after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the hippocampus says,</v>

1211
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.620
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know where we are.</v>

1212
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:48.290
<v Speaker 3>That's what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You no longer know where you are.</v>

1213
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what should you do when you don't know</v>

1214
01:01:49.761 --> 01:01:52.700
<v Speaker 3>where you are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should stop moving and then you</v>

1215
01:01:52.701 --> 01:01:54.980
<v Speaker 3>should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then what?</v>

1216
01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:56.900
<v Speaker 3>They should prepare to do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1217
01:01:56.901 --> 01:01:57.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then one,</v>

1218
01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.750
<v Speaker 3>then you should explore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1219
01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:01.730
<v Speaker 3>that's where the other half of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothalamus comes in.</v>

1220
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:06.110
<v Speaker 3>That dopaminergic circuit that mediates</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive emotion,</v>

1221
01:02:06.111 --> 01:02:08.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost all the positive emotion that you</v>

1222
01:02:08.121 --> 01:02:10.310
<v Speaker 3>experience in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind you like,</v>

1223
01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.220
<v Speaker 3>which is hope and curiosity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>expectation and,</v>

1224
01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 3>and surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1225
01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.440
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's all mediated by the</v>

1226
01:02:18.441 --> 01:02:22.200
<v Speaker 3>dopaminergic systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a major league contributor to your,</v>

1227
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:26.220
<v Speaker 3>to the totality of your being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in a positive direction</v>

1228
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.150
<v Speaker 3>that's rooted in the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means is that it's</v>

1229
01:02:30.151 --> 01:02:33.360
<v Speaker 3>quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got your fundamental motivations,</v>

1230
01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your basic blood biological motivations.</v>

1231
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fail.</v>

1232
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:38.640
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anxiety.</v>

1233
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:43.200
<v Speaker 3>That's a newer system and exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an older system.</v>

1234
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:46.140
<v Speaker 3>That damn exploratory system has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>there forever.</v>

1235
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Now if you look at classic hero</v>
<v Speaker 3>mythology,</v>

1236
01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:55.401
<v Speaker 3>which we're going to do in great detail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you see is that the typical myth of</v>

1237
01:02:56.011 --> 01:03:01.011
<v Speaker 3>it of humanity is we live in a place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll say we have to live in a place and</v>

1238
01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:04.440
<v Speaker 3>the place is doing quite nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>

1239
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:07.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like the hobbits and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1240
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:09.840
<v Speaker 3>Frodo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1241
01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:11.190
<v Speaker 3>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Lord for the,</v>

1242
01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:12.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it called?</v>

1243
01:03:12.301 --> 01:03:13.650
<v Speaker 3>The hobbit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hobbit.</v>

1244
01:03:13.651 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you've got a little shy or they're</v>

1245
01:03:15.331 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all peaceful.</v>

1246
01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:19.770
<v Speaker 3>It's full of these little people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little on the arrogant side.</v>

1247
01:03:19.771 --> 01:03:22.470
<v Speaker 3>They're kind of dopey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have no idea what the hell is going</v>

1248
01:03:22.471 --> 01:03:24.690
<v Speaker 3>on in the outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they think that's okay.</v>

1249
01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:25.291
<v Speaker 3>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1250
01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1251
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.390
<v Speaker 3>peculiar people are concerned about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing and they got their little</v>

1252
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:33.430
<v Speaker 3>happy paradise going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They live a long time,</v>

1253
01:03:33.431 --> 01:03:34.410
<v Speaker 3>they eat a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1254
01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:36.120
<v Speaker 3>they party a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1255
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.170
<v Speaker 3>unbeknownst to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very interesting feature of the</v>

1256
01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:42.240
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason they have any peace at</v>

1257
01:03:42.241 --> 01:03:45.150
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because they are descendants of old</v>

1258
01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:48.330
<v Speaker 3>kings continually patrolling the</v>
<v Speaker 3>borders.</v>

1259
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the striders Eric Gordon,</v>

1260
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:55.410
<v Speaker 3>he's the member of the race of old kings</v>
<v Speaker 3>who patrols the borders.</v>

1261
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Well those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are ancestral figures.</v>

1262
01:03:58.381 --> 01:04:00.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can all sit here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your little happy paradise,</v>

1263
01:04:00.751 --> 01:04:05.670
<v Speaker 3>but the only reason you can do it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the sons of great kings have put</v>

1264
01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:10.270
<v Speaker 3>borders around your kingdom and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's funny cause in the Harbutt</v>

1265
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:13.690
<v Speaker 3>that hobbits basically despise strider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1266
01:04:13.691 --> 01:04:15.600
<v Speaker 3>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very suspicious of him.</v>

1267
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.170
<v Speaker 3>He's kind of dirty and dusty and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like he's been banged around all</v>

1268
01:04:19.171 --> 01:04:20.850
<v Speaker 3>over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sort of like a trout.</v>

1269
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the son of a great king.</v>

1270
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:25.320
<v Speaker 3>Good thing for them that he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

1271
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you've got the little Shyer and</v>

1272
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 3>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Evil things are stirring.</v>

1273
01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.490
<v Speaker 3>And what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1274
01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:35.790
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally it's a great dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a snake,</v>

1275
01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 3>except it's like medicine snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1276
01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:38.610
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1277
01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:42.510
<v Speaker 3>it's snake with fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can be sure that fire was not</v>

1278
01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:45.330
<v Speaker 3>only one of our greatest allies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of our greatest enemies,</v>

1279
01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:47.760
<v Speaker 3>especially when we lived on the belt in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>

1280
01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Cause that thing would burn now in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1281
01:04:50.461 --> 01:04:54.030
<v Speaker 3>and so get the hell away from that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1282
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>

1283
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:59.610
<v Speaker 3>so one hobbit who's woken up by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wizard,</v>

1284
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wizard is a symbol of the self from</v>

1285
01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:05.670
<v Speaker 3>the union perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's one hobbit who's a little bit</v>

1286
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:07.980
<v Speaker 3>more creative and exploratory than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rest.</v>

1287
01:05:07.981 --> 01:05:09.540
<v Speaker 3>And everybody has little respect for</v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

1288
01:05:09.541 --> 01:05:11.190
<v Speaker 3>but they think he's pretty damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>peculiar.</v>

1289
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:14.670
<v Speaker 3>He decides that he's going to under the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tutelage of the wizard,</v>

1290
01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:19.030
<v Speaker 3>he's going to go check out this dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he leaves the borders and he goes out</v>

1291
01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:22.600
<v Speaker 3>into that unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the rest of it is an adventure.</v>

1292
01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:24.310
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that's very</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting,</v>

1293
01:05:24.311 --> 01:05:27.190
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a union perspective is that what is</v>

1294
01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:30.250
<v Speaker 3>the hobbit have to become in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>conquer the Dragon?</v>

1295
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:33.503
<v Speaker 2>A thief.</v>

1296
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.110
<v Speaker 3>Now that's pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

1297
01:05:35.111 --> 01:05:36.160
<v Speaker 3>because you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1298
01:05:36.161 --> 01:05:38.350
<v Speaker 3>this guy's out to be a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you should be a hero.</v>

1299
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.184
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1300
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:42.400
<v Speaker 3>he turns into a thief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1301
01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because if you're going to conquer</v>

1302
01:05:44.261 --> 01:05:47.830
<v Speaker 3>a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better be a hell of a lot tougher</v>

1303
01:05:47.831 --> 01:05:51.850
<v Speaker 3>than you are naive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so partly what happens is that for</v>

1304
01:05:51.851 --> 01:05:55.600
<v Speaker 3>the hobbit to muster up the forces that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are necessary for him to confront</v>

1305
01:05:55.601 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that is that fundamental,</v>

1306
01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:03.240
<v Speaker 3>he has to transcend his coward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you call it?</v>

1307
01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.730
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cowardice that he describes as</v>

1308
01:06:06.731 --> 01:06:08.140
<v Speaker 3>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1309
01:06:08.141 --> 01:06:09.550
<v Speaker 3>so Nisha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1310
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.560
<v Speaker 3>each is often viewed as a critic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>critic,</v>

1311
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:15.040
<v Speaker 3>critic of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's not true.</v>

1312
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:18.310
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because nature identifies morality with</v>

1313
01:06:18.311 --> 01:06:20.320
<v Speaker 3>cowardice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not what he does.</v>

1314
01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 3>What to says is this.</v>

1315
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 3>If you're too afraid to do something so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't do it,</v>

1316
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:32.230
<v Speaker 3>then you'll say that the reason that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do it is because your moral.</v>

1317
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.530
<v Speaker 3>That's not the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason is it's you're too damn</v>

1318
01:06:35.531 --> 01:06:37.720
<v Speaker 3>afraid to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might want to,</v>

1319
01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:40.540
<v Speaker 3>but you're too afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make you moral.</v>

1320
01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:43.200
<v Speaker 3>So what happens to the Harbutt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1321
01:06:43.201 --> 01:06:48.201
<v Speaker 3>is once he gets outside the kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he asked to develop a whole array of</v>

1322
01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:52.390
<v Speaker 3>potentials that he never developed</v>
<v Speaker 3>before because they were either not</v>

1323
01:06:52.391 --> 01:06:57.391
<v Speaker 3>necessary in his civilized place or</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were forbidden as immoral</v>

1324
01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:01.300
<v Speaker 3>by the cultural situation that he grew</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in.</v>

1325
01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:02.493
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1326
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:07.450
<v Speaker 3>think you have to be touched by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be touched by the snake in</v>

1327
01:07:07.451 --> 01:07:10.840
<v Speaker 3>order to defeat the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where else have you seen that motif?</v>

1328
01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:13.630
<v Speaker 3>It's Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1329
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harry Potter's a strange character</v>

1330
01:07:15.701 --> 01:07:17.020
<v Speaker 3>because he's not obedient.</v>

1331
01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1332
01:07:18.371 --> 01:07:21.850
<v Speaker 3>he's quite disobedient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he breaks the rules in the service</v>

1333
01:07:21.851 --> 01:07:26.290
<v Speaker 3>of higher morality and the higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>morality is that he faces down the</v>

1334
01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:29.800
<v Speaker 3>dragon that paralyzes you and he frees</v>
<v Speaker 3>the virgin.</v>

1335
01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:32.920
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens with Ginny Virginia</v>
<v Speaker 3>Virgin.</v>

1336
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:35.410
<v Speaker 3>It's the retelling of Saint George and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dragon.</v>

1337
01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.000
<v Speaker 3>And interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that Harry Potter revivified</v>

1338
01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:44.030
<v Speaker 3>is because the double doors phoenix</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes by and cries in his wounds while</v>

1339
01:07:45.911 --> 01:07:48.430
<v Speaker 3>the Phoenix is something that dies in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his reborn.</v>

1340
01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:52.750
<v Speaker 3>And so the men have myth underlying the</v>
<v Speaker 3>second volume of the Harry Potter series</v>

1341
01:07:52.751 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 3>is that the part of you that sustains</v>
<v Speaker 3>you through an encounter with the</v>

1342
01:07:56.741 --> 01:07:59.500
<v Speaker 3>dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that paralyzes is the part of you that</v>

1343
01:07:59.501 --> 01:08:03.490
<v Speaker 3>can die and be reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what that means in a sense is if</v>

1344
01:08:03.491 --> 01:08:06.520
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong about something and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>fall into a pit,</v>

1345
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.940
<v Speaker 3>then you should let go of what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong about so that something new can</v>

1346
01:08:09.941 --> 01:08:10.774
<v Speaker 3>arise.</v>

1347
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.050
<v Speaker 3>And so it's better to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better to be the thing that</v>

1348
01:08:14.051 --> 01:08:19.051
<v Speaker 3>transforms in response to catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it is the thing that's static.</v>

1349
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's another big discovery of</v>

1350
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:23.350
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are,</v>

1351
01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.150
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're agents of transformation,</v>

1352
01:08:26.151 --> 01:08:30.050
<v Speaker 3>which is of course why kids are so</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloody obsessed with magicians and</v>

1353
01:08:30.051 --> 01:08:32.600
<v Speaker 3>wizards who are agents of</v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

1354
01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.550
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's all embedded in the</v>

1355
01:08:34.551 --> 01:08:36.130
<v Speaker 3>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all acted out.</v>

1356
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Nobody understands this sort of thing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak of.</v>

1357
01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Certainly the kids don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just hits them,</v>

1358
01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they can recognize the pattern.</v>

1359
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.860
<v Speaker 3>They know that there's something magic</v>
<v Speaker 3>about them.</v>

1360
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:49.340
<v Speaker 3>Even though they're living in a cupboard</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a London suburb where everything is</v>

1361
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:54.020
<v Speaker 3>boring and flat and under control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the real world.</v>

1362
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:55.370
<v Speaker 3>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1363
01:08:56.230 --> 01:09:01.230
<v Speaker 4>Is that why we have more patients or</v>
<v Speaker 4>people including criminals who say who</v>

1364
01:09:03.641 --> 01:09:07.360
<v Speaker 4>admit their crime</v>
<v Speaker 4>selves?</v>

1365
01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh well not only no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know more patients we off often have</v>

1366
01:09:10.781 --> 01:09:12.970
<v Speaker 3>admiration for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1367
01:09:12.971 --> 01:09:17.971
<v Speaker 3>I mean like how many movies feature up</v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive bad guy while or for that</v>

1368
01:09:18.671 --> 01:09:21.100
<v Speaker 3>matter it attractive bad woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1369
01:09:21.101 --> 01:09:23.680
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because it's because of the</v>

1370
01:09:23.681 --> 01:09:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Nietzschean observation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people who are good aren't good.</v>

1371
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:31.360
<v Speaker 3>They're just cowers where's the guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's bad?</v>

1372
01:09:31.361 --> 01:09:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Well at least he's not a coward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then you might say,</v>

1373
01:09:34.331 --> 01:09:35.140
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1374
01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could stop being empowered and also</v>

1375
01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:40.150
<v Speaker 3>become a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean that's often,</v>

1376
01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.510
<v Speaker 3>often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not always the actual plot of the</v>

1377
01:09:43.511 --> 01:09:46.120
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's the redemption of the bad</v>

1378
01:09:46.121 --> 01:09:47.140
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1379
01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:50.860
<v Speaker 3>It's also what women fantasize about in</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the beauty and beast</v>

1380
01:09:50.861 --> 01:09:53.170
<v Speaker 3>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want the coward.</v>

1381
01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.240
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy that wants to be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>

1382
01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.440
<v Speaker 3>It's complete bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bad guys in advance over that,</v>

1383
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.110
<v Speaker 3>but not a big enough advance because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a bad guy.</v>

1384
01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:05.230
<v Speaker 3>The best thing you want is a civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad guy.</v>

1385
01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:06.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1386
01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:10.690
<v Speaker 3>no wonder because it's only a civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad guy that's going to be capable of</v>

1387
01:10:10.691 --> 01:10:15.220
<v Speaker 3>dealing with the dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right Lloyd Axworthy.</v>

1388
01:10:15.221 --> 01:10:18.010
<v Speaker 3>When he was the minister of Foreign</v>
<v Speaker 3>Affairs for Canada,</v>

1389
01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:20.470
<v Speaker 3>we know all the massacres were going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Yugoslavia.</v>

1390
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:25.130
<v Speaker 3>It was front page news at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was during the ethnic cleansings.</v>

1391
01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:27.580
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the imagination for that</v>

1392
01:10:27.581 --> 01:10:28.990
<v Speaker 3>kind of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1393
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:30.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's really impressive,</v>

1394
01:10:30.581 --> 01:10:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Mr. Minister of foreign affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you ever read about the Holocaust?</v>

1395
01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's time to wake up a little bit.</v>

1396
01:10:36.611 --> 01:10:39.580
<v Speaker 3>These things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said it has a moral claim.</v>

1397
01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.100
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't imagine that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing happening.</v>

1398
01:10:42.101 --> 01:10:43.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1399
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:44.770
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a little on the naive side,</v>

1400
01:10:44.771 --> 01:10:47.440
<v Speaker 3>aren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And parading that around his morality is</v>

1401
01:10:47.441 --> 01:10:49.360
<v Speaker 3>not a reasonable thing to do.</v>

1402
01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.970
<v Speaker 3>When you also happened to be minister of</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign affairs,</v>

1403
01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.240
<v Speaker 3>it's like you should be looking out for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the snakes all at the time cause they're</v>

1404
01:10:55.241 --> 01:10:59.230
<v Speaker 3>definitely out there and Milosevic was</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely one of them.</v>

1405
01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:03.760
<v Speaker 3>And so if a naive person meets someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

1406
01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:08.740
<v Speaker 3>the naive person loses and that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>good because there were lots of people</v>

1407
01:11:08.741 --> 01:11:10.570
<v Speaker 3>like that and be better if they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>win.</v>

1408
01:11:11.170 --> 01:11:14.550
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the hypothalamic,</v>

1409
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:18.720
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the exploratory circuitry</v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually embedded right into the</v>

1410
01:11:18.721 --> 01:11:22.380
<v Speaker 3>hypothalamus way down there with like</v>
<v Speaker 3>lust and thirst and hunger.</v>

1411
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:26.160
<v Speaker 3>It's so great because it shows you how</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mythology works.</v>

1412
01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:27.540
<v Speaker 3>It basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1413
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:31.140
<v Speaker 3>here's a bunch of things you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and then something will go wrong.</v>

1414
01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a system to deal with things</v>

1415
01:11:33.571 --> 01:11:35.310
<v Speaker 3>when they go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the system?</v>

1416
01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:37.500
<v Speaker 3>While it might kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bang better,</v>

1417
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:39.600
<v Speaker 3>have some pain and anxiety to protect</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1418
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Well you better figure out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1419
01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Better have an exploratory system so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can go out there and gather</v>

1420
01:11:45.121 --> 01:11:47.670
<v Speaker 3>some more information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While that's,</v>

1421
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 3>that's the human story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gather information in the face of</v>

1422
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:54.030
<v Speaker 3>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the human story.</v>

1423
01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:56.910
<v Speaker 3>That's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1424
01:11:56.911 --> 01:11:59.730
<v Speaker 3>and that's the hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the hero myth is a redemptive,</v>

1425
01:11:59.731 --> 01:12:02.700
<v Speaker 3>and that's because it is redemptive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is what works.</v>

1426
01:12:02.701 --> 01:12:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Or at least that's what we've staked our</v>
<v Speaker 3>being on.</v>

1427
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.421
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

1428
01:12:06.421 --> 01:12:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Maybe all of this exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just get us in trouble.</v>

1429
01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:10.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another part of Genesis,</v>

1430
01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:13.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poke around and see what happens.</v>

1431
01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:14.281
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1432
01:12:14.281 --> 01:12:17.520
<v Speaker 3>you're doing that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in your little paradise battling</v>

1433
01:12:17.521 --> 01:12:20.550
<v Speaker 3>away all happily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you just can't stop yourself</v>

1434
01:12:20.551 --> 01:12:23.430
<v Speaker 3>from pulling on a thread somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you find out,</v>

1435
01:12:23.431 --> 01:12:24.570
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1436
01:12:24.571 --> 01:12:27.790
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's when you get suspicious</v>
<v Speaker 3>about your partner cheating on using</v>

1437
01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.440
<v Speaker 3>maybe this person cheating on me and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't leave it alone.</v>

1438
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.540
<v Speaker 3>You can't leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to go look at the snake.</v>

1439
01:12:33.541 --> 01:12:36.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns out it's there down.</v>

1440
01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.390
<v Speaker 3>You go into the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1441
01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.260
<v Speaker 3>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1442
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:41.850
<v Speaker 3>maybe ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1443
01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.430
<v Speaker 3>maybe the bliss of ignorance would have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been better.</v>

1444
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like psychologists don't tell</v>

1445
01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:50.640
<v Speaker 3>you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those positive illusion people,</v>

1446
01:12:50.641 --> 01:12:54.870
<v Speaker 3>that's their whole shtick is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better to be little bit dumb about</v>

1447
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:57.540
<v Speaker 3>how things work cause otherwise there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way you can be happy.</v>

1448
01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's an idiotic theory on</v>
<v Speaker 3>two accounts.</v>

1449
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.580
<v Speaker 3>A happy isn't the point and be dumb is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the goal.</v>

1450
01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.590
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1451
01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:08.790
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>

1452
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:11.550
<v Speaker 3>it's so ignorant that it's actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt,</v>

1453
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:14.670
<v Speaker 3>which is really saying something because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be pretty damn making rent</v>

1454
01:13:14.671 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 3>before you get to corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a hell of a thing to teach</v>

1455
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:19.374
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1456
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to delude yourself in a minor</v>

1457
01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you can't stand being alive.</v>

1458
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's awful.</v>

1459
01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:29.790
<v Speaker 3>That's really awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like here's a different story.</v>

1460
01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Maybe your Dick Tough enough to open</v>
<v Speaker 3>your eyes.</v>

1461
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:35.100
<v Speaker 3>I'd be a much better story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's possible to,</v>

1462
01:13:35.101 --> 01:13:37.080
<v Speaker 3>cause people are really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1463
01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:39.570
<v Speaker 3>really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just they live in these little</v>

1464
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:41.160
<v Speaker 3>protected places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1465
01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.980
<v Speaker 3>and they never get out there and hammer</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves out against the world.</v>

1466
01:13:43.981 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 3>So they never discovered that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough.</v>

1467
01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.880
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you might think,</v>

1468
01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.140
<v Speaker 3>well that's your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1469
01:13:49.141 --> 01:13:50.610
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not my damn opinion.</v>

1470
01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:53.640
<v Speaker 3>We know that if you take someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>naive and and,</v>

1471
01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:58.320
<v Speaker 3>and paralyzed by anxiety and you put</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in psychotherapy and you expose</v>

1472
01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:02.400
<v Speaker 3>them to the things that they're afraid</v>
<v Speaker 3>of or disgusted by end avoiding that it</v>

1473
01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:05.940
<v Speaker 3>isn't that they get less afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get more confident.</v>

1474
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.070
<v Speaker 3>And that's what generalizes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1475
01:14:08.071 --> 01:14:10.470
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you bring somebody who's got a mouse</v>

1476
01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.080
<v Speaker 3>phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>need them house for the year,</v>

1477
01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:14.410
<v Speaker 3>then they're not ever afraid of a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of other things.</v>

1478
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Why does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1479
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:19.960
<v Speaker 3>they weren't afraid of the damn mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're afraid of their own inadequacy</v>

1480
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 3>and then you teach them that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be afraid and they think,</v>

1481
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.120
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to be afraid.</v>

1482
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.250
<v Speaker 3>And then they're not afraid of a whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of things.</v>

1483
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:30.610
<v Speaker 3>And so you get generalization from</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavioral exposure.</v>

1484
01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.750
<v Speaker 3>And so it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no question about whether or not</v>

1485
01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:37.390
<v Speaker 3>exposure to the things that you avoid is</v>
<v Speaker 3>curative.</v>

1486
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.610
<v Speaker 3>It's the fundamental axiom of</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychotherapy.</v>

1487
01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.530
<v Speaker 3>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And figuring out what you're going to do</v>

1488
01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:44.470
<v Speaker 3>with your future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even in psychoanalysis,</v>

1489
01:14:44.471 --> 01:14:46.300
<v Speaker 3>it's face what threatens you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1490
01:14:46.301 --> 01:14:50.110
<v Speaker 3>It's just that the psychoanalyst tend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go after past traumas,</v>

1491
01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.420
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't matter as far as your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>is concerned.</v>

1492
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.440
<v Speaker 3>A dangerous thing in the past is exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing as a dangerous thing in</v>

1493
01:14:56.441 --> 01:14:59.590
<v Speaker 3>the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems to be partly because the</v>

1494
01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:01.600
<v Speaker 3>Amygdala doesn't have any sense of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1495
01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.270
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because one of the</v>

1496
01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:08.320
<v Speaker 3>things young observed was that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no time in the collective unconscious.</v>

1497
01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:13.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like everything is in eternal now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you got traumatized when</v>

1498
01:15:13.901 --> 01:15:16.510
<v Speaker 3>you were a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your age you're in and make the growth.</v>

1499
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you got bit by a spider or some</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn thing.</v>

1500
01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:21.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're afraid of that spider</v>
<v Speaker 3>then and now.</v>

1501
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:26.050
<v Speaker 3>And in the future it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's outside of time.</v>

1502
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Hippocampus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the thing that's dealing with time.</v>

1503
01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:32.020
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really learn a lesson,</v>

1504
01:15:32.021 --> 01:15:35.950
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to be timeless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While you know you can still help people</v>

1505
01:15:35.951 --> 01:15:38.830
<v Speaker 3>overcome their phobias,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he can't get their damn Amygdala to</v>

1506
01:15:38.831 --> 01:15:39.664
<v Speaker 3>shrink again.</v>

1507
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:42.460
<v Speaker 3>So you can just get it back under</v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

1508
01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty cool.</v>

1509
01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:50.680
<v Speaker 3>And then we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go up a level or two.</v>

1510
01:15:50.681 --> 01:15:52.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's look at the Amygdala for a minute.</v>

1511
01:15:52.511 --> 01:15:57.511
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>things about the Amygdala have probably</v>

1512
01:15:58.001 --> 01:16:01.360
<v Speaker 3>changed since I updated my knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't really matter because the</v>

1513
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 3>fundamental systems I'm telling you</v>
<v Speaker 3>about exist.</v>

1514
01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:07.810
<v Speaker 3>And they keep moving around in the brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we don't know exactly how they</v>

1515
01:16:07.811 --> 01:16:10.660
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at a system level of description,</v>

1516
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and with the,</v>

1517
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:15.550
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a system level of description and</v>

1518
01:16:15.551 --> 01:16:19.930
<v Speaker 3>using slightly vague neuro psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can localize these sorts of things in</v>

1519
01:16:19.931 --> 01:16:21.100
<v Speaker 3>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1520
01:16:21.101 --> 01:16:23.530
<v Speaker 3>So the Amygdala gets inputs from</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

1521
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:27.850
<v Speaker 3>And basically what it's looking for is</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that might threaten you.</v>

1522
01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.630
<v Speaker 3>And I would say the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say in a sense that they'll</v>

1523
01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:35.680
<v Speaker 3>make the law has a inbuilt sense of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>monstrous.</v>

1524
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:39.910
<v Speaker 3>And let me show you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a good time to show you,</v>

1525
01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:40.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1526
01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.610
<v Speaker 3>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little comic.</v>

1527
01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.750
<v Speaker 3>This is a great comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone stoned came up with this comic</v>

1528
01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:49.860
<v Speaker 3>and they really did cause it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1529
01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:50.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>head comic,</v>

1530
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:52.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>underground cartoon comic.</v>

1531
01:16:52.781 --> 01:16:56.410
<v Speaker 3>But I really liked this comic because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just shows you what's going on</v>

1532
01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:57.250
<v Speaker 3>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1533
01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:59.580
<v Speaker 3>So there's these hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1534
01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.960
<v Speaker 3>they're all friends of this guy named</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat Freddy and,</v>

1535
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:02.883
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1536
01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:06.430
<v Speaker 3>they're basically useless hippies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't pay rent and they only do</v>

1537
01:17:06.431 --> 01:17:08.230
<v Speaker 3>smoke pot in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1538
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:11.720
<v Speaker 3>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one point they make a bunch of money</v>

1539
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:16.340
<v Speaker 3>on some cocaine deal and they buy this</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole mouth in the country and they</v>

1540
01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:18.020
<v Speaker 3>think they're going to go out there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in paradise.</v>

1541
01:17:18.021 --> 01:17:22.040
<v Speaker 3>And so they bring their catalog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fat Freddy's cow who has his</v>

1542
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.110
<v Speaker 3>own adventures with cockroaches and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1543
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:26.900
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've ever had a cat,</v>

1544
01:17:26.901 --> 01:17:29.450
<v Speaker 3>one thing you knew about cats is they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like to move.</v>

1545
01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.570
<v Speaker 3>It makes it very upset and nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you put them in a new house,</v>

1546
01:17:32.571 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 3>they are not happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is you've blown</v>

1547
01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:36.440
<v Speaker 3>their map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1548
01:17:36.441 --> 01:17:41.441
<v Speaker 3>It's like the cat will slink around in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>new territory and map every single place</v>

1549
01:17:41.721 --> 01:17:43.550
<v Speaker 3>in every hiding place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1550
01:17:43.551 --> 01:17:47.060
<v Speaker 3>obsessively till it knows what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hell's going on and then it'll find me.</v>

1551
01:17:47.061 --> 01:17:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a cat in a new place is not a common</v>

1552
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:53.720
<v Speaker 3>cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A cat in a new place is a nervous cat.</v>

1553
01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is also indication that you don't</v>

1554
01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:59.720
<v Speaker 3>have to learn to be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you have to learn is how to be</v>

1555
01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:02.270
<v Speaker 3>calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that reverses the way that</v>

1556
01:18:02.271 --> 01:18:05.990
<v Speaker 3>psychologists generally talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety because they're all hobbits and</v>

1557
01:18:05.991 --> 01:18:07.700
<v Speaker 3>they think that life is safe.</v>

1558
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:09.920
<v Speaker 3>And so they think that because life is</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe,</v>

1559
01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:12.500
<v Speaker 3>you have to learn to be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's dopey.</v>

1560
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:16.220
<v Speaker 3>The natural condition is terror and</v>
<v Speaker 3>curiosity.</v>

1561
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:20.210
<v Speaker 3>And if you're really lucky now and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're somewhere safe enough so that you</v>

1562
01:18:20.211 --> 01:18:23.990
<v Speaker 3>don't have to be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's tenuous and delicate.</v>

1563
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.930
<v Speaker 3>And so what you have to learn is how not</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be afraid,</v>

1564
01:18:26.931 --> 01:18:31.250
<v Speaker 3>not how to be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1565
01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:33.380
<v Speaker 3>they got the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's in his box and they take</v>

1566
01:18:33.381 --> 01:18:36.920
<v Speaker 3>them out of the box and the cat thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is the country.</v>

1567
01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:39.650
<v Speaker 3>And then the cat goes real low and start</v>
<v Speaker 3>sniffing.</v>

1568
01:18:39.651 --> 01:18:44.651
<v Speaker 3>And that is what animals do when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>first start exploring both of those</v>

1569
01:18:44.661 --> 01:18:46.970
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they crouched down and that makes them</v>

1570
01:18:46.971 --> 01:18:49.430
<v Speaker 3>less visible to predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they sniff.</v>

1571
01:18:49.431 --> 01:18:52.910
<v Speaker 3>And the reason they sniff is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>like most animals are all no's.</v>

1572
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:56.180
<v Speaker 3>You can tell that with dogs for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their whole brains are built around</v>

1573
01:18:56.181 --> 01:18:59.900
<v Speaker 3>their sense of smell unlike us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which most of our brain is built around</v>

1574
01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 3>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

1575
01:19:01.311 --> 01:19:05.510
<v Speaker 3>so the cat's slinking around there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it smells something that it doesn't</v>

1576
01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:10.430
<v Speaker 3>know and it thinks God only knows what</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing that I don't know is.</v>

1577
01:19:10.431 --> 01:19:14.960
<v Speaker 3>And so it re it would freeze first and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it would beat a hasty retreat.</v>

1578
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now it's underneath the porch.</v>

1579
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:17.511
<v Speaker 3>One hip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

1580
01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:20.900
<v Speaker 3>where'd the cap disappeared now the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other one says under the house,</v>

1581
01:19:20.901 --> 01:19:24.890
<v Speaker 3>and then the cats down there shaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what cats do after the freaked</v>

1582
01:19:24.891 --> 01:19:28.310
<v Speaker 3>out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's got this little fantasy going.</v>

1583
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:30.340
<v Speaker 3>You'd hide too if you'd smelled what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

1584
01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.070
<v Speaker 3>And then it imagines up this monster and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a monster technically is the</v>

1585
01:19:34.071 --> 01:19:36.500
<v Speaker 3>amalgamation of unrelated parts.</v>

1586
01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:38.450
<v Speaker 3>So what's the monster?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1587
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 3>let's go duck feed and it's called like</v>
<v Speaker 3>bare arms and,</v>

1588
01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:46.040
<v Speaker 3>and it's got a skunk tail and it's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a wolf head and it's got antlers</v>

1589
01:19:46.041 --> 01:19:48.050
<v Speaker 3>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that thing doesn't exist.</v>

1590
01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:49.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong.</v>

1591
01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.730
<v Speaker 3>That thing exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1592
01:19:52.731 --> 01:19:55.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a really accurate representation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's out in the forest.</v>

1593
01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Now any one animal wouldn't look like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1594
01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:02.960
<v Speaker 3>but the set of all possible animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks exactly like that.</v>

1595
01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:04.130
<v Speaker 3>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1596
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:09.490
<v Speaker 3>what do you want first when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>something you want quick and dirty</v>

1597
01:20:10.111 --> 01:20:13.730
<v Speaker 3>representation of what to be afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do you want to hang around trying to</v>

1598
01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:15.750
<v Speaker 3>figure out whether that thing has hooves</v>
<v Speaker 3>and teeth?</v>

1599
01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:16.973
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1600
01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:20.850
<v Speaker 3>you want it quick and dirty</v>
<v Speaker 3>representation of just what might be</v>

1601
01:20:20.851 --> 01:20:24.390
<v Speaker 3>lurking out there because that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent hypothesizing,</v>

1602
01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the kind of hypothesize and it</v>

1603
01:20:26.491 --> 01:20:27.870
<v Speaker 3>would be evolutionary driven.</v>

1604
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.710
<v Speaker 3>You ever see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1605
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.430
<v Speaker 3>the far side cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1606
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Monster Snorkel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved that cartoon.</v>

1607
01:20:35.371 --> 01:20:40.371
<v Speaker 3>So there's this little kid in his bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dark and he's under the covers.</v>

1608
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:43.980
<v Speaker 3>He's one of those ugly little kids that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gary Larson always drew.</v>

1609
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.790
<v Speaker 3>And he's got this snorkel that you use</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1610
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:52.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scuba diving and what do you call it?</v>

1611
01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Snorkeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scuba diving and all that sticking out</v>

1612
01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:59.070
<v Speaker 3>from under the covers is the snorkel so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he can breathe.</v>

1613
01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:03.480
<v Speaker 3>And then of course in his imagination</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some like reptilian dinosaur,</v>

1614
01:21:03.481 --> 01:21:06.690
<v Speaker 3>like things sitting beside his bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1615
01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1616
01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what he's hypothesizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1617
01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what's in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>

1618
01:21:14.281 --> 01:21:15.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell your kid,</v>

1619
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.070
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no monsters in the dark.</v>

1620
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:17.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1621
01:21:17.701 --> 01:21:19.920
<v Speaker 3>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never talked to a stranger.</v>

1622
01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:21.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your story straight.</v>

1623
01:21:21.361 --> 01:21:23.520
<v Speaker 3>People really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1624
01:21:23.521 --> 01:21:24.630
<v Speaker 3>it's so dopey.</v>

1625
01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:25.681
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1626
01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:28.170
<v Speaker 3>there's monsters in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are you telling your kids?</v>

1627
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:29.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no such thing as monsters.</v>

1628
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:31.860
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're driven half crazy because they</v>

1629
01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:32.490
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1630
01:21:32.490 --> 01:21:34.140
<v Speaker 3>what am I afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then?</v>

1631
01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:38.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and second you tell them over time that</v>

1632
01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:39.750
<v Speaker 3>there are monsters in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1633
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:42.840
<v Speaker 3>you're probably more paranoid about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn things then your kid is,</v>

1634
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:44.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what do you tell them?</v>

1635
01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:48.180
<v Speaker 3>There are monsters in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can probably handle up,</v>

1636
01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:51.360
<v Speaker 3>especially with our health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1637
01:21:51.361 --> 01:21:56.130
<v Speaker 3>So now I'll tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my nephew,</v>

1638
01:21:57.330 --> 01:22:01.230
<v Speaker 3>he was six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had night terrors in night terrors or</v>

1639
01:22:01.231 --> 01:22:05.610
<v Speaker 3>this strange phenomena where all of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden you wake up screaming is quite</v>

1640
01:22:05.611 --> 01:22:08.100
<v Speaker 3>unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you might say,</v>

1641
01:22:08.101 --> 01:22:10.440
<v Speaker 3>well why was this happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>answer as well?</v>

1642
01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:13.350
<v Speaker 3>We really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was some instability in his</v>

1643
01:22:13.351 --> 01:22:14.520
<v Speaker 3>household at that point.</v>

1644
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:16.860
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just going off to kindergarten.</v>

1645
01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:18.570
<v Speaker 3>So that's a big transition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1646
01:22:18.571 --> 01:22:21.600
<v Speaker 3>It's out of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would into the world and be,</v>

1647
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:25.530
<v Speaker 3>his parents were in the throes of</v>
<v Speaker 3>approaching divorce.</v>

1648
01:22:25.531 --> 01:22:27.960
<v Speaker 3>So there was that sort of undercurrent</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the house.</v>

1649
01:22:27.961 --> 01:22:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what that's like.</v>

1650
01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:32.580
<v Speaker 3>You walk into a house like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you know something's up.</v>

1651
01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:36.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like the error is frozen and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably something that you can smell.</v>

1652
01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:38.850
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever,</v>

1653
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:40.950
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can certainly tell.</v>

1654
01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.570
<v Speaker 3>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1655
01:22:42.690 --> 01:22:45.630
<v Speaker 3>he's waking up at night screaming away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so during the day,</v>

1656
01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:49.110
<v Speaker 3>he's a very verbal kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>During the days running around,</v>

1657
01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:51.240
<v Speaker 3>I guess he was about four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not six.</v>

1658
01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.610
<v Speaker 3>It's got this little night hat that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wears.</v>

1659
01:22:53.611 --> 01:22:57.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a plastic night hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he zooms around without all the time</v>

1660
01:22:57.031 --> 01:22:59.580
<v Speaker 3>and he's got this plastic sword and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing around with that too.</v>

1661
01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:00.691
<v Speaker 3>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1662
01:23:00.691 --> 01:23:02.040
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's he up to?</v>

1663
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's playing night.</v>

1664
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:07.000
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of weird day because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1665
01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:10.720
<v Speaker 3>why would being a night be attractive to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kid?</v>

1666
01:23:10.721 --> 01:23:12.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we weren't nights for that long,</v>

1667
01:23:12.610 --> 01:23:14.440
<v Speaker 3>but whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really matter.</v>

1668
01:23:14.441 --> 01:23:19.030
<v Speaker 3>He's running around playing night and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes to sleep and he puts his night hat</v>

1669
01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.970
<v Speaker 3>and his sword right beside his bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fine.</v>

1670
01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:24.940
<v Speaker 3>I watched that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching what's going on with him.</v>

1671
01:23:24.941 --> 01:23:26.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm figuring out what's going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

1672
01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.930
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his mom is worried because he's having</v>

1673
01:23:28.931 --> 01:23:29.920
<v Speaker 3>night terrors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1674
01:23:29.921 --> 01:23:30.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible.</v>

1675
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Wakes up screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1676
01:23:31.751 --> 01:23:34.090
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nighttime comes,</v>

1677
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.450
<v Speaker 3>he wakes up screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all sitting at the breakfast table</v>

1678
01:23:37.451 --> 01:23:40.060
<v Speaker 3>the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1679
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:43.180
<v Speaker 3>did you dream about anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1680
01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then got right into this dream.</v>

1681
01:23:45.701 --> 01:23:46.600
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1682
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:47.710
<v Speaker 3>well this is what happened.</v>

1683
01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:53.190
<v Speaker 3>I was out in a field and all of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>little dwarfs were around me.</v>

1684
01:23:53.651 --> 01:23:56.350
<v Speaker 3>They only came up to my knees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they had big beaks.</v>

1685
01:23:56.351 --> 01:23:59.470
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have any arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have big beaks on them and they</v>

1686
01:23:59.471 --> 01:24:02.200
<v Speaker 3>were covered with hair and Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were all greased down and there</v>

1687
01:24:02.201 --> 01:24:04.080
<v Speaker 3>was a cross shaped at the top of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

1688
01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.990
<v Speaker 3>Wherever I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these beat dwarfs would jump at me with</v>

1689
01:24:07.991 --> 01:24:11.290
<v Speaker 3>their feet and bite me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a horrible image,</v>

1690
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:12.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said they're everywhere,</v>

1691
01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.080
<v Speaker 3>so everyone stops eating breakfast and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like watching this thinking,</v>

1692
01:24:16.150 --> 01:24:17.980
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's no wonder you're screaming man.</v>

1693
01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.110
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he said,</v>

1694
01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:22.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was worse than that because like</v>

1695
01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:27.460
<v Speaker 3>there was smoke and at the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>little doors there was this dragon and</v>

1696
01:24:27.461 --> 01:24:30.040
<v Speaker 3>the dragon was breathing out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke and fire and the smoke and fire</v>

1697
01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:31.840
<v Speaker 3>would turn into the dwarfs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1698
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:33.460
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do about that?</v>

1699
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:35.170
<v Speaker 3>Wiping out some dwarfs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1700
01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:36.360
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Dragon.</v>

1701
01:24:36.361 --> 01:24:40.030
<v Speaker 3>We'll just breathe up some more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's life man.</v>

1702
01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I've got this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excellent.</v>

1703
01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:44.340
<v Speaker 3>I've got this excellent picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1704
01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.710
<v Speaker 3>let me show it to you cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth finding even though it's</v>

1705
01:24:47.711 --> 01:24:49.420
<v Speaker 3>going to interrupt my story a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1706
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1707
01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.670
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm not going to find it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll take too long,</v>

1708
01:25:15.671 --> 01:25:18.720
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you what it is anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a Greek amphora.</v>

1709
01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.720
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Know How am fora there?</v>

1710
01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:23.130
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a boss sort of and they</v>

1711
01:25:23.131 --> 01:25:26.390
<v Speaker 3>just keep winding them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dreary.</v>

1712
01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.680
<v Speaker 3>It's painted on like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a cartoon.</v>

1713
01:25:28.681 --> 01:25:32.500
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of black and white and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got this hero who I believe is Hercules.</v>

1714
01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:33.690
<v Speaker 3>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

1715
01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:36.910
<v Speaker 3>these is facing this snake and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>really cool snake.</v>

1716
01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:39.880
<v Speaker 3>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its tail is curled in a perfect circle.</v>

1717
01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:43.180
<v Speaker 3>And that's if you look at dragons and</v>
<v Speaker 3>snakes and mythology,</v>

1718
01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:47.470
<v Speaker 3>there are often their tails often curled</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a circle and it means something like</v>

1719
01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:50.760
<v Speaker 3>it means something like infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

1720
01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.390
<v Speaker 3>and then there's all these snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a high drug,</v>

1721
01:25:53.391 --> 01:25:55.540
<v Speaker 3>so it's a snake with like eight can say.</v>

1722
01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.790
<v Speaker 3>And so then there's Hercules with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>sword.</v>

1723
01:25:57.791 --> 01:25:59.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what's the problem with the hydro</v>

1724
01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:03.040
<v Speaker 3>cut off one hand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens eight more heads?</v>

1725
01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.393
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

1726
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:07.190
<v Speaker 3>quit cutting off heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1727
01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:10.670
<v Speaker 3>it's a good piece of foreign policy</v>
<v Speaker 3>advice for the Middle East.</v>

1728
01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.340
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the hydrus keep growing.</v>

1729
01:26:13.341 --> 01:26:14.174
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1730
01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:16.130
<v Speaker 3>cutting off heads isn't going to be of</v>
<v Speaker 3>any utility.</v>

1731
01:26:16.131 --> 01:26:20.210
<v Speaker 3>And so here's what the story is saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like no matter how many problems</v>

1732
01:26:20.211 --> 01:26:21.890
<v Speaker 3>you solve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a bunch more</v>

1733
01:26:21.891 --> 01:26:24.080
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's even worse than that.</v>

1734
01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.070
<v Speaker 3>If you have a problem and you solve it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to lead to more problems.</v>

1735
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:30.530
<v Speaker 3>So even the solution is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1736
01:26:30.531 --> 01:26:33.080
<v Speaker 3>And that's the law of unexpected</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences,</v>

1737
01:26:33.081 --> 01:26:35.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why automobiles have destroyed</v>

1738
01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:37.850
<v Speaker 3>the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody thought in automobile is for</v>

1739
01:26:37.851 --> 01:26:40.730
<v Speaker 3>getting from point a to point b.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns out it's not.</v>

1740
01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:44.330
<v Speaker 3>It's for transforming the world into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world's holes,</v>

1741
01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.490
<v Speaker 3>into jungles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know that.</v>

1742
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:50.990
<v Speaker 3>So that's an unexpected consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1743
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:54.410
<v Speaker 3>the kid is faced with this horrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>conundrum,</v>

1744
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.510
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do?</v>

1745
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:58.520
<v Speaker 3>Go out these doors and they're biting me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's this stupid dragon.</v>

1746
01:26:58.521 --> 01:27:02.210
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what could you do about that?</v>

1747
01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Now that's called a loaded question and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be inadmissible in a court of</v>

1748
01:27:07.071 --> 01:27:08.690
<v Speaker 3>law in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it,</v>

1749
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.060
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a question,</v>

1750
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:13.040
<v Speaker 3>but no one isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling him something,</v>

1751
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:18.790
<v Speaker 3>you could do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1752
01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:20.210
<v Speaker 3>that's a hell of a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1753
01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:20.631
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1754
01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I should just lay down and let the door</v>
<v Speaker 3>of seat me,</v>

1755
01:27:22.851 --> 01:27:23.870
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1756
01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:25.100
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do something about it.</v>

1757
01:27:25.101 --> 01:27:26.210
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what could you do?</v>

1758
01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.810
<v Speaker 3>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put my hat on,</v>

1759
01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:30.920
<v Speaker 3>I get my sword.</v>

1760
01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.800
<v Speaker 3>Then I'd go get my dad and we'd go up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dragon.</v>

1761
01:27:33.801 --> 01:27:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I jumped on his head and then I poke</v>
<v Speaker 3>both his eyes out with my sword and then</v>

1762
01:27:37.911 --> 01:27:41.120
<v Speaker 3>I go right down the stomach to the place</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the fire comes out.</v>

1763
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:44.510
<v Speaker 3>And I cut a piece off of that and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>use it as a shield.</v>

1764
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:46.880
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1765
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:48.710
<v Speaker 3>art and Kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got it,</v>

1766
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:51.290
<v Speaker 3>you can fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so cool because he had the whole</v>

1767
01:27:51.291 --> 01:27:51.781
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1768
01:27:51.781 --> 01:27:53.510
<v Speaker 3>and that's why he's running around</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing night.</v>

1769
01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:56.600
<v Speaker 3>He'd almost go on it and all I had to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>was drop.</v>

1770
01:27:56.870 --> 01:28:01.870
<v Speaker 3>There's this fifth chemical phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 3>called a supersaturated solution.</v>

1771
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:04.430
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you take,</v>

1772
01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:08.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>water can only dissolve so much sugar</v>

1773
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:10.400
<v Speaker 3>until the sugar starts to crystallize</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1774
01:28:10.401 --> 01:28:11.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're careful,</v>

1775
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:14.120
<v Speaker 3>you heat up the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can dissolve a bunch of sugar in it.</v>

1776
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:18.350
<v Speaker 3>And then if you really slow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly cool down the water and you don't</v>

1777
01:28:18.351 --> 01:28:21.710
<v Speaker 3>tap it and there's no impurities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get this sugar,</v>

1778
01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:25.100
<v Speaker 3>you can get this solution super</v>
<v Speaker 3>saturated,</v>

1779
01:28:25.101 --> 01:28:28.880
<v Speaker 3>which means weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it holds more sugar than it can.</v>

1780
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:31.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like it forgets to crystallize it</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

1781
01:28:31.551 --> 01:28:34.250
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it needs a little impurity or a shock or</v>

1782
01:28:34.251 --> 01:28:35.750
<v Speaker 3>something to get it going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>

1783
01:28:35.751 --> 01:28:39.050
<v Speaker 3>it forgets to crystallize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then if you take a little crystal of</v>

1784
01:28:39.051 --> 01:28:42.680
<v Speaker 3>sugar and you drop it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like he goes and instantly,</v>

1785
01:28:42.681 --> 01:28:44.370
<v Speaker 3>it's all crystal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1786
01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:47.570
<v Speaker 3>so that's what happened to this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he was there,</v>

1787
01:28:47.571 --> 01:28:49.400
<v Speaker 3>he was ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had the answer.</v>

1788
01:28:49.401 --> 01:28:54.230
<v Speaker 3>And all I had to do is say you could do</v>
<v Speaker 3>something about this and Poof,</v>

1789
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:57.950
<v Speaker 3>instant hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the cool thing is no more night</v>

1790
01:28:57.951 --> 01:29:01.660
<v Speaker 3>terrors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So well,</v>

1791
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:03.460
<v Speaker 3>so you get the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

1792
01:29:03.461 --> 01:29:05.080
<v Speaker 3>very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1793
01:29:05.081 --> 01:29:10.081
<v Speaker 3>so back to our discussion now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1794
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:24.810
<v Speaker 3>so you've got the brain here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is uh,</v>

1795
01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:29.930
<v Speaker 3>the brain has conceptualized by</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alexander Luria who was the Russia's</v>

1796
01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:32.130
<v Speaker 3>most famous neuropsychologist and who</v>

1797
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:36.340
<v Speaker 3>got the big picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1798
01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:39.280
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically he said there's a bunch of</v>

1799
01:29:39.281 --> 01:29:42.010
<v Speaker 3>different ways that you can divide up</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain.</v>

1800
01:29:42.011 --> 01:29:42.844
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of,</v>

1801
01:29:42.970 --> 01:29:44.790
<v Speaker 3>it depends on what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1802
01:29:44.791 --> 01:29:47.380
<v Speaker 3>which is an interesting way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it because you might say,</v>

1803
01:29:47.381 --> 01:29:49.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how should you divide up the world?</v>

1804
01:29:49.541 --> 01:29:50.410
<v Speaker 3>And that's her is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1805
01:29:50.411 --> 01:29:51.910
<v Speaker 3>it depends on what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1806
01:29:52.150 --> 01:29:54.490
<v Speaker 3>It depends to some degree on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>features of the world,</v>

1807
01:29:54.491 --> 01:29:56.350
<v Speaker 3>but it depends even more on what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1808
01:29:57.730 --> 01:30:02.230
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things Luria said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay if you go from the back to the</v>

1809
01:30:02.231 --> 01:30:04.750
<v Speaker 3>front of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the front of the gray part here,</v>

1810
01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:08.830
<v Speaker 3>what you see is roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the back half of the brain does sensory</v>

1811
01:30:08.831 --> 01:30:11.620
<v Speaker 3>processing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially visual processing.</v>

1812
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:14.230
<v Speaker 3>And the front half of the brain does</v>
<v Speaker 3>motor processing.</v>

1813
01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:16.810
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you look at the back of the</v>

1814
01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:18.130
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sensory unit there,</v>

1815
01:30:18.131 --> 01:30:21.160
<v Speaker 3>you see that there's an auditory area</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a visual area.</v>

1816
01:30:21.490 --> 01:30:24.100
<v Speaker 3>And what's cool is those overlap to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>degree.</v>

1817
01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:28.330
<v Speaker 3>So there's some hypothesis that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>places where the sensory systems</v>

1818
01:30:28.331 --> 01:30:31.060
<v Speaker 3>overlap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it are the parts that are responsible</v>

1819
01:30:31.061 --> 01:30:34.720
<v Speaker 3>for your experience of a unified</v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptual field.</v>

1820
01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:38.770
<v Speaker 3>So here's an example of managing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>visual cortex in the auditory cortex.</v>

1821
01:30:38.771 --> 01:30:40.900
<v Speaker 3>Overlap in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1822
01:30:40.901 --> 01:30:45.580
<v Speaker 3>So it sort of be maybe hear about there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say on the left side.</v>

1823
01:30:45.610 --> 01:30:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1824
01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.070
<v Speaker 3>that's the part used for silent reading.</v>

1825
01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:51.640
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that cool?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means you're using your eyes,</v>

1826
01:30:51.641 --> 01:30:53.750
<v Speaker 3>his ears and the way you do that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>used.</v>

1827
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.350
<v Speaker 3>The overlap between the visual and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>auditory cortex.</v>

1828
01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.780
<v Speaker 3>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can use your eyes his ears.</v>

1829
01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:00.280
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1830
01:31:00.281 --> 01:31:02.440
<v Speaker 3>so the senses aren't as separate as</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think.</v>

1831
01:31:02.441 --> 01:31:03.710
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

1832
01:31:03.711 --> 01:31:06.490
<v Speaker 3>I used to wear glasses and I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear what people were saying when I</v>

1833
01:31:06.491 --> 01:31:08.980
<v Speaker 3>wasn't wearing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is I couldn't,</v>

1834
01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:12.130
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't watching their lips say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of what I was hearing in</v>

1835
01:31:12.131 --> 01:31:15.550
<v Speaker 3>language processing was the expression</v>
<v Speaker 3>on their face and the movement of their</v>

1836
01:31:15.551 --> 01:31:17.260
<v Speaker 3>lips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So take off my glasses,</v>

1837
01:31:17.261 --> 01:31:19.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm deaf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1838
01:31:19.361 --> 01:31:21.220
<v Speaker 3>so that's the sensory unit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half the brain,</v>

1839
01:31:21.221 --> 01:31:25.090
<v Speaker 3>most of it's visual cortex because we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>insanely visual creatures and the front</v>

1840
01:31:25.091 --> 01:31:27.130
<v Speaker 3>half is the motor unit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1841
01:31:27.131 --> 01:31:28.240
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1842
01:31:28.241 --> 01:31:30.100
<v Speaker 3>because we proceed and act.</v>

1843
01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.600
<v Speaker 3>So it's the part of the brain that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for Zika.</v>

1844
01:31:33.610 --> 01:31:35.950
<v Speaker 3>You around you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got voluntary action,</v>

1845
01:31:36.010 --> 01:31:36.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1846
01:31:36.690 --> 01:31:41.690
<v Speaker 3>you inhabit a nervous system that</v>
<v Speaker 3>enables you to navigate your way</v>

1847
01:31:42.071 --> 01:31:44.350
<v Speaker 3>throughout the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're navigators fundamentally,</v>

1848
01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:49.380
<v Speaker 3>we really are navigators and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask can navigate by the stars.</v>

1849
01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:53.740
<v Speaker 3>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the hell can enact navigate by the</v>

1850
01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:56.020
<v Speaker 3>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They figured that out by figure,</v>

1851
01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:57.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching ants is figuring out how to get</v>

1852
01:31:57.671 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then up the sky,</v>

1853
01:32:00.161 --> 01:32:03.010
<v Speaker 3>and then the ants were wandering around</v>
<v Speaker 3>not knowing where they were going.</v>

1854
01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:04.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1855
01:32:04.541 --> 01:32:06.160
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of things we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

1856
01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:07.560
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1857
01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.930
<v Speaker 3>the motor unit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got the motor strip.</v>

1858
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Now if you touch that with an electro</v>
<v Speaker 3>during brain surgery,</v>

1859
01:32:14.441 --> 01:32:18.670
<v Speaker 3>then people will either move or have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>impulse to move and you can map out how</v>

1860
01:32:18.671 --> 01:32:22.390
<v Speaker 3>the body is represented in the brain by</v>
<v Speaker 3>touching that strip with an electrode.</v>

1861
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:26.080
<v Speaker 3>And that was done by wilder Pinfield at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Montreal neurological institute.</v>

1862
01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:29.890
<v Speaker 3>It was a major move forward in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the brain.</v>

1863
01:32:29.891 --> 01:32:33.280
<v Speaker 3>And he did that on epileptics before</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery because he didn't want to take</v>

1864
01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:35.620
<v Speaker 3>out parts of the brain that you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>were necessary.</v>

1865
01:32:35.621 --> 01:32:37.090
<v Speaker 3>So he's trying to figure out what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing.</v>

1866
01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:40.840
<v Speaker 3>So that's the part that enables you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>act voluntarily.</v>

1867
01:32:40.841 --> 01:32:43.510
<v Speaker 3>And in front of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the premotor strip.</v>

1868
01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:47.140
<v Speaker 3>And then in front of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the prefrontal cortex.</v>

1869
01:32:47.170 --> 01:32:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Now what's cool is that the premotor</v>
<v Speaker 3>strip and the prefrontal cortex grew out</v>

1870
01:32:53.441 --> 01:32:55.750
<v Speaker 3>of the motor strip over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution.</v>

1871
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:57.550
<v Speaker 3>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1872
01:32:57.551 --> 01:33:01.150
<v Speaker 3>why do we think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the answer isn't so that we can come</v>

1873
01:33:01.151 --> 01:33:03.790
<v Speaker 3>up with accurate objective</v>
<v Speaker 3>representations of the world.</v>

1874
01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:08.680
<v Speaker 3>The answer is so that we can plan what</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do and what you see fundamentally is</v>

1875
01:33:08.681 --> 01:33:13.681
<v Speaker 3>that as you move forward in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go from action to planning action.</v>

1876
01:33:16.450 --> 01:33:18.670
<v Speaker 3>And so by the time you get to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>prefrontal Cortex,</v>

1877
01:33:18.671 --> 01:33:20.740
<v Speaker 3>let's say the Dorsolateral prefrontal</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cortex,</v>

1878
01:33:20.741 --> 01:33:23.710
<v Speaker 3>which is the part of the brain that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>use for abstract thinking,</v>

1879
01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:28.980
<v Speaker 3>what you're basically doing is conjuring</v>
<v Speaker 3>up avatars of yourself in an imaginary</v>

1880
01:33:32.171 --> 01:33:36.730
<v Speaker 3>world running the mess simulations in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your imagination and the collective</v>

1881
01:33:36.731 --> 01:33:38.500
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what stories are,</v>

1882
01:33:38.770 --> 01:33:43.090
<v Speaker 3>and then running the simulation to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end to see if you live or die and if you</v>

1883
01:33:43.091 --> 01:33:45.580
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you don't implement the simulation.</v>

1884
01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:48.640
<v Speaker 3>And if you live in thrive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you do implement the simulation.</v>

1885
01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.650
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it Karl Popper,</v>

1886
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.490
<v Speaker 3>philosopher of science said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason we think is so that we can</v>

1887
01:33:57.491 --> 01:34:01.420
<v Speaker 3>let our thoughts die instead of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1888
01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:03.130
<v Speaker 3>That's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1889
01:34:03.131 --> 01:34:05.680
<v Speaker 3>that also ties into the death and</v>
<v Speaker 3>rebirth idea,</v>

1890
01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:07.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like are you going to die?</v>

1891
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:10.420
<v Speaker 3>Are you to let your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know your avatars die?</v>

1892
01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:15.420
<v Speaker 3>And one way of thinking about that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your current self is just an</v>

1893
01:34:15.611 --> 01:34:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if you understand that,</v>

1894
01:34:19.061 --> 01:34:24.061
<v Speaker 3>that means you also understand the</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between the union self and</v>

1895
01:34:24.161 --> 01:34:26.860
<v Speaker 3>the ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Ego is an Avatar.</v>

1896
01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.710
<v Speaker 3>The self is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1897
01:34:29.711 --> 01:34:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the word Avatar,</v>

1898
01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:34.540
<v Speaker 3>it's actually a theological term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's from,</v>

1899
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:39.750
<v Speaker 3>it's from Sanskrit and an Avatar is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>form that God takes on earth.</v>

1900
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.240
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty cool that that turned into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the word for the thing that you use at a</v>

1901
01:34:43.241 --> 01:34:44.170
<v Speaker 3>video game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1902
01:34:44.171 --> 01:34:47.530
<v Speaker 3>That's your little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1903
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:50.350
<v Speaker 3>disposable self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You throw it out there in a world and it</v>

1904
01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:52.540
<v Speaker 3>can live or die and you're back there</v>
<v Speaker 3>like God,</v>

1905
01:34:52.541 --> 01:34:56.650
<v Speaker 3>just be an eternal all along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a very,</v>

1906
01:34:56.651 --> 01:34:58.640
<v Speaker 3>very thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

1907
01:34:58.641 --> 01:35:00.770
<v Speaker 3>even before we had video games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were doing that,</v>

1908
01:35:00.771 --> 01:35:00.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1909
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Cause we had fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had stories,</v>

1910
01:35:02.511 --> 01:35:06.710
<v Speaker 3>we had imagination and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's decoupled from our motor systems.</v>

1911
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:08.880
<v Speaker 3>And so we can implement these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1912
01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:13.520
<v Speaker 3>hypothetical instances of ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we implement them.</v>

1913
01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.680
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Kinda how we fight hydrus.</v>

1914
01:35:15.681 --> 01:35:16.221
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1915
01:35:16.221 --> 01:35:18.170
<v Speaker 3>you got eight snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do about that?</v>

1916
01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:22.520
<v Speaker 3>You'll have eight potential selves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you multiply potential cells just as</v>

1917
01:35:22.521 --> 01:35:25.520
<v Speaker 3>fast as the world can multiply snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1918
01:35:25.521 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 3>and that's what evolution does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1919
01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:32.030
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you've got a mongoose,</v>

1920
01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:33.470
<v Speaker 3>mongoose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mongoose,</v>

1921
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.360
<v Speaker 3>mongooses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like to eat snakes.</v>

1922
01:35:35.361 --> 01:35:37.070
<v Speaker 3>They're really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can eat cobras,</v>

1923
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:39.800
<v Speaker 3>go mongooses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think,</v>

1924
01:35:39.801 --> 01:35:42.230
<v Speaker 3>well a mongoose gets killed by a Cobra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1925
01:35:42.231 --> 01:35:44.630
<v Speaker 3>well it's not a very good mongoose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't matter because the</v>

1926
01:35:44.631 --> 01:35:48.770
<v Speaker 3>mongooses are generating all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mongoose and one of them is going to be</v>

1927
01:35:48.771 --> 01:35:49.700
<v Speaker 3>able to kill the snake.</v>

1928
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Not all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all that really matters.</v>

1929
01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.920
<v Speaker 3>So there's a very funny mouse that lives</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the desert in Arizona.</v>

1930
01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:01.970
<v Speaker 3>I'd like this most a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it jumps and it,</v>

1931
01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.710
<v Speaker 3>it's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This mouse,</v>

1932
01:36:03.711 --> 01:36:06.050
<v Speaker 3>it feeds on Scorpions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1933
01:36:06.051 --> 01:36:08.450
<v Speaker 3>how the hell did it learn to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways?</v>

1934
01:36:08.451 --> 01:36:11.960
<v Speaker 3>It has to teach its young to eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>scorpions and it's quite immune from</v>

1935
01:36:11.961 --> 01:36:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Scorpion Vanneman Venom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite helpful.</v>

1936
01:36:14.121 --> 01:36:16.110
<v Speaker 3>But still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it goes out in this,</v>

1937
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:19.460
<v Speaker 3>it's like you going out to wrestler Nile</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crocodile,</v>

1938
01:36:19.461 --> 01:36:22.070
<v Speaker 3>it's like a scarf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and he's a big thing compared to a</v>

1939
01:36:22.071 --> 01:36:23.970
<v Speaker 3>mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mouse will hop on the Scorpion and</v>

1940
01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:27.380
<v Speaker 3>they have this terrible fight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding the most tears it apart and then</v>

1941
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:30.110
<v Speaker 3>it brings it back and feeds it's little</v>
<v Speaker 3>mice,</v>

1942
01:36:30.111 --> 01:36:35.111
<v Speaker 3>babies pops and you know what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it goes outside and howls at the</v>

1943
01:36:35.631 --> 01:36:39.160
<v Speaker 3>moon like a wolf just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a mouse.</v>

1944
01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:43.280
<v Speaker 3>So it's really squeaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you slow it down,</v>

1945
01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:45.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you have to do.</v>

1946
01:36:45.441 --> 01:36:47.900
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to hear mouse vocalizations</v>

1947
01:36:47.901 --> 01:36:50.660
<v Speaker 3>cause they're often super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super what,</v>

1948
01:36:50.670 --> 01:36:52.430
<v Speaker 3>what uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>above,</v>

1949
01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:56.720
<v Speaker 3>above your threshold for hearing pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>excepted that to here or rats laugh when</v>

1950
01:36:56.721 --> 01:36:59.300
<v Speaker 3>you tickle though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to slow down their vocalizations</v>

1951
01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:02.300
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they laugh at ultrasonic frequency.</v>

1952
01:37:02.301 --> 01:37:05.180
<v Speaker 3>So he had to slow down your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their vocalizations to hear them laugh</v>

1953
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:06.560
<v Speaker 3>when you take a look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

1954
01:37:06.561 --> 01:37:10.490
<v Speaker 3>these damn nice go out in the desert at</v>
<v Speaker 3>night after eating a scorpion and they</v>

1955
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:12.080
<v Speaker 3>howl at the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like</v>

1956
01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:14.780
<v Speaker 3>go mice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1957
01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:17.630
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

1958
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:22.930
<v Speaker 3>back to the brain here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's all these terrible monsters</v>

1959
01:37:23.121 --> 01:37:26.810
<v Speaker 3>being generated and you generate avatars</v>
<v Speaker 3>of yourself to cope with.</v>

1960
01:37:26.811 --> 01:37:29.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm in generally used to have to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolve to do that,</v>

1961
01:37:29.871 --> 01:37:33.380
<v Speaker 3>but human beings being the smart</v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures we are generated up and the</v>

1962
01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:37.370
<v Speaker 3>environment in the imagination and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>populated it with imaginary</v>

1963
01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:41.960
<v Speaker 3>representations of ourselves and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>try those out and then we implement the</v>

1964
01:37:41.961 --> 01:37:43.310
<v Speaker 3>ones that we think are great.</v>

1965
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:45.980
<v Speaker 3>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we've been doing that for a very,</v>

1966
01:37:45.981 --> 01:37:47.750
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very long time.</v>

1967
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.320
<v Speaker 3>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe we figured out exactly what</v>

1968
01:37:51.321 --> 01:37:53.600
<v Speaker 3>thing we should implement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we might say,</v>

1969
01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:57.360
<v Speaker 3>well that's the savior figures in</v>
<v Speaker 3>mythology.</v>

1970
01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what else would they be?</v>

1971
01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:03.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would be trying to figure out</v>

1972
01:38:03.301 --> 01:38:07.650
<v Speaker 3>what the hell we are for forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the fundamental question isn't what</v>

1973
01:38:07.651 --> 01:38:10.590
<v Speaker 3>is reality maideb not the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

1974
01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:14.730
<v Speaker 3>The fundamental question is how do you</v>
<v Speaker 3>act in the world?</v>

1975
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:18.150
<v Speaker 3>And that's a whole different way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about the world.</v>

1976
01:38:18.151 --> 01:38:22.950
<v Speaker 3>But I think given that I'm a Darwinian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the fundamental question.</v>

1977
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:25.800
<v Speaker 3>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously,</v>

1978
01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:30.690
<v Speaker 3>given what I've described to you so far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't fall in love too much with</v>

1979
01:38:30.691 --> 01:38:33.990
<v Speaker 3>your current self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because what if it's wrong?</v>

1980
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should let that sucker die.</v>

1981
01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:38.220
<v Speaker 3>And so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1982
01:38:38.221 --> 01:38:41.640
<v Speaker 3>what part of you is it that doesn't die</v>
<v Speaker 3>when your Avatar's die?</v>

1983
01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you'd called the self.</v>

1984
01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:46.680
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you got undergo a</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality transformation here.</v>

1985
01:38:46.681 --> 01:38:49.290
<v Speaker 3>There's the old view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all naive a and something comes</v>

1986
01:38:49.291 --> 01:38:52.200
<v Speaker 3>along and just wallops you bang into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>underworld,</v>

1987
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:53.430
<v Speaker 3>you fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1988
01:38:53.670 --> 01:38:56.370
<v Speaker 3>and then bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a new you and maybe a little,</v>

1989
01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:58.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>battle weary but wiser,</v>

1990
01:38:59.010 --> 01:39:01.310
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you know that one gets walked,</v>

1991
01:39:01.311 --> 01:39:04.020
<v Speaker 3>walked out and bang into down the road</v>
<v Speaker 3>and up you come again.</v>

1992
01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:06.900
<v Speaker 3>It's like fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's constant across all those</v>

1993
01:39:06.901 --> 01:39:09.810
<v Speaker 3>transformations?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the core element of,</v>

1994
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.220
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the person.</v>

1995
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:14.610
<v Speaker 3>That's what you called the self</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>

1996
01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:17.040
<v Speaker 3>It's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So smart.</v>

1997
01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes and then we'll,</v>

1998
01:39:21.130 --> 01:39:22.020
<v Speaker 3>we'll go on.</v>
