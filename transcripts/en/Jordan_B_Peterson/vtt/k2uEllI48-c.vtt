1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were to have read today.</v>

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>This section on classification is just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>small section,</v>

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>right on categorization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next section on boss,</v>

4
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:15.324
<v Speaker 1>basically on the new buddy Alicia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the taping and the creation </v>

5
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:19.734
<v Speaker 1>Now that's the most fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most archaic up creation </v>

7
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:23.064
<v Speaker 1>guest that we have in written form in </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything approaching a state of </v>

8
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.234
<v Speaker 1>completeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting from a historical </v>

9
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:31.300
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.383
<v Speaker 1>because it's so archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also an like the Mesopotamians has </v>

11
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>an extraordinarily well developed dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Religious Dogma as far as I've been able</v>

12
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:46.491
<v Speaker 1>to be terrible in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think in,</v>

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.633
<v Speaker 1>in many ways Jewish and Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>theology are elaborations on a mess of </v>

14
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:53.574
<v Speaker 1>attaining to think they'll eliod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It points out the Mesopotamian creation </v>

15
00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:58.494
<v Speaker 1>myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's about 5,000 years old and </v>

16
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>seq stamp form is definitely based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>oral traditions that are much older than</v>

17
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

18
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.713
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you can say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sumerians just originated the Enuma </v>

19
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>elish in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very brief period of time on ground</v>

20
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>that haven't been prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just codify,</v>

21
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.293
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions that have been handed down </v>

22
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>orally to that date and so we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been written for it.</v>

23
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.513
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

24
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.613
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I wanted to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about was this notion of categorization </v>

25
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is</v>

26
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Roger Brown pointed out with 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago or there about that time.</v>

27
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.023
<v Speaker 1>We have always in psychology tended to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that the way that people think is </v>

28
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:45.984
<v Speaker 1>the way that scientists think and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that we categorize things is in </v>

29
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:50.514
<v Speaker 1>terms of the categories that we think </v>
<v Speaker 1>are appropriate from the scientific or </v>

30
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:53.814
<v Speaker 1>the logical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown points out that this is well that </v>

31
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>is a minimal amount of investigation </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically in the cycle.</v>

32
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:01.104
<v Speaker 1>Linguistic domain immediately indicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this was in fact false and that we </v>

33
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:08.590
<v Speaker 1>do not categorize things naturally the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that people do scientifically.</v>

34
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.803
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't use the notion of the proper </v>

35
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 1>set and he uses as a standard example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper set,</v>

36
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the idea of triangles and you can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a triangle is.</v>

37
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can define what's a triangle,</v>

38
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:20.904
<v Speaker 1>what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no fuzziness about the borders </v>

39
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:23.304
<v Speaker 1>and everything either fits in the set or</v>
<v Speaker 1>is outside of the set and by contrast </v>

40
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>are natural categories don't seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that type.</v>

41
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>They have fuzzy boundaries and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>more concerned with function,</v>

42
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or with an effect of relevance than with</v>

43
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:40.401
<v Speaker 1>sensory and with swift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely determinable sensory essence.</v>

44
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>So we categorize in in much more vague </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

45
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that I gave you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>listing in this,</v>

46
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:49.854
<v Speaker 1>in this document of the qualities of </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural categorization as they'd been </v>

47
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:55.284
<v Speaker 1>described by George Lakoff in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a women fire and dangerous things and </v>

48
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>lack off is basically following up on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition as I'm not a psycho linguist,</v>

49
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>and this is no new news to me basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But lakoff has been falling apart.</v>

50
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Church tradition that was established by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger Brown and Eleanor Ross,</v>

51
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:13.474
<v Speaker 1>who was one of his students and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>older elder has made a big name for </v>

52
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>herself studying categorization.</v>

53
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.410
<v Speaker 1>The thing I think is so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this is that what Rosch and lakoff</v>

54
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.813
<v Speaker 1>describe as categories are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much like the kinds of categories </v>

55
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:28.504
<v Speaker 1>that religious thinkers have used that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been studied from a completely </v>

56
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.500
<v Speaker 1>different perspective by people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and Mircea Eliade.</v>

57
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.883
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that surprising if you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because it's obvious that </v>

58
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:39.214
<v Speaker 1>religious categories aren't proper sets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their natural categories are can't </v>

59
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>people in religious categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always thought that way.</v>

60
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that surprising.</v>

61
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.323
<v Speaker 1>What's surprising our guests more </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising is that the overlap between </v>

62
00:03:56.921 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>the two literatures is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not well explored or,</v>

63
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

64
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we should do,</v>

65
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I guess is think to think about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of categorization.</v>

66
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Lakoff describes natural categories is </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive models.</v>

68
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:18.034
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing he says is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are embodied with regards to their </v>

69
00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:22.190
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which essentially means that they can be</v>

70
00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:23.024
<v Speaker 1>used without necessarily being defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that they are implicit in </v>

71
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.850
<v Speaker 1>action without necessarily being </v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit and description.</v>

72
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.223
<v Speaker 1>So basically what lakoff is pointing out</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you act towards a number of </v>

73
00:04:36.321 --> 00:04:37.154
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if they are the same thing with </v>

74
00:04:39.981 --> 00:04:42.620
<v Speaker 1>regards to your actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are in fact,</v>

75
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.893
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are in fact treating those objects </v>

76
00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:46.724
<v Speaker 1>as if they're in the same category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one domain of category can be </v>

77
00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:53.150
<v Speaker 1>fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like significance for motor output.</v>

78
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

79
00:04:54.591 --> 00:04:55.424
<v Speaker 1>if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like what defines chair because </v>

80
00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:02.480
<v Speaker 1>chair's very and all sorts of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they vary so much that there's very,</v>

81
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.830
<v Speaker 1>there may be very little sensory overlap</v>
<v Speaker 1>between one chair and another if there's</v>

82
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:07.664
<v Speaker 1>not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not much similar between a </v>

83
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:10.460
<v Speaker 1>stump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

84
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.250
<v Speaker 1>And the kind of designer chair that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might see in a museum,</v>

85
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.263
<v Speaker 1>they're very different objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing they have in common is </v>

86
00:05:15.801 --> 00:05:16.634
<v Speaker 1>their implication for output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the chairs are things that you </v>

87
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>can sit on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

88
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.773
<v Speaker 1>They're defined by their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by their significance in our under </v>

89
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:26.900
<v Speaker 1>sensory nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I used an example here.</v>

90
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.510
<v Speaker 1>What makes a dog you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

91
00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't say but I know one when I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

92
00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:34.220
<v Speaker 1>which is another indication that you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>be using a natural category,</v>

93
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.913
<v Speaker 1>the August something friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to be petted and something to </v>

94
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:39.404
<v Speaker 1>play with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although such knowledge does not </v>

95
00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:42.770
<v Speaker 1>comprise everything that makes up you </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard his dog.</v>

96
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.870
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's interesting about those</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

97
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.093
<v Speaker 1>something friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to be petted and something to </v>

98
00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:52.520
<v Speaker 1>play with is that in a sense those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not precisely the attributes of the dog.</v>

99
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I think of a natural category of dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what you're,</v>

100
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>if you define a dog as a friend or as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to play with,</v>

101
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:00.074
<v Speaker 1>you're actually defining the object in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of your interactions with it and </v>

102
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:03.974
<v Speaker 1>not in terms of the object and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the terms we use have exactly that </v>

103
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like beautiful.</v>

104
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says when you define it,</v>

105
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>say if you to find another person that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

106
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to tell exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it is that that quality besides,</v>

107
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean people say beauty's in the eye of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beholder.</v>

108
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 1>We know there's quite a substantial </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of cultural variation in terms of</v>

109
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:25.304
<v Speaker 1>attitudes towards beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very difficult to pin down what </v>

110
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.070
<v Speaker 1>constitutes beauty from the objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

111
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:30.904
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's been a certain certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to do that and they've been </v>

112
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.184
<v Speaker 1>somewhat successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that as beauty's in </v>

113
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:38.924
<v Speaker 1>the eye of the beholder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that we naturally </v>

114
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.024
<v Speaker 1>attribute to an object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the things that we consider </v>

115
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:43.934
<v Speaker 1>properties of objects are actually what </v>
<v Speaker 1>lakoff describes his interaction with </v>

116
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:47.954
<v Speaker 1>properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things that we attribute to </v>

117
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:50.024
<v Speaker 1>the thing that actually arise as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of our interaction with the </v>

118
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the notion of friend,</v>

119
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.330
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you describe,</v>

120
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 1>if you put someone in the category of </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

121
00:06:58.941 --> 00:06:59.774
<v Speaker 1>you're actually describing them in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your pattern of interactions with </v>

122
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:03.014
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you attributed the qualities </v>

123
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 1>that make up those interactions to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that automatically.</v>

124
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.863
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm suggesting with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to this study of </v>

125
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>categorization is that we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the natural way that we think is</v>

126
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:17.324
<v Speaker 1>we think about things in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>implication for our behavioral output </v>

127
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.343
<v Speaker 1>and we need to do that because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what adaptation means and say a few of </v>

128
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 1>adapt adapted to something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've structured your behavior well.</v>

129
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:27.374
<v Speaker 1>Basically what you've done is structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior in the presence of that </v>

130
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>thing so that it does what you want it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

131
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.743
<v Speaker 1>which means basically that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>threaten you then it doesn't hurt you </v>

132
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.223
<v Speaker 1>that it furthers your progress towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal or that it caused the </v>

133
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 1>tombstone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goal itself.</v>

134
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Speaker 1>That's behavioral adaptation and</v>

135
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.303
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

136
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that make up that category of</v>

137
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.543
<v Speaker 1>objects to which you've structured </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral adaptation that's explored </v>

138
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:56.624
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's the domain of the known say in </v>

139
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>that domain is everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how to act towards.</v>

140
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Now what I'm trying to suggest in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of this whole manuscript,</v>

141
00:08:05.641 --> 00:08:06.474
<v Speaker 1>because that's how your brain works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific overlay of scientific </v>

142
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:10.484
<v Speaker 1>categorizations is just a thin veneer on</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of that and in some sense it's </v>

143
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.423
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The near from the perspective of </v>

144
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:16.364
<v Speaker 1>emotional regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science has enabled us to describe </v>

145
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:19.664
<v Speaker 1>things ever more accurate so that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep track of them are still what we're </v>

146
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 1>interested in is determining how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave in the presence of things.</v>

147
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what we want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

148
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.953
<v Speaker 1>Now lack off points on a few other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about natural categories and I </v>

149
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:34.964
<v Speaker 1>want you to think about this in regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the sorts of categories that we're </v>

150
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about for the remainder.</v>

151
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.853
<v Speaker 1>Of course he says they're characterized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by basic level categorization and basic </v>

152
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:43.784
<v Speaker 1>level primacy and basically what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>means by that is that we tend to view </v>

153
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:52.451
<v Speaker 1>things as in a category or as objects to</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves if they're the right size for</v>

154
00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

155
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>that the world that we perceive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the world of experience,</v>

156
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>which is in some sense doing world you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get access to is human sized.</v>

157
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.363
<v Speaker 1>The cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are categories that naturally </v>

158
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:09.860
<v Speaker 1>spring to mind because they're handy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about,</v>

159
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like the English imperial system of</v>
<v Speaker 1>measurement.</v>

160
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.003
<v Speaker 1>We can we define things in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being English imperial system and it's </v>

161
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.124
<v Speaker 1>very handy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally a foot is a foot long and </v>

162
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:20.883
<v Speaker 1>inches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The length of one digit in the point </v>

163
00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:24.714
<v Speaker 1>lakoff is trying to make is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world would have experienced presents </v>

164
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:28.284
<v Speaker 1>itself the way it presents itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the interaction between our </v>

165
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:34.010
<v Speaker 1>physiology and whatever it is.</v>

166
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.893
<v Speaker 1>That's how we there and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we're going to try to </v>

167
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:41.601
<v Speaker 1>explore is what does it mean to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that that's out there.</v>

168
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean we tend to think of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically as the objective world,</v>

169
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.983
<v Speaker 1>which would be exactly the same as it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>now if none of us were here except that </v>

170
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:50.334
<v Speaker 1>none of us would be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point lakoff is trying to make is </v>

171
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:53.424
<v Speaker 1>that what we define as reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat more or what were you </v>

172
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 1>experiences?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reality is more complex than that.</v>

173
00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:58.494
<v Speaker 1>It's an interaction between whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that's out there and ask and </v>

174
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:02.964
<v Speaker 1>everything that we think of is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We defined like in terms of our </v>

175
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:08.580
<v Speaker 1>experience of temporal duration and size</v>
<v Speaker 1>and weight.</v>

176
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.873
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

177
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.023
<v Speaker 1>I guess the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way you can get your mind </v>

178
00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 1>around this to some degree is to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of</v>

179
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.203
<v Speaker 1>what lakoff is saying in a sense is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we're human and have the </v>

180
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are basically our limitations,</v>

181
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.313
<v Speaker 1>means that the universe is constituted </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a particular way with regards to us </v>

182
00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>is that we have a built in level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

183
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.603
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously not the sub atomic level </v>
<v Speaker 1>or at the molecular level and it's not </v>

184
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:41.280
<v Speaker 1>the cosmic level either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's human sized.</v>

185
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.803
<v Speaker 1>Now if you start thinking about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>would constitute reality in the absence </v>

186
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:46.254
<v Speaker 1>of a human observer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first problem that you run into is </v>

187
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:53.661
<v Speaker 1>the problem of a reference point is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer have anything against which to</v>

188
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:54.654
<v Speaker 1>judge things like duration or size and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not things like certainly not </v>

189
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:02.120
<v Speaker 1>things like color or beauty or emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

190
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Don't those categories obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear.</v>

191
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.483
<v Speaker 1>What happens to the sensory categories </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not all that easy to figure out </v>

192
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:08.484
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

193
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.320
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I already can't figure it out.</v>

194
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.600
<v Speaker 3>Would you find that in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Character Physical Mall discusses</v>

195
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.400
<v Speaker 3>encoding the nature of human experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a mathematical form and sending it to</v>

196
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.123
<v Speaker 3>an alien so that he could reconstruct </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world that we experience based on </v>

197
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.933
<v Speaker 3>the</v>
<v Speaker 3>proportion of an elemental character or </v>

198
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:42.700
<v Speaker 3>an element</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

199
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.810
<v Speaker 3>And he gives a fairly good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

200
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.223
<v Speaker 3>just from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's convincing that you could describe </v>

201
00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 3>the world independent of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

202
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>If you define,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you define the,</v>

203
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.543
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

204
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 1>that make up our capacity to experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you eat,</v>

205
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.623
<v Speaker 1>if you can just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could possibly describe the world </v>

206
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:08.221
<v Speaker 1>that we exceed the world in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something which is transhumance by,</v>

207
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:11.290
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by using mathematical symbols.</v>

208
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Well that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So feynman says he,</v>

209
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.043
<v Speaker 1>he would define our level of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically as well as what it is </v>

210
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:20.074
<v Speaker 1>that we're experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would give an alien the </v>

211
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 1>capacity to see what it is that we see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't,</v>

212
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:25.444
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about a trans human </v>

213
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.883
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fiman does mischief subject the reality </v>

214
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>of reality to the presence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject?</v>

215
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

216
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to,</v>

217
00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 1>the subject must have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence that is,</v>

218
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:44.543
<v Speaker 1>it leaves me in some way where like our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own in order to interpret what we send </v>

219
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:48.670
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

220
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.503
<v Speaker 1>So just really not [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's an alien out there who has a </v>

221
00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:56.330
<v Speaker 1>similar enough intelligence to ours that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

222
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 1>that can understand this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've sent out.</v>

223
00:12:59.081 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean then then they're the subject in </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

224
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 1>It opens up the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it draws question too.</v>

225
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of puts a question mark over the</v>

226
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:08.674
<v Speaker 1>possibility of seeing that reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on that [inaudible] it's </v>

227
00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous talking about reality in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of the human subject.</v>

228
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans human,</v>

229
00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:20.170
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but trans subject,</v>

230
00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:22.570
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

231
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.620
<v Speaker 1>One small difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

232
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.690
<v Speaker 1>well I don't want to make too much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because it isn't,</v>

233
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.920
<v Speaker 1>it's knowing something that's critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the arguments that,</v>

234
00:13:33.921 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to undertake.</v>

235
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:36.454
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I want to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is how mythological categories </v>

236
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 1>represent the category of all things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exist in the absence of a subject,</v>

237
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.250
<v Speaker 1>but just kind of a strange category and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even the mythological,</v>

238
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:49.084
<v Speaker 1>like in the scientific world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we presume an objective independent </v>

239
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

240
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.293
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to argue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly don't want to argue about </v>

241
00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:56.020
<v Speaker 1>that because it's way too complicated an</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

242
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.243
<v Speaker 1>but may have also presumes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something exists in the absence of a </v>

243
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:02.260
<v Speaker 1>procedure or in the absence of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

244
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:03.094
<v Speaker 1>Although the thing that exists is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to define and that's one of </v>

245
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:08.940
<v Speaker 1>the things we're going to take a brief </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at today because my,</v>

246
00:14:08.941 --> 00:14:09.774
<v Speaker 1>my question is what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does science have to do it and all </v>

247
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 1>of that science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another size is size of the,</v>

248
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:16.160
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

249
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 1>of the raptors point that which presents</v>
<v Speaker 1>us up to the reference.</v>

250
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:20.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the lack office basically saying is </v>

251
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:23.524
<v Speaker 1>that certain categories seem to present </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to us more naturally than </v>

252
00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the category cat presents itself to</v>

253
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:33.490
<v Speaker 1>us more naturally than the category of </v>
<v Speaker 1>species of cat because we naturally,</v>

254
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:36.130
<v Speaker 1>we're naturally predisposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

255
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:38.770
<v Speaker 1>towards making an object out of.</v>

256
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:40.783
<v Speaker 1>I was something like at cap now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one knows exactly why it is that </v>

257
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.220
<v Speaker 1>certain forms of categorization appeared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to us more nationally than other sorts.</v>

258
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I suspect it has something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you can say.</v>

259
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I have something to do with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological hard wiring,</v>

260
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:54.464
<v Speaker 1>which is not really much of an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the way and we are and we </v>

261
00:14:56.541 --> 00:15:00.500
<v Speaker 1>perceive certain things more accurately </v>
<v Speaker 1>than we perceive other things.</v>

262
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to take a trivial example in,</v>

263
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 1>in this room will focus all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention on each other's face.</v>

264
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:10.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not going to spend a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time when I'm talking to you,</v>

265
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:11.594
<v Speaker 1>looking at your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My natural point of orientation in our </v>

266
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 1>discussion is your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very significant for me,</v>

267
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 1>and I think you see this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at children's drawings,</v>

268
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's a child's drawing of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's,</v>

269
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually something like this.</v>

270
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.983
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's not even a body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the head is 90% of the person and </v>

271
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Speaker 1>the face is 90% of the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

272
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a protocol linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of me of a human being.</v>

273
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Children tend to produce these sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures spontaneously.</v>

274
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.893
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's kind of a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero glyphic that stands for person and </v>

275
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:46.783
<v Speaker 1>the things that are most relevant about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person or the things that are </v>

276
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:49.934
<v Speaker 1>focused in on by the child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just certain things appear to us </v>

277
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:53.924
<v Speaker 1>more naturally than other things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things more naturally constitute </v>

278
00:15:56.901 --> 00:15:57.734
<v Speaker 1>our world.</v>

279
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.270
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about sides really quickly,</v>

280
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.633
<v Speaker 2>you returned to physics stuff and what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive that you can sort of look at </v>

281
00:16:07.681 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sort of divide the universe into</v>

282
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.600
<v Speaker 2>three very basic levels of order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude.</v>

283
00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.493
<v Speaker 2>You can have sort of what's intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the Newtonian universe we all </v>

284
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.653
<v Speaker 2>live in and you can have the cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of which is sort of defined by </v>

285
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.190
<v Speaker 2>signing mechanics and space time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can go to quantum mechanics,</v>

286
00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 2>which is smaller than you could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive.</v>

287
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.603
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the mathematics involved </v>

288
00:16:27.811 --> 00:16:30.260
<v Speaker 2>in each one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Newtonian equations,</v>

289
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.103
<v Speaker 2>the ones that make sense to you that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think in and the other ones seemed like </v>

290
00:16:33.811 --> 00:16:35.700
<v Speaker 2>when you read about in the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think to yourself,</v>

291
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.470
<v Speaker 2>how could this be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in a,</v>

292
00:16:37.471 --> 00:16:38.910
<v Speaker 2>in a sort of mathematical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all,</v>

293
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.740
<v Speaker 1>that's an excellent one because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

294
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:42.603
<v Speaker 1>that's an excellent example because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Newtonian universe is intuitive and the </v>

295
00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:46.534
<v Speaker 1>reason that it's intuitive from the loch</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee perspective is that the laws are </v>

296
00:16:49.331 --> 00:16:52.810
<v Speaker 1>in accordance with our motor patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>are patterns of adaptation.</v>

297
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:53.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean Psja is pointed out that we first</v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt to objects from the motor </v>

298
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.500
<v Speaker 1>perspective as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>

299
00:16:59.501 --> 00:17:00.334
<v Speaker 1>Then we build our abstract notions about</v>
<v Speaker 1>our relationships with those objects as </v>

300
00:17:03.821 --> 00:17:05.930
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of our established motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>

301
00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:10.240
<v Speaker 1>So that basically that basically sums up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of embodied knowledge.</v>

302
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And your point is that these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>universes are counter intuitive.</v>

303
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.063
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not in accordance with our </v>

304
00:17:15.731 --> 00:17:16.564
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's partly because they aren't </v>

305
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.503
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they aren't the left the levels of </v>

306
00:17:20.771 --> 00:17:21.604
<v Speaker 1>resolution or the orders of magnitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards which we actually adapt our </v>

307
00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:25.114
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

308
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.620
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

309
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

310
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.490
<v Speaker 1>you can finish reading through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

311
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.530
<v Speaker 1>the properties of natural categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have interest in categories.</v>

312
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I also think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

313
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.250
<v Speaker 1>membership and sensuality gradients is </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of an interesting category,</v>

314
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as this familial resemblance.</v>

315
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.550
<v Speaker 1>The idea of familial resemblance is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite interesting.</v>

316
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.273
<v Speaker 1>Basically what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raj has been coaching under the thing </v>

317
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:53.724
<v Speaker 1>that she's worked on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say if we have notions of prototypes </v>

318
00:17:57.961 --> 00:17:58.794
<v Speaker 1>where our categories is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of an ideal thing that constitutes </v>

319
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.710
<v Speaker 1>the category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the category bird people wouldn't say,</v>

320
00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:07.290
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that robin is a more prototypical burden</v>

321
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:11.520
<v Speaker 1>than an ostrich and you can't exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a question?</v>

322
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

323
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.130
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not really a way to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying,</v>

324
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:15.973
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But do we sort of subconsciously </v>

325
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 3>concrete different categories or find </v>
<v Speaker 3>things easier in a categorized?</v>

326
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.870
<v Speaker 3>And what we see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean now we'd all look at each other's</v>

327
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 3>faces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you have dreams,</v>

328
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:28.014
<v Speaker 3>you can sort of identify somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if they look completely </v>

329
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:30.840
<v Speaker 3>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>

330
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I knew in my dream this was supposed</v>

331
00:18:32.431 --> 00:18:33.264
<v Speaker 3>to be your father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though he looked like my math </v>

332
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:36.550
<v Speaker 3>teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they maybe are we sharing of getting out</v>

333
00:18:36.551 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 3>of different subconscious of essence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

334
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:40.554
<v Speaker 3>Then when we</v>

335
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.710
<v Speaker 1>in in a dream or I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

336
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying and people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

337
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean there must be some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

338
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 1>some other way of categorizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I guess what happens in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

340
00:18:52.571 --> 00:18:53.404
<v Speaker 1>in a situation and dream like that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to conflict in </v>

341
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:57.560
<v Speaker 1>categorizations of one takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>predominance.</v>

342
00:18:57.561 --> 00:19:00.300
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite all these exceptions,</v>

343
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.520
<v Speaker 1>the product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical aspects of this,</v>

344
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are still intact.</v>

345
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.053
<v Speaker 1>So we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to look at the individual </v>

346
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 1>differences in the dreams to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do your own exactly.</v>

347
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Exactly how that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the prototypical Smith brunt</v>

348
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:14.730
<v Speaker 1>of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

349
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:15.563
<v Speaker 1>your classic example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you identify some family members </v>

350
00:19:19.081 --> 00:19:23.640
<v Speaker 1>is coming from all from the same family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have all these Smith brothers,</v>

351
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>there's five of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can all tell their brothers,</v>

352
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:29.124
<v Speaker 1>but they don't share the same complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of characteristics is the </v>

353
00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 1>prototypical brother.</v>

354
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he has six characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

355
00:19:36.121 --> 00:19:36.954
<v Speaker 1>well a big nose would be one and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy mustache would be another kind of </v>

356
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.003
<v Speaker 1>beard would be a third big years and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fourth and heavy eyebrows from vfm in </v>

357
00:19:44.321 --> 00:19:48.090
<v Speaker 1>glasses say would be a six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's your prototype people,</v>

358
00:19:48.091 --> 00:19:48.924
<v Speaker 1>Smith's brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to be recognizable as a smith </v>

359
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.743
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you only have to have two of </v>

360
00:19:53.251 --> 00:19:55.170
<v Speaker 1>these characteristics and the rest can </v>
<v Speaker 1>vary.</v>

361
00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.200
<v Speaker 1>So this character would have big ears </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eyes and maybe the mustache,</v>

362
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.750
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have a little nose and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>beard.</v>

363
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:08.420
<v Speaker 1>And then this character would have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses and a big nose and mustache.</v>

364
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.880
<v Speaker 1>A little areas I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say a beard anyways,</v>

365
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you get the idea and they don't share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not like triangles.</v>

366
00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't precisely define the captain </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that this myth,</v>

367
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.363
<v Speaker 1>Brett Smith brothers half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically the old rate to this </v>

368
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:23.124
<v Speaker 1>relate to this central prototype which </v>
<v Speaker 1>we abstract from our experience in some </v>

369
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:27.480
<v Speaker 1>complex manner.</v>

370
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.990
<v Speaker 1>So the notion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else is interesting.</v>

371
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:36.683
<v Speaker 1>Well the other thing about natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories is that instead of being </v>

372
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:39.750
<v Speaker 1>distinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

373
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 1>like a proper sets as make it overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is part of the reason that,</v>

374
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.140
<v Speaker 1>well knowing this helps you make sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

375
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.490
<v Speaker 1>the logical categories because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift with context.</v>

376
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately that makes them difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>to interpret.</v>

377
00:20:53.831 --> 00:20:54.664
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most basic divisions of the </v>

378
00:20:57.641 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 1>world from a mythological perspective as</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine versus feminine.</v>

379
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.513
<v Speaker 1>And that's related in a very profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to explore a territory versus saw </v>

380
00:21:07.351 --> 00:21:09.110
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

381
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.850
<v Speaker 1>the problem is is that whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is masculine or feminine tends</v>

382
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:15.910
<v Speaker 1>to depend on the context of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>

383
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:16.953
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talk about an island and the </v>

384
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:21.640
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the island is masculine and notions</v>

385
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:22.474
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you talk about an island in the </v>

386
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:24.334
<v Speaker 1>sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the island is feminine and the sky </v>

387
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:27.090
<v Speaker 1>is masked.</v>

388
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:27.923
<v Speaker 1>But so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the island is theoretically </v>

389
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:31.900
<v Speaker 1>objectively the same in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

390
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.690
<v Speaker 1>it's cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an effect of classification,</v>

391
00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:36.910
<v Speaker 1>shifts with context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>

392
00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:39.800
<v Speaker 1>well that's a bizarre property for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization have.</v>

393
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:41.003
<v Speaker 1>The thing is we do this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually how we derive meaning </v>

394
00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:45.940
<v Speaker 1>in large part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always context dependent.</v>

395
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.153
<v Speaker 1>Like most of the words you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know because someone told you </v>

396
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:49.984
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know because you derive the meaning </v>

397
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.910
<v Speaker 1>from the context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see a normal word,</v>

398
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.753
<v Speaker 1>one context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in another context and then in </v>

399
00:21:56.861 --> 00:21:57.694
<v Speaker 1>another context and you can derive the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning from from from analysis of </v>

400
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.063
<v Speaker 1>what's common across the context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can define it novel where if </v>

401
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:08.284
<v Speaker 1>you saw it in 10 different sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have enough information there to </v>

402
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:11.464
<v Speaker 1>figure out what the word means and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the word shifts with the </v>

403
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:15.364
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this meaning of the sentence shifts </v>

404
00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:20.200
<v Speaker 1>with the paragraph and the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the paragraph shifts with the essay.</v>

405
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.363
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can pull things out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>context and reversed their meaning </v>

406
00:22:23.651 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact of context dependent meaning</v>

407
00:22:26.561 --> 00:22:27.820
<v Speaker 1>has gone up that much of a mystery</v>

408
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.680
<v Speaker 3>cause everything happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little confused</v>

409
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.610
<v Speaker 3>when you see a door or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

410
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.250
<v Speaker 3>Now someone can say that they see a door</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it has,</v>

411
00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

412
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.390
<v Speaker 3>it has sensory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

413
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.353
<v Speaker 3>information like it's a door you open </v>
<v Speaker 3>and close it but they feel nothing </v>

414
00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:46.170
<v Speaker 3>towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

415
00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.750
<v Speaker 3>But does it have value?</v>

416
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Well it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always last week for example,</v>

417
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the relationship of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to your story.</v>

418
00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:01.360
<v Speaker 1>You have your story</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

419
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.630
<v Speaker 1>like if part of your ideal future</v>

420
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.730
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have it doesn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>relevance unless it interferes.</v>

421
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

422
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.220
<v Speaker 1>not only interferes with if it aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>

423
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.530
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look again,</v>

424
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.433
<v Speaker 1>whatever it looks to me like your cortex</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved in part to modulate the </v>

425
00:23:19.221 --> 00:23:20.054
<v Speaker 1>automatic reactions of your limbic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system to stimuli to make it more </v>

426
00:23:22.521 --> 00:23:24.790
<v Speaker 1>flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How it looks to me like what's happening</v>

427
00:23:24.791 --> 00:23:26.900
<v Speaker 1>is that what your cortex has done is </v>
<v Speaker 1>high jack,</v>

428
00:23:26.901 --> 00:23:30.800
<v Speaker 1>your limbic system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this way it says you can put anything</v>

429
00:23:30.801 --> 00:23:34.790
<v Speaker 1>you want into the goal box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you put it there,</v>

430
00:23:34.791 --> 00:23:37.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a conservatory reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what it is.</v>

431
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Now you have a lot of underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological systems,</v>

432
00:23:40.281 --> 00:23:42.800
<v Speaker 1>but how has their own idea about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be here,</v>

433
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.990
<v Speaker 1>but you can still put whatever you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

434
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a conservatory reward now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you do that,</v>

435
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:53.210
<v Speaker 1>everything that you encounter is </v>
<v Speaker 1>construed in relationship to that goal.</v>

436
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.193
<v Speaker 1>So the door is only relevant if you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get through it to get to where you </v>

437
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:57.614
<v Speaker 1>want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's not relevant at the end </v>

438
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:00.404
<v Speaker 1>of the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will.</v>

439
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you shift the significance of things</v>

440
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.300
<v Speaker 1>by shifting your framework of reference </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what we're trying to define this.</v>

441
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 1>What constitutes a framework of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>

442
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.190
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a framework of reference?</v>

443
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I would say in terms of natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>

444
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:16.723
<v Speaker 1>everything within here is of one type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and everything outside of it is </v>

445
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:22.503
<v Speaker 1>I'm a completely different type of thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tried to define that as the known </v>

446
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.133
<v Speaker 1>and unknown.</v>

447
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really think this is,</v>

448
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to chase</v>

449
00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.103
<v Speaker 1>say categories have this central </v>
<v Speaker 1>prototype and there's all sorts of </v>

450
00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:42.090
<v Speaker 1>mythological categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Masculine,</v>

451
00:24:42.091 --> 00:24:43.890
<v Speaker 1>this one category and feminine is </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

452
00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.203
<v Speaker 1>a sky as a category and earth is it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>category matter as a category and water </v>

453
00:24:48.871 --> 00:24:52.140
<v Speaker 1>as a category because things overlap in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some odd way,</v>

454
00:24:52.141 --> 00:24:54.360
<v Speaker 1>like sky tends to be related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>

455
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.710
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to chase down what's at</v>

456
00:24:58.711 --> 00:25:01.770
<v Speaker 1>the core of these mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories and that's why I come up with</v>

457
00:25:01.771 --> 00:25:03.930
<v Speaker 1>these terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No woman unknown.</v>

458
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.660
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediation that's the knower.</v>

459
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is even more fundamental,</v>

460
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.260
<v Speaker 1>the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unexplored territory.</v>

461
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:17.483
<v Speaker 1>The no one has explored territory</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the knower is the explorer and </v>

462
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:27.980
<v Speaker 1>that's how we conceive of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is made up.</v>

463
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

464
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.490
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

465
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.760
<v Speaker 1>That's how our brain naturally organizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

466
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.610
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

467
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:37.483
<v Speaker 1>I was a little confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come that the heavens or the sky is </v>

468
00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:41.504
<v Speaker 1>considered masculine and cans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would think known territory because </v>

469
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 1>compared to the earth it seems like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>more unknown.</v>

470
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>

471
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.103
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

472
00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.610
<v Speaker 1>well have to think about that part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer.</v>

473
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:00.613
<v Speaker 1>There's two masculine categories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the answer is the </v>

474
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:08.710
<v Speaker 1>explored territory tends to be the king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the old king Michael Cirrus</v>

475
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.153
<v Speaker 1>or example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does the knower tends to be </v>

476
00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:15.254
<v Speaker 1>masculine as well as usually the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's horace say or Marduk and these </v>

477
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:26.180
<v Speaker 1>are usually skype bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're assimilated to the sun,</v>

478
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.930
<v Speaker 1>the sun as assimilated to consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's basically the answer to that.</v>

479
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.870
<v Speaker 1>The sky is the domain of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun is massive.</v>

480
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Why is the Sun Masculine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

481
00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.110
<v Speaker 1>because it's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

482
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.430
<v Speaker 1>illumination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment,</v>

483
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.460
<v Speaker 1>it rate it rules during the times when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are conscious.</v>

484
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:45.150
<v Speaker 1>It's also the thing that fights the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon of chaos in the night packs.</v>

485
00:26:45.151 --> 00:26:47.520
<v Speaker 1>It's way out in the belly of the beast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then is born again</v>

486
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.960
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

487
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.750
<v Speaker 3>that's the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that question.</v>

488
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.840
<v Speaker 3>I could think of a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the sky could be explored.</v>

489
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:55.674
<v Speaker 3>Territory relative theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who never thought of going up in </v>

490
00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:00.184
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is not something you move </v>

491
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:03.780
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something it's over you.</v>

492
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.540
<v Speaker 3>And to that extent it is exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very predictable.</v>

493
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.980
<v Speaker 3>And even if you move a great distance </v>
<v Speaker 3>across Europe,</v>

494
00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.790
<v Speaker 3>this guys is relatively the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's your changes?</v>

495
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:12.743
<v Speaker 3>Inadequate,</v>

496
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:13.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

497
00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.640
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be as well.</v>

498
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.320
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to remember,</v>

499
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:19.800
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of mythological symbols tricky.</v>

500
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.280
<v Speaker 1>They do shift with context and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not always culturally stable.</v>

501
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:24.443
<v Speaker 1>For the Sumerians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was male and the earth was </v>

502
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:27.360
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the Egyptians,</v>

503
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:29.100
<v Speaker 1>the sky was female and the earth was </v>
<v Speaker 1>male.</v>

504
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.080
<v Speaker 1>That's more rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does happen.</v>

505
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.580
<v Speaker 1>What seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

506
00:27:32.581 --> 00:27:33.414
<v Speaker 1>so you have to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look for the prototype </v>

507
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:37.500
<v Speaker 1>that's at the core of this to try and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense of it.</v>

508
00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:38.334
<v Speaker 1>The shifting relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the mother earth notion is more </v>

509
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.410
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laptop.</v>

510
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 1>The fatherland is also a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion,</v>

511
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fight for the fatherland,</v>

512
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.673
<v Speaker 1>we fight for the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those two ideas have slightly different </v>

513
00:27:53.521 --> 00:27:57.710
<v Speaker 1>slants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like to call the explorer</v>

514
00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.560
<v Speaker 3>predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unexplored,</v>

515
00:27:59.561 --> 00:28:01.510
<v Speaker 3>the unpredictable might be just as </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental.</v>

516
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.631
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

517
00:28:03.631 --> 00:28:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

518
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another,</v>

519
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.790
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it as well.</v>

520
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically where you see the,</v>

521
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.593
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological overlap instantly </v>

522
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:14.754
<v Speaker 1>because we do know now that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional systems are our a priori </v>

523
00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.120
<v Speaker 1>hardwired to respond to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable.</v>

524
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:21.983
<v Speaker 1>That's a domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it looks to me like in terms of </v>

525
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.753
<v Speaker 1>neuro psychological function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the left hemisphere of the </v>

526
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:28.764
<v Speaker 1>linguistic hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's specialized for habitual patterns </v>

527
00:28:31.051 --> 00:28:31.884
<v Speaker 1>of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks to me like it's the hemisphere </v>

528
00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:37.170
<v Speaker 1>that rules and known territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

529
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:37.831
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

530
00:28:37.831 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Speaker 1>your brain is actually wired up so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

531
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:40.763
<v Speaker 1>it has one set of responses that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful when you know what the hell </v>

532
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:45.384
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it has a whole other set of </v>

533
00:28:47.101 --> 00:28:49.380
<v Speaker 1>subsystems that are useful when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what you're doing.</v>

534
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And when you do know what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the linguistic left.</v>

535
00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:52.983
<v Speaker 1>That's it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you don't know what you're </v>

536
00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:55.884
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the limbically dominated right </v>

537
00:28:57.271 --> 00:29:00.680
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere that then appears to mediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your actions.</v>

538
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Now why would I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

539
00:29:02.261 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 1>it's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we know the right frontal cortex</v>

540
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:07.180
<v Speaker 1>responds to punishment and threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trevor,</v>

541
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.033
<v Speaker 1>the APR already phenomenon that appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the appearance of the </v>

542
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:11.424
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the right hemisphere is what governs </v>

543
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:16.110
<v Speaker 1>your behavioral responses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you encounter something you do that</v>

544
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:19.260
<v Speaker 1>you can predict in terms of it's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive functions.</v>

545
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governance,</v>

546
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.260
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

547
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.450
<v Speaker 1>It may govern pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not so clear,</v>

548
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.120
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like there's a high possibility</v>

549
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.620
<v Speaker 1>governs depression anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

550
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.533
<v Speaker 1>it's also the part of your brain that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at recognizing patterns and </v>

551
00:29:32.661 --> 00:29:35.190
<v Speaker 1>generating stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my guess is that you can think about</v>

552
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:36.024
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you encounter something you don't </v>

553
00:29:37.381 --> 00:29:38.214
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you tried to do is to </v>

554
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 1>figure out how it's like other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already encountered,</v>

555
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.873
<v Speaker 1>which is basically to say that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're first trying to adapt to </v>

556
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 1>something that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't predict,</v>

557
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:48.843
<v Speaker 1>you try to apprehend in it familiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns say well even people who just </v>

558
00:29:52.361 --> 00:29:55.560
<v Speaker 1>with the sky then that's how we get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constellations had this massive,</v>

559
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 1>an undiscovered territory that </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes the night sky.</v>

560
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.093
<v Speaker 1>You chunk it into patterns and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it identifiable and you have </v>

561
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:03.514
<v Speaker 1>stories that revolve around the patterns</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start to move the information </v>

562
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:09.850
<v Speaker 1>from the domain of the unknown into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of familiar territory.</v>

563
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.903
<v Speaker 1>And when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere is the hemisphere </v>

564
00:30:13.391 --> 00:30:17.290
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be specialized for for </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and for fantasy.</v>

565
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 1>And it is fantasy is hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation as far as I can tell,</v>

566
00:30:21.281 --> 00:30:22.114
<v Speaker 1>a fantasy is the story of well maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this and your and your right </v>

567
00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:26.794
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere seems to be good for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have a nice set of </v>

568
00:30:28.301 --> 00:30:29.134
<v Speaker 1>functions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that is activated when </v>

569
00:30:31.421 --> 00:30:33.880
<v Speaker 1>you encounter something unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it stops you,</v>

570
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.773
<v Speaker 1>it makes you shut up and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the next thing it does is just </v>

571
00:30:37.351 --> 00:30:40.300
<v Speaker 1>start thinking it's specialized for </v>
<v Speaker 1>global pattern recognition.</v>

572
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Recognition wants to give you a quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dirty answer.</v>

573
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.310
<v Speaker 1>What's out there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now,</v>

574
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:46.930
<v Speaker 1>right hemisphere thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's like this.</v>

575
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:48.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this.</v>

576
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:49.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like this and it gives you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

577
00:30:49.421 --> 00:30:50.254
<v Speaker 1>So you get something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Kelly who will encounter and a </v>

578
00:30:52.691 --> 00:30:53.524
<v Speaker 1>little bit later who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a monster that inhabits the </v>

579
00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:59.730
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically composed of determinant</v>

580
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.573
<v Speaker 1>things that are frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like Kelly was the goddess of the </v>

581
00:31:04.061 --> 00:31:07.420
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has staring face big teeth,</v>

582
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:09.880
<v Speaker 1>she sits in fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has eight legs like a spider.</v>

583
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.630
<v Speaker 1>She's a picture of the thing that lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>the out there in the unknown.</v>

584
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

585
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.073
<v Speaker 1>Back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you elaborate on how the left </v>

586
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.890
<v Speaker 1>rewards in the business as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be,</v>

587
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.190
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be more specialized for </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that you already know how to</v>

588
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:28.660
<v Speaker 1>handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also,</v>

589
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.530
<v Speaker 1>it's also good at handling </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistically mediated information that</v>

590
00:31:32.531 --> 00:31:33.364
<v Speaker 1>by the time you've chopped up the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>into units that you can describe with </v>

591
00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:38.020
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already done a pretty good job of</v>

592
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:38.710
<v Speaker 1>adapting to it.</v>

593
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.210
<v Speaker 1>You can even have straggly represented </v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

594
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.153
<v Speaker 1>if you're still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think action is a form of </v>

595
00:31:44.981 --> 00:31:48.430
<v Speaker 1>categorization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really don't know something,</v>

596
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.890
<v Speaker 1>all you know about is the in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence.</v>

597
00:31:50.891 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 1>You should stop or run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a form of categorization.</v>

598
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.340
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty generalized information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

599
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.490
<v Speaker 1>By the time you've explored something </v>
<v Speaker 1>really thoroughly,</v>

600
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 1>you can describe it and words and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can communicate it,</v>

601
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.800
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to me part of what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left hemisphere does,</v>

602
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's also responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think about it this way.</v>

603
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.393
<v Speaker 1>The left frontal hemisphere is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the generation of </v>

604
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:12.980
<v Speaker 1>positive aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

605
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:13.863
<v Speaker 1>you only generate positive ethic in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of cues of conservatory reward </v>

606
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.360
<v Speaker 1>in the presence of incentive rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

607
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.233
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates that you're getting closer to </v>

608
00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:26.200
<v Speaker 1>your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

609
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.333
<v Speaker 1>Now explored territory is basically full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of indications that you're getting </v>

610
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:32.164
<v Speaker 1>closer to your goal.</v>

611
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.000
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's explored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

612
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:34.953
<v Speaker 1>Because you've already transformed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>from something unknown and threatening </v>

613
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 1>into something that you can use to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to where you want to go.</v>

614
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.720
<v Speaker 1>And the left hemisphere does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it looks to me like,</v>

615
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.230
<v Speaker 1>well it looks to me like those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sort of fit together.</v>

616
00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Adoptation basically means in its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its most optimal sense,</v>

617
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.033
<v Speaker 1>adaptation means that you transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you do not understand into </v>

618
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.470
<v Speaker 1>something that you can not only predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>but can you,</v>

619
00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.930
<v Speaker 1>because you just don't want to transform</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything into something irrelevant,</v>

620
00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:07.220
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be useless.</v>

621
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.640
<v Speaker 1>You want to transform things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand the things that you</v>

622
00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:12.860
<v Speaker 1>can do something with that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

623
00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:14.463
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so at the individual has a different </v>

624
00:33:16.531 --> 00:33:18.960
<v Speaker 5>balance through which they approach like</v>
<v Speaker 5>the youth,</v>

625
00:33:18.961 --> 00:33:22.120
<v Speaker 5>like the balance between the left and </v>
<v Speaker 5>right hemisphere or the first two.</v>

626
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.943
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some evidence for variation and </v>

627
00:33:25.901 --> 00:33:27.370
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

628
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.160
<v Speaker 1>some people are more inhibited and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are less inhibited.</v>

629
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with that is that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that,</v>

630
00:33:34.241 --> 00:33:35.074
<v Speaker 1>I mean it does look like there's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>solid evidence for these temperamental </v>

631
00:33:37.271 --> 00:33:38.104
<v Speaker 1>variations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say that you have a lower </v>

632
00:33:40.121 --> 00:33:41.440
<v Speaker 1>threshold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

633
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.250
<v Speaker 1>for experiencing anxiety in the presence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of something or a new one,</v>

634
00:33:45.251 --> 00:33:47.800
<v Speaker 1>then the next person does and that's to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cross situation.</v>

635
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:48.873
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is that it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>take into account the fact that what's </v>

636
00:33:51.791 --> 00:33:55.260
<v Speaker 1>unexpected is always construed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the story,</v>

637
00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.790
<v Speaker 1>but my guess is that if people looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this,</v>

638
00:33:57.791 --> 00:33:58.624
<v Speaker 1>they find it inhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have different stories about the </v>

639
00:34:01.601 --> 00:34:02.434
<v Speaker 1>way the world is constructed and part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their biological predisposition towards </v>

640
00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:06.844
<v Speaker 1>timidity manifest itself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the stories they tell </v>

641
00:34:10.271 --> 00:34:13.330
<v Speaker 1>themselves about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense because if you're more,</v>

642
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:14.853
<v Speaker 1>you're more frightened by people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stories you tell about them are </v>

643
00:34:17.361 --> 00:34:20.520
<v Speaker 1>going to be twisted more towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of threat.</v>

644
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.833
<v Speaker 1>So those</v>

645
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:24.210
<v Speaker 5>does that balance also very </v>
<v Speaker 5>situationally,</v>

646
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.123
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if if someone is refusing groups up in </v>

647
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:27.523
<v Speaker 5>all this information that does have </v>
<v Speaker 5>relevance to their story and they're </v>

648
00:34:30.091 --> 00:34:34.190
<v Speaker 5>ignoring it until it gets to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>point where they can foresee,</v>

649
00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:35.493
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are a whole last half of </v>

650
00:34:36.881 --> 00:34:40.420
<v Speaker 1>the course is about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like because one of the things that</v>

651
00:34:40.421 --> 00:34:41.254
<v Speaker 1>you can do to yourself to make yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>more pathological and just know how to </v>

652
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.633
<v Speaker 1>adapt to normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his information and that makes you </v>

653
00:34:46.991 --> 00:34:50.170
<v Speaker 1>function with pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

654
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.103
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would that actually make the right </v>

655
00:34:51.451 --> 00:34:54.080
<v Speaker 5>hemisphere less reactive or we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>make it yet?</v>

656
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.680
<v Speaker 1>It would make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would make a left,</v>

657
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.233
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

658
00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.000
<v Speaker 5>Compensating function or is it,</v>

659
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:01.553
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens in those </v>

660
00:35:02.731 --> 00:35:03.564
<v Speaker 1>circumstances does the right hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to make a lot of noise so your </v>

661
00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:07.314
<v Speaker 1>dreams start to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or one of the students I had last been </v>

662
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.493
<v Speaker 1>open the in the class this past last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year has just written a paper for me on </v>

663
00:35:13.481 --> 00:35:17.470
<v Speaker 1>the potential function of dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He points out that in in neural map,</v>

664
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:22.230
<v Speaker 1>in neural net modeling of pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition,</v>

665
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:23.723
<v Speaker 1>there's a phenomena called catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure where if you have a neuro debt </v>

666
00:35:26.431 --> 00:35:27.264
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to a bird category and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish category and you'd throw in a </v>

667
00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:30.594
<v Speaker 1>penguin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what happens is that the bird </v>

668
00:35:32.131 --> 00:35:35.820
<v Speaker 1>county going to fish category collapsed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all you get is animal category.</v>

669
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:36.923
<v Speaker 1>So there's kinds anomalous information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will blow a whole categorization </v>

670
00:35:39.991 --> 00:35:40.824
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what he paused it was that there's </v>

671
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:43.374
<v Speaker 1>one system that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does categorization and another </v>

672
00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:50.640
<v Speaker 1>that's slowly feeds at anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 1>information so it doesn't collapse.</v>

673
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.000
<v Speaker 1>So it has time to adjusted structure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new anomalous information,</v>

674
00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.190
<v Speaker 1>but blowing into a categorization </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme.</v>

675
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to have a categorization </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme because if you don't,</v>

676
00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:01.710
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's really global,</v>

677
00:36:01.711 --> 00:36:03.240
<v Speaker 1>like if I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

678
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:06.630
<v Speaker 1>well how do I write an essay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said you act like a human being.</v>

679
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:07.703
<v Speaker 1>So this is pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this information is so vague as to be </v>

680
00:36:10.411 --> 00:36:14.080
<v Speaker 1>completely useless for the task at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to categorize it,</v>

681
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:14.933
<v Speaker 1>you want information that's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently high resolution so that it </v>

682
00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:18.894
<v Speaker 1>will aid you in your task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I blow all your categorization sets </v>

683
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:23.730
<v Speaker 1>and you're just left with this really </v>
<v Speaker 1>amorphous,</v>

684
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.940
<v Speaker 1>amorphous categorization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to act.</v>

685
00:36:26.941 --> 00:36:27.774
<v Speaker 1>So you want to maintain your categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he suggested was wasn't the dream </v>

686
00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:35.130
<v Speaker 1>slowly moving almost information up into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that categorization schemes.</v>

687
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in terms of your question,</v>

688
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:39.953
<v Speaker 1>well if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you constantly ignore anomalous </v>

689
00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:45.900
<v Speaker 1>information pouring in from the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere,</v>

690
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:46.734
<v Speaker 1>basically what you've done is categorize</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more information into the </v>

691
00:36:50.521 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 1>category of things that are so terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't be faced.</v>

692
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.100
<v Speaker 1>And I think what you do under those </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

693
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.620
<v Speaker 1>you activate a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

694
00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.513
<v Speaker 1>that lives in your right hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it gets more and more and more </v>

695
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:06.741
<v Speaker 1>powerful until one day when at a weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment say it just swallows you whole.</v>

696
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.333
<v Speaker 1>And that's when you fall catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We into depression or into terrible </v>

697
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:12.654
<v Speaker 1>anxiety or maybe even depending on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological predisposition to </v>

698
00:37:15.481 --> 00:37:18.380
<v Speaker 1>something resembling schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Katie,</v>

699
00:37:18.381 --> 00:37:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all that information that you've</v>

700
00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:22.560
<v Speaker 1>encountered that's anomalous and scag </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocks,</v>

701
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.700
<v Speaker 1>you categorize it by avoiding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the category is so terrible.</v>

702
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I can't face it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think that if you integrate it,</v>

703
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:30.030
<v Speaker 1>you don't end up with nightmares?</v>

704
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.673
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

705
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.920
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although if you haven't been integrating</v>

706
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:35.754
<v Speaker 1>and then you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nightmares might increase in </v>

707
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 1>intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the case that when you are</v>

708
00:37:40.771 --> 00:37:41.521
<v Speaker 1>dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

709
00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:42.390
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

710
00:37:42.391 --> 00:37:44.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your spinal cord,</v>

711
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.043
<v Speaker 1>your reticular activating system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part is activating the hippocampus </v>

712
00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:49.434
<v Speaker 1>and the Amygdala.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the part of the brain that </v>

713
00:37:50.431 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 1>deals with anomalous information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It reverts to two brainstem control.</v>

714
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.680
<v Speaker 1>So it looks to me like this is a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a reasonable hypothesis.</v>

715
00:37:58.681 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 1>You have a system that deals with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and another one that deals with</v>

716
00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:03.780
<v Speaker 1>what you don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need both.</v>

717
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.330
<v Speaker 1>If you ignore one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

718
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.193
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole social psych literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>that says if you ignore anomalous </v>

719
00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:10.980
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're happier.</v>

720
00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

721
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:13.853
<v Speaker 1>that's a really appalling literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't take temporal </v>

722
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:19.550
<v Speaker 1>duration into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real good in the short term.</v>

723
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.410
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are really,</v>

724
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:21.953
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole,</v>

725
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.621
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

726
00:38:25.621 --> 00:38:26.454
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The positive illusions literature is </v>

727
00:38:27.341 --> 00:38:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Taylor or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

728
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:29.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

729
00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:30.624
<v Speaker 1>it's being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being trashed with empirical data </v>

730
00:38:33.361 --> 00:38:34.650
<v Speaker 1>showing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

731
00:38:34.651 --> 00:38:36.730
<v Speaker 1>In the short terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good solution for the long term.</v>

732
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:41.140
<v Speaker 1>You know you get hostile and anxious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and people don't like you very</v>

733
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:41.860
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you know,</v>

734
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 1>hardly all that surprising but they </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually wrote self help books,</v>

735
00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.093
<v Speaker 1>self help books telling people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive self legions would good for </v>

736
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:48.934
<v Speaker 1>mental health man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite like 5,000 years of </v>

737
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:53.770
<v Speaker 1>philosophical evidence to the contrary,</v>

738
00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.793
<v Speaker 2>both of these hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right hemisphere working at the same </v>

739
00:39:01.001 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you come across experience,</v>

740
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.570
<v Speaker 2>what would happen to a split brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>patient?</v>

741
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Is there been any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

742
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.190
<v Speaker 1>well we do know for example that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

743
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the literature on emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsivity of split brain patients,</v>

744
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that if you sustain right </v>
<v Speaker 1>frontal cortical damage,</v>

745
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.240
<v Speaker 1>it makes you inappropriately northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and anxious.</v>

746
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.313
<v Speaker 1>And what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens under those circumstances </v>

747
00:39:21.521 --> 00:39:23.770
<v Speaker 1>is that you acquire functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathy,</v>

748
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:24.933
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that psychopath </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't regulate his behavior as a </v>

749
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:29.164
<v Speaker 1>consequence of information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates that his behavioral output is </v>

750
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:34.990
<v Speaker 1>doing something that in the long run is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad idea.</v>

751
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

752
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a famous paper by Islam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>demands you about a guy who uh,</v>

753
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.120
<v Speaker 1>can't remember his initials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had an Iq of 143,</v>

754
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 1>right frontal damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no measurable decrements in Iq.</v>

755
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.990
<v Speaker 1>So he's still 143 is three standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviations above the mean.</v>

756
00:39:49.991 --> 00:39:50.824
<v Speaker 1>We're talking very bright person here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he makes series of catastrophic </v>

757
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.950
<v Speaker 1>decisions that look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are up,</v>

758
00:39:56.951 --> 00:40:00.340
<v Speaker 1>the sort that you'd associate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid criminality.</v>

759
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.810
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

760
00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:03.250
<v Speaker 1>gets divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he marries Ah,</v>

761
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

762
00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:06.813
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is very bad for him </v>

763
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:11.380
<v Speaker 1>basically gets involved in a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>series of terrible business decisions,</v>

764
00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.310
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

765
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.630
<v Speaker 1>So if you're missing the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your right frontal Cortex,</v>

766
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.250
<v Speaker 1>you're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No kidding,</v>

767
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.293
<v Speaker 1>because you've knocked out the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that deals with all those things </v>

768
00:40:21.311 --> 00:40:22.144
<v Speaker 1>that make you unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be unhappy to live </v>

769
00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:26.704
<v Speaker 1>properly</v>

770
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:29.583
<v Speaker 1>when you encounter those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dope go out according to plan </v>

771
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:32.944
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't attend to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that don't occur according to </v>

772
00:40:36.131 --> 00:40:37.520
<v Speaker 1>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't learn.</v>

773
00:40:37.521 --> 00:40:42.040
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep your model of adaptation stable</v>

774
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.203
<v Speaker 1>in the face of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the face of shifting environmental </v>

775
00:40:45.131 --> 00:40:50.131
<v Speaker 1>contingencies and what that basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>means is that over time the thing that's</v>

776
00:40:50.471 --> 00:40:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you gets old and senile and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's represented.</v>

777
00:40:53.231 --> 00:40:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Mythology by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the,</v>

778
00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.870
<v Speaker 1>that's the image of the wasteland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

779
00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.010
<v Speaker 1>that's the land where all the trees have</v>
<v Speaker 1>dried up and everything's all,</v>

780
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:00.883
<v Speaker 1>nothing grows and you can read that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the absence of the positive aspect of </v>

781
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:06.334
<v Speaker 1>the great mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that there's no beneficial </v>

782
00:41:08.291 --> 00:41:13.170
<v Speaker 1>novelty around or you can read that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tyranny of stupid if you all would.</v>

783
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

784
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.713
<v Speaker 2>You're suggesting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you suggesting that in the apps and </v>

785
00:41:17.701 --> 00:41:21.390
<v Speaker 2>so a connection the left brain will </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominate?</v>

786
00:41:21.391 --> 00:41:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Probably one of them.</v>

787
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is speculative,</v>

788
00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.930
<v Speaker 1>but there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some physiological evidence like</v>

789
00:41:30.931 --> 00:41:31.764
<v Speaker 1>the left brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left hemisphere is in most </v>

790
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 1>circumstances in schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

791
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 1>if you're a schizophrenia and you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing voices,</v>

792
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:39.853
<v Speaker 1>it appears as though there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that the reason for that is </v>

793
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:42.884
<v Speaker 1>because the areas that are associates </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are isomorphic with the language </v>

794
00:41:46.761 --> 00:41:50.960
<v Speaker 1>centers but are in the right hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been released from tonic inhibition</v>

795
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:52.123
<v Speaker 1>by the language centers in the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere and our start to become </v>

796
00:41:54.711 --> 00:41:57.560
<v Speaker 1>active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way you interpret that is I hear</v>

797
00:41:57.561 --> 00:41:59.510
<v Speaker 1>voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they aren't me.</v>

798
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.440
<v Speaker 1>So which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which suggests to me that who you are as</v>

799
00:42:03.441 --> 00:42:04.274
<v Speaker 1>far as you're concerned is mostly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sum total of linguistically mediated </v>

800
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:08.684
<v Speaker 1>processes that localized usually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left hemisphere but mostly their </v>

801
00:42:11.881 --> 00:42:12.910
<v Speaker 1>linguistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We immediate,</v>

802
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.810
<v Speaker 1>which is only to say that mostly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are as far as your own self regard,</v>

803
00:42:16.811 --> 00:42:21.811
<v Speaker 1>he's a culturally constructed entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of which has been constructed using</v>

804
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:24.550
<v Speaker 1>the mediation of language that's up </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlement.</v>

805
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.553
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one won't be because first of all </v>

806
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:32.563
<v Speaker 1>there isn't consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of processes that are </v>

807
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:35.174
<v Speaker 1>consciousness now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one consciousness that's clearly </v>

808
00:42:38.571 --> 00:42:42.350
<v Speaker 1>conscious is what happens to you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>something enormous occurs.</v>

809
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Because you will orient towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think orienting is most central to</v>

810
00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:48.980
<v Speaker 1>what we define as consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like even in this room,</v>

811
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.843
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only a few things that you're </v>

812
00:42:51.561 --> 00:42:52.394
<v Speaker 1>really conscious of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're very much not conscious as a </v>

813
00:42:54.591 --> 00:42:56.360
<v Speaker 1>general rule of the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ceiling,</v>

814
00:42:56.361 --> 00:42:58.040
<v Speaker 1>the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most things around you.</v>

815
00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.173
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you're conscious of is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of your experiential field </v>

816
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:04.820
<v Speaker 1>where there's some novelty emerging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

817
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:05.893
<v Speaker 1>That's because you're orienting systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>are activated and those are critical to </v>

818
00:43:08.781 --> 00:43:09.614
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is very interesting because in </v>

819
00:43:11.961 --> 00:43:15.110
<v Speaker 1>mythology</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mythology,</v>

820
00:43:15.111 --> 00:43:17.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that brings about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

821
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.440
<v Speaker 1>the world is the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate between things,</v>

822
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 1>capacity to attend to novelty.</v>

823
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I want,</v>

824
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I want to get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

825
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.000
<v Speaker 1>today's discussion actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

826
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:33.973
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're orienting towards things </v>

827
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.083
<v Speaker 1>you're attending to the world that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined by chaos and transforming it </v>

828
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:43.003
<v Speaker 1>with the intermediation of exploration </v>
<v Speaker 1>into defined territory from the </v>

829
00:43:47.381 --> 00:43:50.270
<v Speaker 1>mythological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's equivalent to the construction of</v>

830
00:43:50.271 --> 00:43:53.930
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's why in in Christian theology,</v>

831
00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:55.790
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the doctrine of the logos.</v>

832
00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.220
<v Speaker 1>The logos is being assimilated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

833
00:43:58.221 --> 00:44:02.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a solar light entity mediated by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

834
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.910
<v Speaker 1>by language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's the word.</v>

835
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:05.833
<v Speaker 1>It's also a simulated to Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not a notion that's unique </v>

836
00:44:09.201 --> 00:44:13.430
<v Speaker 1>to Christianity as we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that creates the world,</v>

837
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.430
<v Speaker 1>creates the world by dividing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

838
00:44:16.431 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the earliest Sumerian mess,</v>

839
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.253
<v Speaker 1>there's a dragon who lives in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial waters and he gives rise to </v>

840
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:31.640
<v Speaker 1>two wedded daddy's once the sky and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

841
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.660
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're separate,</v>

842
00:44:33.661 --> 00:44:34.500
<v Speaker 1>but not really.</v>

843
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:35.843
<v Speaker 1>And the way the myth represents that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're locked in something </v>

844
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.070
<v Speaker 1>technically called a Hieros Gamos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a mystical marriage.</v>

845
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 1>So they're in sexual union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're united.</v>

846
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:44.483
<v Speaker 1>They're not really two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are union gives rise to a third </v>

847
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's their sun,</v>

848
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.970
<v Speaker 1>the god of the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out the scenario,</v>

849
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.100
<v Speaker 1>it's the God is the atmosphere who </v>
<v Speaker 1>separates them,</v>

850
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:55.223
<v Speaker 1>pushing the sky up to the sky and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first out of the earth and thereby </v>

851
00:44:58.111 --> 00:45:00.540
<v Speaker 1>creates the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell does that mean?</v>

852
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that in any creation myth,</v>

853
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:07.380
<v Speaker 1>there's four elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and once chaos.</v>

854
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:08.663
<v Speaker 1>That's the union of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will one at one point be distinct </v>

855
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.960
<v Speaker 1>and in sometimes represented methodology</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Indian,</v>

856
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 1>between the mother and the infant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's sort of symbiotic,</v>

857
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ones absolutely dependent on the other,</v>

858
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.553
<v Speaker 1>but yet in a sense they're two distinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>entities where they will be two </v>

859
00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.160
<v Speaker 1>distinctive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

860
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.293
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

861
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:31.680
<v Speaker 1>That's the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lives at the bottom of the water.</v>

862
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.390
<v Speaker 1>It gives rise to two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth and the sky.</v>

863
00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:38.280
<v Speaker 1>They're law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual union.</v>

864
00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:42.740
<v Speaker 1>They give rise to a sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The God of the atmosphere.</v>

865
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.420
<v Speaker 1>This is the sun gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He separates them.</v>

866
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:49.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say the world is born as a</v>

867
00:45:49.441 --> 00:45:51.330
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the interaction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>

868
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:52.164
<v Speaker 1>God in the Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God or you could say that the world was </v>

869
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:57.630
<v Speaker 1>born as a consequence of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sun God separates the two.</v>

870
00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Most stories are accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this stories saying you have to look</v>

871
00:46:01.141 --> 00:46:03.930
<v Speaker 1>at the mythological representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story say,</v>

872
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:06.590
<v Speaker 1>well the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is chaos there.</v>

873
00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 1>If that's a maternal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the mother.</v>

874
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:15.443
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

875
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.530
<v Speaker 1>that's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the source of all things.</v>

876
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:30.563
<v Speaker 1>Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God separates these two things by </v>

877
00:46:31.641 --> 00:46:32.474
<v Speaker 1>discriminating between them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically by taking the thing </v>

878
00:46:35.511 --> 00:46:38.540
<v Speaker 1>that's novel and transforming it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's explored.</v>

879
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:42.470
<v Speaker 1>That means the origin of the cosmos from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mythological perspective.</v>

880
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:46.820
<v Speaker 1>So there's three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's three seminal out elements in in</v>

881
00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:49.220
<v Speaker 1>your standard creation myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mother,</v>

882
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:50.240
<v Speaker 1>the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the son,</v>

883
00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.230
<v Speaker 1>and the mother is the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory.</v>

884
00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:56.150
<v Speaker 1>The fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the known explored territory and the sun</v>

885
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.950
<v Speaker 1>is the process that mediates between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

886
00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.083
<v Speaker 1>And I have assimilated that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orienting reflects because it's the </v>

887
00:47:00.801 --> 00:47:05.801
<v Speaker 1>thing that focuses in on novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiates the process of exploration,</v>

888
00:47:06.741 --> 00:47:09.470
<v Speaker 1>which is the process by which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>determinant world is form.</v>

889
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Thank well why does the determinant </v>
<v Speaker 1>world under those circumstances?</v>

890
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:13.783
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all those places that you can go </v>

891
00:47:15.651 --> 00:47:20.651
<v Speaker 1>where you know how to behave and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>places consist of the territory but also</v>

892
00:47:21.501 --> 00:47:23.630
<v Speaker 1>the behaviors of everyone else but you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with.</v>

893
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:24.703
<v Speaker 1>So Nolan territory is social territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all of our actions in habitual </v>

894
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.063
<v Speaker 1>are defined by the actions of others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of what it is that we know when </v>

895
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:36.820
<v Speaker 1>we say we know how to map the actions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and interactions of others.</v>

896
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's why the no one is also similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture</v>

897
00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:46.630
<v Speaker 1>and to the Patriarchy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cane.</v>

898
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.453
<v Speaker 1>Because of course the king is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral model that defines the state </v>

899
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:53.103
<v Speaker 1>who everyone in the state imitates so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone in the state can predict </v>

900
00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>

901
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.863
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me you're explored territory </v>

902
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.690
<v Speaker 1>because I can define what you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with this situation and the reason</v>

903
00:48:04.691 --> 00:48:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I can define us cause we shared the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

904
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.310
<v Speaker 1>which is what we're pursuing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goals there are at least concurrent,</v>

905
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.070
<v Speaker 1>they don't conflict because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicted.</v>

906
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:13.023
<v Speaker 1>We'd have trouble because you be mapping</v>
<v Speaker 1>things with one motivational </v>

907
00:48:16.121 --> 00:48:18.550
<v Speaker 1>significance and I'd be mapping the Mfi </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

908
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:22.120
<v Speaker 1>which basically means we either have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate,</v>

909
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:25.450
<v Speaker 1>which means you'd arrange your story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd arrange mind or we fight.</v>

910
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:26.740
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

911
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:27.574
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I can pretend that the conflict </v>

912
00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:30.274
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case sooner or later it will </v>

913
00:48:31.961 --> 00:48:32.794
<v Speaker 1>get me.</v>

914
00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:35.723
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is a course about social </v>

915
00:48:37.961 --> 00:48:41.970
<v Speaker 1>identity and social conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to read you some or get to one,</v>

916
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.813
<v Speaker 1>one sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to read you some things for </v>

917
00:48:43.581 --> 00:48:44.414
<v Speaker 1>Mircea Eliade because it'll help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will help you understand how it is </v>

918
00:48:47.681 --> 00:48:48.514
<v Speaker 1>that we naturally categorize things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to remember chaos because </v>

919
00:48:51.851 --> 00:48:54.700
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss.</v>

920
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:55.623
<v Speaker 1>They'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos is what exists before there's a </v>

921
00:48:59.921 --> 00:49:00.754
<v Speaker 1>separation of subject and object and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that chaos is is then both spirit </v>

922
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.540
<v Speaker 1>and matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible mythological way of speaking.</v>

923
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example of what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

924
00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:11.853
<v Speaker 1>Piaget said that the subject constructs </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself as well as the object in the </v>

925
00:49:15.821 --> 00:49:16.654
<v Speaker 1>course of exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that what you are </v>

926
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:20.614
<v Speaker 1>formed out of is all those things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you discovered as you were approaching </v>

927
00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 1>all those things you didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you form the world has a consequence</v>

928
00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:28.564
<v Speaker 1>of the process of exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also form yourself because it's </v>

929
00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:32.614
<v Speaker 1>in the process of encounter with novelty</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you generate information and it's </v>

930
00:49:35.291 --> 00:49:37.000
<v Speaker 1>information that you build your cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

931
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.073
<v Speaker 1>So from the mythological world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's chaos that existed </v>

932
00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:44.560
<v Speaker 1>before the world existed is composed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit,</v>

933
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:51.150
<v Speaker 1>which is what you will be and mattered</v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously,</v>

934
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.300
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds very interesting.</v>

935
00:49:55.301 --> 00:49:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Quonset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

936
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:57.543
<v Speaker 1>Question.</v>

937
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

938
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.133
<v Speaker 2>All alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go off into different </v>

939
00:50:03.151 --> 00:50:03.950
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

940
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:08.950
<v Speaker 2>The symmetry between the pros and goal </v>
<v Speaker 2>process and then the state one.</v>

941
00:50:11.491 --> 00:50:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Chaos state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

942
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:16.770
<v Speaker 2>And then the known nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

943
00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:18.660
<v Speaker 2>unknown knower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

944
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the knower is in the place of the </v>

945
00:50:21.211 --> 00:50:21.640
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

946
00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.640
<v Speaker 1>The know raise the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no worries.</v>

947
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.610
<v Speaker 1>The process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

948
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.240
<v Speaker 2>becomes the mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which your body's</v>

949
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:29.610
<v Speaker 1>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

950
00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

951
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.400
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

952
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's what religious stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically push you towards.</v>

953
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 1>That's why I wanted to show you this </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

954
00:50:35.961 --> 00:50:36.794
<v Speaker 1>Martech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martech is the person who encounters </v>

955
00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:38.501
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

956
00:50:38.501 --> 00:50:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm the God who attains the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>position in the hierarchy of Gods.</v>

957
00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Who then goes out to fight time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the dragon of both?</v>

958
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.010
<v Speaker 1>She's both the dragon of chaos and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother of all things.</v>

959
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Those two categories get overlapped some</v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs and in the,</v>

960
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.600
<v Speaker 1>in the fight with timeout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marta generates the cosmos.</v>

961
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Now the Mesopotamian King Imitates </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marduk.</v>

962
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what gives him power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

963
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.713
<v Speaker 1>that's what gives his position validity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that he's the embodiment of </v>

964
00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:08.060
<v Speaker 1>the Sun God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what does that mean?</v>

965
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:09.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sun God is the thing that makes the </v>

966
00:51:10.131 --> 00:51:11.780
<v Speaker 1>world well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

967
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:12.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sunken garden is an image of the </v>

968
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:16.820
<v Speaker 1>process of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which turns the unknown,</v>

969
00:51:16.821 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 1>which is undefined territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into explored territory,</v>

970
00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:20.840
<v Speaker 1>which is the world.</v>

971
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:26.350
<v Speaker 1>And as long as the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then the arcade people say the state,</v>

972
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.370
<v Speaker 1>if the king doesn't do his job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state becomes sterile.</v>

973
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Crops don't grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

974
00:51:33.201 --> 00:51:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

975
00:51:34.251 --> 00:51:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Trying to quit warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How they all kind of attitude is that if</v>

976
00:51:36.771 --> 00:51:38.990
<v Speaker 1>the king doesn't do his job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crops won't grow.</v>

977
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.113
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means is the king is a pattern </v>

978
00:51:41.811 --> 00:51:42.644
<v Speaker 1>of adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't constantly update his </v>

979
00:51:45.921 --> 00:51:50.921
<v Speaker 1>behavioral attributes in the space of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifting environmental contingencies,</v>

980
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:54.770
<v Speaker 1>the beneficial aspect of the environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>will disappear.</v>

981
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 1>So when they are caring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people says,</v>

982
00:51:57.410 --> 00:52:00.900
<v Speaker 1>if the king doesn't do his job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the state becomes say,</v>

983
00:52:00.901 --> 00:52:02.690
<v Speaker 1>no crops won't grow there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>

984
00:52:02.691 --> 00:52:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they do?</v>

985
00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:05.990
<v Speaker 1>He killed the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice the king,</v>

986
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:10.520
<v Speaker 1>or he has to undergo a ritual that </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates salary sacrifice,</v>

987
00:52:10.521 --> 00:52:11.354
<v Speaker 1>which actually the king of Mesopotamia </v>
<v Speaker 1>did every new years when he renewed the </v>

988
00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:15.770
<v Speaker 1>cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to do that.</v>

989
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Cause if he didn't renew the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically meant update his pattern</v>

990
00:52:20.481 --> 00:52:24.110
<v Speaker 1>of behavioral adaptation representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the environment would drift farther</v>

991
00:52:24.111 --> 00:52:27.500
<v Speaker 1>and farther away from the state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything would collapse precipitously.</v>

992
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:32.770
<v Speaker 1>So the king had to voluntarily and </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter novelty or in the long term,</v>

993
00:52:34.281 --> 00:52:35.114
<v Speaker 1>he would catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We encounter it along with all those </v>

994
00:52:37.191 --> 00:52:38.360
<v Speaker 1>people anyway.</v>

995
00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last semester.</v>

996
00:52:40.931 --> 00:52:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Can you relate that somehow to why money</v>
<v Speaker 2>has value or the use of coins?</v>

997
00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a funny one though,</v>

998
00:52:46.561 --> 00:52:47.394
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

999
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.860
<v Speaker 1>a gold coin has the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of</v>

1000
00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.720
<v Speaker 1>the head of a head of state on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1001
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.823
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gold is a symbol of the sun and the </v>

1002
00:52:59.131 --> 00:53:02.460
<v Speaker 1>sun is the Sun God and the emperor is </v>
<v Speaker 1>put on the toy.</v>

1003
00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:03.693
<v Speaker 1>Did you indicate value?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is the thing that is most </v>

1004
00:53:07.741 --> 00:53:08.574
<v Speaker 1>valuable and it's symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of that that we've used </v>

1005
00:53:11.341 --> 00:53:13.080
<v Speaker 1>to signify province basically.</v>

1006
00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:17.610
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1007
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:20.770
<v Speaker 1>gold is always been assimilated to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sun at least in the west,</v>

1008
00:53:20.771 --> 00:53:21.604
<v Speaker 1>so okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to read you some things from </v>

1009
00:53:23.801 --> 00:53:24.634
<v Speaker 1>Elliot and I think these things are well</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of social </v>

1010
00:53:27.781 --> 00:53:32.040
<v Speaker 1>psychology and the notion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding conflict and the hopes for</v>

1011
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:33.990
<v Speaker 1>its revolution resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of things.</v>

1012
00:53:33.991 --> 00:53:34.824
<v Speaker 1>I think your revolutionary if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand their significance because </v>

1013
00:53:37.141 --> 00:53:37.974
<v Speaker 1>the only out he basically describes how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that people naturally perceive </v>

1014
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:42.390
<v Speaker 1>those who are not like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1015
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:43.224
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1016
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.700
<v Speaker 1>if I'm like you,</v>

1017
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.720
<v Speaker 1>if I'm like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I share your story.</v>

1018
00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a castle.</v>

1019
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.213
<v Speaker 1>We're both inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can construe your relationship to me </v>

1020
00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.350
<v Speaker 1>with regards to our end goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1021
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I also am going to get to this later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also a dominance hierarchy.</v>

1022
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.150
<v Speaker 1>The kings at the top of it and every </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization is set up that way.</v>

1023
00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:19.763
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you and I are both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you and I in a hundred other people </v>

1024
00:54:22.501 --> 00:54:23.334
<v Speaker 1>are pursuing the same goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we organize ourselves into a dominance </v>

1025
00:54:25.771 --> 00:54:26.604
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We each have a position that basically </v>

1026
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:29.244
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a sub goal of that greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal and the utility of the goals are </v>

1027
00:54:32.761 --> 00:54:33.594
<v Speaker 1>rank ordered in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance and the person who's at the </v>

1028
00:54:36.301 --> 00:54:40.170
<v Speaker 1>top is simultaneously the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>person in the dominance hierarchy and an</v>

1029
00:54:40.171 --> 00:54:44.100
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chief Executive Officer in a corporation</v>

1030
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:47.400
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you can also relate that in thinking</v>

1031
00:54:47.401 --> 00:54:51.420
<v Speaker 1>about that this week too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more complex stories,</v>

1032
00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:53.310
<v Speaker 1>remember it looks like this</v>

1033
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:58.103
<v Speaker 4>and so on.</v>

1034
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing that's neat about this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also you remember,</v>

1035
00:55:04.741 --> 00:55:05.574
<v Speaker 1>does everybody remember how this works?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the story is actually consists </v>

1036
00:55:09.091 --> 00:55:11.490
<v Speaker 1>of sub stories basically all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1037
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Now the higher you are up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

1038
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:19.950
<v Speaker 1>the closer you are to the broadest </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanse of this story.</v>

1039
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.680
<v Speaker 1>So if you're just a functionary in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

1040
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.813
<v Speaker 1>you have one of these stories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that comes along to disrupt </v>

1041
00:55:26.581 --> 00:55:27.414
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you get fired is only going to </v>

1042
00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:31.350
<v Speaker 1>bond or people who are working on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular sub goal.</v>

1043
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're the king or the chief </v>
<v Speaker 1>executive officer,</v>

1044
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:38.250
<v Speaker 1>you occupied this territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like in the case of a,</v>

1045
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:39.084
<v Speaker 1>of a hostile takeover of a corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means the whole structure is </v>

1046
00:55:42.541 --> 00:55:43.374
<v Speaker 1>potentially disruptive and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside that structure feels anxiety and </v>

1047
00:55:47.611 --> 00:55:50.220
<v Speaker 1>depression because their stories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being disrupted.</v>

1048
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:52.403
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can also see how groups form in </v>

1049
00:55:53.971 --> 00:55:54.804
<v Speaker 1>relationship to this because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're most tightly identified with </v>

1050
00:55:58.561 --> 00:55:59.394
<v Speaker 1>those who share the most at the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the broadest subset of your embedded </v>

1051
00:56:05.791 --> 00:56:06.624
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

1052
00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:08.193
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1053
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:11.283
<v Speaker 1>does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you say that to response to </v>

1054
00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy's assassination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1055
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1056
00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:20.500
<v Speaker 1>More accurately in the north when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korean emperor died,</v>

1057
00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.560
<v Speaker 1>people said the sun had set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun had permanently,</v>

1058
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:25.630
<v Speaker 1>people were on the street wailing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying,</v>

1059
00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying around pictures of the sun,</v>

1060
00:56:27.971 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 1>God who disappeared because the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>state was placed into chaos.</v>

1061
00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.820
<v Speaker 1>But at the same thing happens when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1062
00:56:33.821 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Stalin died,</v>

1063
00:56:35.111 --> 00:56:35.944
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when any tire and dies because of the </v>

1064
00:56:37.121 --> 00:56:37.954
<v Speaker 1>tire is well in bodies and bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of the state killed the </v>

1065
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:43.940
<v Speaker 1>tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything collapses.</v>

1066
00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.700
<v Speaker 1>People come out in the streets and cry.</v>

1067
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:48.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fry points out that people like Queen </v>

1068
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:52.083
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth still draw crowd because lots </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people still thinking of medieval </v>

1069
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 1>fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1070
00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 1>but more accurately Queen Elizabeth in </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies or stories,</v>

1071
00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.030
<v Speaker 1>everyone's story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the,</v>

1072
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.433
<v Speaker 1>she's the focal point you could say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or She's the person who incarnates the </v>

1073
00:57:05.741 --> 00:57:10.741
<v Speaker 1>abstract and stories now so you can say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that or overtop of her objective reality</v>

1074
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:13.690
<v Speaker 1>is laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1075
00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:16.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many describe it.</v>

1076
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:19.463
<v Speaker 1>A glamorous</v>
<v Speaker 1>facade that people see you because of </v>

1077
00:57:24.761 --> 00:57:28.360
<v Speaker 1>their subjective interpretations and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>acts out that role.</v>

1078
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:30.250
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's projection.</v>

1079
00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:31.403
<v Speaker 1>Say That's a good example of projection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that what they're so excited </v>

1080
00:57:34.271 --> 00:57:37.150
<v Speaker 1>about is the queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's her attributes.</v>

1081
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:40.930
<v Speaker 1>But you can say in a sense that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what she signifies for behavior.</v>

1082
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:44.500
<v Speaker 1>But that's not exactly a property of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>

1083
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:45.334
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

1084
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Now if you can understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get very close to understanding what</v>

1085
00:57:48.251 --> 00:57:50.590
<v Speaker 1>it is that our people are referring to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were referring to.</v>

1086
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:55.590
<v Speaker 1>A God cause it Queen Elizabeth in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense is an incarnated to go out and</v>

1087
00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.313
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more potent gods occupied broader </v>

1088
00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:05.080
<v Speaker 1>domains of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the Mesopotamians said,</v>

1089
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.750
<v Speaker 1>and this is the core for religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories in general,</v>

1090
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.520
<v Speaker 1>is that the thing that should be at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the hierarchy is Marta,</v>

1091
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marduk was elected by all the other gods</v>

1092
00:58:13.571 --> 00:58:18.220
<v Speaker 1>to be the cane gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the process by which it normally is</v>

1093
00:58:18.221 --> 00:58:19.054
<v Speaker 1>transformed into explored territory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that basically means that if in </v>

1094
00:58:23.531 --> 00:58:24.364
<v Speaker 1>your hierarchy of values was placed </v>
<v Speaker 1>above all else is the necessity of </v>

1095
00:58:29.921 --> 00:58:33.340
<v Speaker 1>responding to a normally every time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself,</v>

1096
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.353
<v Speaker 1>then all your other biological systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that determine value will operate </v>

1097
00:58:40.181 --> 00:58:41.014
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you put something else in the </v>

1098
00:58:42.641 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 1>place of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1099
00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:46.443
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then sooner or later everything will </v>

1100
00:58:47.621 --> 00:58:49.750
<v Speaker 1>fall into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>

1101
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:52.023
<v Speaker 1>That's what those mythological stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to tell people that your </v>

1102
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:58.420
<v Speaker 1>attitude towards anomaly that determines</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and you have two choices.</v>

1103
00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.200
<v Speaker 1>You to face it voluntarily or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't,</v>

1104
00:59:02.201 --> 00:59:03.034
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why we're reading Milton's </v>

1105
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:05.374
<v Speaker 1>paradise lost because Milton's paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost is a story about the consequences </v>

1106
00:59:10.061 --> 00:59:14.380
<v Speaker 1>of voluntarily voluntary failure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit to the existence of the normally.</v>

1107
00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1108
00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 1>so you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read the story of Martech,</v>

1109
00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:23.390
<v Speaker 1>the Samarian myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

1110
00:59:23.391 --> 00:59:25.370
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say all those gods,</v>

1111
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.280
<v Speaker 1>they organized themselves into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

1112
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:30.890
<v Speaker 1>so they're threatened by timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the dragon of chaos.</v>

1113
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:33.260
<v Speaker 1>She con she caused the dude's unexplored</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

1114
00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:37.340
<v Speaker 1>She's going to destroy all the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create creator.</v>

1115
00:59:37.341 --> 00:59:38.174
<v Speaker 1>God's always do that and that's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown generates everything and </v>

1116
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:42.284
<v Speaker 1>takes everything back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it has this ambivalent motivational </v>

1117
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:45.044
<v Speaker 1>status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source of everything kind of place </v>

1118
00:59:46.661 --> 00:59:49.160
<v Speaker 1>that everything returns to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a constant threat.</v>

1119
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:51.560
<v Speaker 1>It never goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always something you don't have.</v>

1120
00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:52.663
<v Speaker 1>You don't expect to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gods organized themselves into a </v>

1121
00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:57.620
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and they put Marta cat the </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

1122
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Then he's the king.</v>

1123
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.133
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1124
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.393
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that what that story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you with regards to the </v>

1125
01:00:08.951 --> 01:00:11.200
<v Speaker 1>construction of the dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is two things.</v>

1126
01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.333
<v Speaker 1>It's first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamian society was the </v>

1127
01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the intermingling of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole set of cultural groups.</v>

1128
01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.413
<v Speaker 1>Each of them had their own God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically their own </v>

1129
01:00:21.461 --> 01:00:25.540
<v Speaker 1>representation of the highest ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>projected more or less into the external</v>

1130
01:00:25.541 --> 01:00:26.374
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there was a lot of differences </v>

1131
01:00:27.341 --> 01:00:28.174
<v Speaker 1>between these representations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the process of becoming one </v>

1132
01:00:31.391 --> 01:00:34.630
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these gods had to fight it out,</v>

1133
01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:35.464
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for dominance in the territory defined </v>

1134
01:00:38.561 --> 01:00:39.394
<v Speaker 1>by interpersonal communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the myth of Marta climbing the </v>

1135
01:00:42.581 --> 01:00:43.414
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy is the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cumulative story of the combat </v>

1136
01:00:46.931 --> 01:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>between these gods and the rise of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>clock,</v>

1137
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:54.250
<v Speaker 1>two preeminent status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can see at the end here,</v>

1138
01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:01.263
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on page 96 I don't know how many of you </v>

1139
01:01:02.891 --> 01:01:03.724
<v Speaker 1>have your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Marduk still in the Sumerian Myth </v>

1140
01:01:06.731 --> 01:01:07.564
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin still has a whole bunch of sort </v>

1141
01:01:09.551 --> 01:01:14.551
<v Speaker 1>of other names that were likely the </v>
<v Speaker 1>names of gods who sooner or later became</v>

1142
01:01:14.561 --> 01:01:15.394
<v Speaker 1>assimilated to Marduk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sort of took over their domain and </v>

1143
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:23.650
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamian said that mark had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how many names cst,</v>

1144
01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:25.383
<v Speaker 1>and here are some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what the Mesopotamians basically </v>

1145
01:01:28.061 --> 01:01:30.340
<v Speaker 1>concluded unconsciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1146
01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:31.623
<v Speaker 1>was that whenever Martech represented </v>
<v Speaker 1>was also vital to what all these other </v>

1147
01:01:34.481 --> 01:01:35.314
<v Speaker 1>names representative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here are some of the names he's Nam </v>

1148
01:01:38.381 --> 01:01:40.990
<v Speaker 1>to lack of who's the God who restores to</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1149
01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:42.123
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That he's describing his role in the </v>

1150
01:01:45.521 --> 01:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>process that we</v>

1151
01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1152
01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.390
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos.</v>

1153
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:55.620
<v Speaker 4>Impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1154
01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:57.383
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1155
01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>When the Mesopotamia Martech is the God </v>
<v Speaker 1>who restores to life,</v>

1156
01:02:01.381 --> 01:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>this is what they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's this process,</v>

1157
01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>this being read as death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stale state rejuvenation process.</v>

1158
01:02:11.131 --> 01:02:11.964
<v Speaker 1>That's more deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's named number one who can restore </v>

1159
01:02:14.971 --> 01:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>all ruined gods as though they were his </v>
<v Speaker 1>own creation.</v>

1160
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>The God Lord who who by holy incantation</v>
<v Speaker 1>restores the dead thoughts to light.</v>

1161
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the dad doors and you can say,</v>

1162
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:27.504
<v Speaker 1>well why is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>while your behavioral patterns of </v>

1163
01:02:30.511 --> 01:02:31.344
<v Speaker 1>adaptation or the consequences in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>final analysis of your mimicry of all </v>

1164
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>those people who came before you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>established moans,</v>

1165
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>exploration driven modes of adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that what do you consist</v>

1166
01:02:43.351 --> 01:02:44.184
<v Speaker 1>of in terms of your behaviors is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cumulative behaviors of your whole </v>

1167
01:02:47.581 --> 01:02:48.414
<v Speaker 1>culture in so far as those would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptively relevant and most of those </v>

1168
01:02:51.391 --> 01:02:52.224
<v Speaker 1>were established by people who are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead ancestral fingers in many </v>

1169
01:02:55.561 --> 01:02:56.394
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancestral figures or assimilated to </v>

1170
01:02:57.781 --> 01:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>God and that's because they determine </v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior.</v>

1171
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.553
<v Speaker 1>Then when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown is the domain of the dead </v>

1172
01:03:05.971 --> 01:03:07.200
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's basically,</v>

1173
01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:08.483
<v Speaker 1>there's an interesting little side is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of knowledge I know about you as </v>

1174
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.420
<v Speaker 1>if you were completely identified with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your culture,</v>

1175
01:03:15.421 --> 01:03:16.254
<v Speaker 1>Your radiology snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you're the product of people </v>

1176
01:03:18.781 --> 01:03:20.840
<v Speaker 1>who lived before you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not your own original thought.</v>

1177
01:03:20.841 --> 01:03:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Cause you buy den,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've adapted the dogma,</v>

1178
01:03:22.621 --> 01:03:24.240
<v Speaker 1>which defines you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not you.</v>

1179
01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:29.550
<v Speaker 1>It's the construction of people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>damned ideologically Huh.</v>

1180
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:32.640
<v Speaker 1>The catchword of an ideology as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slogan.</v>

1181
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Slogan is derived from the Welsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Gareth slowly,</v>

1182
01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Gareth means battle crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1183
01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Which is a nice commentary on etiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1184
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1185
01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.150
<v Speaker 6>So it seems to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1186
01:03:47.151 --> 01:03:49.610
<v Speaker 6>so the right hemisphere seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

1187
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.040
<v Speaker 6>what the process is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the king is doing.</v>

1188
01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.860
<v Speaker 6>They're the ones that are going out into</v>
<v Speaker 6>the unknown and the other ones that are,</v>

1189
01:03:54.861 --> 01:03:57.590
<v Speaker 6>that are using what they find,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1190
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:59.570
<v Speaker 6>just for adaptive behavior.</v>

1191
01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hang on one note now.</v>

1192
01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:03.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1193
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Look chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dragon,</v>

1194
01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.260
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the possibility.</v>

1195
01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:13.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the unknown before it's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>contacted.</v>

1196
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:14.543
<v Speaker 1>It's the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically is the fact that behind </v>

1197
01:04:17.881 --> 01:04:18.714
<v Speaker 1>everything that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this reality that you can say </v>

1198
01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:26.091
<v Speaker 1>anything about something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually encounter that's unexpected,</v>

1199
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:29.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the manifestation of the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your experience.</v>

1200
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.470
<v Speaker 1>That's in the normally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1201
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:36.320
<v Speaker 1>The right hemisphere is responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1202
01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:37.853
<v Speaker 1>I think in conjunction with the limbic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is responsible for pointing out </v>

1203
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:42.023
<v Speaker 1>the fact of a normal is just to say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're pursuing your goal directed </v>

1204
01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:50.220
<v Speaker 1>linguistically mediate plans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you didn't expect or curves,</v>

1205
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.353
<v Speaker 1>then you're septal hippocampal and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make delek systems grab your motor </v>

1206
01:04:54.601 --> 01:04:57.930
<v Speaker 1>behavior on your intention and force of </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the anomaly.</v>

1207
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:59.303
<v Speaker 1>Then you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you make a decision process or </v>

1208
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:02.484
<v Speaker 1>ignore and the thing that makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision I think is the left is left </v>

1209
01:05:06.001 --> 01:05:06.834
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that decides whether it </v>

1210
01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:11.990
<v Speaker 1>will voluntarily make the descend or </v>
<v Speaker 1>will reject it.</v>

1211
01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:14.903
<v Speaker 1>So then what is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think we experienced chaos </v>

1212
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.273
<v Speaker 1>from the aspect of perspective when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're completely dominated by the </v>

1213
01:05:24.911 --> 01:05:25.744
<v Speaker 1>processes of the right hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say the ASTEC does aspects </v>

1214
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:30.090
<v Speaker 1>of Keanna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1215
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:30.933
<v Speaker 1>basically anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and while I think the third </v>

1216
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>category is sort of schizophrenia length</v>
<v Speaker 1>symptomatology,</v>

1217
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.870
<v Speaker 1>this is right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr mediated.</v>

1218
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>We did not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When when?</v>

1219
01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:48.330
<v Speaker 1>When your brain has flipped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman is from the left hemisphere in</v>

1220
01:05:49.611 --> 01:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like dying.</v>

1221
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might commit suicide.</v>

1222
01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.093
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's part of the reason why </v>

1223
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:01.204
<v Speaker 1>people are very motivated not to bend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The intention is to it to a normally is </v>

1224
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:08.560
<v Speaker 1>the vase and its first manifestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's anxiety provoking and painful.</v>

1225
01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:10.203
<v Speaker 1>But you have to balance that against </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge than if you don't pay </v>

1226
01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:13.054
<v Speaker 1>attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that will happen is that it will </v>

1227
01:06:15.251 --> 01:06:16.084
<v Speaker 1>grow until instead of you facing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will attack you likely when you're </v>

1228
01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.693
<v Speaker 1>weak.</v>

1229
01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:22.850
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

1230
01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:24.980
<v Speaker 6>so you have this anomalous pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 6>information.</v>

1231
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:29.480
<v Speaker 6>Remind him as your focus is on the left </v>
<v Speaker 6>hemisphere says go after it or not,</v>

1232
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:33.720
<v Speaker 6>or or ignore it and then does it then </v>
<v Speaker 6>call again to the right hemisphere to,</v>

1233
01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:36.100
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to use patterns to identify it,</v>

1234
01:06:36.101 --> 01:06:37.280
<v Speaker 6>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

1235
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:38.141
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll keep that.</v>

1236
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:41.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good question because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about an anomalous experiences,</v>

1237
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:44.290
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't present herself purely in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1238
01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.510
<v Speaker 1>in in its objective manifestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>

1239
01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>So you're sitting in your apartment at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

1240
01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>it's quiet and you hear a noise that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be in another room.</v>

1241
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're reading,</v>

1242
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>they have disrupts your reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say here's something fall over.</v>

1243
01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Something big that disrupts your </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>

1244
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like your goal directed activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

1245
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>has been eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like your alert,</v>

1246
01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.030
<v Speaker 1>you wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might even wake up if you're asleep,</v>

1247
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:11.480
<v Speaker 1>but you're alert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you walk cautiously.</v>

1248
01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:14.180
<v Speaker 1>But you might run out of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of dealing with air.</v>

1249
01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.193
<v Speaker 1>You might fall in the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's say you decide to explore </v>

1250
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:20.720
<v Speaker 1>while you're conflicted because you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven towards it,</v>

1251
01:07:20.721 --> 01:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>but you're also angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious.</v>

1252
01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:23.863
<v Speaker 1>So you walked towards the room and let's</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the doors are like this and it's </v>

1253
01:07:29.541 --> 01:07:34.541
<v Speaker 1>dark in there and you reach your hand in</v>
<v Speaker 1>to trouble like you watch what your mind</v>

1254
01:07:34.971 --> 01:07:35.180
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

1255
01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.013
<v Speaker 1>When you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if you watch the pictures the </v>

1256
01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>degenerate because it's trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what the hell is in there.</v>

1257
01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:41.653
<v Speaker 1>You'll get all sorts of fantasies about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential things that might be in </v>

1258
01:07:44.571 --> 01:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>the next group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you actually watch yourself do this,</v>

1259
01:07:47.601 --> 01:07:49.370
<v Speaker 1>you generate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are some of the,</v>

1260
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.353
<v Speaker 1>some of the visions will be more or less</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are less capital on and maybe it's </v>

1261
01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:54.813
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also get images that are </v>

1262
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:59.090
<v Speaker 1>monstrous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's what's well,</v>

1263
01:07:59.091 --> 01:07:59.924
<v Speaker 1>that's both a hypothesis that your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>is generating about what might've done </v>

1264
01:08:03.291 --> 01:08:04.124
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A warning that something terrible might </v>

1265
01:08:06.021 --> 01:08:07.570
<v Speaker 1>be in that room because you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you read it.</v>

1266
01:08:07.571 --> 01:08:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to put your hand in there</v>

1267
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:14.350
<v Speaker 1>and the anomaly all at once because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

1268
01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:15.243
<v Speaker 1>it emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The anomaly emerges in a sense in </v>

1269
01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 1>already categorized for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

1270
01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>You never really encounter chaos per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as something unexpected happens,</v>

1271
01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>it's already presenting itself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of a potential hypothesis,</v>

1272
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.033
<v Speaker 1>so I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hemispheres is doing the pattern </v>

1273
01:08:32.391 --> 01:08:33.950
<v Speaker 1>recognition instantly.</v>

1274
01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:35.723
<v Speaker 6>So then it seems like the left </v>
<v Speaker 6>hemispheres that gets the decision </v>

1275
01:08:37.371 --> 01:08:38.204
<v Speaker 6>maker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>basically it just uses the right </v>

1276
01:08:39.511 --> 01:08:41.040
<v Speaker 6>hemisphere for for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1277
01:08:41.041 --> 01:08:42.360
<v Speaker 6>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is anomalous,</v>

1278
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:43.363
<v Speaker 6>what give me the patterns and then let's</v>
<v Speaker 6>see how to use this for adaptive for my </v>

1279
01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:47.760
<v Speaker 6>adaptive behavior to get to the,</v>

1280
01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

1281
01:08:49.131 --> 01:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the information,</v>

1282
01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:56.120
<v Speaker 1>if there's a continuum between entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>explored and not explored at all,</v>

1283
01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:59.230
<v Speaker 1>as information moves from the category </v>
<v Speaker 1>of no unexplored Vol,</v>

1284
01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:00.143
<v Speaker 1>two entirely explored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It moves across the hemisphere so to </v>

1285
01:09:02.391 --> 01:09:03.224
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the locale of specialization shifts </v>

1286
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:09.260
<v Speaker 1>and there's evidence for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the right hemisphere does seem to</v>

1287
01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:10.094
<v Speaker 1>be the place where activity takes place </v>
<v Speaker 1>most particularly when you don't know </v>

1288
01:09:12.831 --> 01:09:14.720
<v Speaker 1>what the hell you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1289
01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:15.583
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that happens is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're practicing in new </v>

1290
01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:18.254
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first start practicing huge </v>

1291
01:09:20.091 --> 01:09:23.540
<v Speaker 1>areas of the cortex light up and as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get good at it,</v>

1292
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:24.913
<v Speaker 1>the area that's involved gets smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>and smaller and smaller and smaller </v>

1293
01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:28.700
<v Speaker 1>until there's just a tiny center </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

1294
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:29.653
<v Speaker 1>It's really specialized for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity and then it's not conscious </v>

1295
01:09:31.911 --> 01:09:33.330
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you do it automatically?</v>

1296
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Piping and things?</v>

1297
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all right.</v>

1298
01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't know enough about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature on specialization.</v>

1299
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what for I don't know where </v>
<v Speaker 1>motor patterns ended up localizing,</v>

1300
01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody knows.</v>

1301
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.193
<v Speaker 1>We know that the prefrontal cortex is </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in construction and monitoring </v>

1302
01:09:54.621 --> 01:09:56.620
<v Speaker 1>of motor plans when they're first being </v>
<v Speaker 1>formula,</v>

1303
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.300
<v Speaker 1>but once they're perfected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are they go?</v>

1304
01:09:59.301 --> 01:10:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It seems still somewhat mysterious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>

1305
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:04.873
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems involved in regulating the </v>

1306
01:10:07.101 --> 01:10:09.290
<v Speaker 1>smoothness of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their,</v>

1307
01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:10.124
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their application and the Basal </v>

1308
01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Ganglia are involved in motor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put two,</v>

1309
01:10:16.221 --> 01:10:17.830
<v Speaker 1>but where are those patterns are </v>
<v Speaker 1>localize.</v>

1310
01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody knows yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems a bit brash and generalize that to</v>

1311
01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:23.460
<v Speaker 1>have as business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the possible ways,</v>

1312
01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:24.800
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1313
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Patterns of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is rubbish.</v>

1314
01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:29.043
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is is that broadly is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is broadly speaking and I don't </v>

1315
01:10:32.631 --> 01:10:33.464
<v Speaker 1>think it's so much a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemispheric specialization may be as </v>

1316
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:39.110
<v Speaker 1>whether the information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistically media.</v>

1317
01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.690
<v Speaker 1>There's still an image form or whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an image form.</v>

1318
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:46.390
<v Speaker 1>We're still at the level of behavior so </v>
<v Speaker 1>I know when you read it just isn't,</v>

1319
01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:47.243
<v Speaker 1>it's you risk simplification to think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in terms of hemispheric </v>

1320
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:51.200
<v Speaker 1>specialization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still,</v>

1321
01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:55.250
<v Speaker 1>there's still enough useful information </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be driving that when you're making to</v>

1322
01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:56.090
<v Speaker 1>make it worthwhile.</v>

1323
01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:59.910
<v Speaker 6>So if you were to look at language then </v>
<v Speaker 6>could you say that that the organization</v>

1324
01:10:59.911 --> 01:11:01.890
<v Speaker 6>of thoughts and all that is left </v>
<v Speaker 6>hemisphere,</v>

1325
01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.060
<v Speaker 6>but let style and m the actual thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 6>coming from the right hemisphere?</v>

1326
01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.500
<v Speaker 6>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't seem right.</v>

1327
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadly again,</v>

1328
01:11:13.951 --> 01:11:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I would say that there's some evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

1329
01:11:15.691 --> 01:11:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Things like style that is pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition capacity.</v>

1330
01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>

1331
01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Like the fond toner on a given type face</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1332
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.940
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>per se.</v>

1333
01:11:26.941 --> 01:11:30.420
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of an emergent property or or </v>
<v Speaker 1>styles and architecture,</v>

1334
01:11:30.421 --> 01:11:31.254
<v Speaker 1>literature and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are patterns there are difficult </v>

1335
01:11:32.971 --> 01:11:33.804
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think they are related to two </v>

1336
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:37.440
<v Speaker 1>story and image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1337
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:39.983
<v Speaker 1>I know that you know that the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere is specialized for the </v>

1338
01:11:41.911 --> 01:11:42.744
<v Speaker 1>comprehension of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is specialized for the comprehension </v>

1339
01:11:45.331 --> 01:11:46.164
<v Speaker 1>of patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the hemisphere that's responsible </v>

1340
01:11:47.821 --> 01:11:50.880
<v Speaker 1>for your understanding of music and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal cues.</v>

1341
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:53.880
<v Speaker 1>It broadly specialized for negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

1342
01:11:53.881 --> 01:11:54.714
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also architectonic [inaudible] </v>

1343
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.013
<v Speaker 1>construct so that it has a left less </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated structure than the left </v>

1344
01:12:00.991 --> 01:12:01.824
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to indicate it's better for </v>

1345
01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:05.520
<v Speaker 1>quick and dirty analysis.</v>

1346
01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:07.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think what it does is use </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor.</v>

1347
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:12.420
<v Speaker 1>It says this unknown thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of the same attributes as all these</v>

1348
01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:14.520
<v Speaker 1>other unexpected things that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>already encountered.</v>

1349
01:12:14.521 --> 01:12:18.570
<v Speaker 1>So look out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So which is useful information.</v>

1350
01:12:18.571 --> 01:12:20.400
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know anything else about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>

1351
01:12:20.401 --> 01:12:21.234
<v Speaker 1>it's good to know that it's like all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those other things that you already </v>

1352
01:12:23.011 --> 01:12:23.844
<v Speaker 1>encountered that you didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what's happened with in </v>

1353
01:12:27.001 --> 01:12:27.834
<v Speaker 1>religious systems in large part is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have constructed images of the </v>

1354
01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:31.764
<v Speaker 1>unknown like Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then use those as ritual models </v>

1355
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:40.680
<v Speaker 1>against which to practice patterns about</v>
<v Speaker 1>amputation that are specialized.</v>

1356
01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:41.693
<v Speaker 1>Not for anything particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for adaptation to the unknown in </v>

1357
01:12:44.851 --> 01:12:45.684
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's really what you have to </v>

1358
01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:48.540
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not how to do something,</v>

1359
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.180
<v Speaker 1>but how to do something when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to do anything.</v>

1360
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.530
<v Speaker 1>That's really what you need to know.</v>

1361
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.680
<v Speaker 1>So you get things like the great goddess</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's responsible for death.</v>

1362
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:02.280
<v Speaker 1>The only thing to her that's acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the human sacrifice.</v>

1363
01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:04.590
<v Speaker 1>But what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1364
01:13:04.591 --> 01:13:07.530
<v Speaker 1>they originally acting up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this says,</v>

1365
01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:09.443
<v Speaker 1>to get from here to here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make an adjustment to the fact of </v>

1366
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:17.910
<v Speaker 1>chaos requires constant sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1367
01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Sacrifice up at king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1368
01:13:20.071 --> 01:13:20.904
<v Speaker 1>that the king is a pattern of adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior before you can understand that </v>

1369
01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:28.200
<v Speaker 1>in the image or semantically yanked it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1370
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:29.910
<v Speaker 1>and that's where those rituals come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

1371
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.950
<v Speaker 1>So that plaque,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kate's the goddess,</v>

1372
01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:33.930
<v Speaker 1>endless sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1373
01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:35.670
<v Speaker 1>that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is it?</v>

1374
01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:36.683
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's endless sacrifice of that thing </v>

1375
01:13:37.591 --> 01:13:41.250
<v Speaker 1>that you value most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in fact in the abstract and for</v>

1376
01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:44.040
<v Speaker 1>your current set of beliefs and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>configuration,</v>

1377
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:44.993
<v Speaker 1>your view of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing you want to give up the least </v>

1378
01:13:46.951 --> 01:13:49.650
<v Speaker 1>because it's the thing that protects you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from emotional chaos.</v>

1379
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:50.813
<v Speaker 1>That's what you have to sacrifice all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time in order to adapt to the fact </v>

1380
01:13:54.511 --> 01:13:55.344
<v Speaker 1>of the unknown.</v>

1381
01:13:57.630 --> 01:14:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now back to social psychology.</v>

1382
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I want to read you these things familiar</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

1383
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:07.710
<v Speaker 1>This is very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for religious man.</v>

1384
01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:08.544
<v Speaker 1>Space is not homogenous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He experienced his interruptions and </v>

1385
01:14:11.891 --> 01:14:12.724
<v Speaker 1>breaks in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some parts of space are qualitatively </v>

1386
01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:17.650
<v Speaker 1>different from others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drawing not nigh.</v>

1387
01:14:17.651 --> 01:14:18.484
<v Speaker 1>Hither says the Lord unto Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put off my shoes from off they feet for </v>

1388
01:14:21.611 --> 01:14:23.680
<v Speaker 1>the place where I'm they'll stand is </v>
<v Speaker 1>holy ground.</v>

1389
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Exodus three five there is then a sacred</v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

1390
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:30.760
<v Speaker 1>enhance a strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant space.</v>

1391
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:35.530
<v Speaker 1>There are other spaces that are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacred and so our without consistency or</v>

1392
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:38.740
<v Speaker 1>core structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're amorphous have no definition,</v>

1393
01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.593
<v Speaker 1>nor is this all for religious man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This spatial lauren homogeneity finds </v>

1394
01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:46.750
<v Speaker 1>expression and the experience of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition between space that is sacred,</v>

1395
01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>the only real and really existing space </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all other space,</v>

1396
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.980
<v Speaker 1>the formless expanse that surrounds it.</v>

1397
01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:36.963
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1398
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:43.223
<v Speaker 1>It must be set at once that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious experience of the [inaudible] </v>

1399
01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:49.610
<v Speaker 1>spaces and primordial experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he means by that an archetype experience</v>

1400
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:52.680
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to be learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a structural element of experience.</v>

1401
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Homologeo Homo Habilis homologous to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>founding of the world.</v>

1402
01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:01.020
<v Speaker 1>It is not a matter of theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation,</v>

1403
01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:05.280
<v Speaker 1>but have a primary religious experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>that precedes all reflection on the,</v>

1404
01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.173
<v Speaker 1>on the world,</v>

1405
01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:07.503
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1406
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:09.343
<v Speaker 1>Or just the break effect in the space </v>
<v Speaker 1>that allows the world to be cost to to </v>

1407
01:16:11.671 --> 01:16:12.504
<v Speaker 1>that because it reveals a fixed point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The central access for all future </v>

1408
01:16:15.061 --> 01:16:17.790
<v Speaker 1>orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the sacred manifest itself,</v>

1409
01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:20.520
<v Speaker 1>there was not only a break in the emoji </v>
<v Speaker 1>native space,</v>

1410
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:21.383
<v Speaker 1>there's also a revelation of an absolute</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of the non reality of the bass </v>

1411
01:16:24.751 --> 01:16:25.584
<v Speaker 1>around the expanse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manifestation of the sacred </v>

1412
01:16:27.661 --> 01:16:29.430
<v Speaker 1>ontologically founds the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1413
01:16:29.431 --> 01:16:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Now what Eliade is trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1414
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you're a cognitive systems are founded </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon certain preset positions.</v>

1415
01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:37.643
<v Speaker 1>What did I eliade is trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was a guild was trying to do </v>

1416
01:16:39.721 --> 01:16:40.554
<v Speaker 1>too with this idea of vacation with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype is just to point out what are </v>

1417
01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:44.064
<v Speaker 1>the most fundamental levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions upon which all the </v>

1418
01:16:46.891 --> 01:16:48.570
<v Speaker 1>things that you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1419
01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:52.410
<v Speaker 1>our baits as Kurt Gadell pointed out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that any,</v>

1420
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:56.460
<v Speaker 1>any internally cysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any internal and consistent system,</v>

1421
01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.413
<v Speaker 1>logical system is necessarily predicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>on presumptions and the can be approved </v>

1422
01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.520
<v Speaker 1>from within the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to be accepted.</v>

1423
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Their axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Deon seems of geometry.</v>

1424
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:08.850
<v Speaker 1>This is an axiom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's defined territory and undefined.</v>

1425
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 1>This is what you protect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where you live.</v>

1426
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:12.583
<v Speaker 1>It's the establishment of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the precondition for everything </v>

1427
01:17:17.061 --> 01:17:17.894
<v Speaker 1>else you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So establishing that initial sacred </v>

1428
01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:21.320
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a religious act,</v>

1429
01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.120
<v Speaker 1>the primary religious act.</v>

1430
01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.610
<v Speaker 1>So what is clear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's clear to what it'd be grieved.</v>

1431
01:17:27.611 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 1>That discovery that is the revelation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacred space,</v>

1432
01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:32.720
<v Speaker 1>possesses existential value for </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious man.</v>

1433
01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:33.973
<v Speaker 1>For nothing can begin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can be done without a previous </v>

1434
01:17:36.111 --> 01:17:39.140
<v Speaker 1>orientation in any orientation implies </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquiring a fixed point.</v>

1435
01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.473
<v Speaker 1>It is for this reason that religious man</v>
<v Speaker 1>has always sought to fix his abode at </v>

1436
01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:43.904
<v Speaker 1>the center of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the medieval notion that </v>

1437
01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:47.294
<v Speaker 1>man exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be earth was the center of </v>

1438
01:17:48.801 --> 01:17:51.080
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where that idea came from.</v>

1439
01:17:51.081 --> 01:17:55.400
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't an empirical notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the notion that wherever we live,</v>

1440
01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.503
<v Speaker 1>that's the center that's defined space </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded necessarily by an expanse of </v>

1441
01:18:00.141 --> 01:18:00.974
<v Speaker 1>territory that we haven't explored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we already know to what to make of </v>

1442
01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:06.104
<v Speaker 1>that in terms of implications because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what an unexplored territory </v>

1443
01:18:08.421 --> 01:18:09.860
<v Speaker 1>signifies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

1444
01:18:09.861 --> 01:18:13.160
<v Speaker 1>It's signifies fear and it signifies </v>
<v Speaker 1>promise.</v>

1445
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.400
<v Speaker 1>So defined territory is security </v>
<v Speaker 1>established in an expanse of anxiety and</v>

1446
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:22.790
<v Speaker 1>and curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny but eight priority.</v>

1447
01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:25.370
<v Speaker 1>It's anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're a village is surrounded by the</v>

1448
01:18:25.371 --> 01:18:27.830
<v Speaker 1>places you don't know because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening out there.</v>

1449
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:28.873
<v Speaker 1>Why is it frightening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No behavioral structures have been </v>

1450
01:18:31.551 --> 01:18:36.551
<v Speaker 1>erected to make that space habitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the domain of monsters.</v>

1451
01:18:37.210 --> 01:18:39.790
<v Speaker 1>It's the domain of wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the domain of foreigners.</v>

1452
01:18:39.791 --> 01:18:43.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the domain of barbarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the place that you can explore.</v>

1453
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:44.473
<v Speaker 1>It's like the old maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole medieval maps of the world to </v>

1454
01:18:46.941 --> 01:18:51.680
<v Speaker 1>find territory amorphous just surrounded</v>
<v Speaker 1>by ocean with monsters.</v>

1455
01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what that means.</v>

1456
01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.090
<v Speaker 1>There were monsters out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown territory.</v>

1457
01:18:57.450 --> 01:18:58.710
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting too,</v>

1458
01:18:58.711 --> 01:19:00.990
<v Speaker 1>cause the most is always take the form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of whales.</v>

1459
01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:02.910
<v Speaker 1>But Wales aren't whales for medieval </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1460
01:19:02.911 --> 01:19:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And if they didn't know what Wales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there are serpents,</v>

1461
01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:05.993
<v Speaker 1>sea surface that live in the sea and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go out there out beyond explored </v>

1462
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.880
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sea serpent comes out of the sea and</v>

1463
01:19:11.881 --> 01:19:12.714
<v Speaker 1>swallows you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the hero's mission right down </v>

1464
01:19:14.731 --> 01:19:17.340
<v Speaker 1>into the belly of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might come back and you might not.</v>

1465
01:19:17.490 --> 01:19:20.700
<v Speaker 1>But what that is is the projection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology on the world.</v>

1466
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:25.110
<v Speaker 1>So for the European exploration was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary radical.</v>

1467
01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1468
01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1469
01:19:28.651 --> 01:19:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1470
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Well here I going to tell you exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how radical that was.</v>

1471
01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.393
<v Speaker 1>This is something in reality is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pains to describe what are the </v>

1472
01:19:36.061 --> 01:19:36.894
<v Speaker 1>outstanding characteristics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional societies is the opposition </v>

1473
01:19:39.331 --> 01:19:41.640
<v Speaker 1>that they assume between their inhabited</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

1474
01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.860
<v Speaker 1>ambien determinant space that surrounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1475
01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.150
<v Speaker 1>The former is the world more precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>our world.</v>

1476
01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:52.200
<v Speaker 1>The cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when Marta constructs the cosmos,</v>

1477
01:19:52.230 --> 01:19:55.470
<v Speaker 1>that's what that means is he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructing habitable territory,</v>

1478
01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:59.400
<v Speaker 1>the definable world out of the amorphous</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality that surrounds it.</v>

1479
01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:01.503
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1480
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Everything outside of the cosmos is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer cosmos,</v>

1481
01:20:03.921 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of other world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a foreign chaotic place by ghosts,</v>

1482
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.420
<v Speaker 1>demons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreigners who are assimilated to demons</v>

1483
01:20:12.421 --> 01:20:15.250
<v Speaker 1>into the souls of the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is,</v>

1484
01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:17.010
<v Speaker 1>this is some other research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>

1485
01:20:17.011 --> 01:20:22.011
<v Speaker 1>So this is an insert more specifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the dragon of chaos.</v>

1486
01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the point here.</v>

1487
01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Your natural category of foreigner is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon of chaos.</v>

1488
01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.633
<v Speaker 1>They're in the same category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not because you've assimilated them </v>

1489
01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:32.754
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because you have not yet </v>

1490
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:36.330
<v Speaker 1>distinguished them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still the same thing.</v>

1491
01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:37.283
<v Speaker 1>So your natural response to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreigner is he's the thing that isn't </v>

1492
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:44.640
<v Speaker 1>human that occupies the space defined by</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

1493
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Who's a primary motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance is the generation of terror</v>

1494
01:20:49.321 --> 01:20:50.154
<v Speaker 1>and disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She say you don't get an explanation </v>

1495
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:55.640
<v Speaker 1>then about why people are hostile with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreigners.</v>

1496
01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:58.650
<v Speaker 1>What you need is an explanation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>those few instances where that does not,</v>

1497
01:20:58.651 --> 01:20:59.550
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll curve</v>

1498
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.370
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In,</v>

1499
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:06.000
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Among the Hicks sauce.</v>

1500
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Barbarians were assimilated to Apophis </v>
<v Speaker 1>who do borrowers?</v>

1501
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:11.263
<v Speaker 1>The Sun,</v>

1502
01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.133
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

1503
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right</v>

1504
01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:16.483
<v Speaker 1>Hicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were barbarians from the Egyptian </v>

1505
01:21:17.651 --> 01:21:18.484
<v Speaker 1>point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kept coming into Egypt and </v>

1506
01:21:19.421 --> 01:21:20.254
<v Speaker 1>disrupting everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were assimilate hicks sauce met </v>

1507
01:21:22.391 --> 01:21:23.224
<v Speaker 1>barbarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were simulated to apophis who </v>

1508
01:21:25.331 --> 01:21:26.770
<v Speaker 1>devours the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1509
01:21:26.771 --> 01:21:30.070
<v Speaker 1>so that's the Egyptians among the Indo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europeans,</v>

1510
01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.990
<v Speaker 1>the ancestors of the mortar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indians,</v>

1511
01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.190
<v Speaker 1>the assimilation of enemies in back,</v>

1512
01:21:34.330 --> 01:21:35.163
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

1513
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:39.890
<v Speaker 1>to the slaying of [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1514
01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:40.873
<v Speaker 1>enemies were called Burton's and Virta </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the gigantic dragon who held back </v>

1515
01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:46.790
<v Speaker 1>the waters in the hollow of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain.</v>

1516
01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Interests laid him and constructed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1517
01:21:50.271 --> 01:21:51.104
<v Speaker 1>So for the Indo Europeans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slang and enemies was precisely </v>

1518
01:21:53.751 --> 01:21:55.760
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the act that constructed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1519
01:21:55.761 --> 01:21:57.710
<v Speaker 1>And that is because when you slay your </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies,</v>

1520
01:21:57.711 --> 01:21:58.544
<v Speaker 1>you expand your territory in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion of territory is equivalent </v>

1521
01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.860
<v Speaker 1>construction in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a heroic enterprise.</v>

1522
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:09.130
<v Speaker 1>You're battling the enemies of the state</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the Zoroastrians and the ram.</v>

1523
01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.480
<v Speaker 1>He will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's in the battle.</v>

1524
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:15.280
<v Speaker 1>He truly kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

1525
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:16.383
<v Speaker 1>the fight of the hero three tournament </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the dragon as they hakka is </v>

1526
01:22:20.141 --> 01:22:23.650
<v Speaker 1>recounted as the struggle of King Fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>done against the foreign new surfer,</v>

1527
01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.960
<v Speaker 1>the dragon as to hack and it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1528
01:22:25.961 --> 01:22:29.290
<v Speaker 1>This is an arrhenius foreigners or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon of chaos.</v>

1529
01:22:29.291 --> 01:22:33.100
<v Speaker 1>They bring disorder into the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to overthrow the forerunner,</v>

1530
01:22:33.130 --> 01:22:33.963
<v Speaker 1>to establish new territories to to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing that the day he did what he </v>

1531
01:22:36.611 --> 01:22:38.080
<v Speaker 1>established the world</v>

1532
01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:43.770
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1533
01:22:45.490 --> 01:22:47.070
<v Speaker 1>At first this cleavage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first side.</v>

1534
01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:47.913
<v Speaker 1>This cleavage in space appear to be due </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the opposition between an inhabited </v>

1535
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:51.303
<v Speaker 1>and organize hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmo sized territory and the unknown </v>

1536
01:22:53.771 --> 01:22:54.604
<v Speaker 1>space that expands beyond its frontiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On one side there's a cosmos on the </v>

1537
01:22:58.031 --> 01:23:01.270
<v Speaker 1>other side of cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we shall see that if every inhabited</v>

1538
01:23:01.271 --> 01:23:02.104
<v Speaker 1>territory is a cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is precisely because it was first </v>

1539
01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.113
<v Speaker 1>consecrated because in one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another it is the work of the garden </v>

1540
01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.793
<v Speaker 1>cards or is in communication with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of the guards who determine </v>

1541
01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:12.334
<v Speaker 1>destiny in that territory and who </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore caused the toothy organizing </v>

1542
01:23:14.921 --> 01:23:15.754
<v Speaker 1>principles of the society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy that rules </v>

1543
01:23:18.281 --> 01:23:19.114
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1544
01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:21.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1545
01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.430
<v Speaker 1>inside say can space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're all,</v>

1546
01:23:23.490 --> 01:23:26.580
<v Speaker 1>you're pursuing a goal that's shared by </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else that's in that space.</v>

1547
01:23:26.581 --> 01:23:27.414
<v Speaker 1>So their behavior is all random,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable as a consequence of their </v>

1548
01:23:30.511 --> 01:23:33.330
<v Speaker 1>participation in the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a religious story.</v>

1549
01:23:33.331 --> 01:23:35.760
<v Speaker 1>This defined by the dominance of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain God.</v>

1550
01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:36.893
<v Speaker 1>So when you go out into new territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you do is consecrate </v>

1551
01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:41.820
<v Speaker 1>that new territory to the God that rules</v>
<v Speaker 1>your territory.</v>

1552
01:23:41.821 --> 01:23:44.280
<v Speaker 1>So the order rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>order rains there,</v>

1553
01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.430
<v Speaker 1>that means the world's created and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it means,</v>

1554
01:23:47.431 --> 01:23:51.870
<v Speaker 1>that order range there is that whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people go there,</v>

1555
01:23:51.871 --> 01:23:54.090
<v Speaker 1>they have to behave the same way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>

1556
01:23:54.091 --> 01:23:54.924
<v Speaker 1>So they're predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means they're out of the domain </v>

1557
01:23:56.941 --> 01:23:59.220
<v Speaker 1>that's defined by CAS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't terrify.</v>

1558
01:23:59.221 --> 01:24:00.054
<v Speaker 1>You don't undermine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't pose the possibility of </v>

1559
01:24:03.241 --> 01:24:05.220
<v Speaker 1>undermining everything that it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe in.</v>

1560
01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:06.443
<v Speaker 1>So lem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says all this appears very clearly </v>

1561
01:24:08.881 --> 01:24:09.714
<v Speaker 1>from the thing that ritual for taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession of the territory that </v>

1562
01:24:12.611 --> 01:24:16.050
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't becomes legally valid through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the erection of a fire alter consecrated</v>

1563
01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:16.884
<v Speaker 1>to Agni.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a quote from the religious </v>

1564
01:24:19.141 --> 01:24:21.570
<v Speaker 1>texts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shout of path that Brovana one,</v>

1565
01:24:21.571 --> 01:24:23.480
<v Speaker 1>he says that what is installed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1566
01:24:23.481 --> 01:24:24.314
<v Speaker 1>what has built a fire altered and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who build the fire alter our </v>

1567
01:24:26.941 --> 01:24:28.260
<v Speaker 1>legally established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1568
01:24:28.261 --> 01:24:30.570
<v Speaker 1>so this is rules for in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Territory</v>

1569
01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:35.160
<v Speaker 1>by the erection of a fire alter Agni is </v>
<v Speaker 1>made present.</v>

1570
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:38.150
<v Speaker 1>You see a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the erection of a firewall to,</v>

1571
01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a symbol of the construction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

1572
01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:41.573
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because the mastery of fire is </v>

1573
01:24:42.671 --> 01:24:46.950
<v Speaker 1>something that is absolutely integral to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the establishment of border anyways,</v>

1574
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:50.930
<v Speaker 1>but the meaning of the ritual is far </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex.</v>

1575
01:24:50.931 --> 01:24:52.670
<v Speaker 1>And if we consider all of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>ramifications,</v>

1576
01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:53.504
<v Speaker 1>we shall understand why concentrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>your territory is equivalent to making </v>

1577
01:24:55.821 --> 01:24:56.654
<v Speaker 1>it a cosmos for in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the erection of an alternate Agni is </v>

1578
01:24:58.941 --> 01:25:02.270
<v Speaker 1>nothing but the rep production on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>microcosmic scale of the creation,</v>

1579
01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:04.610
<v Speaker 1>the water in which the clay is mixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clay.</v>

1580
01:25:04.611 --> 01:25:08.330
<v Speaker 1>So the altered is assimilated to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial water chaos.</v>

1581
01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:11.900
<v Speaker 1>The client that forms the base of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>altar symbolizes the earth.</v>

1582
01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.930
<v Speaker 1>The lateral walls represent the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere and so on.</v>

1583
01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:16.063
<v Speaker 1>And the building of the alters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>company by songs that proclaim which </v>

1584
01:25:17.991 --> 01:25:19.880
<v Speaker 1>caused region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just being created.</v>

1585
01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.073
<v Speaker 1>Hence the erection of a fire altered </v>
<v Speaker 1>which alone validates taking possession </v>

1586
01:25:23.541 --> 01:25:24.374
<v Speaker 1>of her new territory is equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the construction of the world and I'm </v>

1587
01:25:28.281 --> 01:25:32.930
<v Speaker 1>known for an unoccupied territory which </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually means unoccupied by our people.</v>

1588
01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Still shares in the fluid and larva </v>
<v Speaker 1>modality of chaos,</v>

1589
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.903
<v Speaker 1>my occupying it and above all by </v>
<v Speaker 1>settling it man symbolically transform </v>

1590
01:25:41.341 --> 01:25:43.120
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it transforms it into a cosmos,</v>

1591
01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:45.560
<v Speaker 1>through a ritual repetition of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation of the world.</v>

1592
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.903
<v Speaker 1>What is to become our world must first </v>
<v Speaker 1>be created and every creation as a </v>

1593
01:25:50.001 --> 01:25:53.030
<v Speaker 1>paradigmatic mortal creation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe by the guards.</v>

1594
01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:54.483
<v Speaker 1>When the Scandinavian calling this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this took position of Iceland and </v>

1595
01:25:56.991 --> 01:25:58.700
<v Speaker 1>cleared it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they regarded the enterprise.</v>

1596
01:25:58.710 --> 01:26:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Neither has an original undertaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor is human and profane work.</v>

1597
01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:03.433
<v Speaker 1>For them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The was the repetition of a priority </v>

1598
01:26:04.841 --> 01:26:08.060
<v Speaker 1>will act and transformation of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>into cosmos by the divine.</v>

1599
01:26:08.061 --> 01:26:10.970
<v Speaker 1>After creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they tilt the deserted soil,</v>

1600
01:26:10.971 --> 01:26:12.780
<v Speaker 1>they were in fact repeating the act of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gardens.</v>

1601
01:26:12.781 --> 01:26:15.020
<v Speaker 1>So was organized chaos by giving it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

1602
01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.003
<v Speaker 1>forums and norms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it is a case of clearing </v>

1603
01:26:18.570 --> 01:26:19.403
<v Speaker 1>uncultivated grown or conquering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupying and territory already </v>

1604
01:26:22.191 --> 01:26:24.470
<v Speaker 1>inhabited by other human beings.</v>

1605
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.513
<v Speaker 1>Ritual taking possession must always </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeat the cosmogony from the view of </v>

1606
01:26:28.311 --> 01:26:29.144
<v Speaker 1>archaic societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that is not our world is not </v>

1607
01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:32.144
<v Speaker 1>yet the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The territory can only be made ours by </v>

1608
01:26:34.281 --> 01:26:37.390
<v Speaker 1>creating a new this religious behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>and respect.</v>

1609
01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Unknown lands continued even in the west</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the daughter of in times Spanish</v>

1610
01:26:42.121 --> 01:26:42.954
<v Speaker 1>and Portuguese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conquistadores discovering and </v>

1611
01:26:44.431 --> 01:26:47.520
<v Speaker 1>conquering territory is took possession </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them in the name of Jesus Christ.</v>

1612
01:26:47.970 --> 01:26:51.090
<v Speaker 1>The raising of the cross was equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Carson crating which country?</v>

1613
01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Hanson some way to a new birth for </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Christ.</v>

1614
01:26:53.971 --> 01:26:57.120
<v Speaker 1>All things are passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behold all things become new.</v>

1615
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:58.223
<v Speaker 1>Two Corinthians five 17 the newly </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered country was the nude </v>

1616
01:27:01.630 --> 01:27:03.540
<v Speaker 1>recreated by the cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1617
01:27:03.541 --> 01:27:05.290
<v Speaker 1>and when the Americans landed on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moon,</v>

1618
01:27:05.291 --> 01:27:07.140
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they did was put up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American flag.</v>

1619
01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a profane repetition of precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same notions.</v>

1620
01:27:13.090 --> 01:27:13.923
<v Speaker 1>This is this undiscovered territory is </v>
<v Speaker 1>now part of the world order rules there </v>

1621
01:27:18.571 --> 01:27:19.404
<v Speaker 1>in North Carolina.</v>

1622
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:25.030
<v Speaker 3>So also Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the ritual after that,</v>

1623
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:30.490
<v Speaker 3>because like in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bag agonize like the fire guys,</v>

1624
01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:37.610
<v Speaker 3>your guide of transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're transforming that land from</v>

1625
01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:38.533
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is honest,</v>

1626
01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:39.523
<v Speaker 3>it that which is explore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right and thereby making it </v>

1627
01:27:42.261 --> 01:27:45.650
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously sacred part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sacred territory.</v>

1628
01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.513
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1629
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1630
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.193
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the ritual that you undergo when </v>

1631
01:27:50.511 --> 01:27:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you're creating the fire temple is </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to participating in the act.</v>

1632
01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:55.760
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's defined by Marduk.</v>

1633
01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fighting with the Dragon.</v>

1634
01:27:58.521 --> 01:27:59.354
<v Speaker 1>That's reference till I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason you might think this </v>

1635
01:28:01.251 --> 01:28:03.590
<v Speaker 1>is completely off the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've thought about for a long time,</v>

1636
01:28:03.591 --> 01:28:04.940
<v Speaker 1>it makes a certain amount of sense to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1637
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is represented by a drag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1638
01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Why are you dragging the urge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any dragons?</v>

1639
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:14.030
<v Speaker 1>But it's partly because the dragon is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature of the of matter because it's a</v>

1640
01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:16.450
<v Speaker 1>serpent and it goes around on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>and has wings.</v>

1641
01:28:16.451 --> 01:28:17.284
<v Speaker 1>So it's also a creature of the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a symbol of the union of </v>

1642
01:28:19.491 --> 01:28:20.420
<v Speaker 1>opposites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1643
01:28:20.490 --> 01:28:23.330
<v Speaker 1>It's also a serpent so it can shed its </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin and be reborn.</v>

1644
01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:25.340
<v Speaker 1>So there's an element of transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

1645
01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:28.790
<v Speaker 1>But I always saw this great picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a picture from the medieval church.</v>

1646
01:28:28.791 --> 01:28:31.460
<v Speaker 1>It's called souls in the grip of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

1647
01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.473
<v Speaker 1>there's a picture of this monstrous </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon and inside it's wood carving </v>

1648
01:28:36.801 --> 01:28:37.634
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's all these people who have </v>

1649
01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:40.940
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrified expressions on their face,</v>

1650
01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.880
<v Speaker 1>but maybe being devoured by a serpent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1651
01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:52.040
<v Speaker 1>we share our ascending spinal tracks on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their limbic system with animals.</v>

1652
01:28:52.041 --> 01:28:52.874
<v Speaker 1>The pulling a long ways back on the file</v>
<v Speaker 1>of genetic chain and our limbic system </v>

1653
01:28:56.190 --> 01:28:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and the cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all as amphibians.</v>

1654
01:28:59.160 --> 01:28:59.993
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hippocampus first made its </v>

1655
01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:01.584
<v Speaker 1>appearance win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our rn says to his crawled out of the </v>

1656
01:29:03.361 --> 01:29:04.194
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of kind of interesting </v>

1657
01:29:05.641 --> 01:29:06.474
<v Speaker 1>from a symbolic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason that the dragon of </v>

1658
01:29:09.001 --> 01:29:13.110
<v Speaker 1>chaos as symbolized by the dragon is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when we fall into that,</v>

1659
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:17.430
<v Speaker 1>our actions and aspects are dominated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of our brain that are so old.</v>

1660
01:29:17.431 --> 01:29:18.264
<v Speaker 1>But they still partake in the aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is defined by my reptilian </v>

1661
01:29:22.201 --> 01:29:23.034
<v Speaker 1>potency.</v>

1662
01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.033
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

1663
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:29.200
<v Speaker 1>you can think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I debated whether or not to,</v>

1664
01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.753
<v Speaker 1>to make a point about it in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>manuscript cause it seems to be kind of </v>

1665
01:29:33.101 --> 01:29:33.934
<v Speaker 1>a strange notion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is there are dragons </v>

1666
01:29:35.501 --> 01:29:37.990
<v Speaker 1>everywhere in the world and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of something.</v>

1667
01:29:38.890 --> 01:29:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we</v>

1668
01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:42.290
<v Speaker 5>thank in these ways and draw these </v>
<v Speaker 5>distinctions naturally.</v>

1669
01:29:42.291 --> 01:29:45.200
<v Speaker 5>It's not a feature of the object.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we would tend to think of,</v>

1670
01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.190
<v Speaker 1>well it depends on how you define the </v>
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>

1671
01:29:47.290 --> 01:29:48.123
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1672
01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:49.313
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These ways,</v>

1673
01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:53.920
<v Speaker 5>even when the territory that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>exploring isn't a spacial object,</v>

1674
01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 5>even if it's something abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a concept.</v>

1675
01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

1676
01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:58.173
<v Speaker 1>Our ideological concepts around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in your logical concepts or </v>

1677
01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:05.150
<v Speaker 1>actually abstract representations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptive behavioral patterns,</v>

1678
01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.340
<v Speaker 1>they're not descriptions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective world.</v>

1679
01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Like if you share a Marxist ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist ideology is a body of laws,</v>

1680
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:17.360
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that it's a verbal</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of a pattern of action.</v>

1681
01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:19.970
<v Speaker 1>This designed to transform order into </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

1682
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:21.081
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and order.</v>

1683
01:30:21.081 --> 01:30:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Although with the Marxist state works </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other way round.</v>

1684
01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:24.853
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're any illogical identification is </v>

1685
01:30:27.681 --> 01:30:30.650
<v Speaker 1>in fact your abs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your identification with uh,</v>

1686
01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:31.513
<v Speaker 1>with a god of behavior that's become </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract that into a higher order </v>

1687
01:30:34.191 --> 01:30:35.390
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1688
01:30:35.391 --> 01:30:36.224
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think,</v>

1689
01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:37.213
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously in those situations </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you can use that as an impetus to </v>

1690
01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:40.034
<v Speaker 5>fight or to have more.</v>

1691
01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1692
01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.013
<v Speaker 5>In some cases the fact that it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 5>spacial object or a literal possession </v>

1693
01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:49.550
<v Speaker 5>or territory or land might change the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way that we approach it.</v>

1694
01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:51.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean we'd still approach it in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same way in our mind,</v>

1695
01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.313
<v Speaker 5>but the consequence,</v>

1696
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's worse.</v>

1697
01:30:53.670 --> 01:30:54.503
<v Speaker 1>I think it's worse because look if was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've taken it on the wall then you </v>

1698
01:30:57.571 --> 01:30:58.404
<v Speaker 1>train it so that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it's adapted to a territory you </v>

1699
01:31:01.411 --> 01:31:02.244
<v Speaker 1>can't come along and have an argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it and thereby undermine its whole </v>

1700
01:31:05.161 --> 01:31:05.994
<v Speaker 1>sequence of that applications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like once the animal is gone and sat </v>

1701
01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:08.724
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>station fixed about the only thing you </v>

1702
01:31:09.871 --> 01:31:12.720
<v Speaker 1>can do to really follow it up is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift its environment.</v>

1703
01:31:12.721 --> 01:31:13.554
<v Speaker 1>Like you can move it somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you have abstracted your patent </v>

1704
01:31:16.851 --> 01:31:19.770
<v Speaker 1>and about adaptation up into an ideology</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's verbally mediate,</v>

1705
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:20.813
<v Speaker 1>and I'd come along with a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles that it make logical </v>

1706
01:31:23.821 --> 01:31:25.860
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If some of your presuppositions,</v>

1707
01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:26.933
<v Speaker 1>I can blow apart whole schemes of you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>an adaptation in the course of say an </v>

1708
01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:31.613
<v Speaker 1>afternoon and it might take a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the consequences of that to like </v>

1709
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.560
<v Speaker 1>have their effect on all your structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>about amputation.</v>

1710
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:40.860
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that one side </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed my adaptations into words.</v>

1711
01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I can adapt abstract and that's where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the useful,</v>

1712
01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.633
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can build potential adaptive </v>

1713
01:31:46.591 --> 01:31:48.690
<v Speaker 1>models in the abstract without having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask them.</v>

1714
01:31:48.691 --> 01:31:50.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the positive side.</v>

1715
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:53.760
<v Speaker 1>But the negative side is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I can abstract out the principles,</v>

1716
01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:54.623
<v Speaker 1>I'm really vulnerable to an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what an argument is is a war that </v>

1717
01:31:57.431 --> 01:31:58.264
<v Speaker 1>sparked with works and if it fails then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we just cascade down the chain of </v>

1718
01:32:02.201 --> 01:32:04.470
<v Speaker 1>abstraction to the actual part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1719
01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:05.670
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1720
01:32:05.670 --> 01:32:06.503
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to ask you about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I guess what I'm trying to get at is </v>

1721
01:32:08.201 --> 01:32:11.830
<v Speaker 5>something more like if there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if there is a fertile valley,</v>

1722
01:32:11.831 --> 01:32:15.010
<v Speaker 5>10 miles outside of mine order and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're there.</v>

1723
01:32:15.011 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 5>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I'm not going to cooperate with you,</v>

1724
01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:17.734
<v Speaker 5>I have to kill you in order for me to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have that in order for me to explore it </v>

1725
01:32:20.171 --> 01:32:21.004
<v Speaker 5>and for it to be mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if I'm studying astrophysics and </v>

1726
01:32:23.741 --> 01:32:24.574
<v Speaker 5>you're an astrophysicist in China,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't necessarily have to kill you in </v>

1727
01:32:27.581 --> 01:32:28.414
<v Speaker 5>order for me to be able to study even </v>
<v Speaker 5>the exact same thing that you're </v>

1728
01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:31.053
<v Speaker 5>studying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you kill this person by firing off </v>

1729
01:32:35.861 --> 01:32:37.180
<v Speaker 5>letters undermine.</v>

1730
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well look,</v>

1731
01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:39.840
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1732
01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:40.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>

1733
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.943
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary reason why a scientific model </v>

1734
01:32:47.650 --> 01:32:52.510
<v Speaker 1>has to simultaneously take on the effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Valence of an adaptation or more.</v>

1735
01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:57.430
<v Speaker 1>But to the degree that your career is </v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminated with your ideas,</v>

1736
01:32:57.730 --> 01:33:01.030
<v Speaker 1>you're going to respond to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitors as if they were enemies.</v>

1737
01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:04.300
<v Speaker 1>So if you've abstracted yourself from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your objective ideas,</v>

1738
01:33:04.570 --> 01:33:07.090
<v Speaker 1>which basically means if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

1739
01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.610
<v Speaker 1>it's independent of your scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>

1740
01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.720
<v Speaker 1>then you can treat them as objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements and there's no necessary reason</v>

1741
01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:16.480
<v Speaker 1>for you to get your emotions involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the truth,</v>

1742
01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:19.510
<v Speaker 1>like the real situation tends not to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

1743
01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:23.890
<v Speaker 1>As the people get their objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures tangled up with their religious</v>

1744
01:33:23.891 --> 01:33:24.724
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they do view attacks on their </v>

1745
01:33:26.561 --> 01:33:27.394
<v Speaker 1>domain as personal attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're not supposed to do that in </v>

1746
01:33:29.151 --> 01:33:30.400
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1747
01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:31.593
<v Speaker 1>science is actually the mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 1>whereby we separate those two types of </v>

1748
01:33:35.441 --> 01:33:37.450
<v Speaker 1>models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't always work.</v>

1749
01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.370
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it seems</v>

1750
01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:44.160
<v Speaker 5>like if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when you're literally exploring the</v>

1751
01:33:44.161 --> 01:33:47.820
<v Speaker 5>actual physical world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's absolutely inevitable there's going</v>

1752
01:33:47.821 --> 01:33:48.654
<v Speaker 5>to be physical violence and conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's no even possibility of </v>

1753
01:33:50.971 --> 01:33:51.721
<v Speaker 5>getting around that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1754
01:33:51.721 --> 01:33:54.180
<v Speaker 5>in principle that isn't necessarily part</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

1755
01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.313
<v Speaker 5>But then so is it wrong to say then that</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're no longer studying the </v>

1756
01:33:59.310 --> 01:34:00.143
<v Speaker 5>physical world and when you're studying </v>
<v Speaker 5>more abstract things that most likely </v>

1757
01:34:03.481 --> 01:34:05.010
<v Speaker 5>you're probably still going to behave </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same way,</v>

1758
01:34:05.011 --> 01:34:07.110
<v Speaker 5>but there's at least the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can,</v>

1759
01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:08.151
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say,</v>

1760
01:34:08.151 --> 01:34:08.630
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

1761
01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:09.463
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that like I don't think </v>

1762
01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:13.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're studying things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective,</v>

1763
01:34:13.041 --> 01:34:13.874
<v Speaker 1>you have in principle the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being objective about when you didn't </v>

1764
01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:19.700
<v Speaker 1>have to fight over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's one thing and we both won and</v>

1765
01:34:19.701 --> 01:34:21.390
<v Speaker 1>won't cooperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must for sure it</v>

1766
01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.870
<v Speaker 1>didn't like about your apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1767
01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are all like your,</v>

1768
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:31.490
<v Speaker 1>your first premise was the bloodshed was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a necessary intermediate.</v>

1769
01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not one of the things we want</v>

1770
01:34:33.891 --> 01:34:34.724
<v Speaker 1>to do in this course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that I'm interested in the </v>

1771
01:34:36.841 --> 01:34:39.380
<v Speaker 1>structure of myth to begin with is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out,</v>

1772
01:34:39.710 --> 01:34:41.060
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your alternatives.</v>

1773
01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:47.750
<v Speaker 1>If I let your ideas in my head and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I end up in chaos,</v>

1774
01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.780
<v Speaker 1>that's one option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1775
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:51.900
<v Speaker 1>so I don't let you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1776
01:34:51.901 --> 01:34:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Isn't the body you have by killing you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another option.</v>

1777
01:34:54.710 --> 01:34:55.543
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those options seem to me to be </v>

1778
01:34:56.571 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 1>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty distressing.</v>

1779
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:01.490
<v Speaker 1>You can't expect me to give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I believe in just because you</v>

1780
01:35:01.491 --> 01:35:03.860
<v Speaker 1>have different idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the same token,</v>

1781
01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:04.873
<v Speaker 1>if the only way that we can settle our </v>
<v Speaker 1>disputes is through force and you'll </v>

1782
01:35:06.851 --> 01:35:08.090
<v Speaker 1>have an involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one,</v>

1783
01:35:08.091 --> 01:35:10.010
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty much the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story in there too,</v>

1784
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.053
<v Speaker 1>so it's sort of anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and the possibility of </v>

1785
01:35:13.551 --> 01:35:18.230
<v Speaker 1>suicide and cultural degeneration on one</v>
<v Speaker 1>side or like conflict.</v>

1786
01:35:18.231 --> 01:35:20.240
<v Speaker 1>It will kill us both on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1787
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might describe those as the horns of</v>

1788
01:35:22.161 --> 01:35:24.260
<v Speaker 1>a dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the question is,</v>

1789
01:35:24.261 --> 01:35:25.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that dilemma,</v>

1790
01:35:25.221 --> 01:35:27.560
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there an alternative path?</v>

1791
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:28.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're hopefully going to </v>

1792
01:35:29.001 --> 01:35:32.990
<v Speaker 1>define mostly in the second part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course because that's the dilemma.</v>

1793
01:35:32.991 --> 01:35:33.824
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible dilemma mean before if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had an ax as stone axes and sticks </v>

1794
01:35:38.691 --> 01:35:40.010
<v Speaker 1>and so did I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have fight,</v>

1795
01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:40.873
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was at least the possibility that </v>

1796
01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.430
<v Speaker 1>one of our groups wasn't going to end </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1797
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:45.343
<v Speaker 1>But now when we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>territorial disputes between hours that </v>

1798
01:35:48.291 --> 01:35:53.291
<v Speaker 1>are fully armed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibility for settling the problem</v>

1799
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:54.463
<v Speaker 1>violently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even exist unless you're </v>

1800
01:35:56.211 --> 01:35:57.044
<v Speaker 1>willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you'd be willing to kill me </v>

1801
01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:02.180
<v Speaker 1>unless you'd be willing to die just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill me.</v>

1802
01:36:02.181 --> 01:36:03.014
<v Speaker 1>Which of course is always a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's now like how deep your desire </v>

1803
01:36:07.431 --> 01:36:09.700
<v Speaker 1>for revenge action is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1804
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:12.120
<v Speaker 1>so the middle road is always a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromise or having,</v>

1805
01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:12.973
<v Speaker 1>because your copper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an argument with Sonia </v>

1806
01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:16.190
<v Speaker 1>men's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a little of their idea and then</v>

1807
01:36:16.191 --> 01:36:18.720
<v Speaker 1>it'll enough of yours so that you're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to get along.</v>

1808
01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:19.963
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're have a more sort of physical </v>

1809
01:36:21.591 --> 01:36:22.424
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just compromised in terms of </v>

1810
01:36:25.131 --> 01:36:26.210
<v Speaker 1>getting what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that,</v>

1811
01:36:26.211 --> 01:36:27.044
<v Speaker 1>isn't that exactly what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what culture is is compromised so that </v>

1812
01:36:28.941 --> 01:36:29.774
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well a certain part of your providers </v>

1813
01:36:31.581 --> 01:36:34.670
<v Speaker 1>because if you had are modifying our </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior in some territory,</v>

1814
01:36:34.671 --> 01:36:36.710
<v Speaker 1>part of it's dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of it's,</v>

1815
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:40.730
<v Speaker 1>well if you do this I'll reward you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I do this you'll reward me.</v>

1816
01:36:40.730 --> 01:36:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And so like it's positive mutual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a modification,</v>

1817
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:47.270
<v Speaker 1>but also words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't have everything I could possibly</v>

1818
01:36:47.271 --> 01:36:48.790
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I could just have everything I</v>

1819
01:36:48.791 --> 01:36:49.624
<v Speaker 1>could possibly want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not function and this economic </v>

1820
01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:53.350
<v Speaker 1>function in society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1821
01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:53.990
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get,</v>

1822
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.823
<v Speaker 1>what you do is essentially theoretically</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you'd give up some immediate </v>

1823
01:36:57.711 --> 01:37:00.950
<v Speaker 1>gratification for the longterm protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

1824
01:37:00.951 --> 01:37:01.784
<v Speaker 1>I've continued stable gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one way of looking at it </v>

1825
01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 1>or at least being able to live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

1826
01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:09.440
<v Speaker 1>which I have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1827
01:37:09.441 --> 01:37:10.370
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1828
01:37:10.371 --> 01:37:12.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the social contract sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion right now.</v>

1829
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:15.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you said compromise and I would say,</v>

1830
01:37:15.801 --> 01:37:17.350
<v Speaker 1>well rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you know,</v>

1831
01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.193
<v Speaker 1>here's your negative option one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I kill you and here's maybe </v>

1832
01:37:20.690 --> 01:37:21.523
<v Speaker 1>option two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I listened to you and thereby </v>

1833
01:37:23.241 --> 01:37:26.090
<v Speaker 1>lose all my faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then the question is like,</v>

1834
01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.073
<v Speaker 1>is there some need a principal that </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't either of these that can be used </v>

1835
01:37:30.831 --> 01:37:31.580
<v Speaker 1>instead of them?</v>

1836
01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:32.413
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's why we're studying what </v>

1837
01:37:34.011 --> 01:37:34.844
<v Speaker 1>Marta represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I would say at the core of all </v>

1838
01:37:37.821 --> 01:37:38.654
<v Speaker 1>belief systems is a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process by which the belief system </v>

1839
01:37:43.431 --> 01:37:44.264
<v Speaker 1>was erected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the most important thing about </v>

1840
01:37:46.221 --> 01:37:47.770
<v Speaker 1>the belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

1841
01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:51.710
<v Speaker 1>you have belief system may that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like dogmatically attached to and I have</v>

1842
01:37:51.711 --> 01:37:53.930
<v Speaker 1>a belief system B and I'm dogmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attached to it.</v>

1843
01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:57.920
<v Speaker 1>And I point out to you that despite our </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences that the core,</v>

1844
01:37:57.940 --> 01:37:58.773
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we actually both agree about that </v>

1845
01:38:01.381 --> 01:38:05.220
<v Speaker 1>might help in some way smooth the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of transition.</v>

1846
01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:08.970
<v Speaker 1>It would also make us at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable negotiators because,</v>

1847
01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:11.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>

1848
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:15.180
<v Speaker 1>You have to see if I want to negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>

1849
01:38:15.181 --> 01:38:20.040
<v Speaker 1>we need a higher order point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference that defines the rules because</v>

1850
01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:20.874
<v Speaker 1>otherwise I might make an agreement with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and then just like how don't you </v>

1851
01:38:23.251 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 1>went to shreds is the first chance like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1852
01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:25.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1853
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:29.190
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be able to trust me even </v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin the process of negotiation.</v>

1854
01:38:29.191 --> 01:38:31.560
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is a weird example,</v>

1855
01:38:31.561 --> 01:38:32.394
<v Speaker 1>but let's say in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Christian marriage ceremony and </v>

1856
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:39.270
<v Speaker 1>white table that is the union of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>disparate territory's.</v>

1857
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:40.521
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion is,</v>

1858
01:38:40.521 --> 01:38:41.354
<v Speaker 1>is that the male and the female want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>with post to subordinate themselves to </v>

1859
01:38:44.461 --> 01:38:47.590
<v Speaker 1>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Christ represents smart,</v>

1860
01:38:47.591 --> 01:38:50.520
<v Speaker 1>smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Horace,</v>

1861
01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:54.540
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in breath and Buddha.</v>

1862
01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:56.970
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1863
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.560
<v Speaker 1>because this person has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1864
01:38:58.561 --> 01:38:59.394
<v Speaker 1>their story and this person has their </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and you didn't have the stores </v>

1865
01:39:04.890 --> 01:39:07.770
<v Speaker 1>produces a lot of unknown territory like</v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

1866
01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:10.440
<v Speaker 1>And in order to mediate between the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

1867
01:39:10.441 --> 01:39:12.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher order principle,</v>

1868
01:39:12.091 --> 01:39:13.290
<v Speaker 1>which says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the rule.</v>

1869
01:39:13.291 --> 01:39:14.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1870
01:39:14.251 --> 01:39:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll negotiate with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to trust me.</v>

1871
01:39:16.741 --> 01:39:17.574
<v Speaker 1>And vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to put the possibility of trust </v>

1872
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.153
<v Speaker 1>above all our dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd say what trust is one of the </v>

1873
01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:25.020
<v Speaker 1>aspects here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

1874
01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:25.873
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we have a higher point of </v>

1875
01:39:27.181 --> 01:39:29.340
<v Speaker 1>reference to mediate or just be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm saying,</v>

1876
01:39:29.341 --> 01:39:31.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one territory,</v>

1877
01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:31.893
<v Speaker 1>this is another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to find out what rules the </v>

1878
01:39:34.291 --> 01:39:38.130
<v Speaker 1>unexplored spaces in between so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we get there we know how to act.</v>

1879
01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.273
<v Speaker 5>Say</v>
<v Speaker 5>One more question about that similar </v>

1880
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:44.343
<v Speaker 5>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if the type of thing that you want </v>

1881
01:39:45.671 --> 01:39:46.504
<v Speaker 5>to explore it isn't the type of thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that inherently precludes like there's </v>

1882
01:39:50.441 --> 01:39:51.880
<v Speaker 5>sometimes the things that if I want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have it,</v>

1883
01:39:51.881 --> 01:39:54.520
<v Speaker 5>I must keep everyone else from having it</v>
<v Speaker 5>in order that I can have it.</v>

1884
01:39:54.850 --> 01:39:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a zero sum game.</v>

1885
01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.670
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there are other sorts of things that</v>

1886
01:39:57.671 --> 01:39:59.140
<v Speaker 5>aren't that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like for instance,</v>

1887
01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:00.203
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I just had this dispute that I </v>

1888
01:40:02.981 --> 01:40:03.814
<v Speaker 5>couldn't resolve with the Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 5>astrophysics says I would not </v>

1889
01:40:05.861 --> 01:40:09.070
<v Speaker 5>necessarily need to even knowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he was studying something.</v>

1890
01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:10.083
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>

1891
01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.480
<v Speaker 1>well that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look it up on it.</v>

1892
01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:13.550
<v Speaker 1>There are going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have to fight.</v>

1893
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:18.580
<v Speaker 1>This is your story and this is his </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1894
01:40:18.730 --> 01:40:22.380
<v Speaker 1>You both established domains of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cosmo,</v>

1895
01:40:22.570 --> 01:40:24.050
<v Speaker 1>cosmo's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1896
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.903
<v Speaker 1>the plural of that is to costs</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as he's studying phenomena that </v>

1897
01:40:32.801 --> 01:40:35.260
<v Speaker 1>are relevant to your pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if studying,</v>

1898
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.500
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1899
01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:38.500
<v Speaker 5>that same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did not have to keep him from studying</v>

1900
01:40:38.501 --> 01:40:39.660
<v Speaker 5>it just so that I can study it.</v>

1901
01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:40.693
<v Speaker 1>You not have to kill him as long as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as the implications of what he </v>

1902
01:40:43.541 --> 01:40:46.840
<v Speaker 1>discovers have no negative significance </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your ongoing story.</v>

1903
01:40:47.290 --> 01:40:48.120
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1904
01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:49.030
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1905
01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:50.373
<v Speaker 1>It seems like when you're</v>

1906
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:51.383
<v Speaker 5>like just solely to the physical world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in rivers and who's going to own </v>

1907
01:40:54.791 --> 01:40:55.624
<v Speaker 5>the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then if you're not willing to cooperate </v>

1908
01:40:57.461 --> 01:40:59.560
<v Speaker 5>and you're not going to give up your </v>
<v Speaker 5>goal and you have to kill them.</v>

1909
01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:00.723
<v Speaker 5>But if it's an abstracted thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're not studying a particular </v>

1910
01:41:02.771 --> 01:41:05.440
<v Speaker 5>tree yours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're just studying a concept.</v>

1911
01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:08.603
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even if he wants to stay in the </v>

1912
01:41:09.091 --> 01:41:10.710
<v Speaker 5>exact same bit of territory,</v>

1913
01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:14.910
<v Speaker 1>well he don't make that argument about </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited territory too all the time.</v>

1914
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Cause they say because there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists to basically follower,</v>

1915
01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:23.420
<v Speaker 1>which population theorist who said we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were all destined to starve my office.</v>

1916
01:41:24.761 --> 01:41:25.594
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's somebody coming in a suit taken </v>

1917
01:41:26.171 --> 01:41:27.004
<v Speaker 1>both thoseand perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that everything is a zero sum </v>

1918
01:41:28.871 --> 01:41:29.704
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the competition for resources as </v>

1919
01:41:30.791 --> 01:41:32.140
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's others who say,</v>

1920
01:41:32.141 --> 01:41:32.974
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true because you redefined </v>

1921
01:41:35.261 --> 01:41:37.690
<v Speaker 1>territory by transforming your adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1922
01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:38.524
<v Speaker 1>And that means that what may look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounded territory is only bounded </v>

1923
01:41:41.171 --> 01:41:42.004
<v Speaker 1>because of the way that you approach it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you think of a new way to </v>

1924
01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:44.764
<v Speaker 1>approach it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then there's plenty of resources </v>

1925
01:41:45.911 --> 01:41:46.744
<v Speaker 1>for all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so far the [inaudible] ones I think </v>

1926
01:41:48.851 --> 01:41:49.684
<v Speaker 1>are winning the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that territory is </v>

1927
01:41:52.121 --> 01:41:52.954
<v Speaker 1>defined by your behavior in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by any objective aspects of the </v>

1928
01:41:55.691 --> 01:41:56.524
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

1929
01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:57.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1930
01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:58.253
<v Speaker 1>he was a jury of distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>over goods and really these are really </v>

1931
01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.760
<v Speaker 1>structures of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1932
01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1933
01:42:07.051 --> 01:42:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I would say not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not usually,</v>

1934
01:42:09.331 --> 01:42:14.331
<v Speaker 1>because what constitutes a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always construed in relationship to</v>

1935
01:42:15.631 --> 01:42:18.900
<v Speaker 1>the pursuit of a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we fight wars over oil and the</v>

1936
01:42:18.901 --> 01:42:19.734
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we wouldn't fight wars over oil and </v>

1937
01:42:22.621 --> 01:42:23.454
<v Speaker 1>the 19th century because the effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect of Valence of petroleum has </v>

1938
01:42:27.001 --> 01:42:30.600
<v Speaker 1>shifted as a consequence of a shift and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our environmental structure.</v>

1939
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:33.270
<v Speaker 1>So and that's a natural good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1940
01:42:33.271 --> 01:42:35.820
<v Speaker 1>but like I don't buy the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural resource,</v>

1941
01:42:36.090 --> 01:42:36.923
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a real flawed logic </v>

1942
01:42:38.251 --> 01:42:39.084
<v Speaker 1>somewhere there because natural resource</v>
<v Speaker 1>plays the same role in economic theory </v>

1943
01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.490
<v Speaker 1>as stimuli does in psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean suddenly they were like,</v>

1944
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:48.870
<v Speaker 1>we agree that oil is a good and so we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting over it.</v>

1945
01:42:48.930 --> 01:42:49.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's then just say that I look at the </v>

1946
01:42:51.961 --> 01:42:52.794
<v Speaker 1>world in such a way that I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world very differently out of the </v>

1947
01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:57.203
<v Speaker 1>world in such a way that your way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world is inherently a </v>

1948
01:42:59.371 --> 01:43:01.620
<v Speaker 1>threat to it because it's different from</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1949
01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:06.090
<v Speaker 1>from mine and so it's not exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can compromise.</v>

1950
01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:09.810
<v Speaker 1>We have to come up with some integrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>principal.</v>

1951
01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1952
01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:14.400
<v Speaker 1>That's why it was taking dispute </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting over oil.</v>

1953
01:43:14.490 --> 01:43:16.230
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1954
01:43:16.231 --> 01:43:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I would say yes because we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1955
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:24.120
<v Speaker 1>we have to get to some other level so to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

1956
01:43:24.121 --> 01:43:24.954
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should do that with the fight over </v>

1957
01:43:26.221 --> 01:43:28.830
<v Speaker 1>oil too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there should be a higher,</v>

1958
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.903
<v Speaker 1>theoretically at least there might be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher order set of principles to which </v>

1959
01:43:33.031 --> 01:43:36.030
<v Speaker 1>we would be willing to subordinate our </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition for oil.</v>

1960
01:43:36.150 --> 01:43:36.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1961
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:38.680
<v Speaker 1>and it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's not,</v>

1962
01:43:39.210 --> 01:43:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's unreasonably Utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>to presume that in the long run it would</v>

1963
01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:47.490
<v Speaker 1>be better if we could get as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible for everyone.</v>

1964
01:43:47.490 --> 01:43:49.770
<v Speaker 1>It would be like from the selfish </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1965
01:43:49.771 --> 01:43:53.820
<v Speaker 1>better like think it was a historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormously van,</v>

1966
01:43:53.821 --> 01:43:57.470
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Americans rebuilt Japan instead</v>

1967
01:43:57.471 --> 01:43:59.330
<v Speaker 1>of burning into the ground and plowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you down.</v>

1968
01:43:59.331 --> 01:44:00.164
<v Speaker 1>You're with salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your more standard human </v>

1969
01:44:01.461 --> 01:44:03.740
<v Speaker 1>response to demolish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demolished enemy.</v>

1970
01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:06.530
<v Speaker 1>And it was the same Mikey said about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

1971
01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:07.513
<v Speaker 1>but the addition of Japan to the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic power strikes me as a net </v>

1972
01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:15.911
<v Speaker 1>benefit even to the victors evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a well union.</v>

1973
01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Well that plus the Japanese are online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

1974
01:44:20.211 --> 01:44:21.044
<v Speaker 1>We have access to the creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence of an additional several </v>

1975
01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:27.380
<v Speaker 1>hundred million people or however many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people inhabit Japan.</v>

1976
01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:30.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a zero sum game.</v>

1977
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:33.800
<v Speaker 1>There's no necessary reason to construe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as a zero sum game.</v>

1978
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:36.710
<v Speaker 1>It can be played that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1979
01:44:36.711 --> 01:44:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an error so that eliminates</v>
<v Speaker 1>the known,</v>

1980
01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:44.540
<v Speaker 1>the notion of the distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>like limited resources and ideas because</v>

1981
01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:46.280
<v Speaker 1>resources are ideas.</v>

1982
01:44:46.650 --> 01:44:47.483
<v Speaker 5>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I look at,</v>

1983
01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I see this danger that you're in.</v>

1984
01:44:49.651 --> 01:44:51.390
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't get any theologies and fight </v>
<v Speaker 5>wars over them,</v>

1985
01:44:51.391 --> 01:44:52.920
<v Speaker 5>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me they seem,</v>

1986
01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:54.173
<v Speaker 5>it seems to present a more optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 5>playing field because just if we have </v>

1987
01:44:57.331 --> 01:45:00.590
<v Speaker 5>this drive to explore that must be so </v>
<v Speaker 5>satisfied and we want,</v>

1988
01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:02.730
<v Speaker 5>we want to explore the physical </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>

1989
01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.333
<v Speaker 5>We must fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We must either cooperate or fight </v>

1990
01:45:07.650 --> 01:45:08.483
<v Speaker 5>because if there's one object and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there aren't duplicate copies of it and </v>

1991
01:45:11.341 --> 01:45:13.090
<v Speaker 5>only one person can explore it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I must,</v>

1992
01:45:13.230 --> 01:45:14.063
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what I can both explored </v>

1993
01:45:16.131 --> 01:45:17.540
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that don't even need to talk.</v>

1994
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:18.703
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the farm with the space race was good </v>

1995
01:45:20.461 --> 01:45:23.160
<v Speaker 1>for that for precisely that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great,</v>

1996
01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:27.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a great outlet for necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>explored very Tennessee.</v>

1997
01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:29.910
<v Speaker 1>It would not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you mean.</v>

1998
01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been saying all along.</v>

1999
01:45:32.521 --> 01:45:33.354
<v Speaker 1>And the whole point of abstraction and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of in terms of evolutionary </v>

2000
01:45:35.641 --> 01:45:39.180
<v Speaker 1>development is so that you can figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what's good and bad without actually</v>

2001
01:45:39.181 --> 01:45:41.340
<v Speaker 1>going out there and getting slaughtered </v>
<v Speaker 1>by it's bad.</v>

2002
01:45:41.650 --> 01:45:42.820
<v Speaker 1>So therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2003
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:46.170
<v Speaker 1>our whole cultural system is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>extracted so that you can have,</v>

2004
01:45:46.210 --> 01:45:47.860
<v Speaker 1>you can do these things where it hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

2005
01:45:47.970 --> 01:45:48.803
<v Speaker 1>but it has a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with it is that it has this </v>

2006
01:45:50.701 --> 01:45:52.200
<v Speaker 1>attended a danger that we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed,</v>

2007
01:45:52.201 --> 01:45:56.310
<v Speaker 1>which is the Tam Cascade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can also blow your whole system.</v>

2008
01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:57.173
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what we did with the </v>

2009
01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.570
<v Speaker 1>site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I should some smell.</v>

2010
01:46:00.571 --> 01:46:01.404
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the scientific revolution came </v>

2011
01:46:04.231 --> 01:46:05.064
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the discoveries of the scientific </v>

2012
01:46:06.391 --> 01:46:07.224
<v Speaker 1>revolution in abstract form seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradict the presumptions of the </v>

2013
01:46:11.101 --> 01:46:14.700
<v Speaker 1>religious systems upon which we erected </v>
<v Speaker 1>are a deputational structures.</v>

2014
01:46:14.970 --> 01:46:18.840
<v Speaker 1>So the consequence of abstraction was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we could destroy our belief systems</v>

2015
01:46:18.841 --> 01:46:20.940
<v Speaker 1>and that brought on an existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

2016
01:46:20.941 --> 01:46:21.774
<v Speaker 1>So the problem with abstraction is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can explore the abstract is very </v>

2017
01:46:25.111 --> 01:46:25.944
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can also be undermined really </v>

2018
01:46:27.661 --> 01:46:28.494
<v Speaker 1>easily by words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what another reason it's really </v>

2019
01:46:31.171 --> 01:46:35.130
<v Speaker 1>useful to study your theology I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it gives your ideology,</v>

2020
01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:36.083
<v Speaker 1>your necessary believe that kind of from</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground they can no longer be your mind </v>

2021
01:46:40.230 --> 01:46:43.260
<v Speaker 1>easily by a few casual words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're north,</v>

2022
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:47.010
<v Speaker 1>you're no longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it as a tree,</v>

2023
01:46:50.890 --> 01:46:53.980
<v Speaker 1>you're way up here in the branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't got the foggiest clue what's</v>

2024
01:46:53.981 --> 01:46:56.380
<v Speaker 1>down here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all unconscious so to speak,</v>

2025
01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:59.710
<v Speaker 1>which is to say it's all procedural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord still embed images.</v>

2026
01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Somebody would come along and give you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of harassment here and it blows your</v>

2027
01:47:03.101 --> 01:47:06.250
<v Speaker 1>whole adoptation we'll structure apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hate that.</v>

2028
01:47:06.251 --> 01:47:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard on you.</v>

2029
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:10.870
<v Speaker 1>But that's mostly because you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's down here.</v>

2030
01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:14.200
<v Speaker 1>So your house is built on shifting sand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one on the rock.</v>

2031
01:47:14.201 --> 01:47:15.460
<v Speaker 1>And the point is you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2032
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:18.340
<v Speaker 1>this ties in with the philosopher's </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone inventory that we'll get to in the</v>

2033
01:47:18.341 --> 01:47:19.174
<v Speaker 1>second half of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is that you're supposed to </v>

2034
01:47:20.591 --> 01:47:21.424
<v Speaker 1>build your house on a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the point is you have to figure out </v>

2035
01:47:22.931 --> 01:47:24.840
<v Speaker 1>what that rock is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2036
01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:27.910
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the reason why we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending so much time to discussing this</v>

2037
01:47:27.911 --> 01:47:28.744
<v Speaker 1>pattern of adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you know that in your belief </v>

2038
01:47:31.091 --> 01:47:31.924
<v Speaker 1>system is description of the process by </v>
<v Speaker 1>which belief systems are generated and </v>

2039
01:47:35.951 --> 01:47:37.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that you need to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>above all else,</v>

2040
01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:41.650
<v Speaker 1>well it makes you much more resistant to</v>
<v Speaker 1>casual disruption of your,</v>

2041
01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:42.933
<v Speaker 1>of your adaptations structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know what you should do when </v>

2042
01:47:45.851 --> 01:47:46.684
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the thing you need to know the </v>

2043
01:47:48.431 --> 01:47:49.264
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>

2044
01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:52.820
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're reading.</v>

2045
01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:00.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question.</v>

2046
01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.340
<v Speaker 1>The simple answer would be yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>

2047
01:48:04.690 --> 01:48:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Well you use the abuse of history is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty short.</v>

2048
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:08.350
<v Speaker 1>The basic writings of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2049
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:09.223
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to read all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read beyond good and evil as much of it </v>

2050
01:48:11.721 --> 01:48:13.460
<v Speaker 1>as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to read.</v>

2051
01:48:13.461 --> 01:48:14.294
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2052
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great mother.</v>

2053
01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:19.353
<v Speaker 1>Well look are the reason that I signed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great mother is because it's the </v>

2054
01:48:22.451 --> 01:48:23.284
<v Speaker 1>most comprehensive survey I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The symbolism of novelty basically of </v>

2055
01:48:27.221 --> 01:48:28.054
<v Speaker 1>the great mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you should do is go through it </v>

2056
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:32.900
<v Speaker 1>and get familiar with what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>new saying.</v>

2057
01:48:33.010 --> 01:48:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Basically all he's doing is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2058
01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:37.173
<v Speaker 1>there's a sim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks it's the collective </v>

2059
01:48:38.441 --> 01:48:39.274
<v Speaker 1>unconscious by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is right in a sense there's a </v>

2060
01:48:43.751 --> 01:48:45.130
<v Speaker 1>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the unknown.</v>

2061
01:48:45.131 --> 01:48:47.260
<v Speaker 1>It has a positive side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative side.</v>

2062
01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Here's the symbols that have accumulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>around that domain in representation.</v>

2063
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.823
<v Speaker 1>If you read that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like go through it enough so that you </v>

2064
01:48:56.351 --> 01:48:58.510
<v Speaker 1>get a feel for the language of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols,</v>

2065
01:48:58.511 --> 01:48:59.344
<v Speaker 1>which basically means you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand when you see the statue of </v>

2066
01:49:02.381 --> 01:49:03.214
<v Speaker 1>Diana who has a multitude of breasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand what that image </v>

2067
01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:09.430
<v Speaker 1>signifies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how when you see Kelly who has,</v>

2068
01:49:09.730 --> 01:49:11.950
<v Speaker 1>who's eating someone she's giving birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2069
01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to see it.</v>

2070
01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:13.893
<v Speaker 1>No one has a foreign artifact but as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of something that you </v>

2071
01:49:16.061 --> 01:49:18.160
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to read that book and a half</v>

2072
01:49:18.161 --> 01:49:18.994
<v Speaker 1>until you get the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is because unless </v>

2073
01:49:21.851 --> 01:49:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you understand those mythological</v>

2074
01:49:24.161 --> 01:49:24.994
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea how terrifying the </v>

2075
01:49:28.751 --> 01:49:29.584
<v Speaker 1>thing is that you want to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in normal circumstances it are </v>

2076
01:49:34.121 --> 01:49:34.954
<v Speaker 1>well protected existences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never ever encounter anything but </v>

2077
01:49:37.841 --> 01:49:40.960
<v Speaker 1>scares us badly enough to let us know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how scared we could be.</v>

2078
01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:43.720
<v Speaker 1>If you look at these mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>

2079
01:49:43.721 --> 01:49:44.554
<v Speaker 1>you can get an abstract notion of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying territory really is and it's </v>

2080
01:49:49.361 --> 01:49:52.690
<v Speaker 1>very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get instant insight into other,</v>

2081
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.570
<v Speaker 1>into the artistic productions of arcade </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>

2082
01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:58.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2083
01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:00.820
<v Speaker 1>the origins and history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

2084
01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically the best book that I do</v>

2085
01:50:06.431 --> 01:50:08.080
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It describes hero mythology.</v>

2086
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.923
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go through these enough so </v>

2087
01:50:10.391 --> 01:50:14.200
<v Speaker 1>that you get the gist of what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authors are trying to,</v>

2088
01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:20.190
<v Speaker 1>are trying to describe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the great mother Newman describes the</v>

2089
01:50:20.801 --> 01:50:24.430
<v Speaker 1>symbolism of north in the origins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of consciousness.</v>

2090
01:50:24.670 --> 01:50:28.330
<v Speaker 1>He describes the symbolism of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process that explores novelty.</v>

2091
01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:29.493
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get a picture of it cause </v>

2092
01:50:30.731 --> 01:50:34.300
<v Speaker 1>then you'll start understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>references to heroes and so on.</v>

2093
01:50:34.301 --> 01:50:35.850
<v Speaker 1>As we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we proceed through that,</v>

2094
01:50:36.490 --> 01:50:39.490
<v Speaker 1>through the divorce or these ordering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2095
01:50:39.491 --> 01:50:41.170
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

2096
01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.673
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>
