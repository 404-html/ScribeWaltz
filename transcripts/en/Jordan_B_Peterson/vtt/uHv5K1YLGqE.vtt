00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Hi Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a quick update.</v>

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.353
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to be having a debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday at nine 30 in the morning </v>

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.183
<v Speaker 1>eastern standard time and it will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>live cast on Jordan Peterson videos on </v>

5
00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The participants will be Mayo Moran,</v>

6
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
<v Speaker 1>who's the moderator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a professor of law and the provost</v>

7
00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:24.130
<v Speaker 1>at Trinity College,</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto.</v>

8
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.743
<v Speaker 1>I'll be debating Mary Bryson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a professor of education and </v>

9
00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:29.554
<v Speaker 1>senior Associate Dean Administration and</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation at the University of British </v>

10
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Brenda Cossman,</v>

11
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:36.184
<v Speaker 1>who is professor of law and director of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom center for sexual diversity </v>

12
00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:40.924
<v Speaker 1>studies at the University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll undoubtedly telling me that I </v>

13
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:45.124
<v Speaker 1>don't really understand bill [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the legislation that I'm commenting </v>

14
00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:50.530
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll see about that.</v>

15
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>So of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the debate has been announced,</v>

16
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>the PC authoritarians are in an uproar </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

17
00:00:58.991 --> 00:00:59.824
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as Huffington Post Canada blogger </v>

18
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.723
<v Speaker 1>idle Khatri pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university met my demands for </v>

19
00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:09.610
<v Speaker 1>holding a public debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I want to just mention a few things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that because he,</v>

21
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.443
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know what the hell he's </v>

22
00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:15.040
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

23
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say that he's uninformed.</v>

24
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't demand that the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>holds a debate.</v>

25
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.223
<v Speaker 1>I met with the Dean after receiving two </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters from the university warning me </v>

26
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:24.244
<v Speaker 1>to stop doing what I was doing and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggested given the uproar that </v>

27
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:28.204
<v Speaker 1>surrounded the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was something that should be </v>

28
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:32.464
<v Speaker 1>talked out in that the university could </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps models civilized conversation </v>

29
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:36.514
<v Speaker 1>about such complex topics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was in no position to demand </v>

30
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.090
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's typical of of I would say the PC</v>

31
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian ideology or idealogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>misuse of language.</v>

32
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.523
<v Speaker 1>You can bend the story too to suit your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective without really giving any </v>

33
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.073
<v Speaker 1>second thought to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course he commented the </v>

34
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.123
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto is providing yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>another stage for spreading uninformed </v>

35
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:00.994
<v Speaker 1>fear and hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can make what you want out of </v>

36
00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:04.144
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what exactly he means by </v>

37
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.064
<v Speaker 1>yet another stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they certainly didn't provide me </v>

38
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:08.914
<v Speaker 1>with my first stage and of course I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't spreading uninformed fear and </v>

39
00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:12.004
<v Speaker 1>hate to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that's just typical of </v>

40
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:15.934
<v Speaker 1>of the behavior of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people on the PC authoritarian </v>

41
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 1>part of the political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what else is new?</v>

42
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leonard Cohen died,</v>

43
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:28.270
<v Speaker 1>so that really was too bad because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was great.</v>

44
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.193
<v Speaker 1>That's the big news in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course Donald Trump was </v>

45
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.610
<v Speaker 1>elected this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to keep you waiting.</v>

46
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Complicated business.</v>

47
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.143
<v Speaker 2>Copper</v>

48
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why was that?</v>

49
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a variety of reasons,</v>

50
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:12.994
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that the simplest </v>

51
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.760
<v Speaker 1>explanation was that in in the mid </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies the Democrats,</v>

52
00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>they abandoned the working class to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics.</v>

53
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's too bad because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class.</v>

54
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.284
<v Speaker 1>Reagan needs a voice in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is that </v>

55
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>there is a proclivity in societies for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the winter to take all fundamentally</v>

56
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>in in monetary circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that accounts for the rise,</v>

57
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:36.544
<v Speaker 1>not so much of the 1% but if the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>10th of one 10th of 1% and it is a </v>

58
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:41.884
<v Speaker 1>constant societal battle to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic resources are funneled in some </v>

59
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>manner down to the people who were near </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the dominance hierarchy.</v>

60
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.703
<v Speaker 1>So the working class needs a voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the Democrats and that's </v>

61
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>why the rust belt abandoned them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost Hillary Clinton the election.</v>

62
00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.993
<v Speaker 1>They identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are not interested in the </v>

63
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:03.754
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of their defining </v>

64
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>characteristic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for them,</v>

65
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>group membership is all that counts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking today,</v>

66
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:09.784
<v Speaker 1>if you told the Kentucky Coal Miner this</v>
<v Speaker 1>story about people demanding their own </v>

67
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 1>pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing he'd think is,</v>

68
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm voting trump.</v>

69
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

70
00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>it's hardly surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyhow,</v>

71
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened in the u s so back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

72
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>to the topic at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to review with a pc game again,</v>

73
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the game that the Democrats have</v>

74
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 1>been playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the left.</v>

75
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.173
<v Speaker 1>Instead of focusing as they should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the economic concerns of </v>

76
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>people who are disadvantaged regardless </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their group identity.</v>

77
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.093
<v Speaker 1>To play the VC game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you identify an area of human activity </v>

78
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>that can be any area of human activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>from sports to economic activity.</v>

79
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.013
<v Speaker 1>You know that there's a distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>success in that area of activity like </v>

80
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:53.524
<v Speaker 1>there is in every human activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people who are good at </v>

81
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.523
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that's being done in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were less good and of course </v>

82
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.064
<v Speaker 1>the people who are good at it do better </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the people who are not as good do </v>

83
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:03.094
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you identify the winners and the </v>

84
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:05.824
<v Speaker 1>losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you claimed that the losers are </v>

85
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 1>losing because they're oppressed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winners.</v>

86
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>That way you can dispense with any such </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as competence,</v>

87
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:13.294
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or failed to notice the effect that say </v>

88
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.414
<v Speaker 1>hard work has on fostering success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that there are campuses in the </v>

89
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:24.271
<v Speaker 1>United States now where it's considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>a microaggression to make the claim that</v>

90
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>people who work hard make more money </v>
<v Speaker 1>than people who don't work hard anyways.</v>

91
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>You can also claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then once you've claimed that the losers</v>

92
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 1>are losing because they're oppressed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the winners,</v>

93
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>you can claim unearned allegiance with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the losers.</v>

94
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.903
<v Speaker 1>Feel secure in your comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation of the world because you've </v>

95
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 1>got everything wrapped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got five axioms.</v>

96
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>That's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can explain everything with them.</v>

97
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.003
<v Speaker 1>Then you can revel in your moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>superiority and you have the additional </v>

98
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>benefit of being able to target your </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment towards your newly discovered</v>

99
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.024
<v Speaker 1>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So any rot or blackness that you happen </v>

100
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:59.264
<v Speaker 1>to be harboring in your soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can vent towards these people that </v>

101
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.194
<v Speaker 1>are hypothetical oppressors and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that you can be a terrible </v>

102
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>person and you can feel good about it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

103
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Then you can repeat that forever in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every possible circumstance everywhere,</v>

104
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 1>and that's the PC gate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

105
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>we've been looking into that fair bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our research.</v>

106
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm working very hard with my graduate </v>
<v Speaker 1>student,</v>

107
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:20.264
<v Speaker 1>Christine Brophy right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my phd student trying to get our first </v>

108
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>paper on political correctness ready for</v>
<v Speaker 1>release,</v>

109
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>but I can give you some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some more,</v>

110
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.960
<v Speaker 1>some information about it.</v>

111
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.523
<v Speaker 1>We did a video with rebel media about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we weren't as articulate as we might've </v>

112
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.963
<v Speaker 1>been about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to give it another shot </v>

113
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

114
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I do that,</v>

115
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.113
<v Speaker 1>another element of the PC game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is part of the pc philosophy </v>

116
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>defined injustice as any equality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

117
00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I would like to give you an update about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto Human Resource</v>

118
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 1>and Equity Department's training </v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

119
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:52.604
<v Speaker 1>They decided they were going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiose and antiracism training </v>

120
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.863
<v Speaker 1>mandatory for their staff and I made my </v>
<v Speaker 1>second video back in late September </v>

121
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 1>about that and somebody slipped the </v>
<v Speaker 1>training material underneath my door.</v>

122
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.143
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I found out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was absolutely distressing was that the </v>

123
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.983
<v Speaker 1>consultant who was hired to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>antiracism and antibiose training was </v>

124
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:13.670
<v Speaker 1>attempting to teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

125
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 1>But I would say indoctrinate the staff </v>
<v Speaker 1>into how to analyze a,</v>

126
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>an organization to decide if it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive.</v>

127
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 1>And so basically what you do is you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organization,</v>

128
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>imagine that it's a pyramid and it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>different strata.</v>

129
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you assess each strata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you assess it demographically,</v>

130
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>so you assess it by group identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

131
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:32.834
<v Speaker 1>gender and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose sexual preference and all the </v>

132
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:35.864
<v Speaker 1>other things that the PC authoritarians </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to go on and on about constantly </v>

133
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.393
<v Speaker 1>and defined people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you match each strata of the </v>

134
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.970
<v Speaker 1>organization against the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

135
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 1>And if the demographics don't match </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

136
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:49.424
<v Speaker 1>So if there aren't say 51% women and 2% </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay people and maybe 6% native people </v>

137
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever makes up the population,</v>

138
00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.293
<v Speaker 1>then you define the organization as </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequitable and regarded as corrupt and </v>

139
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>in need of modification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's obvious problems with that.</v>

140
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Not least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That being,</v>

141
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:12.860
<v Speaker 1>that quality of outcome is perhaps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most pernicious of Marxist doctrines.</v>

142
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:13.694
<v Speaker 1>And the attempt to impose that on entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>populations in the Soviet Union and in </v>

143
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.913
<v Speaker 1>Mao's China resulted in the deaths of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people and we collect the </v>

144
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Cold War to stop claims that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of outcome was the,</v>

145
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>was the optimal metric by which to </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure society's progress.</v>

146
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's the University of Toronto hr </v>
<v Speaker 1>department.</v>

147
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:31.364
<v Speaker 1>They're not at equity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only are they taking advice from a </v>

148
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:34.154
<v Speaker 1>group of radicals who won't disavow </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence in their pursuit of social </v>

149
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:37.244
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they're basically pushing what </v>

150
00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Speaker 1>can only be called communist propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 1>from like the 1930s on their employees.</v>

151
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.810
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly Hannah Moffit,</v>

152
00:08:45.811 --> 00:08:46.644
<v Speaker 1>who's the vice president of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and equity should promptly </v>

153
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:50.414
<v Speaker 1>resigned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a little bit about the historical </v>

154
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:55.690
<v Speaker 1>basis of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

155
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.533
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the political correct </v>

156
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:02.550
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian types are fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by two philosophers.</v>

157
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karl Marx,</v>

158
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the father of communism and his </v>

159
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:08.274
<v Speaker 1>basic principle was from each according </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his ability to each according to his </v>

160
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that sounds good.</v>

161
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:14.844
<v Speaker 1>And it was a good enough slogan to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract the attention of intellectuals </v>

162
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:19.314
<v Speaker 1>everywhere in to other people as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem comes in its practical </v>

163
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:27.201
<v Speaker 1>application and the problem is who </v>
<v Speaker 1>determines what constitutes need?</v>

164
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to decide if my need say,</v>

165
00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:32.804
<v Speaker 1>because I have a father with Alzheimer's</v>
<v Speaker 1>is greater than your need because you </v>

166
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 1>have a daughter with cancer and a wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an alcoholic.</v>

167
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>So who the hell parses up need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

168
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 1>and the problem of course also is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>need is infinite.</v>

169
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.973
<v Speaker 1>And it's also no easy matter to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine whether or not each person is </v>

170
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 1>contributing according to his or her </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>

171
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.723
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why we have a free </v>
<v Speaker 1>market because these sorts of things </v>

172
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>cannot be determined by central </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities.</v>

173
00:09:57.571 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all hell breaks loose.</v>

174
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.953
<v Speaker 1>And the other part of the PC philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror show is Jacques Derrida and </v>

175
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:04.884
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think was the most dangerous person </v>

176
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 1>who lived in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe not because he had to compete</v>

177
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:10.314
<v Speaker 1>with Hitler and mio and Stalin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's a bit of an </v>

178
00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:13.524
<v Speaker 1>overstatement.</v>

179
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.270
<v Speaker 1>It probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darin,</v>

180
00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:16.104
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you might describe him as a </v>

181
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>philosopher of extreme resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a real trickster.</v>

182
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 1>He basically claimed that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization is for exclusion.</v>

183
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 1>And so the postmodernist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a postmodernist,</v>

184
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:29.064
<v Speaker 1>basically claimed that there's no truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only competing power games </v>

185
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:32.964
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the reason that you categorize </v>

186
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:38.130
<v Speaker 1>the reason that human beings categorize </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to further their power games.</v>

187
00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:38.964
<v Speaker 1>And so categorization is for exclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't form a club so much to keep </v>

188
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 1>people in as to keep people out to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of your power game.</v>

189
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:46.374
<v Speaker 1>And that's of course absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous because one of the things </v>

190
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 1>that happens when you categorize is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you exclude things.</v>

191
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise every category contains </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that exists.</v>

192
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 1>And so what the hell good is a category </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

193
00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:57.834
<v Speaker 1>Obviously categories exclude the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's why we categorize is </v>

194
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.370
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>

195
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:03.893
<v Speaker 1>We categorize to simple simplify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world so that we can operate on it </v>

196
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:07.584
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we generalize across discreet </v>

197
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:12.750
<v Speaker 1>entities so that we don't have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with every single discreet entity.</v>

198
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.410
<v Speaker 1>And the reasons that we categorize are </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite complex.</v>

199
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.993
<v Speaker 1>We tend to categorize things in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>category if they can be used for the </v>

200
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:23.190
<v Speaker 1>same purpose because we're basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>tool using creatures.</v>

201
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.293
<v Speaker 1>We don't so much categorize because </v>
<v Speaker 1>things have the same objective </v>

202
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>properties because things have many </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective properties and so,</v>

203
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:31.314
<v Speaker 1>but we do tend to categorize things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar if they can be used for similar </v>

204
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:34.824
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an extension of our tool using </v>

205
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:37.194
<v Speaker 1>capacity into the cognitive domain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dare to also claimed essentially that </v>

206
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:41.484
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing outside the text and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the postmodernists everything </v>

207
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally is interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is subjective and you can see</v>

208
00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:49.734
<v Speaker 1>that reflected say and legislation like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill see 16 which which insists that </v>

209
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:58.591
<v Speaker 1>gender identity and identity in general </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is only subjectively defined</v>

210
00:11:58.661 --> 00:11:59.494
<v Speaker 1>which is of course also observed because</v>
<v Speaker 1>your identity is something that you </v>

211
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with other people.</v>

212
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.563
<v Speaker 1>If you're older than two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that technically because two </v>

213
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:07.984
<v Speaker 1>year olds are egocentric and they have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard time negotiating anything with </v>

214
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:12.364
<v Speaker 1>other children and they can't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to do that until there were about </v>

215
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:15.874
<v Speaker 1>three and and most kids are pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it by the age of four but if they </v>

216
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:19.594
<v Speaker 1>don't get it by the age of four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's very difficult for them to </v>

217
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>make friends for the rest of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

218
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.063
<v Speaker 1>they get excluded from the peer groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they don't stay abreast of </v>

219
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:31.090
<v Speaker 1>their peers and they end up up alienated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and often antisocial.</v>

220
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It's really not good to construe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Identity isn't only subjective,</v>

221
00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 1>is unbelievably psychologically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophically primitive.</v>

222
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:38.434
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing about identity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be noted is that identity also </v>

223
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 1>has functional utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

224
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 1>if you have a genuine identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're an artist,</v>

225
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:47.674
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a lawyer or a businessman or a </v>

226
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>plumber or a nurse or a physician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're identity is something that,</v>

227
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.873
<v Speaker 1>it's a set of skills that you use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate in the social and the natural </v>

228
00:12:57.641 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's plenty outside the text.</v>

229
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking today about who Karl Marx</v>

230
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 1>and Jacques Derrida would produce as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a child,</v>

231
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:08.554
<v Speaker 1>as an offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they ever were able to meet </v>

232
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 1>successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what I came up with.</v>

233
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be the joker.</v>

234
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's why.</v>

235
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Here's a great scene from the Batman </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie that's each herd Heath Ledger,</v>

236
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:22.870
<v Speaker 1>who really had the horror of resentment </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to a,</v>

237
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 1>to a science.</v>

238
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so could I say I?</v>

239
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.260
<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you I'm a man of my word.</v>

240
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Where is he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Italian.</v>

241
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk to [inaudible] to verge on the</v>

242
00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:38.284
<v Speaker 3>location in 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want auxiliary units to cover all </v>

243
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 3>possible get away routes.</v>

244
00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Please don't go to mind what you'll go </v>
<v Speaker 2>with all your money.</v>

245
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.360
<v Speaker 2>You see how the guy have simple taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy,</v>

246
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:56.361
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline</v>

247
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.180
<v Speaker 2>and you know a thing that they have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>common.</v>

248
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Eric sheet</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I am,</v>

249
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.773
<v Speaker 2>I'm only burning my half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you care about is money deserves a </v>

250
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.320
<v Speaker 2>better class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give it the don't</v>

251
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.140
<v Speaker 2>tell you're mad thing work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my setting</v>

252
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.670
<v Speaker 1>so you can see that when the joke or </v>
<v Speaker 1>does get his share of the money,</v>

253
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.730
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to use it for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the point.</v>

254
00:14:38.731 --> 00:14:41.520
<v Speaker 1>The point is to gather it so that it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be destroyed.</v>

255
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Just to show that all he is is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyer and there are plenty of people</v>

256
00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:47.184
<v Speaker 1>who were only destroyers and I certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard the malevolent and of the Pc </v>

257
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Authoritarians as fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyers.</v>

258
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 1>They want to bring down everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the resentful,</v>

259
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.380
<v Speaker 1>they're resentful right to the core and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very powerful human motivation.</v>

260
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 1>You see that reflected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

261
00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:02.714
<v Speaker 1>in the biblical story of Cain and Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really the story of the first </v>

262
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 1>two human beings because Adam and eve </v>
<v Speaker 1>were made by God.</v>

263
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.633
<v Speaker 1>So the story goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel were the first genuine </v>

264
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:13.574
<v Speaker 1>human beings and they instantly lock </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves into a murderous embrace </v>

265
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:20.920
<v Speaker 1>where one was very resentful of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other success and uh,</v>

266
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.590
<v Speaker 1>ended up in fact killing him despite the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that he was his ideal.</v>

267
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a cautionary tale for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to tell you a little bit about</v>

268
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 1>our research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we took 192 political items,</v>

269
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:32.763
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we gathered by analyzing what had </v>

270
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 1>been discussed in the media as elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>or instances of political correctness.</v>

271
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 1>We tried to be agnostic about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gather as many statements as we possibly</v>

272
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:44.924
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we subjected them to a </v>

273
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.650
<v Speaker 1>statistical procedure called a factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

274
00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:51.190
<v Speaker 1>which helps sort beliefs into their </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

275
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 1>And two beliefs go in the same category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

276
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 1>if you agree with one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're likely to agree with the other or</v>

277
00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>if you disagree with when you're likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to disagree with another,</v>

278
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you can see patterns of covariants it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>

279
00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:03.554
<v Speaker 1>but patterns of similarity within data </v>
<v Speaker 1>sets and it's an agnostic pro process </v>

280
00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:09.380
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's purely computational.</v>

281
00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>It's an eight I would say it's about as </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheoretical approaches can possibly be.</v>

282
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.113
<v Speaker 1>Matt managed in in a science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found that there were two clumps of </v>

283
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:21.080
<v Speaker 1>politically correct belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We called one pc liberalism and here's a</v>

284
00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:24.350
<v Speaker 1>couple of examples of things that pc </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals particularly belief.</v>

285
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.463
<v Speaker 1>Other question would be rate the degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>to which you think the following </v>

286
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.830
<v Speaker 1>constitute evidence of an unjust system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a PC liberally,</v>

287
00:16:31.831 --> 00:16:36.831
<v Speaker 1>you believe that societies in just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because or unjust because only 5% of the</v>

288
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:40.040
<v Speaker 1>fortune 500 companies have women as </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceos.</v>

289
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.933
<v Speaker 1>Because in 2013 the poverty rate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocks in the U s was 27% well for </v>

290
00:16:44.991 --> 00:16:45.824
<v Speaker 1>whites it was 10% and because 64% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicians and surgeons are men in the </v>

291
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:51.494
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that societies unjust pc </v>

292
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:54.974
<v Speaker 1>liberals agree with such things as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is warming because of the human </v>

293
00:16:57.351 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 1>species burns too much fossil fuel </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that racial,</v>

294
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 1>ethnic and gender quota should exist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>employment.</v>

295
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Believe that government interventions </v>
<v Speaker 1>should exist in schools and companies to</v>

296
00:17:08.301 --> 00:17:12.170
<v Speaker 1>ensure equality and professions where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a historically large inequality.</v>

297
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.183
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly quality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the beliefs that clump together </v>

298
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:20.060
<v Speaker 1>to make the set of beliefs that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>described this pc liberalism.</v>

299
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.910
<v Speaker 1>And so here's what the PC authoritarians</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like.</v>

300
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.200
<v Speaker 1>They are in favor of censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they believe that books,</v>

301
00:17:27.201 --> 00:17:28.034
<v Speaker 1>including the dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies and art should be censored for </v>

302
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:35.591
<v Speaker 1>offensive slash racist slash sexist </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminatory language and ideas.</v>

303
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.020
<v Speaker 1>So they're pro censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe in punishment.</v>

304
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:40.460
<v Speaker 1>For Racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>

305
00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:41.294
<v Speaker 1>or homophobic slurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also believe in retooling the </v>

306
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:45.620
<v Speaker 1>justice system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

307
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:46.454
<v Speaker 1>they believe that an alleged perpetrator</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sexual assault should have to prove </v>

308
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.763
<v Speaker 1>his or her innocence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reversing the standard western legal </v>

309
00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 1>doctrine of innocent before proven </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty.</v>

310
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.273
<v Speaker 1>They believe that students suspected of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual assault should be suspended </v>

311
00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.993
<v Speaker 1>pending further investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that a suspicion is </v>

312
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to disrupt someone's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they believe that is wrong,</v>

313
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:10.680
<v Speaker 1>to criticize the status and rights of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women under Islam because that is racist</v>

314
00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 1>and disrespectful of multiculturalism.</v>

315
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 1>So that's the PC authoritarian set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>

316
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Here's what predicts whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe those things.</v>

317
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:20.634
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to believe the set of </v>

318
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 1>beliefs that characterizes pc </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism,</v>

319
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.853
<v Speaker 1>then the best predictors were that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had attended a politically correct </v>

320
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:29.844
<v Speaker 1>seminars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that shows you exactly how powerful </v>

321
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:32.570
<v Speaker 1>propaganda is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

322
00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:35.790
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're verbally intelligent.</v>

323
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 1>So the more verbally intelligent you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

324
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 1>the more you believe the PC liberal line</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hiring openness.</v>

325
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big five trait that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with creativity.</v>

326
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 1>You're agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly compassionate.</v>

327
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 1>So agreeableness is another big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>train that's associated,</v>

328
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:51.174
<v Speaker 1>I would say with maternal behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the compassionate and </v>

329
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.413
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to be female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to be educated and </v>

330
00:18:56.521 --> 00:19:00.480
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're a PC authoritarian,</v>

331
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you have low verbal intelligence and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>low intelligence in general,</v>

332
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.450
<v Speaker 1>high disgust sensitivity.</v>

333
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's been associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism in the past.</v>

334
00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:11.940
<v Speaker 1>So the pc out there tarion's or are </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

335
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.960
<v Speaker 1>a hybrid between agreeableness say </v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

336
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.803
<v Speaker 1>which puts them on a pc spectrum and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same kind of orderliness and disgust </v>

337
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:22.770
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity that seemed to characterize </v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing authoritarians.</v>

338
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.023
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to be nonwhite </v>

339
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.733
<v Speaker 1>religious with a low income female </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed with an anxiety or mood </v>

340
00:19:28.951 --> 00:19:31.050
<v Speaker 1>disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that might account for the desire for</v>

341
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:33.210
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a safe spaces and such things.</v>

342
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.820
<v Speaker 1>A agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate down,</v>

343
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:36.660
<v Speaker 1>polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

344
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.523
<v Speaker 1>the best way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness is as a maternal </v>

345
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.013
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's I think why pc people treat </v>

346
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:46.470
<v Speaker 1>everyone as if there are children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're conscientious but orderly,</v>

347
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.880
<v Speaker 1>orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

348
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.743
<v Speaker 1>not industrious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These factors are only correlated at </v>

349
00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:53.310
<v Speaker 1>0.12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are not the same people.</v>

350
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.263
<v Speaker 1>And we think the PC liberals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically apologists for the PC </v>

351
00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:57.504
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to read you a letter that I </v>

352
00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 1>received recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the details that I just wanted to say.</v>

353
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.003
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for standing up for your beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>for others and for free speech in the </v>

354
00:20:08.311 --> 00:20:09.144
<v Speaker 1>face of what I know must be a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuous and publicly attempted </v>

355
00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:12.894
<v Speaker 1>shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a liberal and a feminist in my late </v>

356
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 1>thirties until a few weeks ago when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin checking out your videos.</v>

357
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I would have described myself as a third</v>
<v Speaker 1>wave feminist.</v>

358
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I graduated from the University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>British Columbia with a major in biology</v>

359
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:25.614
<v Speaker 1>and a minor in women's studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I was part of the early wave </v>

360
00:20:28.411 --> 00:20:29.244
<v Speaker 1>of this pc authoritarian indoctrination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference being I remember being </v>

361
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:36.630
<v Speaker 1>encouraged to have open dialogue back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then in my women's studies classes,</v>

362
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.930
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have trigger warnings are safe</v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces that came later.</v>

363
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I ended up finding myself working in </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment,</v>

364
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.910
<v Speaker 1>which I now believe is influenced </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily by academia.</v>

365
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:45.983
<v Speaker 1>For the past 15 years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've managed careers of Comedians and </v>

366
00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:49.474
<v Speaker 1>I've always been drawn to comedians with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a message having adored folks like Bill </v>

367
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor and George Carlin.</v>

368
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.823
<v Speaker 1>Overtime comedians with a message </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually came to me comics who are </v>

369
00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:02.260
<v Speaker 1>living in this social justice or your </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble as am I.</v>

370
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.753
<v Speaker 1>For almost 20 years I lived in this echo</v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber and watched as social justice </v>

371
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 1>academic concepts grew to mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

372
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.383
<v Speaker 1>which I applaud it but at some point it </v>
<v Speaker 1>started realize that in these concepts </v>

373
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 1>of equality and inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in my online world have morphed</v>

374
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:18.004
<v Speaker 1>into this strange cult of belief that </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourages descent discussion or free </v>

375
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:23.470
<v Speaker 1>speech and thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned,</v>

376
00:21:23.471 --> 00:21:26.800
<v Speaker 1>most of this came after I graduated so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw it unfold online.</v>

377
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I think social media for all of the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it has brought us,</v>

378
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.520
<v Speaker 1>has allowed us to become more isolated </v>
<v Speaker 1>than ever before possible.</v>

379
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.270
<v Speaker 1>My entire facebook and twitter feeds are</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of sjws.</v>

380
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.253
<v Speaker 1>This is the echo chamber I self selected</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of them are in an all out </v>

381
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:43.660
<v Speaker 1>assault on differing opinions and on </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

382
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps because of the result of the U s</v>

383
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:48.334
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a few of us within my echo </v>

384
00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:50.674
<v Speaker 1>chamber who are trying to share a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful articles that attempt to </v>

385
00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:54.760
<v Speaker 1>answer the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did trump get elected?</v>

386
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:55.923
<v Speaker 1>No matter the nuanced and intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>content of these articles or the pains </v>

387
00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:00.154
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm seeing folks try and present </v>

388
00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:02.044
<v Speaker 1>them in a non offensive way to anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who may not agree the sjws are </v>

389
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:08.410
<v Speaker 1>cannibalizing these folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be clear,</v>

390
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.633
<v Speaker 1>these are also liberals who have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered a part of the same community </v>

391
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:12.754
<v Speaker 1>until now who are being thrown out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfriended and ganged up on in this </v>

392
00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:17.134
<v Speaker 1>social media public shaming way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you see that's a good indication of </v>

393
00:22:20.801 --> 00:22:24.310
<v Speaker 1>why I'm reading this letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because our research indicates that</v>

394
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.430
<v Speaker 1>there are two clumps of belief in the pc</v>
<v Speaker 1>cap,</v>

395
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:28.403
<v Speaker 1>the liberal type beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but but they're strongly influenced by </v>

396
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:32.554
<v Speaker 1>trait agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not the case with with let's </v>

397
00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:35.224
<v Speaker 1>say normal liberalism and the PC </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians and there are strange </v>

398
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 1>bedfellows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

399
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really agree and given the opportunity,</v>

400
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:46.000
<v Speaker 1>the PC authoritarians will eat the PC </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals.</v>

401
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 1>So this is a warning to upc liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>types.</v>

402
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.653
<v Speaker 1>You should stop apologizing and acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>as intelligent and articulate </v>

403
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:54.724
<v Speaker 1>mouthpieces for the PC authoritarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are not your friends and they're </v>

404
00:22:57.761 --> 00:22:58.594
<v Speaker 1>pro censorship and this throwing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>out cannibalizing as as mentioned in </v>

405
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:03.514
<v Speaker 1>this letter is precisely the attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>impose a censorship on their so called </v>

406
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:10.540
<v Speaker 1>allies while they aren't your allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what you're seeing.</v>

407
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:12.603
<v Speaker 1>These are allies doing their best to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand why trump won so we can </v>

408
00:23:16.031 --> 00:23:16.864
<v Speaker 1>best change course and sway people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our liberal point of view and they are </v>

409
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:21.700
<v Speaker 1>being told that they need to check their</v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege,</v>

410
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.120
<v Speaker 1>that they are only posting these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they're unconscious racism.</v>

411
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sort of thing that the </v>

412
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.870
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto is trying to train</v>
<v Speaker 1>their staff out of,</v>

413
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.273
<v Speaker 1>that they are part of the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>supremacist culture and that they are </v>

414
00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:33.660
<v Speaker 1>not allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

415
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It saddens me because I now believe it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of censorship and divisiveness</v>

416
00:23:37.931 --> 00:23:38.764
<v Speaker 1>and willingness to write people off by </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting them in a bigot box that caused </v>

417
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:42.634
<v Speaker 1>the trump backlash to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think these folks unconsciously </v>

418
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.091
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

419
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:47.924
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not so sure it's unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be pushing more and more </v>

420
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:51.884
<v Speaker 1>people out of the left and ensuring the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump will win again in 2020 ultimately </v>

421
00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:56.294
<v Speaker 1>I think they are ensuring that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>country will only become more polarized </v>

422
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.190
<v Speaker 1>into this us versus them mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

423
00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:02.024
<v Speaker 1>You see the reason I don't think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much unconscious as the women's </v>

424
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:07.460
<v Speaker 1>studies websites all say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go read them,</v>

425
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:08.294
<v Speaker 1>they're out to destroy the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically indistinguishable </v>

426
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:12.224
<v Speaker 1>from Western civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not so sure to clear me that </v>

427
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:17.930
<v Speaker 1>it's unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they are propelling the very old</v>

428
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 1>right that they see to oppose for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these people in my timeline,</v>

429
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:23.240
<v Speaker 1>this is their career.</v>

430
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.800
<v Speaker 1>They are all churning out online article</v>
<v Speaker 1>after article right now about how racism</v>

431
00:24:27.801 --> 00:24:30.290
<v Speaker 1>is to blame for the election and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think anything else,</v>

432
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:31.124
<v Speaker 1>you're a racist about how white people </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to wear a safety pin to show their </v>

433
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:34.993
<v Speaker 1>allies about how white people need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the safety pins off now because </v>

434
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:39.134
<v Speaker 1>it's embarrassing and only shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want validation for being good </v>

435
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:42.104
<v Speaker 1>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piece upon piece about something so </v>

436
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:50.240
<v Speaker 1>trivial as a safety pin and I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>countless privileged sjws in my timeline</v>

437
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:52.580
<v Speaker 1>wringing their hands and posting long </v>
<v Speaker 1>status updates,</v>

438
00:24:52.581 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 1>asking how to be the best ally they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>to more marginalized folks and how these</v>

439
00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:58.760
<v Speaker 1>contradictory articles or confusing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

440
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Well of course they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're only waiting to be told how to</v>

441
00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:05.420
<v Speaker 1>be a good human being because you bought</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the idea that you're privileged,</v>

442
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 1>presents you from your right to your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions and choices,</v>

443
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:08.953
<v Speaker 1>then you will be pulled by each and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every contradictory and incendiary </v>

444
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:12.620
<v Speaker 1>opinion piece like this.</v>

445
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry for the long winded email we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started off as a simple thank you.</v>

446
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:17.863
<v Speaker 1>I started watching your videos a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the election because I saw folks </v>

447
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:23.840
<v Speaker 1>in my timeline labeling you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transphobic and I looked a little deeper</v>

448
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:25.940
<v Speaker 1>only to be surprised that I disagreed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

449
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.373
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started listening to some of your </v>

450
00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:28.964
<v Speaker 1>lectures while at the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I particularly enjoyed the tragedy </v>

451
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:33.840
<v Speaker 1>versus evil talk and the Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ella.</v>

452
00:25:33.841 --> 00:25:34.674
<v Speaker 1>Gloria stayed with me for weeks now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every choice I make ass as it </v>

453
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:38.654
<v Speaker 1>should and I am learning to live well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being vulnerable to unravel what I </v>

454
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:46.460
<v Speaker 1>actually believe about things </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent of this sg w ideology I have</v>

455
00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:47.294
<v Speaker 1>been subscribing to for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now see that it's not so different </v>

456
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:50.624
<v Speaker 1>than the conservative fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology I was raised in and took </v>

457
00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:54.650
<v Speaker 1>several years to shed in my teens.</v>

458
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I understood the full </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of that Nietzsche quote.</v>

459
00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:01.970
<v Speaker 1>He who fights with monster should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful lest he thereby become a monster</v>

460
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.910
<v Speaker 1>and if thou gaze long into an abyss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abyss.</v>

461
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:08.900
<v Speaker 1>We'll also gaze into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I began listening to your lectures</v>

462
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:09.734
<v Speaker 1>and reflecting on the actions I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my community slash echo chamber </v>

463
00:26:12.441 --> 00:26:15.650
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so thank you for that to finally,</v>

464
00:26:15.651 --> 00:26:16.484
<v Speaker 1>I am sure you have many people assisting</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I'm going to contribute to your </v>

465
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 1>patriot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you ever need additional help,</v>

466
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 1>especially on any of the sjw magic words</v>
<v Speaker 1>and conversation stopping tactics,</v>

467
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:26.983
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have lived without ideology as my </v>

468
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:32.120
<v Speaker 1>religion for so many years and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language well.</v>

469
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:33.283
<v Speaker 1>Well that's an excellent letter and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much to the writer of </v>

470
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:38.420
<v Speaker 1>that letter who I've taken some pains to</v>
<v Speaker 1>disguise.</v>

471
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Here's something that Milton Friedman </v>
<v Speaker 1>said about inequality.</v>

472
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman was someone,</v>

473
00:26:44.491 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 1>the Economist magazine called the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>influential economists,</v>

474
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.223
<v Speaker 1>the second half of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's often put into the conservative </v>

475
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 1>camp of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of economists,</v>

476
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.113
<v Speaker 1>a society that puts equality before </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom will get neither a society that </v>

477
00:26:58.681 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Speaker 1>puts freedom before he quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get a high degree of both.</v>

478
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to think about.</v>

479
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Now I should also say that the anti pc </v>
<v Speaker 1>stickers are still for sale.</v>

480
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:10.074
<v Speaker 1>I'll put the link back below the apse in</v>
<v Speaker 1>development and that was the APP that </v>

481
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:14.034
<v Speaker 1>will help us locate where the bulk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>poster activity is that's associated </v>

482
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 1>with politically correct activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have a web page and development.</v>

483
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:23.184
<v Speaker 1>The idea for the web pages to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to upload policy documents from </v>

484
00:27:27.121 --> 00:27:27.954
<v Speaker 1>companies and other institutions as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as governments that are fundamentally </v>

485
00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:32.604
<v Speaker 1>politically correct in the origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to track their developmental course </v>

486
00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:36.384
<v Speaker 1>so that we can start to figure out who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind these sorts of things and what </v>

487
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:41.130
<v Speaker 1>might be done to stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

488
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:41.993
<v Speaker 1>that's all for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that you are able to tune into </v>

489
00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:45.834
<v Speaker 1>the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

490
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.840
<v Speaker 1>just a reminder that's Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>November 9th at 9:30 AM eastern standard</v>

491
00:27:51.241 --> 00:27:52.074
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it will be livecast on Jordan </v>

492
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Peterson videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for watching.</v>

493
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.423
<v Speaker 1>Bye Bye.</v>
