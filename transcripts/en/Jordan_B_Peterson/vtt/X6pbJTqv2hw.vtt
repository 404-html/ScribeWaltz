1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 2>so we'll continue with our union </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis of the lion king today.</v>

3
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.523
<v Speaker 2>We ended at the point where you remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mufasa had taken Simba up to the top of </v>

4
00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:25.844
<v Speaker 2>pride rock and</v>
<v Speaker 2>described to him the fact that his </v>

5
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 2>kingdom essentially constituted </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that the light touched.</v>

6
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.553
<v Speaker 2>You can think about that as the domain </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the roughly speaking of the great </v>

7
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 2>father with the domain of the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother on the outside of that,</v>

8
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 2>that being symbolically equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the underworld or to death or to nature.</v>

9
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.523
<v Speaker 2>All of those things seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>approximately equally true and he </v>

10
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:51.704
<v Speaker 2>forbade Simba from going to investigate </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was beyond the confines of the </v>

11
00:00:56.151 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 2>light and in some sense that's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what a tradition does for you.</v>

12
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 2>It because the tradition is precisely </v>
<v Speaker 2>what defines the domain of the light and</v>

13
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 2>to be moral from the perspective of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition.</v>

14
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 2>It's akin to playing a Piagetian game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only adhering to the rules.</v>

15
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 2>You know how Piaget described the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when kids first master a game,</v>

16
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:18.860
<v Speaker 2>they learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they learn how to act it out,</v>

17
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.903
<v Speaker 2>and then they learn what the rules are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they regard the rules in some </v>

18
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:23.354
<v Speaker 2>sense as sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't go outside the rules and then </v>

19
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 2>later in moral development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they get to that stage,</v>

20
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:29.504
<v Speaker 2>then they start to recognize themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>also as formulators of the rule or </v>

21
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:33.884
<v Speaker 2>formulators of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And culture tells you don't go beyond </v>

22
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 2>the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the definition of morality within</v>

23
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Speaker 2>the box of culture and you don't go </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of that.</v>

24
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why move Fossa plays that </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular role and it's wise because if</v>

25
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.524
<v Speaker 2>you go outside the domain of what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>already understand that it's dangerous </v>

26
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:53.390
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly it's dangerous out there.</v>

27
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.260
<v Speaker 2>But the downside of that particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>message,</v>

28
00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:01.670
<v Speaker 2>and this is perhaps this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological reason why move Fossa isn't</v>

29
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 2>as aware as he could be of scar.</v>

30
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.363
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his knowledge is bounded and he's not </v>

31
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:09.320
<v Speaker 2>aware enough of what lies outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

32
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>In this realm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

33
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 2>of death and destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

34
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scar is,</v>

35
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 2>he is able to overcome his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

36
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother,</v>

37
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.273
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see this sort of thing happening to </v>

38
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 2>people very frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

39
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:23.864
<v Speaker 2>who develop posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder and one of the things that's </v>

40
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 2>not as well known about posttraumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress disorder as might be known as a,</v>

41
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.893
<v Speaker 2>it happens to you if you encounter an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that sort of blows out the </v>

42
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:38.630
<v Speaker 2>axioms of your knowledge system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's one way of looking at it.</v>

43
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:39.464
<v Speaker 2>It's so unexpected that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>account for it within the confines of </v>

44
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:44.684
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the system that you're using to </v>

45
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:46.424
<v Speaker 2>interpret the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not often happens to people when they </v>

46
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:49.394
<v Speaker 2>encounter something that's truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolent and that can be within them </v>

47
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.660
<v Speaker 2>or it can be in the form of someone else</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is genuinely out to hurt them.</v>

48
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.493
<v Speaker 2>They're often people who develop ptsd </v>
<v Speaker 2>often but not always somewhat naive and </v>

49
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>they're are not aware of the full </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe of the world.</v>

50
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:08.524
<v Speaker 2>That might be one way of looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they encounter someone who's </v>

51
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 2>truly out to hurt them and they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>detect that even in the way the person's</v>

52
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.364
<v Speaker 2>face looks or they encounter a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that's much more malevolent than </v>

53
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 2>they had ever imagined it could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

54
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.043
<v Speaker 2>And then they do something terrible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they don't know what to do about </v>

55
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

56
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Dell or the Canadian general wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book called shake hands with the devil.</v>

57
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.573
<v Speaker 2>And it was about what happened to him in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rwanda when he was stationed there as a </v>

58
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 2>UN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a warrior or a UN soldier.</v>

59
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.463
<v Speaker 2>And I mean dillera was not naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what he encountered was truly </v>

60
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.810
<v Speaker 2>malevolent and it just blew them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces and,</v>

61
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 2>and that that's what happens.</v>

62
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 2>And so there's real utility in staying </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the bounded domain.</v>

63
00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.983
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there may be information that's </v>

64
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 2>outside of that domain that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely need to know.</v>

65
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.293
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the problem with being </v>
<v Speaker 2>alive is that you have to continually </v>

66
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.703
<v Speaker 2>determine how much you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain your stability and how much </v>

67
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:12.784
<v Speaker 2>you're going to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to explore because the </v>

68
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 2>stable part of you gets outdated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you explore it too much or too,</v>

69
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to unwisely,</v>

70
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 2>then you could encounter things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>flip you upside down.</v>

71
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It's actually one of the problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>being high in trade.</v>

72
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:28.894
<v Speaker 2>Openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're also high in </v>

73
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're open,</v>

74
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.330
<v Speaker 2>you're creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always looking for,</v>

75
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 2>for ideas that are outside of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>current systematic way of thinking.</v>

76
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.163
<v Speaker 2>But if you're high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you experienced a lot of anxiety and </v>

77
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 2>emotional pain and that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can continually upset your own apple</v>

78
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:44.854
<v Speaker 2>cart.</v>

79
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.813
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that you might want to </v>

80
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:47.434
<v Speaker 2>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really useful as far as I'm </v>

81
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.804
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you might want to think about this </v>

82
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 2>politically and we've been doing a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of work.</v>

83
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.093
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have one of my graduate </v>
<v Speaker 2>students actually come and talk to you </v>

84
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:56.314
<v Speaker 2>about the work we'd be doing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality and Paul and political </v>

85
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens with political belief is</v>

86
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 2>that if you're high in openness and low </v>
<v Speaker 2>in conscientiousness,</v>

87
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:04.684
<v Speaker 2>you tend to be a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The openness being the particularly </v>

88
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:07.504
<v Speaker 2>important part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're low in openness and high </v>

89
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 2>in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially orderliness,</v>

90
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.843
<v Speaker 2>you tend to be a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's kind of strange because </v>

91
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 2>openness and conscientiousness aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>very highly correlated,</v>

92
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.933
<v Speaker 2>so it's not obvious why those two traits</v>
<v Speaker 2>would combine to determine political </v>

93
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.033
<v Speaker 2>belief and and the relationship is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually quite strong between </v>

94
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:26.914
<v Speaker 2>temperament and political belief if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure political belief </v>

95
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.224
<v Speaker 2>comprehensively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that the fundamental </v>

96
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 2>distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the political game,</v>

97
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 2>at least along the liberal conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>access is boils down to one thing.</v>

98
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.123
<v Speaker 2>It boils down to how open borders should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be compared to how close they should be </v>

99
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.610
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that reflected,</v>

100
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:46.444
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the attractiveness of trump to a </v>

101
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 2>large part of the general population </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's going to close the borders,</v>

102
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:53.284
<v Speaker 2>build a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fortify the borders and </v>

103
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 2>conservatives like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like to have borders between things</v>

104
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:00.044
<v Speaker 2>stay tight and they don't even care if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's state borders or political borders </v>

105
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 2>or town borders or ethnic borders or </v>
<v Speaker 2>borders between ideas or borders between</v>

106
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:09.494
<v Speaker 2>sexual identities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives like to have things stay </v>

107
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:12.974
<v Speaker 2>in the damn box where they belong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because they're orderly and </v>

108
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 2>partly because they're low in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get any real.</v>

109
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 2>They're not interested in what happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you free up your conceptions.</v>

110
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 2>All they see in that is the probability </v>
<v Speaker 2>of disorder.</v>

111
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.953
<v Speaker 2>Whereas liberals who are high in </v>
<v Speaker 2>openness and low in conscientiousness </v>

112
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.823
<v Speaker 2>slash orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get a real charge out of letting </v>

113
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 2>things out of the box so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatively interplay.</v>

114
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.213
<v Speaker 2>Now the issue is who's correct and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer is you don't know because the </v>

115
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:42.614
<v Speaker 2>environment underneath the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape moves and so sometimes the </v>

116
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:46.784
<v Speaker 2>right answer is tightened up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The borders and fortify and sometimes </v>

117
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:50.440
<v Speaker 2>the right answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

118
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.283
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loosen things up because everything's </v>

119
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.743
<v Speaker 2>getting too static and tight and we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>more information and the dialogue that </v>

120
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 2>occurs in the political landscape with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why dialogue is so important,</v>

121
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.133
<v Speaker 2>is fundamentally between these two </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposing views of borders and because </v>

122
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 2>you can't say with certainty which one </v>
<v Speaker 2>is right at any given time,</v>

123
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:11.623
<v Speaker 2>an open dialogue has to maintain itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that the entire political state can </v>

124
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 2>maneuver properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Along that moving line,</v>

125
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

126
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.433
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really useful to know that people vote </v>

127
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:26.740
<v Speaker 2>their damn temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets you.</v>

128
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 2>It gives you more of an understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in principle of your,</v>

129
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.643
<v Speaker 2>of those who sit on the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on the political fence and there's </v>

130
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 2>been recent newspaper articles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite interesting.</v>

131
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted a couple of them about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>company in UK called Cambridge analytics</v>

132
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.283
<v Speaker 2>and they're using the damn big five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can extract out big five </v>

133
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:45.644
<v Speaker 2>information from your facebook likes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got a model of every single </v>

134
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 2>person in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big five personality,</v>

135
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.143
<v Speaker 2>and they helped trump craft political </v>
<v Speaker 2>messages right down to the level of </v>

136
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:57.434
<v Speaker 2>apartment buildings to appeal to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on their big five temperament and </v>

137
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:02.474
<v Speaker 2>that's all recent work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that's very </v>

138
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:05.624
<v Speaker 2>interesting is we are teaching computers</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand us so fast you can't </v>

139
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:09.464
<v Speaker 2>believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we really do risk walking into an </v>

140
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 2>electronic world where you will only see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want to see.</v>

141
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously the marketers are trying to do</v>

142
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 2>that as fast as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

143
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 2>They only want to send you ads that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be interested in because</v>

144
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:23.894
<v Speaker 2>it's expensive and foolish to send you </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that will annoy you or that </v>

145
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 2>you'll ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the marketers are trying like mad</v>

146
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 2>to map who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even by watching your eyes there.</v>

147
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:34.763
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to figure out who you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they can send you the right </v>

148
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the danger is that that'll happen.</v>

149
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Say in the domain of news and broader </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

150
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.193
<v Speaker 2>increasing this tendency for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be siloed in their exposure to the </v>

151
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:45.614
<v Speaker 2>external world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big sort of like each of us is </v>

152
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:53.081
<v Speaker 2>becoming a micro celebrity surrounded by</v>
<v Speaker 2>electronic sycophants who do nothing but</v>

153
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>tell us exactly what we want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real</v>

154
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.670
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Karl Popper,</v>

155
00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:58.504
<v Speaker 3>a famous philosopher of science said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that one of the things that you should </v>

156
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is akin to the jetty and view,</v>

157
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.553
<v Speaker 3>is you should always look for </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that contradicts your </v>

158
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 3>current viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

159
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 3>that's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

160
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Because who wants their axioms?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Contradicted.</v>

161
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.203
<v Speaker 3>It can take you apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the only way that you can </v>

162
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:15.384
<v Speaker 3>ensure that you're learning at the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>time that you're maintaining your </v>

163
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:18.774
<v Speaker 3>stability and that's another reason why </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really necessary to engage in </v>

164
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:22.494
<v Speaker 3>dialogue with people that you do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with because they're the ones who </v>

165
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 3>will tell you things that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

166
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.193
<v Speaker 3>It's crew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's of crucial importance in the </v>

167
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:30.204
<v Speaker 3>maintenance of your own stability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst thing that can happen to a </v>

168
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

169
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 3>because there's many horrible things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can happen to a person,</v>

170
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:37.044
<v Speaker 3>but one of the worst things that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen is that you find yourself in a </v>

171
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:39.984
<v Speaker 3>situation where no one is offering you </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrective feedback anymore because you </v>

172
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 3>rely on the corrective feedback provided</v>
<v Speaker 3>by other people to keep yourself sane,</v>

173
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:50.640
<v Speaker 3>to keep moving in the ever changing </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

174
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Speaker 3>And if you cut yourself off from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>feedback,</v>

175
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 3>then well then you end up static and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shrinking.</v>

176
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really not good.</v>

177
00:09:59.101 --> 00:09:59.934
<v Speaker 3>You get less and less competent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get less and less confident and the </v>

178
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 3>threats outside of you loom larger and </v>
<v Speaker 3>larger.</v>

179
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.880
<v Speaker 3>So that's all to do with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

180
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the domain outside the light.</v>

181
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.580
<v Speaker 3>So young would also say that out in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>domain,</v>

182
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.743
<v Speaker 3>that sort of beyond what you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's also where you encounter the </v>

183
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 3>archetypes of the collective </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious.</v>

184
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a really,</v>

185
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:22.494
<v Speaker 3>really complicated idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what he means by that is that if </v>

186
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:28.320
<v Speaker 3>you're put outside the domain of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>competence,</v>

187
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 3>you're going to start to use fantasy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>organize your world.</v>

188
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 3>So I can give you an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

189
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.583
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

190
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I presume most of you are old enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a conscious memory of when the twin</v>

191
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:41.034
<v Speaker 3>towers came crashing down and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody in the days after that was </v>

192
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.470
<v Speaker 3>wandering around like they were in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>daze.</v>

193
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 3>And the reason they were in a daze is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

194
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.613
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't exactly clear what fell right </v>

195
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.583
<v Speaker 3>there is the physical towers fell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was only a tiny bit of the </v>

196
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:55.884
<v Speaker 3>problem because those physical towers </v>
<v Speaker 3>were embedded in a network of meaning </v>

197
00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 3>like a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very sophisticated network of meaning,</v>

198
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:02.844
<v Speaker 3>but also a political network and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic network and a military network </v>

199
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.730
<v Speaker 3>and their nodes inside a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

200
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:09.564
<v Speaker 3>And so when they come crashing down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what's come crashing </v>

201
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

202
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:14.304
<v Speaker 3>So when you're out there in the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 3>and wondering what's going on and </v>

203
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:17.424
<v Speaker 3>wandering around in a daze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what happened to </v>

204
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what Bush did,</v>

205
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.190
<v Speaker 3>George W was immediately turned that </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a good versus evil drama instantly.</v>

206
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.383
<v Speaker 3>And that's an archetypal idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's when he came up with the idea </v>

207
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:32.760
<v Speaker 3>of the axis of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was Iran,</v>

208
00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:33.594
<v Speaker 3>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't remember the other one at </v>

209
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:36.594
<v Speaker 3>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

210
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.643
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

211
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.400
<v Speaker 3>he immediately turned the political </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape into a good versus evil drama.</v>

212
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.383
<v Speaker 3>And he said to everyone in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were either with him or </v>

213
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:47.010
<v Speaker 3>against him fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the,</v>

214
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 3>that was part of the retreating into a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess a more protected landscape.</v>

215
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the ways that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with the encounter with a traumatic</v>

216
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:56.974
<v Speaker 3>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the reason you meet the </v>

217
00:11:58.631 --> 00:11:59.464
<v Speaker 3>unconscious and even the collective </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious on the border of your </v>

218
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 3>knowledge is because when you hit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>border of your knowledge,</v>

219
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.843
<v Speaker 3>you start to use fantasy in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring the newest form of order out of </v>

220
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 3>the unknown so that you can start to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sense out of it.</v>

221
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 3>And that's what artists always do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do.</v>

222
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:18.844
<v Speaker 3>And so from the union perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are engaged in creative art </v>

223
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Speaker 3>are the ones who are on the perimeter of</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge structures.</v>

224
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 3>And so what they're doing is taking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute unknown,</v>

225
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.230
<v Speaker 3>which would be in Rumsfeld's terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unknown unknowns,</v>

226
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 3>and turning them into partially known </v>
<v Speaker 3>unknowns.</v>

227
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.123
<v Speaker 3>That's what an artist does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and especially the more classical </v>

228
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 3>artists who deal with mythological and </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious themes,</v>

229
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:42.424
<v Speaker 3>which was the case for art right up </v>
<v Speaker 3>until really until the late 20th </v>

230
00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

231
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.243
<v Speaker 3>they're using these mythological ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of extend the domain of human </v>

232
00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 3>knowledge out beyond its current </v>
<v Speaker 3>parameters.</v>

233
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.140
<v Speaker 3>And so artists do that and literary </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do that and,</v>

234
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 3>and dramatists do that and they help us </v>
<v Speaker 3>extend our knowledge.</v>

235
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:05.920
<v Speaker 3>Now that's where open people live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

236
00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:06.754
<v Speaker 3>So think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're in a city and the city has </v>

237
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:10.354
<v Speaker 3>parts of it that degenerate and so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could think about that as order </v>

238
00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:13.604
<v Speaker 3>degenerating into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the open people who are </v>

239
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:16.804
<v Speaker 3>creative come along and they find places</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the city that have degenerated but </v>

240
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:22.840
<v Speaker 3>that still have interesting potential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

241
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 3>And then they move in there where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheap to.</v>

242
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.163
<v Speaker 3>And they start producing art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start producing galleries and then </v>

243
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:29.404
<v Speaker 3>the coffee shops move in and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing starts to get civilized and then </v>

244
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:36.310
<v Speaker 3>of course the more liberal conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>types move in.</v>

245
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Those would be the Yuppies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking.</v>

246
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:41.560
<v Speaker 3>So they're much more conservative than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the artists,</v>

247
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.530
<v Speaker 3>but they're still liberal compared to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bulk of the population.</v>

248
00:13:44.531 --> 00:13:48.730
<v Speaker 3>And so the more daring people move in </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the artists of civilized it.</v>

249
00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 3>And then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

250
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:51.004
<v Speaker 3>then the chain stores start to move in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and soon it's completely turned into </v>

251
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:54.304
<v Speaker 3>sellers or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the artists have to go </v>

252
00:13:56.771 --> 00:14:00.940
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else and find another place on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boundary where they can live.</v>

253
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.833
<v Speaker 3>And it's a physical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a physical boundary as much as a </v>

254
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:04.840
<v Speaker 3>mental boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you,</v>

255
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.780
<v Speaker 3>because you think each of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality traits,</v>

256
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:08.643
<v Speaker 3>there's five dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of them represent the possibility </v>

257
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:13.360
<v Speaker 3>of inhabiting a kind of niche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

258
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 3>In ecological niche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're an extroverted person,</v>

259
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.640
<v Speaker 3>your niches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social environment,</v>

260
00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 3>if you're an introverted person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the niches,</v>

261
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:21.694
<v Speaker 3>I think nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that for sure because I've </v>

262
00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Speaker 3>never figured out exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>introverts are adapted to,</v>

263
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's not exactly the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're agreeable,</v>

264
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:33.750
<v Speaker 3>then your niche is relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're disagreeable your niches,</v>

265
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.560
<v Speaker 3>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're conscientious,</v>

266
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.450
<v Speaker 3>you're niche niches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>duty and effort,</v>

267
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.823
<v Speaker 3>and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>those niches are partly social because </v>

268
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.953
<v Speaker 3>so much of her environment is social,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're also partly natural because </v>

269
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.920
<v Speaker 3>our social being is nested inside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural world and so you can think about</v>

270
00:14:50.921 --> 00:14:51.754
<v Speaker 3>the big five traits as different kinds </v>
<v Speaker 3>of adaptations to different kinds of </v>

271
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 3>niches and the niche that the open </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

272
00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.833
<v Speaker 3>the open exploratory types occupy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that seems to make a higher order </v>

273
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:04.634
<v Speaker 3>super factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Extraversion and openness called </v>

274
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 3>plasticity as opposed to stability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is conscientiousness,</v>

275
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:10.604
<v Speaker 3>agreeableness and emotional stability </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a playoff between those two </v>

276
00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:16.850
<v Speaker 3>things because the stable people </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously are stable,</v>

277
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.463
<v Speaker 3>but the plastic types of people are more</v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamic and they're more concerned with </v>

278
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:23.090
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

279
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.620
<v Speaker 3>And in order to get a system optimally </v>
<v Speaker 3>stable and dynamic,</v>

280
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a continual interplay </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those,</v>

281
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 3>of those factors because static doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>work because everything changes.</v>

282
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:34.963
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem with conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with liberalism </v>

283
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything changes,</v>

284
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 3>but you have to bring forward some </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures from the past.</v>

285
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.810
<v Speaker 3>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

286
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to get that balance </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

287
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.910
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

288
00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there in the underworld,</v>

289
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.850
<v Speaker 3>in the place beyond your current </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualizations,</v>

290
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:56.803
<v Speaker 3>that's the place of death and nature and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beyond the light and it's also the </v>

291
00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 3>place of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you see here.</v>

292
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.030
<v Speaker 3>And what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you conceptualize that?</v>

293
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:05.893
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you'll see if you're </v>

294
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:08.414
<v Speaker 3>interested in this sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever go read the writings of the </v>

295
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Columbine killers that the teens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very interesting.</v>

296
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 3>They're very much worth reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>

297
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Dylan Klebold who was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>more literate of of the two,</v>

298
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.580
<v Speaker 3>but he tells you exactly where he went </v>
<v Speaker 3>after brooding and brooding and brooding</v>

299
00:16:25.581 --> 00:16:26.414
<v Speaker 3>on his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his isolation and segregation from </v>

300
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:31.280
<v Speaker 3>mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's out there beyond,</v>

301
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 3>he's out there in a chaotic domain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's tortured by that,</v>

302
00:16:35.001 --> 00:16:37.280
<v Speaker 3>his thoughts taken unbelievably dark </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn,</v>

303
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 3>like it's unimaginably dark if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in that sort of thing.</v>

304
00:16:41.721 --> 00:16:42.554
<v Speaker 3>You could read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another book you could read </v>

305
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.580
<v Speaker 3>called Pans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ram p a and zed r a m,</v>

306
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.080
<v Speaker 3>and it's a fascinating book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about this guy who I think he raped</v>

307
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.003
<v Speaker 3>1200 men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that sort of tells you what sort of </v>

308
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:54.824
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was extraordinarily physically </v>

309
00:16:55.911 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 3>powerful and brutal and malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was kind of a juvenile delinquent</v>

310
00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:01.664
<v Speaker 3>type and they put them in a reform </v>
<v Speaker 3>school and he was not well treated in </v>

311
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:05.690
<v Speaker 3>that reform school.</v>

312
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:08.720
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of like the worst of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadian residential schools.</v>

313
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.020
<v Speaker 3>And when he came out he was not a happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>boy.</v>

314
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.513
<v Speaker 3>And so he spent the rest of his life </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to be as destructive as he could </v>

315
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 3>possibly imagine and purely consciously </v>
<v Speaker 3>with malevolent intent.</v>

316
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.660
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

317
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.920
<v Speaker 3>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was pretty destructive.</v>

318
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:27.080
<v Speaker 3>He kept track of the dollar value of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the buildings.</v>

319
00:17:27.081 --> 00:17:27.914
<v Speaker 3>He burned down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tried to start a war between Britain </v>

320
00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:33.180
<v Speaker 3>and the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an all out for all out may Hamp,</v>

321
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.690
<v Speaker 3>his dying words that they are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna hang him.</v>

322
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.990
<v Speaker 3>He told the guy who was going to hang </v>
<v Speaker 3>him too.</v>

323
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.850
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurry up you who's your bastard?</v>

324
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:43.640
<v Speaker 3>I could kill 12 men in the time it takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to hang me,</v>

325
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:44.743
<v Speaker 3>and that's exactly the sort of person he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was and he made friends with this </v>

326
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.433
<v Speaker 3>physician in the in the prison who he </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought was the first person who ever </v>

327
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:55.230
<v Speaker 3>did something nice for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave him a dollar for cigarettes,</v>

328
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:56.064
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the physician encouraged him to </v>

329
00:17:57.901 --> 00:17:58.734
<v Speaker 3>write his autobiography and so we did </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's available and so if you want </v>

330
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:03.923
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know you always think of </v>

331
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:06.990
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

332
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:08.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have good intentions.</v>

333
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.850
<v Speaker 3>You know that you especially think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're naive and agreeable,</v>

334
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:12.893
<v Speaker 3>so all of you who are sitting there out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there thinking people have good </v>

335
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:17.340
<v Speaker 3>intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably high in agreeableness,</v>

336
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:18.563
<v Speaker 3>but that's not always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People can have very dark motivations </v>

337
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 3>that are fully conscious and very well </v>
<v Speaker 3>elaborated and pans around was no,</v>

338
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.103
<v Speaker 3>he was smart and his book is very well </v>
<v Speaker 3>written and he tells you exactly why he </v>

339
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:32.934
<v Speaker 3>thought the way he thought and so it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good glimpse of exactly this sort of </v>

340
00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:36.564
<v Speaker 3>thing where you can get to if you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to buy brooding on your specific </v>

341
00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:40.990
<v Speaker 3>misfortune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

342
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:41.893
<v Speaker 3>in his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His basic credo was that human beings </v>

343
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:47.100
<v Speaker 3>were so reprehensible that they should </v>
<v Speaker 3>just be eliminated and believe me,</v>

344
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:51.120
<v Speaker 3>that's what he was trying to do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people who do terrible things like</v>

345
00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:51.954
<v Speaker 3>the columbine shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what for block of a </v>

346
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:58.890
<v Speaker 3>better word they're possessed by it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheer malevolence and the columbine kids</v>

347
00:18:58.891 --> 00:18:59.724
<v Speaker 3>had a much more spectacular catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 3>planned than the one that actually </v>

348
00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 3>occurred and they knew it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a full blown media circus and lots of</v>

349
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:09.900
<v Speaker 3>these people who engage in those sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mass murders.</v>

350
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.950
<v Speaker 3>They know about the other mass murderers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're engaged in a competition and</v>

351
00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:16.770
<v Speaker 3>the competition is who can do the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>brutal thing the fastest.</v>

352
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.633
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't just be thinking about </v>

353
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:23.160
<v Speaker 3>people who've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have good intentions,</v>

354
00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:23.994
<v Speaker 3>but have somehow gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ever meet someone who isn't like </v>

355
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:30.810
<v Speaker 3>that and you think that you're just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree with ripe fruit to be plucked,</v>

356
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.540
<v Speaker 3>so you don't want to be in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

357
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:36.420
<v Speaker 3>You have to keep your eyes open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so anyways,</v>

358
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 3>that's basically what's encapsulated in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this part of the story.</v>

359
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.960
<v Speaker 3>Now the hygienists go after the little </v>
<v Speaker 3>lie and obviously,</v>

360
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:43.794
<v Speaker 3>but they managed to escape it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolent scene and a move fossa shows </v>

361
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:52.170
<v Speaker 3>up at the last minute to rescue them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

362
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 3>and you know that there's also a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological trope there,</v>

363
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:56.604
<v Speaker 3>which is that if you go outside your </v>
<v Speaker 3>domain of competence and you encounter </v>

364
00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:00.444
<v Speaker 3>something you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing that you're going to do </v>

365
00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:06.030
<v Speaker 3>is look to the knowledge structures that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you already possess to explain it.</v>

366
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>

367
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.033
<v Speaker 3>you could say from a symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective that that's the </v>

368
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 3>manifestation of the father because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course that's what you're going to do.</v>

369
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.440
<v Speaker 3>And you know what's really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

370
00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:17.274
<v Speaker 3>is because I've had a lot of clients </v>
<v Speaker 3>who've had ptsd and and without </v>

371
00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:20.874
<v Speaker 3>exception,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single one of them was induced by </v>

372
00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:23.514
<v Speaker 3>one form of malevolence or another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to develop a very </v>

373
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:26.814
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated philosophy of good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil to get out of it because they have </v>

374
00:20:29.971 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 3>a worldview in which those things don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really exist.</v>

375
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:34.410
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as pure </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence.</v>

376
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine unless you encounter it,</v>

377
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.440
<v Speaker 3>and then as soon as you encounter it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you encounter it,</v>

378
00:20:40.441 --> 00:20:44.220
<v Speaker 3>you won't know what to do and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't be able to get on with your life.</v>

379
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.233
<v Speaker 3>You'll do nothing but think about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and think about it and think about it </v>

380
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:48.750
<v Speaker 3>and think about it.</v>

381
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.583
<v Speaker 3>It'll disrupt your sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll put you into a permanent state of </v>

382
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:56.500
<v Speaker 3>preparation for action because the part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your brain that's detected that which</v>

383
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 3>in my estimation by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the same part,</v>

384
00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:02.530
<v Speaker 3>at least in part that detects snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same damn circuit.</v>

385
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.603
<v Speaker 3>Once it's seen something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is not going to let you go until you </v>

386
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:08.770
<v Speaker 3>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's basically what post traumatic</v>

387
00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:11.170
<v Speaker 3>stress disorder is and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to some degree,</v>

388
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.310
<v Speaker 3>each of you will have experienced that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not all of you in here,</v>

389
00:21:15.311 --> 00:21:16.144
<v Speaker 3>but many of you and you can tell that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you go back and you think about </v>

390
00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:23.770
<v Speaker 3>your past and you have any memory that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than about 18 months old,</v>

391
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.753
<v Speaker 3>and when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it produces a fair bit of negative </v>

392
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:29.360
<v Speaker 3>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that's like a.</v>

393
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.730
<v Speaker 3>that's like a place where there's a mini</v>
<v Speaker 3>posttraumatic stress problem.</v>

394
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.340
<v Speaker 3>And what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember I showed you that hierarchy</v>

395
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.540
<v Speaker 3>moving from tiny motor actions all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way up to high order abstractions.</v>

396
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.673
<v Speaker 3>Well you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say you have good personnel at the top </v>

397
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:49.330
<v Speaker 3>and you kind of use that scenario to </v>
<v Speaker 3>construe other people.</v>

398
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.313
<v Speaker 3>People are basically good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then you run into someone who is </v>

399
00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:53.464
<v Speaker 3>not good and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole bloody system comes tumbling </v>

400
00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:58.810
<v Speaker 3>down because it's violated that highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>order axiom.</v>

401
00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:59.813
<v Speaker 3>So that's posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If something has violated an axiom </v>

402
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:05.770
<v Speaker 3>that's more differentiated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

403
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:06.604
<v Speaker 3>closer to the actual motor output,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not quite so high in the abstraction </v>

404
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:09.994
<v Speaker 3>chain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all it does is wipe out that part </v>

405
00:22:11.741 --> 00:22:12.574
<v Speaker 3>of the structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't wipe out the whole thing and </v>

406
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:15.004
<v Speaker 3>you can tell if you have holes in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptual value structure by checking </v>

407
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:21.154
<v Speaker 3>to see if you have memories that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>still alive in a negative way that are </v>

408
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.383
<v Speaker 3>old enough so that they should have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>incorporated into your personality and </v>

409
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:33.391
<v Speaker 3>so one of the things you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing one of the exercises that's</v>

410
00:22:33.421 --> 00:22:34.690
<v Speaker 3>on myself authoring site.</v>

411
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.620
<v Speaker 3>You guys do the personality analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's another program there called</v>

412
00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the past authoring where you</v>

413
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:41.704
<v Speaker 3>write down an autobiography and thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>through these things that have happened </v>

414
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:46.894
<v Speaker 3>to you in your past that are negative is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good way of making them go away and </v>

415
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.673
<v Speaker 3>thinking them through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of means you have to figure out </v>

416
00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 3>what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

417
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 3>And then you sort of have to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to make it not happen again.</v>

418
00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.120
<v Speaker 3>What you're trying to derive is some </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of causal analysis.</v>

419
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.590
<v Speaker 3>How is it that I was put into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation where I was made vulnerable,</v>

420
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:06.783
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that could be well because you're </v>

421
00:23:07.391 --> 00:23:08.224
<v Speaker 3>only four and you couldn't protect </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and now it's time to update </v>

422
00:23:10.331 --> 00:23:11.164
<v Speaker 3>that because you're a fully functioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>adult or there may be things that you </v>

423
00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:18.670
<v Speaker 3>have to think through and change in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>own personality or attitudes that you've</v>

424
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:20.860
<v Speaker 3>been holding onto since you were tiny.</v>

425
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.873
<v Speaker 3>I had this client once and she came in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and told me that she had been sexually </v>

426
00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:27.304
<v Speaker 3>assaulted by her older brother and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>told me the story and I kind of got the </v>

427
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:31.444
<v Speaker 3>impression that maybe she was like eight</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was like 17 or something like </v>

428
00:23:34.241 --> 00:23:35.074
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she was about 27 when she came and </v>

429
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:37.594
<v Speaker 3>talked to me and then I found out by </v>
<v Speaker 3>further questioning that she was four </v>

430
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:41.344
<v Speaker 3>and he was six and I thought she still </v>
<v Speaker 3>had this story in her head of her being </v>

431
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:48.280
<v Speaker 3>tormented by this older person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

432
00:23:48.281 --> 00:23:51.500
<v Speaker 3>That that's how she told the story and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I told her was,</v>

433
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:52.334
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another way of looking at this is that </v>

434
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:57.200
<v Speaker 3>youtube were very badly supervised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Children,</v>

435
00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.060
<v Speaker 3>because I mean he was six for God's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sake,</v>

436
00:23:59.061 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a little kid.</v>

437
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:04.340
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>her was any less traumatic but,</v>

438
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't 17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

439
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.100
<v Speaker 3>The story was different than the one she</v>
<v Speaker 3>had in her head and you know,</v>

440
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 3>by the time she left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after we had that conversation,</v>

441
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.520
<v Speaker 3>it was clear that the way that she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>considering the experience had radically</v>

442
00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:17.354
<v Speaker 3>shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's very interesting because you </v>

443
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.470
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think of the past as fixed but,</v>

444
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.713
<v Speaker 3>and it is in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason you remember the past </v>

445
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:28.700
<v Speaker 3>isn't to make an objectively accurate </v>
<v Speaker 3>record of the past.</v>

446
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:29.983
<v Speaker 3>It's so that you can use the information</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the past to prepare you for the </v>

447
00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:37.100
<v Speaker 3>future and your mind won't leave you </v>
<v Speaker 3>alone unless that has happened.</v>

448
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:37.934
<v Speaker 3>So if you've encountered something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's negative and you don't know why </v>

449
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 3>and you don't know what to do about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that happens again in the future,</v>

450
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:45.613
<v Speaker 3>then that will stay with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the things that does </v>

451
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:49.004
<v Speaker 3>too is it increases your overall </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiological load is actually </v>

452
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:53.870
<v Speaker 3>physiologists who'd been talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

453
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.393
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the damn phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could imagine that your mind is </v>

454
00:24:58.011 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 3>doing something like this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

455
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.330
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

456
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.203
<v Speaker 3>it's got a record in some sense of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>autobiographical experiences and what </v>

457
00:25:06.381 --> 00:25:07.214
<v Speaker 3>it's doing is calculating how frequently</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been successful versus </v>

458
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:13.310
<v Speaker 3>unsuccessful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the more frequently that you've been</v>

459
00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:14.144
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the higher you are up on the dominance </v>

460
00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:18.110
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one possibility.</v>

461
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.480
<v Speaker 3>So your serotonin levels go up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're calmer,</v>

462
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.040
<v Speaker 3>but also it's reasonable to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment is less dangerous,</v>

463
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.903
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's sort of what constitutes </v>

464
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.573
<v Speaker 3>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're somewhere in react and something </v>

465
00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:33.710
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to have happen happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's danger.</v>

466
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.903
<v Speaker 3>And so your brain is always trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to calibrate how anxious </v>

467
00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:38.144
<v Speaker 3>you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that does is by </v>

468
00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:43.280
<v Speaker 3>sort of keeping track of your past </v>
<v Speaker 3>success failure ratio.</v>

469
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.410
<v Speaker 3>And so to the degree that your past has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been characterized by,</v>

470
00:25:48.411 --> 00:25:49.460
<v Speaker 3>we'll call them failures.</v>

471
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Those are situations where you do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>get what you want.</v>

472
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.623
<v Speaker 3>Then your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain puts your body on constant </v>

473
00:25:56.301 --> 00:26:00.590
<v Speaker 3>alert because if everything that you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>done has resulted in catastrophe,</v>

474
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:01.663
<v Speaker 3>then you're somewhere insanely dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you should be like like a like a </v>

475
00:26:05.361 --> 00:26:06.194
<v Speaker 3>prey animal that's ready to dark in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction and how much you should be a </v>

476
00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:13.190
<v Speaker 3>prey and I'm always dependent on it's an</v>
<v Speaker 3>estimate,</v>

477
00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:14.840
<v Speaker 3>partly your trait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism,</v>

478
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:16.603
<v Speaker 3>partly your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your success as adjudicated by other </v>

479
00:26:18.681 --> 00:26:19.790
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

480
00:26:19.791 --> 00:26:20.624
<v Speaker 3>Because they'll talk pop you up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy if you've been </v>

481
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:23.534
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also partly on your record of </v>

482
00:26:25.371 --> 00:26:26.204
<v Speaker 3>failures and successes in the past and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can go back and you can find out </v>

483
00:26:29.871 --> 00:26:30.704
<v Speaker 3>where you have holes in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the structure through which you're </v>

484
00:26:33.411 --> 00:26:34.244
<v Speaker 3>viewing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of looking at it and you </v>

485
00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:38.430
<v Speaker 3>can sell those things up and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

486
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.303
<v Speaker 3>That's in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're doing in </v>

487
00:26:40.281 --> 00:26:41.500
<v Speaker 3>psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

488
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:45.570
<v Speaker 3>partly it's exposure to things you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid of and disgusted by it are likely</v>

489
00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:47.430
<v Speaker 3>to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge chunk of it,</v>

490
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 3>but if you go back into your past and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you start talking those things through,</v>

491
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:54.510
<v Speaker 3>it's really the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more abstracted,</v>

492
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.250
<v Speaker 3>so Freud of course was always when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing his sprit association,</v>

493
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.880
<v Speaker 3>a process with his clients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd find that if he just let them talk,</v>

494
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.903
<v Speaker 3>that their speech would circle until it </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit a place like that where they were </v>

495
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:10.494
<v Speaker 3>confused and doubtful and then their </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech would sort of wander around that </v>

496
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.513
<v Speaker 3>and and then they'd have an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression that was a consequence of </v>

497
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:17.754
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought the emotional expression was </v>

498
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:21.900
<v Speaker 3>what was curative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was cathartic in his terms,</v>

499
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.033
<v Speaker 3>but later James Pennebaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>upon whom these writing exercises I </v>

500
00:27:26.271 --> 00:27:29.850
<v Speaker 3>described,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his research is based on that.</v>

501
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.090
<v Speaker 3>My re,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my exercises are based on his research.</v>

502
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.380
<v Speaker 3>He found that if you brought college </v>
<v Speaker 3>students into the to the lab and you had</v>

503
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:40.740
<v Speaker 3>them write for 15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three times over three days,</v>

504
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.980
<v Speaker 3>about the worst thing that had ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to them or the worst thing they</v>

505
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:45.660
<v Speaker 3>ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I remember correctly,</v>

506
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.870
<v Speaker 3>they got worse in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but better in the long run.</v>

507
00:27:48.871 --> 00:27:49.704
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and visited the doctor less and </v>

508
00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:52.494
<v Speaker 3>markers of their physical health </v>
<v Speaker 3>improved and so I think the reason for </v>

509
00:27:55.861 --> 00:27:58.470
<v Speaker 3>that is because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that called?</v>

510
00:27:58.471 --> 00:28:00.990
<v Speaker 3>It's called something load.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just devoted.</v>

511
00:28:00.991 --> 00:28:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Got It right from the physiologists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

512
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.353
<v Speaker 3>They got healthier as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they basically calmed down once </v>

513
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:11.364
<v Speaker 3>they had gone through the negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>memory and sorted it out properly and </v>

514
00:28:14.161 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 3>told a properly articulated story and </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out how to deal with it.</v>

515
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Then their physiology calmed down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

516
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:23.603
<v Speaker 3>and so then they weren't as stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't producing as much cortisol </v>

517
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.210
<v Speaker 3>and so cortisol suppresses your immune </v>
<v Speaker 3>function and so they were more likely to</v>

518
00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:31.044
<v Speaker 3>stay healthy and so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's all very much we're thinking </v>

519
00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:36.174
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all in the domain outside of the </v>

520
00:28:37.321 --> 00:28:38.970
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

521
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.223
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

522
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Simba and his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's the girl's name?</v>

523
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.053
<v Speaker 3>Milo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

524
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.043
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty cowed about what has </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened because they sort of stumbled </v>

525
00:28:49.051 --> 00:28:49.884
<v Speaker 3>stupidly out into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stumbled foolishly out into the </v>

526
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:57.180
<v Speaker 3>unknown and this actually highlights </v>
<v Speaker 3>another young Ian archetype,</v>

527
00:28:57.181 --> 00:28:58.014
<v Speaker 3>and that's the archetype of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trickster and the trickster is like the </v>

528
00:29:00.451 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 3>joker in the king's court and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trickster is someone who will be or play</v>

529
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:07.350
<v Speaker 3>the fool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about the fool is that the</v>

530
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:08.184
<v Speaker 3>full is close to the truth because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't learn anything new unless you're </v>

531
00:29:10.861 --> 00:29:12.900
<v Speaker 3>willing to be a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

532
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.870
<v Speaker 3>You know what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

533
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.730
<v Speaker 3>you know exactly what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your you have to master a new skill,</v>

534
00:29:17.731 --> 00:29:18.564
<v Speaker 3>but you're avoiding it because you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you'll be bad at it when you first </v>

535
00:29:21.331 --> 00:29:23.160
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you're perfectionistic,</v>

536
00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:23.994
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

537
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I cannot allow myself to be bad at </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

538
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 3>I can't allow myself to be a fool and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder,</v>

539
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.380
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is is when you try </v>
<v Speaker 3>something new,</v>

540
00:29:31.381 --> 00:29:32.214
<v Speaker 3>you're always a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so unless you're willing to be a </v>

541
00:29:34.351 --> 00:29:36.090
<v Speaker 3>fool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't learn anything new,</v>

542
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.043
<v Speaker 3>and that's also why you regard the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trickster as the precursor to the </v>

543
00:29:39.331 --> 00:29:40.164
<v Speaker 3>savior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Archetypically speaking is because you </v>

544
00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:42.784
<v Speaker 3>cannot do the right thing unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to be a fool first and that's </v>

545
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:48.760
<v Speaker 3>really worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of times you,</v>

546
00:29:48.761 --> 00:29:51.670
<v Speaker 3>you guys are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a stage transition in your life and</v>

547
00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:54.760
<v Speaker 3>you're going to feel like an imposter </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get a new job or when you get a</v>

548
00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:55.594
<v Speaker 3>promotion or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to feel like an imposter </v>

549
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 3>and you are because what do you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you make that first transition,</v>

550
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.433
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's gonna make you embarrassed and </v>

551
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna make you ashamed and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things,</v>

552
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 3>but you have to understand that you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fool when you first try something new,</v>

553
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 3>but you're a worst fool if you don't try</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and that doesn't mean you should make</v>

554
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:16.930
<v Speaker 3>like you know everything.</v>

555
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:20.200
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you're promoted or or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have some transition in status,</v>

556
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.410
<v Speaker 3>that's foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have the wrong sort.</v>

557
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:24.663
<v Speaker 3>But to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know that you have to be fallible in </v>

558
00:30:28.361 --> 00:30:30.790
<v Speaker 3>order to progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an unbelievably useful thing.</v>

559
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:32.580
<v Speaker 3>It can free you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

560
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:37.210
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a writer the other day </v>
<v Speaker 3>about his process for beginning writing.</v>

561
00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:39.670
<v Speaker 3>He's written many books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He writes a very,</v>

562
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:41.590
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very bad first draft.</v>

563
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:43.383
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a good way to think about </v>

564
00:30:44.081 --> 00:30:44.914
<v Speaker 3>things is throughout your life you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be doing that is writing the </v>

565
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 3>next draft of you and it's pretty bad to</v>
<v Speaker 3>begin with,</v>

566
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.233
<v Speaker 3>but that's okay because it isn't going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get any better unless you put </v>

567
00:30:54.911 --> 00:30:57.430
<v Speaker 3>yourself out into the domain of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unknown to begin with.</v>

568
00:30:57.431 --> 00:30:58.264
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might,</v>

569
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.190
<v Speaker 3>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might go badly.</v>

570
00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:01.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what happens here.</v>

571
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.213
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mythos that has a chat with Simba and </v>

572
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 3>tells them that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did what he wasn't supposed to do.</v>

573
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

574
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.613
<v Speaker 3>even in that situation with FAA says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline is paradoxical because </v>

575
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 3>there's part of him because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonably.</v>

576
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Why's that knows that breaking the rules</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that is actually necessary.</v>

577
00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Even though you still have to say play </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the damn rules,</v>

578
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to leave that door open so that</v>

579
00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:33.220
<v Speaker 3>the rules can be broken and appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount.</v>

580
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.940
<v Speaker 3>So he forgives him and pieces made </v>
<v Speaker 3>between them and then</v>

581
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.793
<v Speaker 3>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they involve themselves in sort of </v>

582
00:31:41.321 --> 00:31:42.154
<v Speaker 3>gazing at the night sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the two of them do that together </v>

583
00:31:44.681 --> 00:31:46.480
<v Speaker 3>and the night skies and interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

584
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:47.314
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's where the absolute </v>

585
00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:49.294
<v Speaker 3>unknown resides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you wrote a lot about </v>

586
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.740
<v Speaker 3>was astrology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strangely enough slash astronomy and one</v>

587
00:31:56.741 --> 00:31:58.240
<v Speaker 3>of young's contentions.</v>

588
00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.073
<v Speaker 3>This is a very interesting one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that because of the night sky was </v>

589
00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:02.464
<v Speaker 3>completely unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People could project their fantasies </v>

590
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:07.840
<v Speaker 3>into it and that's what they did with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with astrology.</v>

591
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 3>So astrology is this cumulative fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going on in that roughly speaking</v>

592
00:32:12.941 --> 00:32:16.030
<v Speaker 3>in the deep unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>projected onto the sky.</v>

593
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.510
<v Speaker 3>And so if you analyze old astrological </v>
<v Speaker 3>writings,</v>

594
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:22.300
<v Speaker 3>what you're really doing is analyzing </v>
<v Speaker 3>old fantasies.</v>

595
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:23.283
<v Speaker 3>And because of that you could develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>some insight into the structure of the </v>

596
00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:26.014
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he did the same thing with </v>

597
00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 3>alchemy in his later writings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are very,</v>

598
00:32:30.131 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but extremely worthwhile.</v>

599
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

600
00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:36.790
<v Speaker 3>back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the hellish domain.</v>

601
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Now I told you that that domain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's of knowledge,</v>

602
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:40.724
<v Speaker 3>you could think about that as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underworld or you can think about it as </v>

603
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:43.214
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the negative element of nature in </v>

604
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:45.194
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I mentioned that one element of </v>

605
00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:48.134
<v Speaker 3>that is hellish and that's exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the movie explains next does exactly </v>

606
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:52.460
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

607
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:57.460
<v Speaker 3>We go back out to this domain that scar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the adversary or the negative king.</v>

608
00:32:57.581 --> 00:32:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Now that's another way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

609
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 3>This is his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

610
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:05.540
<v Speaker 3>the domain over which he rules and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see them.</v>

611
00:33:05.871 --> 00:33:06.704
<v Speaker 3>They're surrounded in fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same idea as the hyenas surrounded by </v>

612
00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:12.560
<v Speaker 3>fire earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this green fire and smoke,</v>

613
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:13.394
<v Speaker 3>which I think is even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where the movie starts to </v>

614
00:33:17.001 --> 00:33:17.834
<v Speaker 3>draw on essentially Nazi symbolism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least the symbolism of totalitarian </v>

615
00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 3>states and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about,</v>

616
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.933
<v Speaker 3>you think about a totalitarian state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about the Nazis and their </v>

617
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:28.964
<v Speaker 3>goosestepping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's happening is that every single </v>

618
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.250
<v Speaker 3>person in the military becomes an </v>
<v Speaker 3>identical unit,</v>

619
00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:35.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A unit.</v>

620
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.863
<v Speaker 3>They're all uniform and they're all in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sense imitating the the dictator </v>

621
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:41.114
<v Speaker 3>and in an absolutely perfect way and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dictator wants to impose strict </v>

622
00:33:45.321 --> 00:33:50.321
<v Speaker 3>uniformity on the entire population </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's order order and one of the things</v>

623
00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:54.080
<v Speaker 3>we've discovered that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting is that</v>

624
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.533
<v Speaker 3>disgust sensitivity is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>orderliness and that's associated with </v>

625
00:34:00.741 --> 00:34:01.574
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Hitler was that he was very </v>

626
00:34:03.981 --> 00:34:08.020
<v Speaker 3>disgust sensitive and a lot of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>hatred for non Ariens,</v>

627
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 3>so imagine inside the area and box.</v>

628
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.663
<v Speaker 3>It was all uniform outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all parasites and predators and </v>

629
00:34:13.731 --> 00:34:16.310
<v Speaker 3>so and that was a manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>disgust,</v>

630
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.680
<v Speaker 3>not a fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole different thing.</v>

631
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.600
<v Speaker 3>And if you read Hitler's table talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a collection of his spontaneous</v>

632
00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:27.530
<v Speaker 3>dinner speeches from 1939 to 1942.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very interesting book.</v>

633
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.633
<v Speaker 3>You see that his metaphor for the area </v>
<v Speaker 3>and race was a body of pure body on </v>

634
00:34:34.191 --> 00:34:35.024
<v Speaker 3>assaulted by parasites are predators and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was trying to erect a border </v>

635
00:34:38.631 --> 00:34:39.464
<v Speaker 3>around it to keep all of that away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's an immunological discussed like </v>

636
00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:43.814
<v Speaker 3>metaphor and there's some recent work </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was published in Plos one about </v>

637
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:47.954
<v Speaker 3>three years ago showing that brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 3>study should have got much more </v>

638
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:52.094
<v Speaker 3>attention showing that if you went </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and sampled political attitudes </v>

639
00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:58.640
<v Speaker 3>in different countries or even within </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same country,</v>

640
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.440
<v Speaker 3>what you found was that the higher the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevalence of infectious diseases,</v>

641
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.143
<v Speaker 3>the higher the probability of </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian political attitudes at the </v>

642
00:35:07.671 --> 00:35:08.504
<v Speaker 3>local level.</v>

643
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.673
<v Speaker 3>And you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what happens if there's infectious </v>

644
00:35:11.661 --> 00:35:13.820
<v Speaker 3>diseases is you want to put borders </v>
<v Speaker 3>around everything.</v>

645
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:14.923
<v Speaker 3>You don't want free movement between </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas or people because that's partly </v>

646
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:18.344
<v Speaker 3>how the disease spreads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have much more strict </v>

647
00:35:21.201 --> 00:35:23.540
<v Speaker 3>sexual rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

648
00:35:23.541 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 3>because that's a great way for diseases </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be transmitted.</v>

649
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.020
<v Speaker 3>And before Hitler went on his rampage </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the non Ariens,</v>

650
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:30.973
<v Speaker 3>he'd cleaned up all the factories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he went in there and fumigated </v>

651
00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:34.694
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was part of the law and he went on a </v>

652
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.970
<v Speaker 3>public health campaign to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tuberculosis.</v>

653
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:41.070
<v Speaker 3>And he got rid of the bugs in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>factories as well.</v>

654
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 3>He used Zyklon B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an insecticide,</v>

655
00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 3>and now it's the gas that he used in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gas chambers eventually.</v>

656
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:48.264
<v Speaker 3>So first it was the bugs and the rats </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that it was people who were that it </v>

657
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:52.134
<v Speaker 3>was euthanasia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the next move and forest you </v>

658
00:35:54.631 --> 00:35:58.590
<v Speaker 3>euthanasia and the rationale for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was compassion,</v>

659
00:35:58.591 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so you all know,</v>

660
00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:01.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

661
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.513
<v Speaker 3>it's merciful to put these people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are burdened some to themselves and </v>

662
00:36:06.451 --> 00:36:10.200
<v Speaker 3>their families around the state who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>living second grade lives.</v>

663
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:14.550
<v Speaker 3>It's merciful to euthanize them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was a huge campaign in Germany.</v>

664
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:17.340
<v Speaker 3>It was after that that the more racial</v>

665
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:23.150
<v Speaker 3>purifications began,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's the disgusting.</v>

666
00:36:23.151 --> 00:36:25.520
<v Speaker 3>That's unbelievably important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

667
00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.373
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because lots of times people think </v>

668
00:36:28.611 --> 00:36:29.444
<v Speaker 3>that conservatives are more anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive than liberals and that's why </v>

669
00:36:31.971 --> 00:36:35.300
<v Speaker 3>they're closed in terms of their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't look right.</v>

670
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.193
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives are less neurotic than </v>

671
00:36:37.491 --> 00:36:39.260
<v Speaker 3>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although the effect isn't that big,</v>

672
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.540
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't look and they actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

673
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.060
<v Speaker 3>They score higher in measures of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing.</v>

674
00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.240
<v Speaker 3>The most unhappy people are liberal men </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

675
00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.373
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

676
00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:50.643
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are often accused if they're </v>

677
00:36:51.821 --> 00:36:52.654
<v Speaker 3>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being fearful and that's why they </v>

678
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.280
<v Speaker 3>suppress other people's viewpoints,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't look right.</v>

679
00:36:57.281 --> 00:37:01.300
<v Speaker 3>It's low openness and high orderliness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that looks like it's associated with</v>

680
00:37:01.301 --> 00:37:02.134
<v Speaker 3>disgust and that looks like it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with something called the </v>

681
00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:05.764
<v Speaker 3>extended immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the proclivity of people to to </v>

682
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.500
<v Speaker 3>keep themselves away from potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>sources of contamination.</v>

683
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.753
<v Speaker 3>It's really terrifying because one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things people often said about </v>

684
00:37:15.101 --> 00:37:15.934
<v Speaker 3>Germany was that it was a very civilized</v>
<v Speaker 3>country and yet it descended into </v>

685
00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:20.704
<v Speaker 3>barbarity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conscientiousness is a very good </v>

686
00:37:23.141 --> 00:37:26.500
<v Speaker 3>predictor of long term success and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say,</v>

687
00:37:26.501 --> 00:37:29.920
<v Speaker 3>well conscientious societies are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilized,</v>

688
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:33.400
<v Speaker 3>but they're also more orderly and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes them more disgust sensitive.</v>

689
00:37:33.401 --> 00:37:34.234
<v Speaker 3>And so what it might have easily might </v>
<v Speaker 3>have easily been in Germany was that it </v>

690
00:37:37.211 --> 00:37:38.044
<v Speaker 3>was an excess of civilization rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than its lack that produced exactly </v>

691
00:37:41.801 --> 00:37:44.980
<v Speaker 3>these consequences and that's a far more</v>
<v Speaker 3>frightening proposition.</v>

692
00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.590
<v Speaker 3>And one that's I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more likely to be true.</v>

693
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Hitler based four times a day and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>also an admirer of willpower so he could</v>

694
00:37:52.961 --> 00:37:55.360
<v Speaker 3>stand like this for eight hours in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>back of a car,</v>

695
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.433
<v Speaker 3>and the thing about conscientious people</v>
<v Speaker 3>is they're very willpower oriented and </v>

696
00:37:59.921 --> 00:38:04.540
<v Speaker 3>so if you're unfortunate enough to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>sick chronically in the house of someone</v>

697
00:38:04.541 --> 00:38:07.060
<v Speaker 3>who's conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's a mental illness,</v>

698
00:38:07.061 --> 00:38:07.894
<v Speaker 3>you're more likely to relapse because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the conscientious person is going to be </v>

699
00:38:10.961 --> 00:38:12.520
<v Speaker 3>judgmental and they're going to say to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

700
00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.930
<v Speaker 3>if your schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna say,</v>

701
00:38:13.931 --> 00:38:15.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just organize yourself and get up</v>

702
00:38:15.851 --> 00:38:19.180
<v Speaker 3>in the morning and try a little harder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could overcome this,</v>

703
00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.193
<v Speaker 3>which is of course true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except you can't because you're </v>

704
00:38:22.181 --> 00:38:23.014
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenic and so the pressure put on</v>
<v Speaker 3>you by the anger and the contempt is </v>

705
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.750
<v Speaker 3>going to increase the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll relapse.</v>

706
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.950
<v Speaker 3>So orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are very judgmental and you know,</v>

707
00:38:32.951 --> 00:38:33.784
<v Speaker 3>orderliness is a very highly with things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like anorexia and the anorexic is </v>

708
00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:38.914
<v Speaker 3>basically someone who's so disgust </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive that they become unable to </v>

709
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:42.964
<v Speaker 3>tolerate their own body and they see it </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a source of corruption and </v>

710
00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:48.850
<v Speaker 3>imperfection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course is exactly right.</v>

711
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:53.500
<v Speaker 3>It is and it's very difficult thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain order around.</v>

712
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:54.963
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what happens out here in this </v>

713
00:38:57.581 --> 00:38:58.414
<v Speaker 3>terrible domain where scar rules is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing's turned into a totalitarian </v>

714
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:02.890
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

715
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:04.690
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's presented here as,</v>

716
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 3>as a Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like leader and see.</v>

717
00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:10.900
<v Speaker 3>There's another thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting to see even deeper than this</v>

718
00:39:10.901 --> 00:39:14.470
<v Speaker 3>from a mythological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I can even go into it.</v>

719
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>

720
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.200
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I'll have to do is satisfy </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself with this observation.</v>

721
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.950
<v Speaker 3>There's always been some antagonism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

722
00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:27.930
<v Speaker 3>between the Catholic Church and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationalism and everyone knows that it's</v>

723
00:39:27.931 --> 00:39:28.764
<v Speaker 3>a very long standing antagonism that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of runs its way through at least </v>

724
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:37.741
<v Speaker 3>the last thousand years or so of Western</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization and the people who regarded</v>

725
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:39.243
<v Speaker 3>Catholics as antithetical to science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take the Catholics to task for that in </v>

726
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:47.620
<v Speaker 3>describing it as prejudicial and super </v>
<v Speaker 3>superstitious and fair enough,</v>

727
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 3>but there's something else going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that's more important.</v>

728
00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.380
<v Speaker 3>And that's the observation and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a deep level,</v>

729
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:57.700
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the observation that rationality has one</v>

730
00:39:57.701 --> 00:39:59.770
<v Speaker 3>big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

731
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 3>it can easily become arrogant and </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in.</v>

732
00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:02.764
<v Speaker 3>It's own theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you're smart and you're going to </v>

733
00:40:05.521 --> 00:40:07.090
<v Speaker 3>be some of you people who are like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

734
00:40:07.091 --> 00:40:08.920
<v Speaker 3>some of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your primary,</v>

735
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.053
<v Speaker 3>the primary trait that distinguished you</v>
<v Speaker 3>from other people over the course of </v>

736
00:40:12.461 --> 00:40:13.294
<v Speaker 3>your whole life was that you are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent than most and you may have </v>

737
00:40:16.121 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 3>staked your identity on that and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>overvalue intelligence and rationality,</v>

738
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:21.754
<v Speaker 3>and the problem with that is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a theory of the world and then you </v>

739
00:40:24.581 --> 00:40:27.280
<v Speaker 3>tend to assume that it's 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

740
00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:28.323
<v Speaker 3>That's the tendency to fall in love with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own theories and that's what a </v>

741
00:40:30.551 --> 00:40:33.280
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The totalitarian says,</v>

742
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.870
<v Speaker 3>here's the Damn theory and it's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>right and you're gonna.</v>

743
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:38.140
<v Speaker 3>Act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

744
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.540
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

745
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:41.643
<v Speaker 3>we've got some special treats in mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you and one of the most terrible </v>

746
00:40:44.831 --> 00:40:45.664
<v Speaker 3>things that I encountered while reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>about totalitarianism and this was even </v>

747
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:49.654
<v Speaker 3>more true of the Soviet Union under it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that the true believers and they </v>

748
00:40:54.881 --> 00:40:55.780
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of them</v>

749
00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:01.090
<v Speaker 3>were in a terrible position because </v>
<v Speaker 3>according to their own doctrine,</v>

750
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.343
<v Speaker 3>they're already involved in the process </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was going to bring utopia to </v>

751
00:41:04.391 --> 00:41:06.790
<v Speaker 3>mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problems had already been solved,</v>

752
00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:09.820
<v Speaker 3>but many of them were still suffering </v>
<v Speaker 3>terribly as individuals,</v>

753
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.820
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a totalitarian believer in</v>
<v Speaker 3>utopia,</v>

754
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.880
<v Speaker 3>your own suffering becomes heretical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

755
00:41:15.881 --> 00:41:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Because your suffering is an indication </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the damn theory isn't correct,</v>

756
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.673
<v Speaker 3>and so then you're in a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>position because you either admit that </v>

757
00:41:22.901 --> 00:41:23.734
<v Speaker 3>the theory isn't correct and fall apart </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that and maybe face terrible </v>

758
00:41:27.191 --> 00:41:28.240
<v Speaker 3>punishment as well.</v>

759
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:33.540
<v Speaker 3>Or you have to separate yourself from </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own suffering and lie about it.</v>

760
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:34.514
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course that's exactly what </v>

761
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:39.650
<v Speaker 3>happened in places like the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 3>where everyone lied about everything all</v>

762
00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:41.330
<v Speaker 3>of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to themselves,</v>

763
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 3>to their family members,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to their friends.</v>

764
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.863
<v Speaker 3>The entire system was completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>permeated by lies and so you get this </v>

765
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:50.234
<v Speaker 3>terrible place that scars the ruler over</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is totalitarian and brutal and </v>

766
00:41:55.761 --> 00:42:00.761
<v Speaker 3>murderous and resentful and deceitful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and arrogant all at the same time and</v>

767
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:08.230
<v Speaker 3>that's brought about so the columbine </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

768
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:09.374
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're justifying their </v>

769
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.420
<v Speaker 3>murderousness and their plans to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 3>up the schools,</v>

770
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.160
<v Speaker 3>they keep making reference to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people had slighted them,</v>

771
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:20.940
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

772
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.180
<v Speaker 3>and insulted them and that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>alienated.</v>

773
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.730
<v Speaker 3>They weren't bullied exactly the way the</v>
<v Speaker 3>press made it out.</v>

774
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:26.683
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they were bullied </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore than people usually are in high </v>

775
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:29.234
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they took their alienation </v>

776
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:32.623
<v Speaker 3>personally and regarded that their </v>
<v Speaker 3>isolation from common humanity as </v>

777
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:39.590
<v Speaker 3>indication of the pathology of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

778
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:40.933
<v Speaker 3>and then they went out to destroy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what this sort of thing </v>

779
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:44.804
<v Speaker 3>represents.</v>

780
00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:45.683
<v Speaker 3>Now it's the uniformity and you see he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got this kind of vicious grin on his </v>

781
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:53.480
<v Speaker 3>face which is malicious and pleased all </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time.</v>

782
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.450
<v Speaker 3>There is no fear in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite quite the opposite</v>

783
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.760
<v Speaker 3>and there's another image of using </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's essentially imagery of hell,</v>

784
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.190
<v Speaker 3>which everyone understands strangely </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

785
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.810
<v Speaker 3>and that associates him with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crescent moon.</v>

786
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.630
<v Speaker 3>The crescent moon is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

787
00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 3>it's a symbol of darkness and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underworld fundamentally.</v>

788
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.460
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

789
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:17.240
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's we see the underworld,</v>

790
00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:18.074
<v Speaker 3>we see that which lies beyond the light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in there we see a fragment of that </v>

791
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:24.410
<v Speaker 3>that's basically hellish and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's incorporated into the story.</v>

792
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:28.040
<v Speaker 3>And everyone understands that when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>see it even without,</v>

793
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.590
<v Speaker 3>I would say the overt references to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazi-ism okay,</v>

794
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:31.424
<v Speaker 3>so now scar has a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to kill the king and he's </v>

795
00:43:35.241 --> 00:43:39.890
<v Speaker 3>going to do that by putting what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>king loves in danger.</v>

796
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:42.043
<v Speaker 3>Scar feigning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sympathy has enticed Simba down into </v>

797
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:51.461
<v Speaker 3>this ravine and scars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Minions are going to cause a willdabeast</v>

798
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:53.210
<v Speaker 3>stampede,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

799
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:56.520
<v Speaker 3>So a mindless stampede to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

800
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put,</v>

801
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.670
<v Speaker 3>to put him in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what happens here.</v>

802
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.600
<v Speaker 3>The old buddies start to march into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ravine and everyone is making a scar,</v>

803
00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:14.261
<v Speaker 3>tells Mufasa that Simba is down in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ravine and entices them down there.</v>

804
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:15.403
<v Speaker 3>And so they're all off running to see if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can save Simba and then you see </v>

805
00:44:21.621 --> 00:44:23.450
<v Speaker 3>mythos of running in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>willdabeast,</v>

806
00:44:23.451 --> 00:44:24.284
<v Speaker 3>heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to,</v>

807
00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.720
<v Speaker 3>trying to find a son and and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay ahead of them.</v>

808
00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 3>The mad mob that's put his son in </v>
<v Speaker 3>danger.</v>

809
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 3>And so he tries to escape climbing up </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Butte,</v>

810
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 3>which is almost a sheer cliff and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets to the top,</v>

811
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.073
<v Speaker 3>his brother is waiting for him there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he asks him to pull them up and scar </v>

812
00:44:44.881 --> 00:44:45.714
<v Speaker 3>basically before he kills them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>indicates that he's betraying him and </v>

813
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:54.810
<v Speaker 3>puts his claws into move us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pause and throws them off the cliff.</v>

814
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:57.780
<v Speaker 3>And so that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a sad part of the story.</v>

815
00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:58.683
<v Speaker 3>It's a part that's very hard on kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the father has died and you </v>

816
00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:04.650
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a rare kid who won't cry about that</v>

817
00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:09.420
<v Speaker 3>scene in particular where you see Simba </v>
<v Speaker 3>very upset and his father dying.</v>

818
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:13.090
<v Speaker 3>Now this is a hard part of the story to </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpret and the.</v>

819
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:13.943
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's because of my lack </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ability to interpreter because the </v>

820
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:18.580
<v Speaker 3>story takes a weird twist here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there,</v>

821
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.493
<v Speaker 3>there is this confusion in the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>about whether symbols and innocent </v>

822
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:28.080
<v Speaker 3>victim who set up for the murder of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>father or whether he actually bears some</v>

823
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 3>guilt for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

824
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:32.610
<v Speaker 3>and he's broken some rules and that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>

825
00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:36.150
<v Speaker 3>So he's not exactly placed in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>position of innocence,</v>

826
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.450
<v Speaker 3>but of course he's also been set up by </v>
<v Speaker 3>scar in any case,</v>

827
00:45:39.451 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Speaker 3>scar tells him that it's his fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pure and pure,</v>

828
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.760
<v Speaker 3>and that because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to have to leave.</v>

829
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.520
<v Speaker 3>He's going to have to be banished beyond</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kingdom.</v>

830
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.413
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

831
00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:54.123
<v Speaker 3>you see this motif quite quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently and hero stories where the </v>

832
00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.330
<v Speaker 3>hero has to be raised outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kingdom.</v>

833
00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:04.120
<v Speaker 3>That happens with King Arthur for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

834
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.313
<v Speaker 3>and it happens with Harry Potter because</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harry Potter is raised by muggles </v>

835
00:46:08.531 --> 00:46:10.900
<v Speaker 3>instead of being inside the magic </v>
<v Speaker 3>kingdom.</v>

836
00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:11.973
<v Speaker 3>So it's a very common theme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And partly what it means is that it </v>

837
00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:15.604
<v Speaker 3>means two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is that you do grow up alienated </v>

838
00:46:18.131 --> 00:46:18.964
<v Speaker 3>from your culture to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way around that because the </v>

839
00:46:21.791 --> 00:46:25.810
<v Speaker 3>culture doesn't match you perfectly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work for you perfectly.</v>

840
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.823
<v Speaker 3>And it's old and it's kind of corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it alienates you as it's shaping </v>

841
00:46:29.981 --> 00:46:30.814
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you're going to develop some </v>

842
00:46:31.781 --> 00:46:32.614
<v Speaker 3>separation from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see that in intergenerational </v>

843
00:46:36.071 --> 00:46:36.881
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

844
00:46:36.881 --> 00:46:37.714
<v Speaker 3>where the new generation has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proclivity to blame the previous </v>

845
00:46:39.671 --> 00:46:42.790
<v Speaker 3>generation for everything that's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the current system.</v>

846
00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 3>And Fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

847
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.290
<v Speaker 3>because you do inherit everything that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

848
00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:49.690
<v Speaker 3>Of course you also inherit everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going well,</v>

849
00:46:49.691 --> 00:46:50.524
<v Speaker 3>which is a good thing to also notice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is that you can't help but </v>

850
00:46:54.701 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 3>be alienated from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's call it the patriarchy for,</v>

851
00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.093
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a tyrannical element and because </v>

852
00:47:02.501 --> 00:47:04.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not matched well to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

853
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:08.410
<v Speaker 3>but then there's also this other issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

854
00:47:08.411 --> 00:47:12.160
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're not being successful by the</v>

855
00:47:12.161 --> 00:47:16.090
<v Speaker 3>terms that are by the values that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantiated in the current system.</v>

856
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:17.561
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

857
00:47:17.561 --> 00:47:21.400
<v Speaker 3>that's because the system is set up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>an unfair manner and fair enough,</v>

858
00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.533
<v Speaker 3>but it's also possibly because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just not very good at acting out those </v>

859
00:47:25.181 --> 00:47:26.500
<v Speaker 3>values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

860
00:47:26.501 --> 00:47:27.334
<v Speaker 3>So part of the reason you get alienated </v>
<v Speaker 3>from your culture is because culture is </v>

861
00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:30.490
<v Speaker 3>corrupt,</v>

862
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:34.060
<v Speaker 2>but another part of the reason is you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not doing as well as you could be.</v>

863
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:35.163
<v Speaker 2>You're not playing by the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even your own rules properly and so you </v>

864
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:42.190
<v Speaker 2>get alienated and you're unsuccessful </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of your own inadequacies.</v>

865
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Speaker 2>And so the movie plays both of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously Simba is set up,</v>

866
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.440
<v Speaker 2>but there is an intimation that he's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely blameless as well.</v>

867
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:52.083
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very broken up about this and no </v>

868
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:54.874
<v Speaker 2>wonder it's also partly a story of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergence of adolescence because you </v>

869
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:00.184
<v Speaker 2>know when you're a child and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>ensconced right inside the familial </v>

870
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:04.024
<v Speaker 2>framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you sort of exist within that </v>

871
00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:09.280
<v Speaker 2>system of rules like you would under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>psg Eddie and scheme,</v>

872
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.353
<v Speaker 2>but when you become an adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's much more of a proclivity </v>

873
00:48:13.661 --> 00:48:14.494
<v Speaker 2>to break free and to start breaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and so that's also a canyon in </v>

874
00:48:18.131 --> 00:48:23.131
<v Speaker 2>some sense to the death of the father </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a necessary developmental stage.</v>

875
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scar comes down into the ravine.</v>

876
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:28.263
<v Speaker 2>It's all foggy now because that goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>along with sort of murkiness of death </v>

877
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:36.450
<v Speaker 2>and tells Simba that it's his fault and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's going to have to leave.</v>

878
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:39.910
<v Speaker 2>He's going to have to leave the kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his father,</v>

879
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.770
<v Speaker 2>which makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now his father is dead.</v>

880
00:48:41.771 --> 00:48:44.470
<v Speaker 2>So how are you gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once your father has died,</v>

881
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:47.650
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to stay around in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom so to speak?</v>

882
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.143
<v Speaker 2>So and then scar tries to get these </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyenas to go track him down and kill </v>

883
00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

884
00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.780
<v Speaker 2>and Zuzu goes back to tell all the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the lions that move.</v>

885
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:01.511
<v Speaker 2>Faa says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>

886
00:49:01.511 --> 00:49:06.511
<v Speaker 2>in that Simba has disappeared and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>scar takes over pride rock.</v>

887
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.633
<v Speaker 2>And so what's happened now is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolent element of the king has </v>

888
00:49:13.511 --> 00:49:16.210
<v Speaker 2>obtained control over the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

889
00:49:16.211 --> 00:49:19.360
<v Speaker 2>And so this is the king.</v>

890
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 2>The wise king wasn't paying enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

891
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:22.743
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the malevolent part of the state </v>

892
00:49:25.271 --> 00:49:27.160
<v Speaker 2>has now got control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very,</v>

893
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:27.994
<v Speaker 2>very old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've traced it back at least several </v>

894
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.570
<v Speaker 2>thousand years in its,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in its representation in stories.</v>

895
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:36.910
<v Speaker 2>You can see it in Egyptian mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

896
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:40.960
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is that as the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure builds and complexity,</v>

897
00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:44.200
<v Speaker 2>it offers you the protection of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning complex system,</v>

898
00:49:44.201 --> 00:49:45.034
<v Speaker 2>but it also becomes increasingly likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>to turn into a tyranny and because it's </v>

899
00:49:49.211 --> 00:49:50.044
<v Speaker 2>more and more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact of its potential for tyranny </v>

900
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:55.180
<v Speaker 2>becomes more and more of a danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the question is,</v>

901
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:56.343
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the factors that encourages it </v>

902
00:49:59.081 --> 00:49:59.914
<v Speaker 2>turning into a tyranny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one factor would be the wisest part </v>

903
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:06.820
<v Speaker 2>of it is not paying enough attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the malevolent part of it.</v>

904
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.193
<v Speaker 2>And you could say that's true at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state level and it's also true at the </v>

905
00:50:10.511 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 2>individual level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

906
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:12.483
<v Speaker 2>You have to watch your own proclivity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset yourself and other people and and </v>

907
00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:20.410
<v Speaker 2>take that into account and pay careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to it because otherwise it can</v>

908
00:50:20.411 --> 00:50:23.260
<v Speaker 2>gain control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because you're going to avoid</v>

909
00:50:23.261 --> 00:50:24.094
<v Speaker 2>looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the characteristics of the </v>

910
00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:28.484
<v Speaker 2>wise king who gets overthrown by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrant is that he has an evil brother </v>

911
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 2>and he won't pay enough attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

912
00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.810
<v Speaker 2>He avoids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't look.</v>

913
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.093
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evil king gets the upper hand and </v>

914
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:42.020
<v Speaker 2>that's what's happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so notice now he takes possession of</v>

915
00:50:42.021 --> 00:50:44.480
<v Speaker 2>pride rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in full daylight,</v>

916
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:45.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at night.</v>

917
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.353
<v Speaker 2>So that ties his rule into the rule of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious processes in and </v>

918
00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.700
<v Speaker 2>malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright?</v>

919
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.440
<v Speaker 2>So Simba runs away from the kingdom out </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the desert.</v>

920
00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Now why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

921
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.180
<v Speaker 2>you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you remember and maybe you don't.</v>

922
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't know what the story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>exodus.</v>

923
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:06.170
<v Speaker 2>When Moses takes the Hebrews out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt,</v>

924
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.600
<v Speaker 2>they end up in a desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

925
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.770
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

926
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:13.910
<v Speaker 2>it's because when you leave a kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how tyrannical,</v>

927
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 2>you still fall into disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a place that's desert.</v>

928
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:20.340
<v Speaker 2>There's no civilization there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

929
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.990
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened to Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After the Americans went in,</v>

930
00:51:23.991 --> 00:51:24.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

931
00:51:24.411 --> 00:51:25.244
<v Speaker 2>the Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neocons were all convinced that the </v>

932
00:51:27.241 --> 00:51:28.074
<v Speaker 2>Iraqis would welcome them with open arms</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there would be this smooth </v>

933
00:51:30.411 --> 00:51:33.140
<v Speaker 2>transition to democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same idea in Libya.</v>

934
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

935
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:35.743
<v Speaker 2>that's not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens is the state devolves into </v>

936
00:51:38.421 --> 00:51:42.140
<v Speaker 2>a desert chaos and maybe then you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make order,</v>

937
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:42.974
<v Speaker 2>but probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Simba has left the kingdom and </v>

938
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:48.950
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that happens is he damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>near dies in the desert.</v>

939
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:50.263
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have an old belief system and </v>

940
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:55.400
<v Speaker 2>it's not working very well and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>abandon it,</v>

941
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.413
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you because you're out of the </v>

942
00:51:57.741 --> 00:51:59.720
<v Speaker 2>old belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you're nowhere.</v>

943
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:02.120
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholics,</v>

944
00:52:02.121 --> 00:52:02.954
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and draw draw other drug addicts as </v>

945
00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:06.620
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that</v>

946
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:10.940
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to stop drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

947
00:52:10.941 --> 00:52:11.774
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you have to undergo some medical </v>

948
00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:14.564
<v Speaker 2>treatment so when you first stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't die of seizures because that </v>

949
00:52:17.511 --> 00:52:19.730
<v Speaker 2>often happens to people who are addicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to alcohol.</v>

950
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.983
<v Speaker 2>So when they get valium or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that from a doctor to see them </v>

951
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:28.310
<v Speaker 2>through the first bits of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

952
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:33.311
<v Speaker 2>A while of sobering up and so they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it and then then maybe two weeks</v>

953
00:52:33.321 --> 00:52:35.780
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not physiologically dependent on</v>

954
00:52:35.781 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 2>alcohol anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing is true of cocaine.</v>

955
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:43.130
<v Speaker 2>But if you take them back and you put </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in their environment,</v>

956
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.080
<v Speaker 2>say they go back out to the treatment </v>
<v Speaker 2>center,</v>

957
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:46.003
<v Speaker 2>back into the normal world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start drinking or using right away </v>

958
00:52:48.651 --> 00:52:50.210
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that,</v>

959
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.373
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you've been an alcoholic for </v>

960
00:52:52.071 --> 00:52:53.600
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

961
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:57.530
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all you do for entertainment.</v>

962
00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:01.610
<v Speaker 2>You drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all your friends are alcoholics,</v>

963
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

964
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:10.110
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to stop drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only do you have to</v>

965
00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.470
<v Speaker 2>rid yourself of the,</v>

966
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.533
<v Speaker 2>of the physiological addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to completely learn a new </v>

967
00:53:21.061 --> 00:53:21.894
<v Speaker 2>way of living because what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to get rid of all your friends </v>

968
00:53:24.691 --> 00:53:27.360
<v Speaker 2>because they're drunks pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if they're not there,</v>

969
00:53:27.361 --> 00:53:29.370
<v Speaker 2>at least people who are facilitating </v>
<v Speaker 2>your drinking.</v>

970
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.350
<v Speaker 2>So you have to build a whole new social </v>
<v Speaker 2>network.</v>

971
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:32.423
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to amuse yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course the way you've done </v>

972
00:53:34.741 --> 00:53:37.050
<v Speaker 2>that is by going to the bar or sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>at home drinking.</v>

973
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.093
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a huge hole in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You abandoned the previous pathological </v>

974
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 2>mode of adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that just leaves you with nothing.</v>

975
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:47.910
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to rebuild that thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

976
00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:48.830
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

977
00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 2>from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's extraordinarily difficult.</v>

978
00:53:51.331 --> 00:53:52.164
<v Speaker 2>And that's why so many people fail when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to overcome a major </v>

979
00:53:54.001 --> 00:53:55.440
<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

980
00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

981
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:02.160
<v Speaker 2>symbols out there in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's left his family and the comforts of</v>

982
00:54:02.161 --> 00:54:07.161
<v Speaker 2>home and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's discovered by these by Puma and who</v>

983
00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 2>a little rats name to tymone yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a mere cat,</v>

984
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:12.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

985
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:13.703
<v Speaker 2>Which are very cool things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they discover them and this is sort </v>

986
00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:19.500
<v Speaker 2>of his transition into adolescence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

987
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 2>he kind of finds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

988
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:22.133
<v Speaker 2>I would say more typical of the male </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition into adolescence because </v>

989
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.690
<v Speaker 2>females of course hit puberty so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger.</v>

990
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:28.763
<v Speaker 2>The males who aren't very attractive </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're young and just starting to </v>

991
00:54:32.611 --> 00:54:35.340
<v Speaker 2>undergo puberty that are very attractive</v>
<v Speaker 2>to females.</v>

992
00:54:35.341 --> 00:54:37.890
<v Speaker 2>They tend to clump together in gangs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

993
00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:38.763
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and manage the transition over what </v>

994
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:43.320
<v Speaker 2>could be seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

995
00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.930
<v Speaker 2>and that's what happens here is Simba </v>
<v Speaker 2>joins this little gang of,</v>

996
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:47.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are all right,</v>

997
00:54:47.791 --> 00:54:48.624
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a little on the primordial side </v>

998
00:54:51.211 --> 00:54:52.680
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

999
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:57.210
<v Speaker 2>one of them is basically just a walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>gastrointestinal tract and the other one</v>

1000
00:54:57.211 --> 00:54:58.290
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not so bad,</v>

1001
00:54:58.291 --> 00:55:00.150
<v Speaker 2>but he's like a foot high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1002
00:55:00.151 --> 00:55:00.810
<v Speaker 2>What good is he?</v>

1003
00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:03.780
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got some second rate companions out</v>

1004
00:55:03.781 --> 00:55:05.640
<v Speaker 2>here past the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he enters,</v>

1005
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.830
<v Speaker 2>he's out of childhood now and now he </v>
<v Speaker 2>enters the adolescent world.</v>

1006
00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.670
<v Speaker 2>What happens here is that very quickly </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the film,</v>

1007
00:55:11.671 --> 00:55:14.730
<v Speaker 2>he goes from being a little cub to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>full full adolescents.</v>

1008
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.133
<v Speaker 2>There's about a five minute transition </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's the next stage in his </v>

1009
00:55:18.511 --> 00:55:21.630
<v Speaker 2>development and now he's out there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this paradise,</v>

1010
00:55:21.631 --> 00:55:23.820
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of strange because </v>
<v Speaker 2>adolescence really is no,</v>

1011
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.823
<v Speaker 2>no picnic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea here is that he really </v>

1012
00:55:26.701 --> 00:55:28.970
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have any responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1013
00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:29.813
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is one thing about adolescence </v>

1014
00:55:31.981 --> 00:55:34.110
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even the stage of life that you guys</v>

1015
00:55:34.111 --> 00:55:34.944
<v Speaker 2>are at is you have lots to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not really responsible for </v>

1016
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:38.574
<v Speaker 2>anyone other than yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even though you might be quite </v>

1017
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:43.380
<v Speaker 2>burdened with your current </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities,</v>

1018
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.023
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing compared to what it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like when you know you have </v>

1019
00:55:47.281 --> 00:55:49.830
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for children for example,</v>

1020
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:52.890
<v Speaker 2>or for the people that are working for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you or or whatever.</v>

1021
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.023
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out here it's a kind of impulsive place </v>

1022
00:55:56.901 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And adolescents is like that.</v>

1023
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:03.690
<v Speaker 2>We've had high school students try to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future authoring program,</v>

1024
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:04.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they have to think three to five </v>

1025
00:56:05.281 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 2>years down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like forget that they just can't do</v>

1026
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've watched them.</v>

1027
00:56:10.261 --> 00:56:11.094
<v Speaker 2>And what happens is you immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>become aware of just how little high </v>

1028
00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:16.110
<v Speaker 2>school students know when they're like </v>
<v Speaker 2>15 or 16,</v>

1029
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.240
<v Speaker 2>three to five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget it.</v>

1030
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.433
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the world knowledge to </v>
<v Speaker 2>project themselves out that far in the </v>

1031
00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:23.070
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even close.</v>

1032
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 2>So we've built a high school version </v>
<v Speaker 2>that helps them design a better future.</v>

1033
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Three to six months down the road and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even that's really pushing it,</v>

1034
00:56:29.951 --> 00:56:30.784
<v Speaker 2>but you know adolescents are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive and they live more for the </v>

1035
00:56:33.251 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 2>moment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some utility anatomy.</v>

1036
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:39.363
<v Speaker 2>Being impulsive and living for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment is one of the things that gets </v>

1037
00:56:41.261 --> 00:56:42.094
<v Speaker 2>you pregnant as a teenager and that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly one way that the species has </v>

1038
00:56:44.921 --> 00:56:45.754
<v Speaker 2>managed to propagate itself and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion and impulsivity are </v>

1039
00:56:50.201 --> 00:56:51.034
<v Speaker 2>very tightly linked and so he's out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in this adolescent delusional </v>

1040
00:56:56.501 --> 00:56:58.720
<v Speaker 2>fantasy that might be one way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it,</v>

1041
00:56:58.721 --> 00:56:59.554
<v Speaker 2>but more important he's out there where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in a domain now where the impulses </v>

1042
00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:04.204
<v Speaker 2>of the moment basically take precedence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so and I think they sing some song </v>

1043
00:57:10.091 --> 00:57:12.890
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1044
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Hakuna Matata,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1045
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Which basically means do whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever you want,</v>

1046
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:19.810
<v Speaker 2>and tomorrow will take care of itself or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1047
00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:23.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's very impulsive and lacks all </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

1048
00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.113
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I would recommend</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you if you want to protect yourself </v>

1049
00:57:27.551 --> 00:57:30.790
<v Speaker 2>from ideological possession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shall we say,</v>

1050
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:31.624
<v Speaker 2>is that when you hear people speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically and they don't say anything </v>

1051
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:35.824
<v Speaker 2>about your responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should probably stop listening to </v>

1052
00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:41.470
<v Speaker 2>them because whenever they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer you something,</v>

1053
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:43.780
<v Speaker 2>if it doesn't come along with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent cost,</v>

1054
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:44.763
<v Speaker 2>there's something being hidden from you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're appealing to the part of </v>

1055
00:57:47.411 --> 00:57:48.244
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would say at best </v>

1056
00:57:49.481 --> 00:57:51.100
<v Speaker 2>adolescent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1057
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

1058
00:57:52.451 --> 00:57:55.390
<v Speaker 2>he's out there in his little adolescent </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradise and,</v>

1059
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:58.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his dopey chums and back at,</v>

1060
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:02.080
<v Speaker 2>at pride rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are not good,</v>

1061
00:58:02.081 --> 00:58:03.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scar,</v>

1062
00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:04.623
<v Speaker 2>who's arrogant and refuses to learn and </v>
<v Speaker 2>who will not establish a reasonable </v>

1063
00:58:10.691 --> 00:58:12.070
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the females.</v>

1064
00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:12.903
<v Speaker 2>All he does is tyrannized over them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ends up ruling over a completely </v>

1065
00:58:16.151 --> 00:58:16.984
<v Speaker 2>barren landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what happens in </v>

1066
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:21.550
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we also know quite interestingly,</v>

1067
00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.713
<v Speaker 2>is that one of the best predictors of </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic development in estate is the </v>

1068
00:58:26.321 --> 00:58:28.420
<v Speaker 2>degree to which they extend rights to </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

1069
00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:31.390
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the best predictors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>

1070
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:32.643
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to tear nine your own </v>

1071
00:58:33.221 --> 00:58:34.870
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to terrorize everything.</v>

1072
00:58:34.871 --> 00:58:35.704
<v Speaker 2>You're going to tear tyrannized ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to tear a nice structures </v>

1073
00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:40.300
<v Speaker 2>like if you have to enslave your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

1074
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:41.803
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've adapted a pretty damn </v>

1075
00:58:43.601 --> 00:58:47.110
<v Speaker 2>pathological view of the world and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability that that narrow,</v>

1076
00:58:47.111 --> 00:58:50.170
<v Speaker 2>constrained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted viewpoint is going to pay off</v>

1077
00:58:50.171 --> 00:58:52.330
<v Speaker 2>for you economically is extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>low.</v>

1078
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.770
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scar.</v>

1079
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like what happened in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union to know.</v>

1080
00:58:55.871 --> 00:58:56.704
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason it collapsed by 1989 </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it just could not move any </v>

1081
00:59:01.481 --> 00:59:02.314
<v Speaker 2>farther.</v>

1082
00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.153
<v Speaker 2>It was like this really complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>motor that was worn completely out that </v>

1083
00:59:06.671 --> 00:59:10.420
<v Speaker 2>no one had ever taken care of and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just ground to a halt.</v>

1084
00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.780
<v Speaker 2>It just stopped working because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it didn't work.</v>

1085
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:19.260
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're a totalitarian and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't update your system and adjusted,</v>

1086
00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:23.960
<v Speaker 2>then it wears out and grinds a halt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything becomes unproductive.</v>

1087
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:25.423
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to figure out what makes </v>

1088
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:29.120
<v Speaker 2>us society productive because you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1089
00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:31.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's natural resources or something like</v>

1090
00:59:31.071 --> 00:59:32.090
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1091
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:33.283
<v Speaker 2>natural resources are very often a curse</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a country because they produce </v>

1092
00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:39.140
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call that the Dutch disease.</v>

1093
00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:41.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can look it up,</v>

1094
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 2>but natural resources in and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves are by no means sufficient to</v>

1095
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:50.510
<v Speaker 2>guarantee the wellbeing of a country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan has virtually no natural resources</v>

1096
00:59:50.511 --> 00:59:51.344
<v Speaker 2>at all and it's really rich and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the prime natural resources actually </v>

1097
00:59:55.671 --> 00:59:56.000
<v Speaker 2>seems.</v>

1098
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is honesty and other is trust and if</v>

1099
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:03.050
<v Speaker 2>you can set up a society where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are roughly honest,</v>

1100
01:00:03.051 --> 01:00:03.884
<v Speaker 2>which means they do what they say </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do and where the </v>

1101
01:00:05.451 --> 01:00:09.980
<v Speaker 2>default bargaining position on both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides is trust,</v>

1102
01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.130
<v Speaker 2>then the probability that that culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>will become wealthy is very,</v>

1103
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:14.540
<v Speaker 2>very high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1104
01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:19.340
<v Speaker 2>and a functional legal system is also a </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural resource of tremendous,</v>

1105
01:00:19.341 --> 01:00:21.050
<v Speaker 2>tremendous value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1106
01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:23.960
<v Speaker 2>it's partly why people in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1107
01:00:23.961 --> 01:00:24.794
<v Speaker 2>wealthy people in China are dumping </v>
<v Speaker 2>their money into the real estate market </v>

1108
01:00:27.181 --> 01:00:28.014
<v Speaker 2>in North America like mad because one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things you do know if you buy real </v>

1109
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:33.350
<v Speaker 2>estate in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you actually own it,</v>

1110
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:36.140
<v Speaker 2>it's still going to be years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years in the future,</v>

1111
01:00:36.141 --> 01:00:38.720
<v Speaker 2>30 years in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1112
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:42.710
<v Speaker 2>And so that fact of ownership is </v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded in the functioning legal system</v>

1113
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.950
<v Speaker 2>and that's what gives those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>properties crazy value,</v>

1114
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:52.180
<v Speaker 2>much too much to the problematic </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation for all of you people who are.</v>

1115
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.253
<v Speaker 2>At some point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of you are going to try to buy </v>

1116
01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:58.040
<v Speaker 2>property in Toronto and that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be entertaining.</v>

1117
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.340
<v Speaker 2>So now look the the other thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>scars,</v>

1118
01:01:01.341 --> 01:01:03.770
<v Speaker 2>he's got the little Burg locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1119
01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:05.270
<v Speaker 2>That's the vision of the king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1120
01:01:05.271 --> 01:01:07.430
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't want to know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He already knows everything.</v>

1121
01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.613
<v Speaker 2>So why does he need this stupid bird </v>
<v Speaker 2>flying around telling them what's going </v>

1122
01:01:10.791 --> 01:01:11.624
<v Speaker 2>on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last thing he wants to know is </v>

1123
01:01:12.741 --> 01:01:16.640
<v Speaker 2>what's going on a stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1124
01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:17.953
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gave that guy bad news or good news </v>

1125
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.593
<v Speaker 2>he was going to have you killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kept the bad news to a minimum and </v>

1126
01:01:24.111 --> 01:01:25.250
<v Speaker 2>that's a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1127
01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Because if you torture people who bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>you bad news,</v>

1128
01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:30.710
<v Speaker 2>then you're never going to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything while you don't have to,</v>

1129
01:01:30.711 --> 01:01:34.070
<v Speaker 2>if you already knew everything anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the situation here.</v>

1130
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his little minions,</v>

1131
01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.850
<v Speaker 2>the hyenas are getting pretty unhappy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they haven't had anything to eat</v>

1132
01:01:40.851 --> 01:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is they've just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stripped the landscape bear,</v>

1133
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.793
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1134
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:47.083
<v Speaker 2>I read at the demise of the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 2>that something like 10 to 15 percent of </v>

1135
01:01:50.691 --> 01:01:51.524
<v Speaker 2>the entire land mass of the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 2>had been rendered permanently </v>

1136
01:01:54.561 --> 01:01:58.690
<v Speaker 2>uninhabitable by industrial pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1137
01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:01.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember if that included </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chernobyl,</v>

1138
01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.260
<v Speaker 2>where that terrible nuclear accident </v>
<v Speaker 2>took place,</v>

1139
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:04.094
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were massive domains of </v>

1140
01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:10.760
<v Speaker 2>devastation and in those countries that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will take hundreds of years to fix.</v>

1141
01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.820
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when scar rules,</v>

1142
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.983
<v Speaker 2>everyone starves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of thinking about it </v>

1143
01:02:16.791 --> 01:02:17.624
<v Speaker 2>or everyone dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay because that's really </v>

1144
01:02:18.771 --> 01:02:21.420
<v Speaker 2>what he's after anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that works out quite nicely.</v>

1145
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back out here in paradise.</v>

1146
01:02:23.551 --> 01:02:24.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at him.</v>

1147
01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:25.044
<v Speaker 2>How pathetic can you get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the expression on that </v>

1148
01:02:27.031 --> 01:02:28.560
<v Speaker 2>creature's face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1149
01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:29.710
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's self's,</v>

1150
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.833
<v Speaker 2>he's sated like someone who's just eat a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gallon of ice cream and he's got this </v>

1151
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:38.930
<v Speaker 2>pathetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>self satisfied,</v>

1152
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.860
<v Speaker 2>naive,</v>

1153
01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.493
<v Speaker 2>clueless unconscious grin on his face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the animators did a very nice job </v>

1154
01:02:45.831 --> 01:02:48.620
<v Speaker 2>of capturing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's a complicated expression and</v>

1155
01:02:48.621 --> 01:02:51.740
<v Speaker 2>you just want to slap them and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what should happen.</v>

1156
01:02:51.741 --> 01:02:54.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1157
01:02:54.201 --> 01:02:56.360
<v Speaker 2>he's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be an unconscious Dingbat.</v>

1158
01:02:56.361 --> 01:02:57.194
<v Speaker 2>Well his society is degenerating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bloody well we're thinking about </v>

1159
01:03:00.441 --> 01:03:02.390
<v Speaker 2>because that's an archetypal trope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1160
01:03:02.391 --> 01:03:05.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like things are sinking around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

1161
01:03:05.601 --> 01:03:07.340
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1162
01:03:07.341 --> 01:03:11.540
<v Speaker 2>are you just staying in kind of a blithe</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconsciousness because you can get your</v>

1163
01:03:11.541 --> 01:03:12.374
<v Speaker 2>next meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to wake up and do </v>

1164
01:03:13.161 --> 01:03:14.600
<v Speaker 2>something about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1165
01:03:14.601 --> 01:03:18.800
<v Speaker 2>that's the call of the self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we go back to two Rafiki here and</v>

1166
01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.460
<v Speaker 2>he knows what's going on in the kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a symbol of the self.</v>

1167
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:25.670
<v Speaker 2>And he also has some inkling that Simba </v>
<v Speaker 2>is still alive,</v>

1168
01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:30.020
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the son of the king is still alive,</v>

1169
01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:31.790
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1170
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:35.990
<v Speaker 2>the land has become ruled by a tyrant </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sun is absent.</v>

1171
01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:36.913
<v Speaker 2>He still around somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in a union from the union </v>

1172
01:03:39.651 --> 01:03:43.850
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't much distinction between the</v>

1173
01:03:43.851 --> 01:03:44.684
<v Speaker 2>self and the and the and the child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The self is the sum total of all </v>

1174
01:03:48.411 --> 01:03:51.350
<v Speaker 2>possibility and the child is possibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

1175
01:03:51.351 --> 01:03:52.184
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's say you've become an </v>

1176
01:03:54.351 --> 01:03:55.850
<v Speaker 2>adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all cynical,</v>

1177
01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.313
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everything's falling apart around </v>

1178
01:03:58.461 --> 01:03:59.294
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the typical state of human </v>

1179
01:04:01.431 --> 01:04:02.091
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1180
01:04:02.091 --> 01:04:02.924
<v Speaker 2>Because adolescents are cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking and everything's </v>

1181
01:04:05.001 --> 01:04:05.834
<v Speaker 2>falling around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>falling apart around them generally </v>

1182
01:04:07.491 --> 01:04:08.324
<v Speaker 2>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what do you have to do in order </v>

1183
01:04:10.371 --> 01:04:12.590
<v Speaker 2>to do something about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1184
01:04:12.591 --> 01:04:16.130
<v Speaker 2>one is you have to be drawn by the call </v>
<v Speaker 2>of wisdom.</v>

1185
01:04:16.131 --> 01:04:19.310
<v Speaker 2>And the other part is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rediscover that part of yourself.</v>

1186
01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.353
<v Speaker 2>That's a child like part that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the sun and associated </v>

1187
01:04:24.051 --> 01:04:24.884
<v Speaker 2>with that early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early exposure of similar to the </v>

1188
01:04:26.871 --> 01:04:27.050
<v Speaker 2>sun.</v>

1189
01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:27.883
<v Speaker 2>You have to find that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then trust that some child like </v>

1190
01:04:31.551 --> 01:04:32.384
<v Speaker 2>exploration and a bit of manifestation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of faith might get you to the next </v>

1191
01:04:35.391 --> 01:04:37.670
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what's happening here with</v>

1192
01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.460
<v Speaker 2>the little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1193
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:41.600
<v Speaker 2>the baboons in the tree and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the drawing.</v>

1194
01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.553
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows that Sim was alive now and so </v>

1195
01:04:44.691 --> 01:04:47.420
<v Speaker 2>he goes off to find them and meanwhile </v>
<v Speaker 2>sinbad,</v>

1196
01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:50.360
<v Speaker 2>his dopey companions are out hunting for</v>
<v Speaker 2>bugs,</v>

1197
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's a lion,</v>

1198
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:53.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't eat bugs for crying out </v>

1199
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:57.890
<v Speaker 2>loud but they are easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you see the scene where Puma goes</v>

1200
01:04:57.891 --> 01:05:01.970
<v Speaker 2>after this bug and then another lion </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows up and chases him.</v>

1201
01:05:01.971 --> 01:05:03.830
<v Speaker 2>So she's going to kill them and eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1202
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:05.203
<v Speaker 2>And See.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting thing because one </v>

1203
01:05:08.511 --> 01:05:12.080
<v Speaker 2>of the things that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose you could think about this,</v>

1204
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:13.603
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happens in late </v>
<v Speaker 2>adolescence is that the formation of </v>

1205
01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:18.243
<v Speaker 2>gangs is often broken up by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proclivity of one or more members of </v>

1206
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 2>that gang to get involved in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual romantic relationship.</v>

1207
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.823
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that the female lion is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the carnivore female is the carnivore </v>

1208
01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 2>that will devour the group is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1209
01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:36.573
<v Speaker 2>And so what a girl will do often if </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's in a relationship with somebody </v>

1210
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:43.343
<v Speaker 2>like a young man or an older adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is she'll try to separate him from his </v>

1211
01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:48.100
<v Speaker 2>dopey friends and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no wonder,</v>

1212
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:49.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't she do that?</v>

1213
01:05:49.421 --> 01:05:50.254
<v Speaker 2>Because he does have top friends and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be better for him if he could get </v>

1214
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 2>beyond them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>

1215
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:56.223
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty freaked out about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then Simba goes out and has a </v>

1216
01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:00.214
<v Speaker 2>fight with this lion to protect his </v>
<v Speaker 2>dopey chums and I'm sure you don't need </v>

1217
01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:04.564
<v Speaker 2>any explanation about what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have this huge fight and Nalla </v>

1218
01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.653
<v Speaker 2>who it turns out to be Pinza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that goes back to the beginning </v>

1219
01:06:13.961 --> 01:06:16.000
<v Speaker 2>of the story where when he first </v>
<v Speaker 2>encountered her,</v>

1220
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 2>she pinned them all the time.</v>

1221
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.750
<v Speaker 2>She's an anima figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1222
01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:23.140
<v Speaker 2>And now what she does immediately is </v>
<v Speaker 2>shame him.</v>

1223
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:25.630
<v Speaker 2>So he's an figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in part,</v>

1224
01:06:25.631 --> 01:06:28.480
<v Speaker 2>she's an anima figure in part because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she actually does shame him,</v>

1225
01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:29.853
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's the gateway to higher </v>

1226
01:06:31.211 --> 01:06:33.790
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she makes him self conscious and rightly</v>

1227
01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:35.890
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also a.</v>

1228
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:36.903
<v Speaker 2>she's also a psychological figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he imagined that when a young </v>

1229
01:06:39.401 --> 01:06:42.280
<v Speaker 2>man is establishing a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a young woman and he's,</v>

1230
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.250
<v Speaker 2>he's enamored of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's falling in love,</v>

1231
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 2>he projects an ideal onto her and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal is going to be partially fulfilled</v>

1232
01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:52.810
<v Speaker 2>by the relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the degree to which is unspecified,</v>

1233
01:06:52.811 --> 01:06:53.644
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes it'll collapse completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he projects an ideal onto her </v>

1234
01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.450
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise you wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted to her.</v>

1235
01:06:58.451 --> 01:06:59.284
<v Speaker 2>And then the ideal judges him and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes them feel all self conscious </v>

1236
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:04.483
<v Speaker 2>and useless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is useful because he is useless </v>

1237
01:07:07.001 --> 01:07:08.110
<v Speaker 2>and should feel that way.</v>

1238
01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.840
<v Speaker 2>And so it's part of the impetus to </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up.</v>

1239
01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:13.930
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course one of the</v>

1240
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:16.413
<v Speaker 2>you need necessity in order to mature </v>
<v Speaker 2>you because to mature is to take on </v>

1241
01:07:19.121 --> 01:07:22.660
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel that impetus unless</v>

1242
01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:26.990
<v Speaker 2>adopting the responsibility has some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of payoff.</v>

1243
01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:30.860
<v Speaker 2>And women tend to mate across and up </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy.</v>

1244
01:07:30.861 --> 01:07:32.980
<v Speaker 2>So they tend to actually like men who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are useful.</v>

1245
01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:36.040
<v Speaker 2>And so if they encounter a man who isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>used full at all,</v>

1246
01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.220
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what's going to happen.</v>

1247
01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:42.730
<v Speaker 2>They're going to not be happy about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the least.</v>

1248
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:45.820
<v Speaker 2>And so no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the reason for that,</v>

1249
01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.780
<v Speaker 2>it's economic antibiological reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason is,</v>

1250
01:07:48.781 --> 01:07:53.500
<v Speaker 2>is that women are in the position of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to take care of infants primarily</v>

1251
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:55.443
<v Speaker 2>and an infant has a very heavy load and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so even a woman who's extraordinarily </v>

1252
01:07:58.601 --> 01:07:59.434
<v Speaker 2>competent is going to find herself </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantially limited in her </v>

1253
01:08:02.231 --> 01:08:04.450
<v Speaker 2>possibilities if she has an infant.</v>

1254
01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.613
<v Speaker 2>And so then she's looking around for </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who will pick up part of the </v>

1255
01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:09.820
<v Speaker 2>load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's perfectly reasonable and you're not</v>

1256
01:08:09.821 --> 01:08:11.980
<v Speaker 2>going to pick up part of the load if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're completely useless.</v>

1257
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:13.023
<v Speaker 2>And so it's in the woman's best interest</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to have two children roughly </v>

1258
01:08:17.931 --> 01:08:19.550
<v Speaker 2>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1259
01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:20.384
<v Speaker 2>she pins him and then he's all resentful</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it immediately because she's </v>

1260
01:08:23.661 --> 01:08:24.494
<v Speaker 2>calling him on his stupid friends and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he's out there </v>

1261
01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:29.660
<v Speaker 2>gallivanting impulsively in paradise </v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's real problems to be solved.</v>

1262
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:33.170
<v Speaker 2>And so look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's all resentful and useless and,</v>

1263
01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:37.310
<v Speaker 2>and feeling put upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And picked upon and you just got to slap</v>

1264
01:08:37.311 --> 01:08:38.310
<v Speaker 2>him again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally.</v>

1265
01:08:38.311 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>And she's just completely stunned by </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1266
01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:41.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tells them,</v>

1267
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:46.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the Sim by use to know right now</v>

1268
01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:48.950
<v Speaker 2>he's a little doubtful about the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation there.</v>

1269
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:50.683
<v Speaker 2>The animators do a very nice job of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the movie because one of the </v>

1270
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:56.090
<v Speaker 2>things you see is that his eyebrows are </v>
<v Speaker 2>always pointing up in the middle.</v>

1271
01:08:56.690 --> 01:08:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Whereas his father's eyebrows were </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing down in the middle.</v>

1272
01:08:59.091 --> 01:09:00.770
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1273
01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:01.813
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of like things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening to me and this which is more </v>

1274
01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:08.240
<v Speaker 2>like I'm imposing my will on things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an immature face.</v>

1275
01:09:08.241 --> 01:09:09.074
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the automators captured that </v>

1276
01:09:10.161 --> 01:09:13.400
<v Speaker 2>brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's where she shames him again.</v>

1277
01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:16.270
<v Speaker 2>She tells him how much he liked him when</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was little and,</v>

1278
01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:17.163
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a potential king and how hurt she is </v>

1279
01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:23.690
<v Speaker 2>that he's this useless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wide-eyed,</v>

1280
01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.400
<v Speaker 2>naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive,</v>

1281
01:09:25.401 --> 01:09:27.770
<v Speaker 2>pleasure seeking adolescent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1282
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:32.930
<v Speaker 2>she tells him that she missed him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows why.</v>

1283
01:09:32.931 --> 01:09:33.764
<v Speaker 2>Because look at them again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like completely appalling pauling </v>

1284
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:42.791
<v Speaker 2>creature and this is when Puma and sing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that song about the fact that you know,</v>

1285
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:49.150
<v Speaker 2>their friends doomed because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl's got him and then they switch</v>

1286
01:09:49.581 --> 01:09:54.050
<v Speaker 2>into another archetipal scene and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're falling in love here and so that</v>

1287
01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.310
<v Speaker 2>paradise imagery is really highlighted </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the movie and so they go off and have</v>

1288
01:09:58.311 --> 01:09:59.144
<v Speaker 2>this like romp self reflective romp </v>
<v Speaker 2>through this new paradise and they </v>

1289
01:10:05.151 --> 01:10:10.151
<v Speaker 2>wrestle around and play and then he pins</v>
<v Speaker 2>her more or less than she licks them.</v>

1290
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:15.650
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not so good.</v>

1291
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:22.090
<v Speaker 2>And this is one of the most brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 2>shots I think that the animators managed</v>

1292
01:10:22.091 --> 01:10:26.930
<v Speaker 2>because she's obviously pushing this a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit farther than he knows what to</v>

1293
01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:29.570
<v Speaker 2>do with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're wrestling and he,</v>

1294
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:33.050
<v Speaker 2>she licks them and then she lays down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and makes this face,</v>

1295
01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:33.884
<v Speaker 2>which is every single class I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed this to all laugh when they see </v>

1296
01:10:38.061 --> 01:10:40.370
<v Speaker 2>that image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good example.</v>

1297
01:10:40.371 --> 01:10:43.490
<v Speaker 2>So Freud said that jokes were a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>route into the unconscious.</v>

1298
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:45.223
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is an archetypal facial </v>

1299
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:49.850
<v Speaker 2>expression and everyone knows exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it means.</v>

1300
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:50.684
<v Speaker 2>There's something sexually seductive </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and something very sexually </v>

1301
01:10:53.691 --> 01:10:54.524
<v Speaker 2>seductive about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that it's a linus and </v>

1302
01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.440
<v Speaker 2>the animators do an extraordinarily good</v>
<v Speaker 2>job of capturing that.</v>

1303
01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:05.680
<v Speaker 2>And so that has a huge effect on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While these guys know that the games out</v>

1304
01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.630
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they know their dad,</v>

1305
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:14.530
<v Speaker 2>whatever attractions they can offer our </v>
<v Speaker 2>paling in comparison to so.</v>

1306
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:18.360
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things don't really progress passed out,</v>

1307
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:21.840
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets a hint of her longing for him,</v>

1308
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:22.973
<v Speaker 2>what's waiting for him if he grows up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that she's completely </v>

1309
01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:27.690
<v Speaker 2>disappointed in him because he's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely useless.</v>

1310
01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:28.763
<v Speaker 2>And so now he's lounging about like some</v>
<v Speaker 2>basement dweller with cheeto dust all </v>

1311
01:11:33.451 --> 01:11:38.451
<v Speaker 2>over his chest and trying to justify his</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely useless life.</v>

1312
01:11:39.451 --> 01:11:40.284
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that he doesn't have any </v>

1313
01:11:41.641 --> 01:11:46.290
<v Speaker 2>responsibility to the devastated kingdom</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's out there were Hakuna Matata,</v>

1314
01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:48.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just do whatever I want and,</v>

1315
01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.780
<v Speaker 2>and follow my impulsive pleasures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she thinks he's pretty pathetic.</v>

1316
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.260
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is because he is</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually pretty pathetic.</v>

1317
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:58.890
<v Speaker 2>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she tells him that she's extraordinarily</v>

1318
01:11:58.891 --> 01:12:00.750
<v Speaker 2>disappointed and he gets all pouty about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1319
01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:01.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even here,</v>

1320
01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:05.100
<v Speaker 2>you see when he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's got kind of an aggressive look</v>

1321
01:12:05.101 --> 01:12:05.934
<v Speaker 2>on his face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still nothing about it that's </v>

1322
01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:08.400
<v Speaker 2>commanding.</v>

1323
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.900
<v Speaker 2>It's petulant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1324
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:12.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now I'm irritated,</v>

1325
01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:17.061
<v Speaker 2>but he's got no force and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and still completely appalling in this,</v>

1326
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:18.323
<v Speaker 2>in this particular situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she judges him very harshly and </v>

1327
01:12:21.061 --> 01:12:23.660
<v Speaker 2>leaves and that makes them think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1328
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:24.763
<v Speaker 2>it's all self conscious because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>female that he admires wants to have </v>

1329
01:12:28.591 --> 01:12:31.440
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's first of all,</v>

1330
01:12:31.441 --> 01:12:33.480
<v Speaker 2>then he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I'll just hate all women,</v>

1331
01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:36.090
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty pathetic conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1332
01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.190
<v Speaker 2>but a very common one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the next is,</v>

1333
01:12:38.191 --> 01:12:40.560
<v Speaker 2>well maybe there's actually something </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with them.</v>

1334
01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.073
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is a very painful bit of self </v>

1335
01:12:43.261 --> 01:12:44.930
<v Speaker 2>reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

1336
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.613
<v Speaker 2>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows that there's something wrong </v>

1337
01:12:47.671 --> 01:12:48.504
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he calls out to his father and </v>

1338
01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:49.981
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1339
01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:52.740
<v Speaker 2>you said you were always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>here for me and you're not.</v>

1340
01:12:52.741 --> 01:12:53.574
<v Speaker 2>And so what's happening is that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's become aware of the insufficiency </v>

1341
01:12:57.001 --> 01:12:57.834
<v Speaker 2>of his current adolescent value </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and he wants something beyond </v>

1342
01:13:00.721 --> 01:13:01.554
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be associated with </v>

1343
01:13:02.131 --> 01:13:04.410
<v Speaker 2>identification with the father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he can't.</v>

1344
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 2>He can't find the father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The father is dead.</v>

1345
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:07.973
<v Speaker 2>It's like when Pinocchio goes down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the ocean to bring Japan </v>

1346
01:13:10.311 --> 01:13:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Eto up from the depths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1347
01:13:11.701 --> 01:13:15.330
<v Speaker 2>That's the situation that that symbol </v>
<v Speaker 2>finds himself in.</v>

1348
01:13:15.331 --> 01:13:16.164
<v Speaker 2>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the father's gone and has to be brought </v>

1349
01:13:17.971 --> 01:13:21.630
<v Speaker 2>up from the depths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is where the movie takes the,</v>

1350
01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.530
<v Speaker 2>they the archetypical pathway of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>initiation ceremony.</v>

1351
01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.130
<v Speaker 2>So he says he wants to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1352
01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:30.570
<v Speaker 2>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl Rogers,</v>

1353
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:33.150
<v Speaker 2>one of the clinicians that we'll talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about pointed out was that if,</v>

1354
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:35.220
<v Speaker 2>if someone was going to come to </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy,</v>

1355
01:13:35.221 --> 01:13:38.520
<v Speaker 2>there's some things that had to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they went into psychotherapy.</v>

1356
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:39.623
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that had to happen was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had to admit that there was </v>

1357
01:13:41.911 --> 01:13:44.550
<v Speaker 2>something wrong and they had to want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

1358
01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:48.300
<v Speaker 2>You had to have that before you went </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the psychotherapeutic situation.</v>

1359
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 2>And what happens here is Simba is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1360
01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:53.880
<v Speaker 2>he's dropped his arrogance and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking upward,</v>

1361
01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:57.750
<v Speaker 2>kind of like Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eto wishing on the Star in Pinocchio.</v>

1362
01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:58.973
<v Speaker 2>He's looking upwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looking towards something higher and </v>

1363
01:14:01.831 --> 01:14:04.920
<v Speaker 2>he wants to transform himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's asked the question,</v>

1364
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.540
<v Speaker 2>how can I change for the better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he doesn't get an answer.</v>

1365
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.900
<v Speaker 2>And then Rafiki shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean?</v>

1366
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:17.320
<v Speaker 2>It means that as soon as you know you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong about something,</v>

1367
01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:22.180
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you admit that you're wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>about something and you open the door to</v>

1368
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:25.120
<v Speaker 2>potential change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that part of you will respond.</v>

1369
01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:26.643
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know this because think about </v>

1370
01:14:28.151 --> 01:14:28.984
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking so you ask yourself a </v>

1371
01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:33.214
<v Speaker 2>question because that's what you do when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking and then you generate </v>

1372
01:14:34.991 --> 01:14:36.070
<v Speaker 2>some answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1373
01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:38.560
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thinking will actually work.</v>

1374
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:41.680
<v Speaker 2>You can actually come up with answers if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about something.</v>

1375
01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:44.020
<v Speaker 2>And so this credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this issue is okay.</v>

1376
01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was real good in my little </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive paradise,</v>

1377
01:14:47.531 --> 01:14:51.700
<v Speaker 2>but then it turns out that I'm just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>halfwit and I noticed that and I want to</v>

1378
01:14:51.701 --> 01:14:52.534
<v Speaker 2>do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is now the question is </v>

1379
01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:59.680
<v Speaker 2>has now been posed and what you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say is the deeper part of yourself,</v>

1380
01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:02.770
<v Speaker 2>the part that still contains your </v>
<v Speaker 2>undeveloped potential,</v>

1381
01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:03.843
<v Speaker 2>will respond to that posed question and </v>
<v Speaker 2>change the way that you look at things </v>

1382
01:15:08.021 --> 01:15:09.970
<v Speaker 2>and changed the way that you act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll start,</v>

1383
01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:14.650
<v Speaker 2>it'll start changing things so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can tap those parts of yourself that are</v>

1384
01:15:14.651 --> 01:15:17.860
<v Speaker 2>not yet developed and you certainly do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in psychotherapy,</v>

1385
01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:18.694
<v Speaker 2>but you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young said that psychotherapy could be </v>

1386
01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:21.124
<v Speaker 2>replaced by a supreme moral effort and </v>
<v Speaker 2>by that he meant was that if you really </v>

1387
01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:25.354
<v Speaker 2>wanted things to be better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want it to get your act together </v>

1388
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:28.833
<v Speaker 2>and you admitted that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>insufficient in your current state and </v>

1389
01:15:31.541 --> 01:15:32.374
<v Speaker 2>you meditated on the issue and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what you should do next to </v>

1390
01:15:35.951 --> 01:15:36.784
<v Speaker 2>make to put yourself together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would be able to find out that </v>

1391
01:15:39.761 --> 01:15:42.700
<v Speaker 2>there's something in you that guides the</v>
<v Speaker 2>process of development.</v>

1392
01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:46.540
<v Speaker 2>That's the self that's a higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the higher self in some sense.</v>

1393
01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:48.123
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing that remains constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>across transformations because you're </v>

1394
01:15:51.821 --> 01:15:53.050
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you fall apart,</v>

1395
01:15:53.051 --> 01:15:53.884
<v Speaker 2>then you get somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something outside of that </v>

1396
01:15:55.511 --> 01:15:58.840
<v Speaker 2>that's guiding that process and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>also the self.</v>

1397
01:15:58.841 --> 01:15:59.674
<v Speaker 2>That's what you could be and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate in some sense with what you </v>

1398
01:16:03.401 --> 01:16:04.234
<v Speaker 2>could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a very strange thing about </v>

1399
01:16:06.311 --> 01:16:07.450
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1400
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:08.643
<v Speaker 2>Rafiki shows up and Simba is sitting by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the water self reflecting and there's a </v>

1401
01:16:12.521 --> 01:16:16.240
<v Speaker 2>little pebble that drops into the pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>to attract his attention and up pops the</v>

1402
01:16:16.241 --> 01:16:18.820
<v Speaker 2>self and Rafique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a trickster.</v>

1403
01:16:18.821 --> 01:16:21.730
<v Speaker 2>He tells him weird jokes and he hits him</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a stick a bunch of times.</v>

1404
01:16:21.731 --> 01:16:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Thank God because someone really needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>to and he,</v>

1405
01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:27.550
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes some stupid jokes about bananas</v>

1406
01:16:27.551 --> 01:16:31.120
<v Speaker 2>and Kinda entices Simba into following </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

1407
01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:31.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1408
01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:32.433
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lets him know that he has a secret </v>

1409
01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:38.230
<v Speaker 2>and he entices Simba into following them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so all of a sudden become interested</v>

1410
01:16:38.231 --> 01:16:39.064
<v Speaker 2>in something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you ask yourself what the next </v>

1411
01:16:40.991 --> 01:16:42.910
<v Speaker 2>developmental stages and you really want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know,</v>

1412
01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:43.923
<v Speaker 2>then all of a sudden you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become interested in things that might </v>

1413
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:46.684
<v Speaker 2>move you to the next stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that'll happen more or less </v>

1414
01:16:49.391 --> 01:16:51.160
<v Speaker 2>unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

1415
01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Rafiki entices him and then runs away </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Simba follows it,</v>

1416
01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.213
<v Speaker 2>and while that's where he reveals </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself as a sage and then he tells </v>

1417
01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Simba to follow him and he goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>underground,</v>

1418
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:06.580
<v Speaker 2>and this is the initiation scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1419
01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Which we talked about at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the class.</v>

1420
01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.650
<v Speaker 2>This is the descent into the underworld </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a.</v>

1421
01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:17.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a prerequisite to radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality transformation.</v>

1422
01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.073
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes through this horrifying </v>

1423
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.600
<v Speaker 2>underground tunnel system where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's all tangled up,</v>

1424
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:27.830
<v Speaker 2>which is you'll know if you ever fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>into chaos and everything down there and</v>

1425
01:17:27.831 --> 01:17:28.880
<v Speaker 2>chaos is tangled up.</v>

1426
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:33.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a tangled mess and he's quite and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's horrifying music going on in the</v>

1427
01:17:34.011 --> 01:17:39.011
<v Speaker 2>background and he goes deeper and deeper</v>
<v Speaker 2>until Rafiki says he finds a pool in the</v>

1428
01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.970
<v Speaker 2>middle of the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deep pool.</v>

1429
01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:42.850
<v Speaker 2>That's another symbol of the self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1430
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.903
<v Speaker 2>it's the deep unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something down there that's </v>

1431
01:17:46.071 --> 01:17:48.650
<v Speaker 2>alive that can be drawn up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>surface.</v>

1432
01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:49.693
<v Speaker 2>And so Rafiki shows him the pool and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Simba who's quite terrified at this </v>

1433
01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:55.520
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks at it,</v>

1434
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.400
<v Speaker 2>and the first thing he sees is he only </v>
<v Speaker 2>sees himself.</v>

1435
01:17:58.730 --> 01:18:00.800
<v Speaker 2>He only sees his own reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Rafiki says,</v>

1436
01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:04.580
<v Speaker 2>look deeper now you see what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>animators do here.</v>

1437
01:18:04.581 --> 01:18:05.414
<v Speaker 2>It's very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's Simba and there's his </v>

1438
01:18:07.881 --> 01:18:08.714
<v Speaker 2>reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you see that is already half his </v>

1439
01:18:10.191 --> 01:18:14.090
<v Speaker 2>father and you look at the difference in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eyebrows and the and the look.</v>

1440
01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:14.983
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a tightness of jaw and a </v>

1441
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:20.540
<v Speaker 2>firmness of face that starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest itself there.</v>

1442
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:21.493
<v Speaker 2>And that means that he starting to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the man he could be beyond the </v>

1443
01:18:24.891 --> 01:18:27.080
<v Speaker 2>adolescent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

1444
01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.760
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden while they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1445
01:18:28.761 --> 01:18:30.290
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1446
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:32.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a seriously different face</v>

1447
01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.033
<v Speaker 2>that everything's going in and that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like get out of my way because things </v>

1448
01:18:38.611 --> 01:18:41.580
<v Speaker 2>are gonna happen around me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very judgemental as well.</v>

1449
01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.653
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not naive by any stretch of the </v>

1450
01:18:44.521 --> 01:18:45.354
<v Speaker 2>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know as far as a good guy and so </v>

1451
01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:49.253
<v Speaker 2>there's something archetypal about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he sees the man he could be </v>

1452
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:53.663
<v Speaker 2>reflected back to them and then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>switches that actually becomes a cosmic </v>

1453
01:18:56.611 --> 01:18:59.130
<v Speaker 2>event and we switch up to the sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead.</v>

1454
01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:03.870
<v Speaker 2>And so move fossa manifests himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically as a solar deity</v>

1455
01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.290
<v Speaker 2>and he tells Simba that he's forgotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>who he is,</v>

1456
01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:11.543
<v Speaker 2>which is the son of a king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that he should remember that and </v>

1457
01:19:15.391 --> 01:19:20.010
<v Speaker 2>start acting like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's an archetypal idea.</v>

1458
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:20.963
<v Speaker 2>So if you're just a useless adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you forgotten who you are and the </v>

1459
01:19:23.851 --> 01:19:27.300
<v Speaker 2>consequences of that is that the state </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to fall around,</v>

1460
01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.093
<v Speaker 2>fall apart around you and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do anything to fix it and </v>

1461
01:19:30.751 --> 01:19:33.510
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be good for anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one's going to be able to rely on</v>

1462
01:19:33.511 --> 01:19:35.730
<v Speaker 2>you and you're going to be all whiny and</v>
<v Speaker 2>resentful.</v>

1463
01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:38.220
<v Speaker 2>And then it after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it even gets worse.</v>

1464
01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.010
<v Speaker 2>And so that's basically what Mufasa </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells them.</v>

1465
01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.460
<v Speaker 2>And so Simba is like blown away by this </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision,</v>

1466
01:19:44.461 --> 01:19:45.294
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he sees what he could be and </v>

1467
01:19:47.071 --> 01:19:49.860
<v Speaker 2>also what he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty damn horrifying.</v>

1468
01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.490
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the storm,</v>

1469
01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:56.790
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clears and Rafiki comes up and,</v>

1470
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:57.763
<v Speaker 2>and symbols a lot more thoughtful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not quite as whiny and resentful </v>

1471
01:20:00.751 --> 01:20:02.430
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Rafiki</v>

1472
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:04.833
<v Speaker 2>leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Simba now knows what he's </v>

1473
01:20:06.461 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 2>supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to start</v>

1474
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.083
<v Speaker 4>being useless and take on moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>requirements of setting the kingdom </v>

1475
01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:17.640
<v Speaker 4>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he runs back across the desert,</v>

1476
01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.890
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of impressive music </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening,</v>

1477
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:20.873
<v Speaker 4>and then he comes back to his kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not looking so good and that's </v>

1478
01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:25.780
<v Speaker 4>the consequence of his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1479
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:28.080
<v Speaker 4>his abandonment of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big part of it.</v>

1480
01:20:28.081 --> 01:20:28.914
<v Speaker 4>So now it's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also his abandonment of it to </v>

1481
01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:34.740
<v Speaker 4>nothing but malevolence and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

1482
01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:38.370
<v Speaker 4>he's pretty taken aback at what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

1483
01:20:38.371 --> 01:20:39.204
<v Speaker 4>And Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he exaggerates his guilt or it should </v>

1484
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:44.190
<v Speaker 4>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And nella shows up and,</v>

1485
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:47.820
<v Speaker 4>and they decide they're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something about this.</v>

1486
01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:50.070
<v Speaker 4>So in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a</v>

1487
01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:55.380
<v Speaker 4>sim as mother is complaining about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that there's no food in the kingdom</v>

1488
01:20:55.381 --> 01:20:56.214
<v Speaker 4>anymore and that they've gone as far as </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can and scar doesn't want to hear </v>

1489
01:20:58.441 --> 01:20:59.610
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>

1490
01:20:59.611 --> 01:21:03.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he attacks her and Simba decides to,</v>

1491
01:21:03.061 --> 01:21:04.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go to war.</v>

1492
01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:05.723
<v Speaker 4>And so this is where he wakes up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's willing to encounter the shadow at </v>

1493
01:21:09.451 --> 01:21:10.284
<v Speaker 4>this point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we confronts scar and scars very </v>

1494
01:21:14.191 --> 01:21:18.170
<v Speaker 4>concerned about this because actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>sim is looking pretty impressive now had</v>

1495
01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:19.013
<v Speaker 4>he thought he was dead besides and so he</v>
<v Speaker 4>tries to use treachery and whiny ness </v>

1496
01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:24.443
<v Speaker 4>and subordination to excuse himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's planning to overthrow Simba </v>

1497
01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:34.680
<v Speaker 4>nonetheless to resist him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he tell scar to leave.</v>

1498
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:38.700
<v Speaker 4>He's going to banish him to the nether </v>
<v Speaker 4>regions outside of the kingdom,</v>

1499
01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:43.410
<v Speaker 4>like scarred to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And scar basically refuses.</v>

1500
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:44.873
<v Speaker 4>And then a storm gathers right and</v>
<v Speaker 4>lights the dead wood around the rock on </v>

1501
01:21:51.361 --> 01:21:52.194
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have another kind of descended </v>

1502
01:21:53.101 --> 01:21:56.370
<v Speaker 4>into hell scene here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A very common in Disney movies.</v>

1503
01:21:56.371 --> 01:21:57.204
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1504
01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:58.043
<v Speaker 4>this notion of the hero fighting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>evil force on the edge of something </v>

1505
01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:02.880
<v Speaker 4>that's burning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's quite a common motif.</v>

1506
01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.410
<v Speaker 4>You see it in sleeping beauty for </v>
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>

1507
01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:05.483
<v Speaker 4>So they have a big war and scar ends up </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting Simba in the same position that </v>

1508
01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:10.884
<v Speaker 4>Mufasa was in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he whispers to him that he </v>

1509
01:22:12.841 --> 01:22:13.674
<v Speaker 4>killed his father.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Sam has been thinking all along that </v>

1510
01:22:15.811 --> 01:22:18.600
<v Speaker 4>it was only his fault and it is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his fault,</v>

1511
01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:19.434
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't know that there was a more</v>
<v Speaker 4>archetypal theme playing out in the </v>

1512
01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:22.584
<v Speaker 4>background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that societies are always </v>

1513
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:30.060
<v Speaker 4>endangered by malevolence always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's independent to some degree of</v>

1514
01:22:30.061 --> 01:22:32.580
<v Speaker 4>symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 4>decisions and his and his lack thereof.</v>

1515
01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:34.860
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scar tells him to because he thinks he's</v>

1516
01:22:34.861 --> 01:22:39.861
<v Speaker 4>won and that energizes Simba to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of final battle.</v>

1517
01:22:40.561 --> 01:22:45.561
<v Speaker 4>He leaps out from the pit and they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>a big fight and he pins him basically,</v>

1518
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.520
<v Speaker 4>and the female lionesses come to his aid</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Simba tells him that again,</v>

1519
01:22:53.491 --> 01:22:54.324
<v Speaker 4>that he has to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they have a big fight that's a </v>

1520
01:22:56.251 --> 01:22:57.084
<v Speaker 4>particularly good bit of animation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's real demonic aspect discard </v>

1521
01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:05.250
<v Speaker 4>their sort of king of hell imagery and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he loses and then ha,</v>

1522
01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:08.403
<v Speaker 4>he blames his minions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He blames the Hyenas for everything </v>

1523
01:23:10.421 --> 01:23:11.950
<v Speaker 4>terrible that's happening for getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1524
01:23:11.951 --> 01:23:12.784
<v Speaker 4>They can hear him and then he falls off </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cliff and hygienists go in and </v>

1525
01:23:15.911 --> 01:23:16.744
<v Speaker 4>finish them off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's pretty brutal ending for poor </v>

1526
01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:23.560
<v Speaker 4>old scar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm eaten by his own minions</v>

1527
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.030
<v Speaker 4>and then scars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dad and Simba has one,</v>

1528
01:23:27.031 --> 01:23:29.430
<v Speaker 4>and so the rains come immediately and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>

1529
01:23:29.431 --> 01:23:30.264
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it means that when proper order is </v>

1530
01:23:31.171 --> 01:23:32.004
<v Speaker 4>restored in the kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then everything starts to flourish </v>

1531
01:23:33.841 --> 01:23:37.260
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the rains come and then,</v>

1532
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:41.111
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's raining.</v>

1533
01:23:41.111 --> 01:23:45.220
<v Speaker 4>Simba climbs up to the top of the rock </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now he's completely mature,</v>

1534
01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.054
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The facial pathetic facial expression </v>

1535
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:48.514
<v Speaker 4>disappears entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knee straightens himself up because now </v>

1536
01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:50.824
<v Speaker 4>he's full of Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After having defeated good old scar and </v>

1537
01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:54.993
<v Speaker 4>all the lionesses are roaring and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>climbs up pride rock and they roar at </v>

1538
01:23:59.531 --> 01:24:00.730
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is good.</v>

1539
01:24:00.731 --> 01:24:03.070
<v Speaker 4>They're tough and he's tough and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>show in their teeth.</v>

1540
01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:08.071
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a society of naive and harmless</v>

1541
01:24:09.011 --> 01:24:09.844
<v Speaker 4>creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something that's got some bite and </v>

1542
01:24:13.031 --> 01:24:13.864
<v Speaker 4>the rains come and then the next thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>you see as the restoration of the </v>

1543
01:24:16.481 --> 01:24:19.450
<v Speaker 4>kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so basically what that means is that</v>

1544
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:24.100
<v Speaker 4>if the individual is willing to confront</v>
<v Speaker 4>their own shadow and then to take on the</v>

1545
01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:26.800
<v Speaker 4>malevolent forces that continually </v>
<v Speaker 4>undermine society,</v>

1546
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:30.310
<v Speaker 4>then harmony can be restored and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone can do well.</v>

1547
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.790
<v Speaker 4>And so then we have a return to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning,</v>

1548
01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:38.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so Simba Nela are now a couple along</v>

1549
01:24:38.801 --> 01:24:43.801
<v Speaker 4>with Puma and simone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they have a baby and Rafiki shows up</v>

1550
01:24:45.851 --> 01:24:50.430
<v Speaker 4>and does the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1551
01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.453
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got to present the baby to the sun </v>

1552
01:24:54.941 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 4>and have all the animals bow again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1553
01:24:57.370 --> 01:25:01.570
<v Speaker 4>and that's the end of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's all packed.</v>

1554
01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:08.690
<v Speaker 4>That's all packed into an archetypical </v>
<v Speaker 4>tail.</v>

1555
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.863
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the things that young </v>
<v Speaker 4>would point out is that you all </v>

1556
01:25:13.971 --> 01:25:14.804
<v Speaker 4>understood this right while you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching it because otherwise at some </v>

1557
01:25:19.551 --> 01:25:20.384
<v Speaker 4>level all of these things made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all cohered and the narrative </v>

1558
01:25:23.511 --> 01:25:27.440
<v Speaker 4>appeared to be inappropriate narrative </v>
<v Speaker 4>even when you're a little kid it because</v>

1559
01:25:27.441 --> 01:25:31.100
<v Speaker 4>it strikes a chord inside you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And while that cord,</v>

1560
01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:33.470
<v Speaker 4>the thing that it strikes inside you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the archetype.</v>

1561
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:36.620
<v Speaker 4>Because if there wasn't something inside</v>
<v Speaker 4>of you,</v>

1562
01:25:36.621 --> 01:25:38.790
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this could communicate with,</v>

1563
01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:39.643
<v Speaker 4>then it would fall on deaf ears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it speaks to the part of you that's </v>

1564
01:25:43.251 --> 01:25:44.084
<v Speaker 4>most particularly human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a story of the development of </v>

1565
01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:49.870
<v Speaker 4>the sovereign individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1566
01:25:49.871 --> 01:25:51.860
<v Speaker 4>that's the right way to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So hero archetype,</v>

1567
01:25:51.861 --> 01:25:52.694
<v Speaker 4>that's another way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people are going to get that story </v>

1568
01:25:56.121 --> 01:25:56.954
<v Speaker 4>one way or another and now and then a </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece of public art comes along like </v>

1569
01:26:00.891 --> 01:26:02.660
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That does a good job of encapsulating.</v>

1570
01:26:02.661 --> 01:26:07.070
<v Speaker 4>It captures everyone's imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why you've all seen it.</v>

1571
01:26:07.071 --> 01:26:07.904
<v Speaker 4>And why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I presume you all enjoyed it when you </v>

1572
01:26:09.471 --> 01:26:13.100
<v Speaker 4>were kids and maybe still enjoy it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1573
01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.080
<v Speaker 4>Well that was actually faster than I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought it would be today.</v>

1574
01:26:19.081 --> 01:26:20.420
<v Speaker 4>So this is what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1575
01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:21.254
<v Speaker 4>we've got 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so why don't you think for a minute or </v>

1576
01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:26.790
<v Speaker 4>two and I'll take some questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I don't often do,</v>

1577
01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:27.653
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they can be any questions about </v>

1578
01:26:28.681 --> 01:26:33.100
<v Speaker 4>anything we've covered in class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So take a minute and.</v>

1579
01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.473
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1580
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:51.780
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1581
01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1582
01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's not much difference between</v>

1583
01:27:07.751 --> 01:27:08.584
<v Speaker 4>Gandalf and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's the wizard and Harry Potter </v>

1584
01:27:11.610 --> 01:27:12.820
<v Speaker 4>Dumbledore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There can be the same guy.</v>

1585
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:13.663
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1586
01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:14.913
<v Speaker 4>And so well that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is precisely the indication of the </v>

1587
01:27:18.221 --> 01:27:19.950
<v Speaker 4>existence of an archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1588
01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:23.440
<v Speaker 4>and a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One time a student asked me,</v>

1589
01:27:23.441 --> 01:27:25.000
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if if there are these archetypes,</v>

1590
01:27:25.001 --> 01:27:26.830
<v Speaker 4>why don't we just tell the archetype </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over,</v>

1591
01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:28.930
<v Speaker 4>why do we need fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1592
01:27:28.931 --> 01:27:29.764
<v Speaker 4>which is like a bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's individuals here and the </v>

1593
01:27:31.571 --> 01:27:32.404
<v Speaker 4>archetype is up here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what a high level of </v>

1594
01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:38.020
<v Speaker 4>abstraction fiction sort of fills the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gap between them and so what you want is</v>

1595
01:27:38.021 --> 01:27:41.530
<v Speaker 4>a story that's archetipal so that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand its basic structure,</v>

1596
01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.633
<v Speaker 4>but you want enough variation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>specificity so that this new and </v>

1597
01:27:45.131 --> 01:27:49.450
<v Speaker 4>interesting and also applicable to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to humanize the archetype to</v>

1598
01:27:49.451 --> 01:27:50.020
<v Speaker 4>some degree.</v>

1599
01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.670
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise it's so abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>

1600
01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:55.840
<v Speaker 4>You can't relate to it and and good </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories really do that.</v>

1601
01:27:55.841 --> 01:28:00.610
<v Speaker 4>They bridge the gap and some of them are</v>
<v Speaker 4>more personal and less archetipal,</v>

1602
01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.970
<v Speaker 4>but if they're completely non,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing about them that captures</v>

1603
01:28:03.971 --> 01:28:05.350
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have any force.</v>

1604
01:28:05.890 --> 01:28:06.723
<v Speaker 4>And then if it's too archetipal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it gets to be too abstract and you </v>

1605
01:28:08.861 --> 01:28:09.694
<v Speaker 4>can't relate to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So good fiction writers and and good </v>

1606
01:28:12.521 --> 01:28:13.354
<v Speaker 4>purveyors of of dramatic entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We think about it as entertainment are </v>

1607
01:28:17.051 --> 01:28:19.360
<v Speaker 4>really good at occupying that middle </v>
<v Speaker 4>position,</v>

1608
01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:20.733
<v Speaker 4>so yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they reveal the archetype through </v>

1609
01:28:23.051 --> 01:28:25.630
<v Speaker 4>the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of thinking about it and,</v>

1610
01:28:26.110 --> 01:28:26.943
<v Speaker 4>and that keeps it fresh and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that you pointed out </v>

1611
01:28:30.521 --> 01:28:31.354
<v Speaker 4>too was that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be manifesting </v>

1612
01:28:34.511 --> 01:28:36.310
<v Speaker 4>archetypal patterns of behavior in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

1613
01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:37.144
<v Speaker 4>whether you know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we even when you do something like fall </v>

1614
01:28:39.671 --> 01:28:40.504
<v Speaker 4>in love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's going to be a very </v>

1615
01:28:42.281 --> 01:28:43.114
<v Speaker 4>particular experience for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also a very common experience </v>

1616
01:28:45.311 --> 01:28:46.144
<v Speaker 4>at the same time.</v>

1617
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:47.583
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1618
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:48.783
<v Speaker 4>and romance is older than people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of looking at looking at </v>

1619
01:28:52.901 --> 01:28:53.734
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1620
01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:54.873
<v Speaker 4>because sex is older than human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you're in the grip of something </v>

1621
01:28:58.751 --> 01:29:02.820
<v Speaker 4>that's really ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same it's really personal and</v>

1622
01:29:02.821 --> 01:29:03.654
<v Speaker 4>so a good novelist or a writer of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fiction is able to capture both the </v>

1623
01:29:07.441 --> 01:29:12.441
<v Speaker 4>personal element of that to show the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transpersonal within the personal and so</v>

1624
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:15.510
<v Speaker 4>and in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your destiny,</v>

1625
01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:19.830
<v Speaker 4>proper destiny from a union perspective </v>
<v Speaker 4>is to consciously express an archetype.</v>

1626
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:22.980
<v Speaker 4>And so it'd be the archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of them,</v>

1627
01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:23.814
<v Speaker 4>but one of them would be the archetype </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the hero and you're supposed to </v>

1628
01:29:25.231 --> 01:29:27.540
<v Speaker 4>manifest that in the conditions of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>own life.</v>

1629
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:31.110
<v Speaker 4>So that makes the archetype real in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions of your own life.</v>

1630
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.500
<v Speaker 4>And young would also say that when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing that,</v>

1631
01:29:34.501 --> 01:29:36.810
<v Speaker 4>your experience will manifest itself as </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful.</v>

1632
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:38.783
<v Speaker 4>And so it's because in some sense you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>acting in accordance with your deepest </v>

1633
01:29:40.981 --> 01:29:42.840
<v Speaker 4>instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>technically speaking,</v>

1634
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:44.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

1635
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:44.833
<v Speaker 4>you're acting out what it means to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>human in the world and you're going to </v>

1636
01:29:47.631 --> 01:29:49.530
<v Speaker 4>find that meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1637
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:53.223
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

1638
01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:42.603
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the question is about the </v>

1639
01:30:43.451 --> 01:30:45.970
<v Speaker 4>relationship between the shadow in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1640
01:30:45.971 --> 01:30:46.804
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first thing you have to understand </v>

1641
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:53.103
<v Speaker 4>with regards to trying to come to terms </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the conception of the shadow is to </v>

1642
01:30:55.841 --> 01:30:59.920
<v Speaker 4>understand the idea of persona and </v>
<v Speaker 4>persona is the you,</v>

1643
01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:02.230
<v Speaker 4>that you present when you want people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>accept.</v>

1644
01:31:02.231 --> 01:31:05.410
<v Speaker 4>And like you</v>
<v Speaker 4>often like,</v>

1645
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:10.990
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say that you go to a party and</v>

1646
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:14.203
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to impress the people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are there and you're trying to get them </v>

1647
01:31:16.611 --> 01:31:21.611
<v Speaker 4>to like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you maybe get jabbed out a little</v>

1648
01:31:21.681 --> 01:31:22.514
<v Speaker 4>bit and you laugh and you know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go along with everyone so that they </v>

1649
01:31:25.881 --> 01:31:27.590
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you go home and you're bitterly</v>

1650
01:31:27.591 --> 01:31:31.130
<v Speaker 4>resentful about the way that you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>put down at this party.</v>

1651
01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:33.680
<v Speaker 4>And that's going to make all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive.</v>

1652
01:31:33.681 --> 01:31:34.514
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could have said it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make all sorts of aggressive and </v>

1653
01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:38.820
<v Speaker 4>vengeful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vengeful thought,</v>

1654
01:31:38.821 --> 01:31:41.090
<v Speaker 4>sort of flashed through your </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagination.</v>

1655
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:42.403
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first part of the problem is that </v>

1656
01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:46.070
<v Speaker 4>you are too much persona,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1657
01:31:46.071 --> 01:31:46.904
<v Speaker 4>You sacrificed yourself in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>out the party so that people would like </v>

1658
01:31:49.521 --> 01:31:50.354
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the second part you're refusing </v>

1659
01:31:52.851 --> 01:31:57.200
<v Speaker 4>to admit to the existence of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>elements of you that would have actually</v>

1660
01:31:57.201 --> 01:31:58.610
<v Speaker 4>protected you from doing that.</v>

1661
01:31:58.610 --> 01:31:59.443
<v Speaker 4>So let's say you go home and you're all </v>
<v Speaker 4>bitter and resentful and you have </v>

1662
01:32:02.111 --> 01:32:02.944
<v Speaker 4>fantasies of revenge that reveals to you</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shadow part of you that's </v>

1663
01:32:07.571 --> 01:32:08.404
<v Speaker 4>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is you actually need that </v>

1664
01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:11.494
<v Speaker 4>because if you would have integrated </v>
<v Speaker 4>that more successfully into your </v>

1665
01:32:13.271 --> 01:32:15.610
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you went to the party,</v>

1666
01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:16.444
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't have had lit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't have had to let people put </v>

1667
01:32:18.341 --> 01:32:20.830
<v Speaker 4>you down to get them to like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1668
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:21.664
<v Speaker 4>instead of having a face like this which</v>
<v Speaker 4>says all take anything that's coming my </v>

1669
01:32:25.721 --> 01:32:26.710
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1670
01:32:26.711 --> 01:32:27.544
<v Speaker 4>you have a face and a stance that's more</v>
<v Speaker 4>determined and assertive and if you </v>

1671
01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:31.923
<v Speaker 4>manifest that properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people aren't going to mess with you to </v>

1672
01:32:33.431 --> 01:32:35.380
<v Speaker 4>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1673
01:32:35.381 --> 01:32:37.780
<v Speaker 4>you may have already adopted a morality </v>
<v Speaker 4>that says,</v>

1674
01:32:37.781 --> 01:32:38.614
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to be likable and I shouldn't do </v>

1675
01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:44.170
<v Speaker 4>anything that causes any conflict and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't ever hurt anybody's feelings.</v>

1676
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:45.103
<v Speaker 4>So you're just present yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>punching bag and you think that that </v>

1677
01:32:48.911 --> 01:32:50.560
<v Speaker 4>makes you a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't.</v>

1678
01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:54.280
<v Speaker 4>And there's no integration of the shadow</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that situation.</v>

1679
01:32:55.090 --> 01:32:58.180
<v Speaker 4>So you see that at the end of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when I mentioned this,</v>

1680
01:32:58.181 --> 01:33:00.850
<v Speaker 4>when Simba climbs up the rock to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>control of it,</v>

1681
01:33:00.851 --> 01:33:03.700
<v Speaker 4>all the female lionesses bare their </v>
<v Speaker 4>teeth and he roars.</v>

1682
01:33:04.130 --> 01:33:07.210
<v Speaker 4>It's like that aggressiveness is </v>
<v Speaker 4>integrated into it.</v>

1683
01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:08.763
<v Speaker 4>And so resentment is a really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion for making contact with the </v>

1684
01:33:13.271 --> 01:33:16.330
<v Speaker 4>shadow side because if you're resentful </v>
<v Speaker 4>about something,</v>

1685
01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.990
<v Speaker 4>it basically reveals two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It either means that you're immature and</v>

1686
01:33:19.991 --> 01:33:24.580
<v Speaker 4>you should stop whining and get on with </v>
<v Speaker 4>things you know someone's asked.</v>

1687
01:33:24.610 --> 01:33:25.443
<v Speaker 4>This often happens with adolescents who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are asked say by their mother to clean </v>

1688
01:33:27.821 --> 01:33:29.860
<v Speaker 4>up the room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can all resentful about it.</v>

1689
01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:31.960
<v Speaker 4>It's like shut up and clean up your </v>
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>

1690
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:36.010
<v Speaker 4>You know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that much to ask or so.</v>

1691
01:33:36.011 --> 01:33:36.844
<v Speaker 4>That can be a gateway into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>observation of your own immaturity or </v>

1692
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:41.703
<v Speaker 4>it's possible that you're resentful </v>
<v Speaker 4>because people really have been poking </v>

1693
01:33:44.561 --> 01:33:45.394
<v Speaker 4>at you too much and taking and taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheap shots at you end up oppressing </v>

1694
01:33:49.301 --> 01:33:50.134
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what that means is that you've got </v>

1695
01:33:51.611 --> 01:33:55.900
<v Speaker 4>some things to say that you haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to say or don't know how to say.</v>

1696
01:33:56.770 --> 01:33:57.603
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't stand up for yourself </v>

1697
01:33:58.301 --> 01:34:00.250
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in order to do that,</v>

1698
01:34:00.251 --> 01:34:03.430
<v Speaker 4>you have to grow some teeth and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to use them.</v>

1699
01:34:03.730 --> 01:34:05.590
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something that might violate your</v>

1700
01:34:05.591 --> 01:34:07.090
<v Speaker 4>morality because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1701
01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.290
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't be able to bite people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the thing is,</v>

1702
01:34:11.291 --> 01:34:12.124
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to bite people hard </v>

1703
01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.750
<v Speaker 4>and if you're able to bite them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then generally you don't have to,</v>

1704
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.320
<v Speaker 4>but they need to know that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise,</v>

1705
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:22.780
<v Speaker 4>especially people who are badly </v>
<v Speaker 4>socialized,</v>

1706
01:34:22.810 --> 01:34:23.643
<v Speaker 4>they'll just keep encroaching on you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>encroaching on you and encroaching on </v>

1707
01:34:26.171 --> 01:34:28.150
<v Speaker 4>you and encroaching on you until you.</v>

1708
01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:29.353
<v Speaker 4>You put up a wall like someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>really well put together won't do that </v>

1709
01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:38.820
<v Speaker 4>because they're sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you run into people who only have</v>

1710
01:34:39.251 --> 01:34:42.850
<v Speaker 4>boundaries because other people impose </v>
<v Speaker 4>them on them and you won't do it,</v>

1711
01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:46.720
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be the bullied one in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the office for example.</v>

1712
01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:47.943
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get a raise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People aren't going to credit you with </v>

1713
01:34:50.081 --> 01:34:50.914
<v Speaker 4>your own work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other people are going to take credit </v>

1714
01:34:52.121 --> 01:34:52.954
<v Speaker 4>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when you're going to go home </v>

1715
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 4>angry because you're doing your best and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to get along with everyone</v>

1716
01:34:57.830 --> 01:35:00.350
<v Speaker 4>and nothing ever goes your way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1717
01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:01.184
<v Speaker 4>it's because you're a pushover and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that's good because you confuse </v>

1718
01:35:04.911 --> 01:35:09.911
<v Speaker 4>harmlessness with with with morality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not right.</v>

1719
01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:11.353
<v Speaker 4>Just because you can't do any damage </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean your moral just means </v>

1720
01:35:13.431 --> 01:35:16.610
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have the capability for mayhem</v>

1721
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:19.940
<v Speaker 4>and that makes you a pushover,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean.</v>

1722
01:35:19.941 --> 01:35:21.600
<v Speaker 4>The Yoga stuff is very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very dark.</v>

1723
01:35:21.601 --> 01:35:22.434
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very dark because his notion of </v>

1724
01:35:25.521 --> 01:35:29.690
<v Speaker 4>what constitutes a moral human being is </v>
<v Speaker 4>much different from the typical view.</v>

1725
01:35:30.170 --> 01:35:33.560
<v Speaker 4>He really thinks you get that horrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>side of yourself integrated.</v>

1726
01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.840
<v Speaker 4>So it's up there where you can use it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise you're,</v>

1727
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:38.750
<v Speaker 4>you're dangerous.</v>

1728
01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:41.573
<v Speaker 4>You can't say no to people and you'll go</v>
<v Speaker 4>along with the crowd and then if the </v>

1729
01:35:44.521 --> 01:35:46.860
<v Speaker 4>crowd does something particularly </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathological,</v>

1730
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:49.920
<v Speaker 4>which it's liable to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you won't be able to resist it.</v>

1731
01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:51.660
<v Speaker 4>You won't have the strength of </v>
<v Speaker 4>character.</v>

1732
01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.753
<v Speaker 4>And so then you'll fall prey to crowd </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathology and it will be because you're </v>

1733
01:35:57.751 --> 01:35:58.584
<v Speaker 4>too agreeable with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a shadow resentful side that the </v>

1734
01:36:01.891 --> 01:36:04.500
<v Speaker 4>crowd and it's murderous intent is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to act out.</v>

1735
01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.673
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1736
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:13.830
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1737
01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:19.150
<v Speaker 4>So the question is the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>between archetypes,</v>

1738
01:36:19.330 --> 01:36:21.430
<v Speaker 4>archetypes in the idea of memes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1739
01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:23.170
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a complicated one.</v>

1740
01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:28.780
<v Speaker 4>So Richard Dawkins was the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>originated the idea of me and his notion</v>

1741
01:36:28.781 --> 01:36:29.614
<v Speaker 4>was that you could produce an idea or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>set of ideas that had the capacity to </v>

1742
01:36:34.361 --> 01:36:37.660
<v Speaker 4>propagate across minds for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

1743
01:36:37.661 --> 01:36:39.100
<v Speaker 4>It was catchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say like a,</v>

1744
01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:40.990
<v Speaker 4>like a song that gets stuck in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>

1745
01:36:41.370 --> 01:36:43.930
<v Speaker 4>you know it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

1746
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.153
<v Speaker 4>He called those memes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was sort of a play on the idea of </v>

1747
01:36:48.281 --> 01:36:49.114
<v Speaker 4>genes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there are these stable sets of ideas </v>

1748
01:36:52.661 --> 01:36:55.660
<v Speaker 4>that can be transferred across minds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1749
01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:56.973
<v Speaker 4>I've often thought when I was reading </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dawkins that if he would've kept </v>

1750
01:36:58.931 --> 01:37:03.130
<v Speaker 4>thinking he would have turned into Carl </v>
<v Speaker 4>young because an archetype is a meme,</v>

1751
01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.240
<v Speaker 4>but it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

1752
01:37:04.241 --> 01:37:05.074
<v Speaker 4>really deep meme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you could imagine that an idea has </v>

1753
01:37:07.631 --> 01:37:08.464
<v Speaker 4>been sold around for so long and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people have acted out for so long that </v>

1754
01:37:13.751 --> 01:37:17.080
<v Speaker 4>it's actually become part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>landscape that does the selection.</v>

1755
01:37:18.130 --> 01:37:19.300
<v Speaker 4>So think about it this way.</v>

1756
01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:31.030
<v Speaker 4>So it's more or less a truism that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you take a male dominance hierarchy,</v>

1757
01:37:32.290 --> 01:37:35.920
<v Speaker 4>the probability that the man at the top </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the hierarchy will leave offspring is</v>

1758
01:37:35.921 --> 01:37:36.754
<v Speaker 4>much higher than the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the men at the bottom will leave </v>

1759
01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:40.300
<v Speaker 4>offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's true in many,</v>

1760
01:37:40.301 --> 01:37:43.600
<v Speaker 4>many species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a much higher probability of</v>

1761
01:37:43.601 --> 01:37:46.630
<v Speaker 4>the average female leaving offspring </v>
<v Speaker 4>than the average man.</v>

1762
01:37:47.770 --> 01:37:48.603
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now then imagine that there's </v>

1763
01:37:52.061 --> 01:37:54.730
<v Speaker 4>characteristics that push a man up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dominance hierarchy,</v>

1764
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.863
<v Speaker 4>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then imagine that there are </v>

1765
01:37:57.421 --> 01:37:58.254
<v Speaker 4>characteristics that push a man up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a set of dominance hierarchies so that </v>

1766
01:38:03.301 --> 01:38:06.090
<v Speaker 4>each dominance hierarchy has something </v>
<v Speaker 4>in common with all of the others.</v>

1767
01:38:06.091 --> 01:38:08.280
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of like the idea of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a good player,</v>

1768
01:38:08.281 --> 01:38:11.550
<v Speaker 4>of a game being a good sport across </v>
<v Speaker 4>games.</v>

1769
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:13.560
<v Speaker 4>So then imagine that</v>

1770
01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:20.640
<v Speaker 4>the idea of the successful male starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>to become encapsulated in,</v>

1771
01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:23.500
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in biology,</v>

1772
01:38:23.710 --> 01:38:27.520
<v Speaker 4>because the species is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the male part of the species at least is</v>

1773
01:38:27.521 --> 01:38:32.500
<v Speaker 4>going to be adapting to the selection </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressures placed on the mail by the male</v>

1774
01:38:32.501 --> 01:38:33.334
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is you have a </v>

1775
01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:37.510
<v Speaker 4>competition between men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the men that win the competition,</v>

1776
01:38:37.690 --> 01:38:38.523
<v Speaker 4>find partners and mate so that the male </v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to start to adapt to the fact </v>

1777
01:38:43.781 --> 01:38:47.560
<v Speaker 4>of the selection that's implemented by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the dominance hierarchy.</v>

1778
01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:50.230
<v Speaker 4>Then you can imagine that that's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to take case,</v>

1779
01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:54.490
<v Speaker 4>take place across dominance hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is happening in many,</v>

1780
01:38:54.491 --> 01:38:58.570
<v Speaker 4>many situations spread across time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so then</v>

1781
01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.160
<v Speaker 4>the idea of how the proper man should </v>
<v Speaker 4>act starts to become incorporated in the</v>

1782
01:39:06.101 --> 01:39:09.250
<v Speaker 4>biology and also in the expectations of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the society.</v>

1783
01:39:09.490 --> 01:39:10.323
<v Speaker 4>And then that starts to loop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So as the expectations become clearer </v>

1784
01:39:13.871 --> 01:39:14.704
<v Speaker 4>and clearer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that notion of what constitutes success </v>

1785
01:39:18.101 --> 01:39:19.660
<v Speaker 4>becomes clearer and clearer as well.</v>

1786
01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:22.690
<v Speaker 4>And the two things get tangled together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1787
01:39:22.691 --> 01:39:23.524
<v Speaker 4>and I think you can see that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifestation of that whenever you go </v>

1788
01:39:27.611 --> 01:39:28.444
<v Speaker 4>watch a movie because you immediately </v>
<v Speaker 4>identify the hero and you identify with </v>

1789
01:39:32.741 --> 01:39:33.574
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like he's the person that you're </v>

1790
01:39:36.850 --> 01:39:37.683
<v Speaker 4>mythological imagination grasps onto and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you play that out using your body as a </v>

1791
01:39:42.701 --> 01:39:45.370
<v Speaker 4>representational platform when you watch</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movie.</v>

1792
01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:49.270
<v Speaker 4>And so maybe you admire the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he's a successful hero,</v>

1793
01:39:49.271 --> 01:39:50.104
<v Speaker 4>you do well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That admiration is the manifestation of </v>

1794
01:39:52.811 --> 01:39:53.644
<v Speaker 4>the instinct that drives you towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of behavior and not only can </v>

1795
01:39:57.251 --> 01:39:59.920
<v Speaker 4>you manifest it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in which case you're likely to feel good</v>

1796
01:39:59.921 --> 01:40:00.754
<v Speaker 4>about yourself because you know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you can feel good about </v>

1797
01:40:03.131 --> 01:40:03.964
<v Speaker 4>yourself and sometimes not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're also going to be able to </v>

1798
01:40:06.521 --> 01:40:07.354
<v Speaker 4>recognize it when you see it in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and that's going to manifest </v>

1799
01:40:10.211 --> 01:40:13.750
<v Speaker 4>itself in admiration and admiration is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the proclivity Dan imitate</v>

1800
01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.330
<v Speaker 4>so the meme can be so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

1801
01:40:20.150 --> 01:40:22.130
<v Speaker 4>you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dominance hierarchies are very,</v>

1802
01:40:22.131 --> 01:40:24.650
<v Speaker 4>very old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like 300 million years old.</v>

1803
01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:26.413
<v Speaker 4>They've been around a very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the idea that we have an image of </v>

1804
01:40:29.331 --> 01:40:31.690
<v Speaker 4>what it takes to climb the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 4>targets,</v>

1805
01:40:31.810 --> 01:40:32.643
<v Speaker 4>it's more or less self evident</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's the landscape that </v>

1806
01:40:36.421 --> 01:40:38.960
<v Speaker 4>selected us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and at the same time,</v>

1807
01:40:38.961 --> 01:40:41.300
<v Speaker 4>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the archetype,</v>

1808
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:45.830
<v Speaker 4>the pattern that propagates you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dominance hierarchy is also the same</v>

1809
01:40:45.831 --> 01:40:47.540
<v Speaker 4>pattern that makes you attractive to </v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

1810
01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.680
<v Speaker 4>They're the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1811
01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:52.653
<v Speaker 4>and of course that's a massively </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful selection mechanism and sexual </v>

1812
01:40:56.081 --> 01:40:56.914
<v Speaker 4>selection is really shaped human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's turned us into what we are and </v>

1813
01:41:01.031 --> 01:41:02.810
<v Speaker 4>that's an interesting thing too because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1814
01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:04.093
<v Speaker 4>here's one of the things that really </v>
<v Speaker 4>bothers me about the emphasis of </v>

1815
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:10.150
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary scientists on randomness,</v>

1816
01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.393
<v Speaker 4>so like the the gender mutation </v>
<v Speaker 4>generation process is random or quasi </v>

1817
01:41:15.701 --> 01:41:16.534
<v Speaker 4>random.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know that for sure because </v>

1818
01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:18.813
<v Speaker 4>there is evidence now that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>inherit acquired characteristics and </v>

1819
01:41:21.221 --> 01:41:24.670
<v Speaker 4>that was nobody thought that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible 20 years ago.</v>

1820
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:28.480
<v Speaker 4>So things are have taken a very weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>twist and the Darwinian world.</v>

1821
01:41:28.481 --> 01:41:29.314
<v Speaker 4>But for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could say that the mutation process </v>

1822
01:41:32.171 --> 01:41:35.650
<v Speaker 4>is random,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the selection process isn't random.</v>

1823
01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:37.083
<v Speaker 4>It's not even close to random.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ever since creatures have been able to </v>

1824
01:41:40.181 --> 01:41:43.930
<v Speaker 4>evaluate one another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the selection process hasn't been random</v>

1825
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.903
<v Speaker 4>and so basically were selected by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could say by the manifestation of </v>

1826
01:41:48.971 --> 01:41:52.870
<v Speaker 4>mind in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you believe that women,</v>

1827
01:41:52.871 --> 01:41:54.010
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise,</v>

1828
01:41:54.011 --> 01:41:55.960
<v Speaker 4>no conscious choice in there mate </v>
<v Speaker 4>selection,</v>

1829
01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:58.690
<v Speaker 4>which seems completely absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1830
01:41:58.691 --> 01:42:01.330
<v Speaker 4>men consciously choose who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lead them,</v>

1831
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:02.223
<v Speaker 4>at least in part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know who's going to succeed in a </v>

1832
01:42:03.791 --> 01:42:07.540
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy and women consciously choose </v>
<v Speaker 4>their sexual partners.</v>

1833
01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:08.913
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that the selection process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the evolutionary process is random </v>

1834
01:42:12.791 --> 01:42:13.624
<v Speaker 4>is it's an absurd proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sexual selection makes it nonrandom and </v>

1835
01:42:17.111 --> 01:42:20.230
<v Speaker 4>Darwin knew that he emphasized sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>selection a lot,</v>

1836
01:42:20.231 --> 01:42:23.470
<v Speaker 4>but more modern biologists since the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time of Darwin,</v>

1837
01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:28.120
<v Speaker 4>except for the last about 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>downplayed the role of sexual selection.</v>

1838
01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:29.193
<v Speaker 4>And I think the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it brings mind into the evolutionary </v>

1839
01:42:34.331 --> 01:42:39.040
<v Speaker 4>process in a way that they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>and no wonder it's complicated.</v>

1840
01:42:39.041 --> 01:42:39.874
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like to some degree we're </v>

1841
01:42:40.931 --> 01:42:41.764
<v Speaker 4>consciously directing our own evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least through the mechanism of </v>

1842
01:42:44.171 --> 01:42:45.004
<v Speaker 4>selection.</v>

1843
01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:56.633
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1844
01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.190
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well darkens.</v>

1845
01:42:58.191 --> 01:42:59.024
<v Speaker 4>Just thought of memes as something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd ever thought about them as </v>

1846
01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:04.190
<v Speaker 4>something that could last long enough to</v>
<v Speaker 4>play a role in selection itself.</v>

1847
01:43:05.670 --> 01:43:06.503
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he thought about the Morris parasitical </v>

1848
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:11.100
<v Speaker 4>cognitive entities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that just sort of floated on</v>

1849
01:43:11.101 --> 01:43:14.280
<v Speaker 4>the surface of the mental landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never,</v>

1850
01:43:14.850 --> 01:43:15.683
<v Speaker 4>he never grappled with the idea that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>meme could be something that could last </v>

1851
01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:21.990
<v Speaker 4>for hundreds of millions of years </v>
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking.</v>

1852
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:23.583
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1853
01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:29.030
<v Speaker 4>we got time for one more question if </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody has.</v>

1854
01:43:29.031 --> 01:43:33.850
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1855
01:43:33.851 --> 01:43:34.684
<v Speaker 4>From a political perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you divide people by their </v>

1856
01:43:36.401 --> 01:43:37.234
<v Speaker 4>political affiliation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like liberal men are the most </v>

1857
01:43:39.221 --> 01:43:40.054
<v Speaker 4>unhappy,</v>

1858
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:45.550
<v Speaker 4>they're higher in neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1859
01:43:45.551 --> 01:43:49.150
<v Speaker 4>I think the openness probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>contributes to it as well,</v>

1860
01:43:49.151 --> 01:43:49.984
<v Speaker 4>but we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also possibly the low </v>

1861
01:43:51.741 --> 01:43:54.260
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness when my graduate </v>
<v Speaker 4>students come in,</v>

1862
01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:55.094
<v Speaker 4>or one of the many ways we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about this in some detail because </v>

1863
01:43:57.291 --> 01:43:58.124
<v Speaker 4>she's going to tell you because we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>also looked at the personality </v>

1864
01:44:00.051 --> 01:44:00.884
<v Speaker 4>predictors of political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is extraordinarily interesting as </v>

1865
01:44:04.491 --> 01:44:07.820
<v Speaker 4>well because it doesn't really seem to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fall exactly on the liberal conservative</v>

1866
01:44:07.821 --> 01:44:08.654
<v Speaker 4>continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'll talk more about that when we </v>

1867
01:44:11.541 --> 01:44:13.160
<v Speaker 4>get into the big five part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>course.</v>

1868
01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:15.433
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1869
01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:18.860
<v Speaker 4>We'll see you on Thursday when we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to do a speed review of Freud.</v>
