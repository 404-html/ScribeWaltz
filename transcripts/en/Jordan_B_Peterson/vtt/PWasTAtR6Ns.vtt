6
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>anyone who doesn't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It revolutionized the psychology of </v>

13
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:47.924
<v Speaker 1>religion and his latest book of the 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of life is set to do exactly the </v>

14
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a few housekeeping things.</v>

15
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:59.300

<v Speaker 1>which I'm good to moderate.</v>

<v Speaker 1>assigning a bit here onstage,</v>

25
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.620
<v Speaker 1>a dedication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.483
<v Speaker 1>everyone's book is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or pretty well everyone's work is </v>

27
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>already signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to,</v>

28
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want a dedication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just leave you.</v>

29
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the third page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll find the signature.</v>

30
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to last night there was a huge </v>

31
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>queue as you can imagine in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the q run smoothly.</v>

32
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>And sorry to sound Bossy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not going to be doing selfies.</v>

33
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.913
<v Speaker 1>I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because it means he's got to stand </v>

34
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>up the whole time and it'll slow down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flow.</v>

35
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.513
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he is very happy to be photographed </v>

36
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:01.340
<v Speaker 1>and you can photo bomb him if you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

37
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Also because all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly me,</v>

38
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm a really keen for him to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems of our lives.</v>

39
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm pleased resist doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>during the dedication because it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>really slow everything down.</v>

41
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the three things that you can </v>

42
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:22.840
<v Speaker 1>take away from this evening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

43
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.890
<v Speaker 1>and you'll be the judges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

44
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.110
<v Speaker 1>be inspired by the talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

45
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>read the book and thirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marissa Canadian,</v>

46
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I feel rather fortunate to have now done</v>
<v Speaker 1>all three.</v>

47
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also if you would like to tweet about </v>

48
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag the rules that 12 rules of life.</v>

49
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.183
<v Speaker 1>So without further ado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please welcome one of the world's great </v>

50
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>public intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson.</v>

51
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.033
<v Speaker 3>Well that was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought I'd talk about my book </v>

52
00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:41.654
<v Speaker 3>tonight</v>
<v Speaker 3>given two talks now and I didn't </v>

53
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:48.480
<v Speaker 3>actually talk directly about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sort of talked around it then.</v>

54
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.950
<v Speaker 3>So I thought I don't like to give the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same talk twice.</v>

55
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.460
<v Speaker 3>So I thought I'd actually walked through</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and,</v>

56
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.590
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and outline it a little bit.</v>

57
00:03:57.591 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 3>And so I had spent most of the day </v>
<v Speaker 3>memorizing the rules.</v>

58
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:01.274
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd think if you worked on something </v>

59
00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:04.190
<v Speaker 3>for three years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been five years,</v>

60
00:04:04.191 --> 00:04:06.020
<v Speaker 3>I guess you'd actually have it </v>
<v Speaker 3>memorized.</v>

61
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.790
<v Speaker 3>But memory is a very strange thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very particular and goal oriented.</v>

62
00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 3>And I actually didn't have the rules </v>
<v Speaker 3>memorized.</v>

63
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly not their numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so hopefully I do by now,</v>

64
00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:16.994
<v Speaker 3>so I guess we're gonna find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have a copy of the book here in </v>

65
00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:20.024
<v Speaker 3>case in case I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think we'll go through them one by </v>

66
00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:25.820
<v Speaker 3>one and we'll see how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see how that goes.</v>

67
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Seven o'clock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

68
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.183
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

69
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first rule,</v>

70
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.350
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of a comical rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is stand up straight with your shoulders</v>

71
00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:41.150
<v Speaker 3>back and it's a meditation among other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things on the habits of lobsters.</v>

72
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.493
<v Speaker 3>I read some papers on lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boat must be 10 years ago I guess and </v>

73
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.343
<v Speaker 3>they just absolutely blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I've really loved </v>

74
00:04:50.241 --> 00:04:52.430
<v Speaker 3>about being a psychologist and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>many things,</v>

75
00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:55.340
<v Speaker 3>but I've really loved psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory and,</v>

76
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.860
<v Speaker 3>and the great clinicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the behaviors as well.</v>

77
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jung Adler,</v>

78
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.900
<v Speaker 3>Carl Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham Maslow,</v>

79
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that behaviors like skinner and,</v>

80
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.100
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the cognitive behavioral.</v>

81
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've learned a tremendous amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>from reading the clinicians.</v>

82
00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:12.260
<v Speaker 3>And so if any of you are interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology,</v>

83
00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:13.094
<v Speaker 3>I would really recommend reading the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Greek clinicians because they know you </v>

84
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.270
<v Speaker 3>learn so much about life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy by reading them,</v>

85
00:05:20.271 --> 00:05:21.104
<v Speaker 3>so that's been fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then on the entirely other end of </v>

86
00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:26.430
<v Speaker 3>the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I've learned most about psychology</v>

87
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:30.390
<v Speaker 3>is from the really low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call them,</v>

88
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.560
<v Speaker 3>the really science oriented animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>behaviorist,</v>

89
00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:34.394
<v Speaker 3>so that's where they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who they turned into the </v>

90
00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:36.290
<v Speaker 3>neuroscientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

91
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Do they were the animal behaviors first </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all,</v>

92
00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:38.714
<v Speaker 3>and then they turned into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroscientists that I've learned a </v>

93
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.690
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's such clear thinkers.</v>

94
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.380
<v Speaker 3>The best of the bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's two of them.</v>

95
00:05:45.381 --> 00:05:48.800
<v Speaker 3>One named Jeffrey Gray who wrote a book </v>
<v Speaker 3>called the neuropsychology of anxiety,</v>

96
00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:51.560
<v Speaker 3>which is just a deadly book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to read.</v>

97
00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:52.394
<v Speaker 3>It takes like six months to read it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think he he read like 1800 to </v>

98
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 3>write it or something like that and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually read them.</v>

99
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 3>That's the cool thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he understood them,</v>

100
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:03.434
<v Speaker 3>which is really something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's another guy named Jaak </v>

101
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 3>Panksepp who wrote a book called </v>
<v Speaker 3>affective neuroscience,</v>

102
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 3>which outlines his studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

103
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:11.414
<v Speaker 3>of rats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the guy who learned that rats </v>

104
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 3>laugh if you tickle them with the end of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pencil eraser,</v>

105
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:18.840
<v Speaker 3>but they laugh ultrasonically like bats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to.</v>

106
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.003
<v Speaker 3>You have to slow down the ultrasonic </v>
<v Speaker 3>vocalizations before you can hear them </v>

107
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:24.134
<v Speaker 3>giggle and you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the hell would you spend your time </v>

108
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 3>tickling rats with a pencil and making </v>
<v Speaker 3>them laugh,</v>

109
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.213
<v Speaker 3>but see what he demonstrated there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was a place circuit in </v>

110
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 3>mammals that there's an actual.</v>

111
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 3>There's a psychobiological basis for </v>
<v Speaker 3>rough and tumble play,</v>

112
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bloody big deal,</v>

113
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:40.184
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovering a whole new circuit in the </v>

114
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 3>brain that's like discovering a </v>
<v Speaker 3>continent.</v>

115
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.330
<v Speaker 3>It's Nobel prize winning stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Panksepp's affective neuroscience.</v>

116
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:48.164
<v Speaker 3>I would highly recommend that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this other book I know about </v>

117
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is 12 rules for life,</v>

118
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 3>which you could also look into if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

119
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading these articles on lobsters</v>

120
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:04.451
<v Speaker 3>and I came across this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this finding that lobsters,</v>

121
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 3>lobsters governed their postural </v>
<v Speaker 3>flection with Serotonin,</v>

122
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.211
<v Speaker 3>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

123
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 3>that's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so into selection is this,</v>

124
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:17.490
<v Speaker 3>is to stand up straight to Dr. wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so interesting because you know,</v>

125
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.523
<v Speaker 3>depressed people crouch over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if there's any leap between </v>

126
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 3>those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I went and read a whole pile of</v>

127
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:26.510
<v Speaker 3>papers on lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lobster,</v>

128
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 3>neurochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lobster neurochemistry is actually quite</v>

129
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 3>well understood because they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly simple nervous system.</v>

130
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

131
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 3>and so if you want to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex nervous system,</v>

132
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:36.164
<v Speaker 3>it's a good idea to understand a simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>one first and then sort of elaborate </v>

133
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:43.810
<v Speaker 3>upwards and it turns out that serotonin </v>
<v Speaker 3>governed status,</v>

134
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.043
<v Speaker 3>a governed status,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional regulation and posture in </v>

135
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 3>lobsters just like it does in human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

136
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:54.510
<v Speaker 3>And so that was just blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one,</v>

137
00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:55.344
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing that the chapter one is about </v>

138
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 3>is the fact that if a lobster is </v>
<v Speaker 3>defeated in a dominance battle,</v>

139
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 3>you can give it essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants and it will fight again.</v>

140
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.540
<v Speaker 3>Another just blew me away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

141
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.383
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

142
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 3>it's so remarkable because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that tells you is that,</v>

143
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.490
<v Speaker 3>so if you're a manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be lobster,</v>

144
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 3>top dog or bottom dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine there's 10 strata in the lobster</v>

145
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:23.330
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can be number one,</v>

146
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>top lobster,</v>

147
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:26.150
<v Speaker 3>number 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom lobster.</v>

148
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.583
<v Speaker 3>If your bottom lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have low serotonin levels and high </v>

149
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.023
<v Speaker 3>dopamine levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the neurochemical that human </v>

150
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.044
<v Speaker 3>beings don't produce and if you're a top</v>
<v Speaker 3>last or you have high serotonin levels </v>

151
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 3>and lower top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean levels and you can move a lobster</v>

152
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:41.324
<v Speaker 3>in its dominance hierarchy by moderating</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's levels of serotonin and I thought </v>

153
00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:46.094
<v Speaker 3>that's so interesting because what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>means is that the counter that keeps </v>

154
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.394
<v Speaker 3>track of our status,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a counter in a sense in our </v>

155
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 3>minds that keeps track of our status is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a third of a billion years old</v>

156
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 4>and what that also means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of the hierarchy,</v>

157
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 4>let's call it a dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 4>because within lobsters it's.</v>

158
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like a physical prowess </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy,</v>

159
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:07.404
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea of the hierarchy is at least </v>

160
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 4>350 million years old and so I read that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think,</v>

161
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.453
<v Speaker 4>well so much for the idea that human </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies are associate cultural </v>

162
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 4>construct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

163
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's wrong.</v>

164
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 4>It's not just a little bit wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's unbelievably wrong.</v>

165
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 4>It's mindbogglingly wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

166
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 4>and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

167
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so hierarchies.</v>

168
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.183
<v Speaker 4>Hierarchies have been around for a third</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a billion years and and we have a </v>

169
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:40.191
<v Speaker 4>neurochemical system that modulates our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our understanding of those hierarchies.</v>

170
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 4>And then also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is the interesting thing too,</v>

171
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:43.284
<v Speaker 4>and this is why people's reputations are</v>
<v Speaker 4>so important to them among there's lots </v>

172
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 4>of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is one of them,</v>

173
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:48.144
<v Speaker 4>is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>where this counter that you share with </v>

174
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:52.764
<v Speaker 4>lobsters rates you in terms of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchical position determines the </v>

175
00:09:57.211 --> 00:10:00.420
<v Speaker 4>ratio of negative emotion to positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion that you feel.</v>

176
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 4>And that's also an absolutely mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>boggling idea for two reasons.</v>

177
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 4>One is it tells you why it's so hard on </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to be put down because it doesn't</v>

178
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:10.644
<v Speaker 4>just upset them in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It changes the way their entire system </v>

179
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:17.640
<v Speaker 4>responds to the world so that they now </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience more positive emotion in less</v>

180
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:20.430
<v Speaker 4>than a less negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's really rough.</v>

181
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a corollary to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

182
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:23.934
<v Speaker 4>which is like there's a very tight </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship between your belief system </v>

183
00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 4>and your dominance hierarchy position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's complicated,</v>

184
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:31.284
<v Speaker 4>but it's worth going through like let's </v>
<v Speaker 4>say that so I have a certain amount of </v>

185
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.060
<v Speaker 4>status as a professor and and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

186
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.650
<v Speaker 4>and I have the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it the,</v>

187
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.603
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been granted the entitlement to a </v>

188
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:44.004
<v Speaker 4>certain position in a social hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the question is why do I have a </v>

189
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:49.404
<v Speaker 4>valid claim to that position and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>answer hypothetically is because I know </v>

190
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:54.720
<v Speaker 4>enough so that my claim to the position </v>
<v Speaker 4>is valid.</v>

191
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:55.763
<v Speaker 4>So then if you stand up in the audience </v>
<v Speaker 4>and challenge my beliefs and show that </v>

192
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might.</v>

193
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:00.841
<v Speaker 4>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

194
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:01.674
<v Speaker 4>I get upset because I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the more accurate reason that I get </v>

195
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 4>upset is because you're indicating to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the crowd that my,</v>

196
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 4>my position in the hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 4>authority is invalid.</v>

197
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.503
<v Speaker 4>And by doing that you lower me in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy and you mess around with the </v>

198
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.610
<v Speaker 4>neurochemical systems that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulating my emotions.</v>

199
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.623
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're interested at least in </v>
<v Speaker 4>part in why people are so prone to </v>

200
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 4>defend themselves and their beliefs in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the service of their position,</v>

201
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 4>then that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a great example of how you</v>

202
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:30.954
<v Speaker 4>can learn these unbelievable things by </v>
<v Speaker 4>stumbling across a rather obscure </v>

203
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:35.070
<v Speaker 4>biological fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

204
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.100
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>

205
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a series of dominoes and,</v>

206
00:11:40.311 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Speaker 4>and that's also why biological facts are</v>
<v Speaker 4>so useful.</v>

207
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.673
<v Speaker 4>It's like we don't have to argue about </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not social hierarchy says I </v>

208
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:50.910
<v Speaker 4>said to her are or hierarchies are </v>
<v Speaker 4>social constructs.</v>

209
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.193
<v Speaker 4>A given hierarchy is influenced in its </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure by socio cultural </v>

210
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 4>conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

211
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.083
<v Speaker 4>But the fact of the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the part of your brain that detects </v>

212
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.643
<v Speaker 4>and regulates your response to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies is older than the part of </v>

213
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 4>your brain that recognizes trees like </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's old.</v>

214
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really fundamental.</v>

215
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.313
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and almost all social animals organize </v>

216
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 4>themselves and social in hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 4>because now the other thing that chapter</v>

217
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:20.320
<v Speaker 4>one is a bit of a meditation on what </v>
<v Speaker 4>might constitute a hierarchy.</v>

218
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 4>One of my business colleagues and former</v>
<v Speaker 4>student of mine from Harvard,</v>

219
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:24.820
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very smart guy,</v>

220
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.863
<v Speaker 4>it's got a graduate degree in </v>
<v Speaker 4>engineering from Mit and a phd in </v>

221
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:30.034
<v Speaker 4>psychology from Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's like one of him in the whole </v>

222
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:32.314
<v Speaker 4>world and he's a very smart guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>helped me design the self authoring </v>

223
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 4>suite by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's been working for about 20 years</v>

224
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:39.244
<v Speaker 4>on that.</v>

225
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.003
<v Speaker 4>That's a suite of programs that helps </v>
<v Speaker 4>people write about their lives and </v>

226
00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:43.564
<v Speaker 4>straightened him out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He told me to stop using the word </v>

227
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy and he said the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason for that was that it was infested</v>

228
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:50.164
<v Speaker 4>with Marxists presuppositions and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>really bothered me when he first said </v>

229
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 4>that because I've been using the word </v>
<v Speaker 4>for years,</v>

230
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said we had a discussion about that.</v>

231
00:12:57.971 --> 00:12:58.421
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

232
00:12:58.421 --> 00:12:59.254
<v Speaker 4>it's predicated on the idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>climb up the hierarchy human hierarchy </v>

233
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.390
<v Speaker 4>as a consequence of the expression of </v>
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>

234
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.523
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You climb up valid hierarchies as a </v>

235
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:08.194
<v Speaker 4>consequence of the expression of </v>
<v Speaker 4>competence and that's actually </v>

236
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.613
<v Speaker 4>technically right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was exactly the right person to tell </v>

237
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:13.894
<v Speaker 4>me that because he had done his phd on </v>
<v Speaker 4>what predicts success in western </v>

238
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:19.600
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is quite clear.</v>

239
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.110
<v Speaker 4>General cognitive ability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some prefrontal ability as well,</v>

240
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:25.090
<v Speaker 4>which was what he's specifically tested.</v>

241
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.980
<v Speaker 4>So intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roughly speaking,</v>

242
00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 4>although it's a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 4>elaborate than intelligence,</v>

243
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:30.784
<v Speaker 4>but that's close enough and trait </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness accounts for about 50 </v>

244
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:36.400
<v Speaker 4>percent of the variance in longterm </v>
<v Speaker 4>success and you think,</v>

245
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

246
00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:39.430
<v Speaker 4>how do you want your society to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>structured?</v>

247
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.010
<v Speaker 4>It seems pretty good to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That smart,</v>

248
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 4>hard working people are the ones most </v>
<v Speaker 4>likely to succeed.</v>

249
00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:48.250
<v Speaker 4>That's not a bad empirical test of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>validity of a structure.</v>

250
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.383
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially given how much vaguery there </v>

251
00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Speaker 4>is in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lots of random things happen to people,</v>

252
00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:54.154
<v Speaker 4>but it's better to be born three </v>
<v Speaker 4>standard deviations above the mean and </v>

253
00:13:57.011 --> 00:13:59.040
<v Speaker 4>intelligence in the West than it is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be born.</v>

254
00:13:59.050 --> 00:13:59.883
<v Speaker 4>Three standard deviations above the mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>in wealth in relationship to where </v>

255
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:04.474
<v Speaker 4>you'll end up when you're 40.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he said to use the word competence </v>

256
00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:09.970
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy or we decided that and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's much better.</v>

257
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.133
<v Speaker 4>So chapter one is a bit of a meditation </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the nature of hierarchies in the </v>

258
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 4>biochemistry of hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also an injunction about how to</v>

259
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:19.624
<v Speaker 4>present yourself because you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to present yourself to the </v>

260
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:24.424
<v Speaker 4>world in a manner that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't disgrace you in some sense </v>

261
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:29.674
<v Speaker 4>that that might be a good way to think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it and you don't want to disgrace </v>

262
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.440
<v Speaker 4>yourself because the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 4>disgrace is emotional dysregulation,</v>

263
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 4>more pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less positive emotion,</v>

264
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.823
<v Speaker 4>and so the best way to present yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>is to stand up forthrightly and to </v>

265
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:43.850
<v Speaker 4>stretch out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

266
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:44.723
<v Speaker 4>and to occupy some space and to to to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make yourself sort of vulnerable by </v>

267
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 4>doing that because you open up the front</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your body,</v>

268
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:51.663
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's a sign of confidence and that </v>

269
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:54.014
<v Speaker 4>way people are most likely to give you </v>
<v Speaker 4>the benefit of the doubt and that's a </v>

270
00:14:58.071 --> 00:14:59.630
<v Speaker 4>good way to start regulating your mood.</v>

271
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.463
<v Speaker 4>But not only does it directly regulate </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mood to stand up because it's so </v>

272
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:07.430
<v Speaker 4>tightly associated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like pasta reflection is associated with</v>

273
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:08.264
<v Speaker 4>serotonin and emotional regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also because if you straighten up </v>

274
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.513
<v Speaker 4>and you present yourself in that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then other people are more likely to </v>

275
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:17.084
<v Speaker 4>take you seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that means they'll start treating </v>

276
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 4>you as if you're a number one lobster </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of a number 10 lobster.</v>

277
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.263
<v Speaker 4>And that's another way that you can at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least give yourself the bloody benefit </v>

278
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 4>of the doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

279
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:28.883
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

280
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:29.723
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

281
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.633
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and confront the world in a courageous </v>

282
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.460
<v Speaker 4>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a really good way of also of,</v>

283
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.863
<v Speaker 4>of figuring out how to establish </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself in multiple competence </v>

284
00:15:39.381 --> 00:15:40.214
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies because one of the general </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules of thumb about how to be </v>

285
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:43.784
<v Speaker 4>successful is to confront things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>frighten you forthrightly and with </v>

286
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:48.404
<v Speaker 4>courage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's kind of a universal strategy </v>

287
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 4>for success.</v>

288
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.210
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what the first chapter is </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

289
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:55.670
<v Speaker 4>So that's quite fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My graduate students,</v>

290
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 4>I told them these lobster stories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say my graduate students,</v>

291
00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:01.520
<v Speaker 4>when we used to go out for breakfast and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were a very competitive bunch,</v>

292
00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:02.354
<v Speaker 4>very fractious and witty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were always trying to get one </v>

293
00:16:04.521 --> 00:16:05.354
<v Speaker 4>over on each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a making some witty put down or </v>

294
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:08.414
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it got to the point in the </v>

295
00:16:09.371 --> 00:16:11.930
<v Speaker 4>restaurants where they put their claws </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the errands,</v>

296
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 4>click like this when they got one over </v>
<v Speaker 4>on one of their colleagues,</v>

297
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:19.040
<v Speaker 4>which was very peculiar and strange and </v>
<v Speaker 4>very funny as well.</v>

298
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.920
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's rule number one.</v>

299
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.493
<v Speaker 4>Rule number two is a treat yourself like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're someone that you care about and </v>

300
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.120
<v Speaker 4>that's a deeper chapter I would say like</v>
<v Speaker 4>chapter one is kind of comical,</v>

301
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 4>but it's also got this serious </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific end for example,</v>

302
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:40.070
<v Speaker 4>and it's practical like most of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules are.</v>

303
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Chapter two is a bit of a meditation on </v>
<v Speaker 4>why.</v>

304
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.520
<v Speaker 4>See I read this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read this,</v>

305
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:46.663
<v Speaker 4>this piece of work by young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the long while back and he was a </v>

306
00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:50.324
<v Speaker 4>meditation on the injunction to treat </v>
<v Speaker 4>your neighbor as you would like to be </v>

307
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:57.530
<v Speaker 4>treated or something like that and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you pointed out,</v>

308
00:16:57.531 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 4>which I really liked was that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't an injunction to be nice to other</v>

309
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:04.100
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an invitation to reciprocity.</v>

310
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:04.934
<v Speaker 4>It was something like this is like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should figure out how you would like to </v>

311
00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:10.730
<v Speaker 4>be treated like you were taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

312
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 4>not how you would like people to respond</v>
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>

313
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:14.210
<v Speaker 4>It's more important than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

314
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:17.660
<v Speaker 4>imagine you had a child that you really </v>
<v Speaker 4>cared for and and someone said,</v>

315
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:18.883
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will treat this child exactly </v>

316
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 4>like you want them to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to figure out what that is,</v>

317
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:26.660
<v Speaker 4>and so then you'd have to sit down for </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a month and you think,</v>

318
00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:27.494
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well how do you want your child to be </v>

319
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 4>treated?</v>

320
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.620
<v Speaker 4>You don't want everyone just to be nice </v>
<v Speaker 4>to him.</v>

321
00:17:30.621 --> 00:17:31.454
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want people to challenge them and </v>

322
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.283
<v Speaker 4>you want people to discipline them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we want people to tell him when he's </v>

323
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:36.014
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't just want everyone </v>

324
00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:38.150
<v Speaker 4>to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

325
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.430
<v Speaker 4>that's pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pathetic isn't.</v>

326
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.323
<v Speaker 4>There's no challenge in that and so well</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to treat other people like you </v>

327
00:17:45.951 --> 00:17:47.510
<v Speaker 4>would like to be treated well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you have to figure it out.</v>

328
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:48.344
<v Speaker 4>How would you like to be treated and why</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd like people to foreign all over </v>

329
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:52.740
<v Speaker 4>you and just lay everything at your </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet.</v>

330
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

331
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 4>that's not something you'd wish for for </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone that you were taken care of,</v>

332
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.343
<v Speaker 4>and then then there's an additional </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem which is it's often the case </v>

333
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:04.410
<v Speaker 4>that people will treat other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than they treat themselves.</v>

334
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 4>That happens extremely frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things I pointed out,</v>

335
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:09.324
<v Speaker 4>chapter two was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a dog and you take him to a </v>

336
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 4>vet and the vet gives you your </v>
<v Speaker 4>prescription medicine,</v>

337
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:15.804
<v Speaker 4>you'll go buy the medicine and you will </v>
<v Speaker 4>give it to the dog and you will do it </v>

338
00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:19.254
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>

339
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.370
<v Speaker 4>But if you go yourself to a doctor and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a prescription,</v>

340
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:24.204
<v Speaker 4>there's one that there's a 30 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>chance you won't even pick up the </v>

341
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:28.020
<v Speaker 4>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you do,</v>

342
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:28.854
<v Speaker 4>there's a 50 percent chance that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>won't administer it to yourself </v>

343
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:31.764
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I already thought about when I </v>

344
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:35.610
<v Speaker 4>first came across that statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really,</v>

345
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:37.050
<v Speaker 4>it was another one of those little </v>
<v Speaker 4>facts.</v>

346
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.790
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell is up with that?</v>

347
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:39.624
<v Speaker 4>It's like you'll do it for your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So obviously you'll do it for something </v>

348
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:47.550
<v Speaker 4>you care about and you're conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough so you'll actually do it.</v>

349
00:18:47.551 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't you do it for you,</v>

350
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 4>your dog likes you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

351
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:53.610
<v Speaker 4>even your dog would rather that you did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't,</v>

352
00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

353
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.170
<v Speaker 4>and it's actually one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 4>that modern medicine doesn't work nearly</v>

354
00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:01.920
<v Speaker 4>as well as it could because people just </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't take their medication and it's not</v>

355
00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:03.750
<v Speaker 4>only because they don't take care of </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

356
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.583
<v Speaker 4>There's some skepticism about doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can be just as skeptical about </v>

357
00:19:07.621 --> 00:19:10.740
<v Speaker 4>the vet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a deep meditation,</v>

358
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

359
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.803
<v Speaker 4>what I've done with these rules is </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very simple rules and they're </v>

360
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 4>kind of comical and tongue and cheek in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some ways.</v>

361
00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:17.994
<v Speaker 4>But what I've tried to do is like pull </v>
<v Speaker 4>them apart and show what's underneath </v>

362
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 4>the men to go down as deep as I possibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>

363
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:27.840
<v Speaker 4>And in rural too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bit of a meditation on why people</v>

364
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:32.270
<v Speaker 4>don't like themselves very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's two reasons really.</v>

365
00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.213
<v Speaker 4>One is that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're fragile and damageable and </v>

366
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.390
<v Speaker 4>imperfect in multiple dimensions all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

367
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.583
<v Speaker 4>And that often just gets worse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets lots of things get worse as you </v>

368
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 4>get old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example.</v>

369
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:45.024
<v Speaker 4>So it's not necessarily that easy for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>self conscious being who's </v>

370
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.860
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily aware of his or her own </v>
<v Speaker 4>fragility and,</v>

371
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.330
<v Speaker 4>but not just virgility</v>
<v Speaker 4>foolishness and errors.</v>

372
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.170
<v Speaker 4>His like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

373
00:19:58.171 --> 00:20:00.660
<v Speaker 4>yourself better than anyone else knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and you know,</v>

374
00:20:00.661 --> 00:20:01.494
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might have a certain amount of </v>

375
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.440
<v Speaker 4>dislike for someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

376
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:06.180
<v Speaker 4>because of something they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

377
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:08.070
<v Speaker 4>everything you did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

378
00:20:08.071 --> 00:20:09.360
<v Speaker 4>that's a drag man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

379
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 4>you have to carry that along behind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

380
00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:12.150
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did that,</v>

381
00:20:12.151 --> 00:20:14.220
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then so there's that.</v>

382
00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:15.054
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're your week and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>useless and prone to temptation and you </v>

383
00:20:18.811 --> 00:20:19.644
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things that just shouldn't be </v>

384
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:22.314
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you're also capable of pretty </v>

385
00:20:23.761 --> 00:20:24.594
<v Speaker 4>vicious acts of malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you also know that about </v>

386
00:20:26.881 --> 00:20:27.714
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a real existential question </v>

387
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:30.354
<v Speaker 4>for people's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why the hell should you take care of </v>

388
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.260
<v Speaker 4>something is sorry and wretched as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

389
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.450
<v Speaker 4>And that's really what the chapter's </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

390
00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Speaker 4>It's because the answer in the chapter </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

391
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:39.000
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

392
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

393
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.900
<v Speaker 4>You know your first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

394
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.753
<v Speaker 4>you're pretty useless and terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so is everyone else and that's </v>

395
00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 4>actually an existential problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

396
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.183
<v Speaker 4>And what I mean that it's a problem that</v>
<v Speaker 4>every human being has always had an </v>

397
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.630
<v Speaker 4>always will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's not just you,</v>

398
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.510
<v Speaker 4>it's a universal problem and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

399
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.373
<v Speaker 4>there's an answer to that and one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them is to what is to say love the </v>

400
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 4>sinner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but hate the sin.</v>

401
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:02.194
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that is that despite</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you're not all that you </v>

402
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:05.554
<v Speaker 4>could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the proper attitude to have towards </v>

403
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:08.194
<v Speaker 4>yourself is the attitude that you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have towards someone that you genuinely </v>

404
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:12.064
<v Speaker 4>cared for and that it's incumbent on you</v>
<v Speaker 4>to act as if you genuinely care for </v>

405
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:16.504
<v Speaker 4>yourself just like you would act toward </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone that you actually cared about </v>

406
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:21.154
<v Speaker 4>some other person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a reversal in some sense of the </v>

407
00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:23.770
<v Speaker 4>golden rule.</v>

408
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:24.830
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

409
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.790
<v Speaker 4>and it's a discussion of why that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary.</v>

410
00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 4>And also more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a discussion of why,</v>

411
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.040
<v Speaker 4>why you have a moral obligation to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

412
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.710
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that you should because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be better for you.</v>

413
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:37.720
<v Speaker 4>It's you actually have a moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>obligation to do that.</v>

414
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:40.390
<v Speaker 4>I think because you make the world a </v>
<v Speaker 4>much better place,</v>

415
00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:43.150
<v Speaker 4>a much worse place if you don't take </v>
<v Speaker 4>care of yourself,</v>

416
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 4>so you should bloody well take care of </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

417
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because well,</v>

418
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.813
<v Speaker 4>that's what the chapter's about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's partly because you have something </v>

419
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:51.844
<v Speaker 4>valuable to bring into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about being an </v>

420
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:56.830
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the thing that Western civilization</v>

421
00:21:56.831 --> 00:21:57.664
<v Speaker 4>has always recognized that as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual you have a light that you </v>

422
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 4>have to bring into the world and that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't bring it into the world,</v>

423
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.713
<v Speaker 4>the world is a dimmer place and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad thing because when the world is a </v>

424
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.860
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can get very,</v>

425
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:10.150
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very dark,</v>

426
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.120
<v Speaker 4>and so it's not just so that you feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>better,</v>

427
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.250
<v Speaker 4>not just so that you're a number one </v>
<v Speaker 4>lobster.</v>

428
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.420
<v Speaker 4>None,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of those things.</v>

429
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:17.523
<v Speaker 4>You need to take care of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're in the best position to </v>

430
00:22:19.511 --> 00:22:20.344
<v Speaker 4>do that and it's necessary for you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take care of yourself despite the fact </v>

431
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:27.550
<v Speaker 4>that we're mortal and vulnerable and </v>
<v Speaker 4>self conscious and capable,</v>

432
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.620
<v Speaker 4>not only capable of doing terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

433
00:22:29.621 --> 00:22:32.250
<v Speaker 4>but actually do them despite all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

434
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.293
<v Speaker 4>You're still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You still have that responsibility and </v>

435
00:22:35.981 --> 00:22:36.814
<v Speaker 4>so I wanted to hit the question as hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>as I can to try to figure out well why </v>

436
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:45.580
<v Speaker 4>people are have are contemptuous of </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves and there's plenty of reason,</v>

437
00:22:45.581 --> 00:22:46.414
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reasons do not justify the </v>

438
00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:52.000
<v Speaker 4>mistreatment of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's as simple as that.</v>

439
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:52.893
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good strategy and the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>rule is make friends with people who </v>

440
00:22:56.021 --> 00:22:56.854
<v Speaker 4>want the best for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a meditation on my own </v>

441
00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.900
<v Speaker 4>childhood and adolescents to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree.</v>

442
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:06.020
<v Speaker 4>I had friends who wanted the best for me</v>
<v Speaker 4>and friends who didn't know.</v>

443
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:06.883
<v Speaker 4>They were friends who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them were aiming up and some of </v>

444
00:23:11.171 --> 00:23:12.004
<v Speaker 4>them were aiming down and if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend that's aiming down and you do </v>

445
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:15.274
<v Speaker 4>something that's aiming up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're generally not that happy </v>

446
00:23:17.351 --> 00:23:17.981
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

447
00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:18.814
<v Speaker 4>they tried to talk your accomplishment </v>
<v Speaker 4>with one of their own hypothetical or </v>

448
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:22.534
<v Speaker 4>real or put down what you're doing or </v>
<v Speaker 4>offer you a cigarette if you're trying </v>

449
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:26.134
<v Speaker 4>to quit and you've kind of done that </v>
<v Speaker 4>successfully or a drink if you've been </v>

450
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 4>drinking too much and are just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop being an alcoholic,</v>

451
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

452
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.480
<v Speaker 4>or any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're cynical and bitter and,</v>

453
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.633
<v Speaker 4>and devoted towards no good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes that's family members too </v>

454
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:41.550
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes it's even part of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

455
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 4>but this chapter is a injunction to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people is like,</v>

456
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 4>like you have an ethical responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>to take care of yourself.</v>

457
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:49.964
<v Speaker 4>You have an ethical responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 4>surround yourself with people who have </v>

458
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.073
<v Speaker 4>the courage and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and faith and wisdom to wish you well </v>

459
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.104
<v Speaker 4>when you've done something good and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop you when you're doing something </v>

460
00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:04.394
<v Speaker 4>destructive.</v>

461
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.430
<v Speaker 4>And if your friends aren't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're not your friends.</v>

462
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.833
<v Speaker 4>And maintaining your friendships with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them might not even be in their </v>

463
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:12.314
<v Speaker 4>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a tricky argument to make </v>

464
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:15.260
<v Speaker 4>because I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

465
00:24:15.261 --> 00:24:16.094
<v Speaker 4>whenever anyone's in trouble you should </v>
<v Speaker 4>push them into a ditch and then give </v>

466
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:20.570
<v Speaker 4>them a couple of kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

467
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.553
<v Speaker 4>that's not the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea is that what I had a couple of </v>

468
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:27.080
<v Speaker 4>rules I didn't write about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One was be careful,</v>

469
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.650
<v Speaker 4>be careful about whom you share good </v>
<v Speaker 4>news with.</v>

470
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:31.484
<v Speaker 4>And another was be careful about who you</v>
<v Speaker 4>share bad news with and everyone goes </v>

471
00:24:34.821 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 4>rules ringing in people's minds quite </v>
<v Speaker 4>quickly.</v>

472
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.290
<v Speaker 4>A friend is someone you can share good </v>
<v Speaker 4>news with.</v>

473
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to them and you say,</v>

474
00:24:40.711 --> 00:24:42.170
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this good thing happened to me.</v>

475
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.220
<v Speaker 4>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

476
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:46.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm so happy that that happened to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like way to be.</v>

477
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.450
<v Speaker 4>And they don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God dammit,</v>

478
00:24:47.451 --> 00:24:49.180
<v Speaker 4>why didn't that happen to me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

479
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:50.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't deserve it.</v>

480
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.820
<v Speaker 4>Here's a bunch of reasons you're stupid </v>
<v Speaker 4>and why it won't work.</v>

481
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not helpful.</v>

482
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.800
<v Speaker 4>And so I would say like if people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

483
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 4>the other thing people are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're trying to drag you down,</v>

484
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:01.274
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is they're trying to see if you'll put </v>

485
00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:02.984
<v Speaker 4>up with it because they have this idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that maybe life isn't worth living and </v>

486
00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 4>things aren't good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if they can be smirch,</v>

487
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:10.160
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to use an archaic term,</v>

488
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.580
<v Speaker 4>something that's pristine and good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they demonstrate to themselves that</v>

489
00:25:13.581 --> 00:25:14.414
<v Speaker 4>there is no true ideal and that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>no necessary reason to be responsible </v>

490
00:25:17.841 --> 00:25:21.080
<v Speaker 4>and to strive forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they use us as a test case.</v>

491
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.213
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just push you down into the low </v>

492
00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 4>lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>been and see how you respond.</v>

493
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.950
<v Speaker 4>And if you put up with it then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my cynicism is fully justified.</v>

494
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:29.893
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's chapter three and it's a </v>

495
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:33.494
<v Speaker 4>painful chapter because it also details </v>
<v Speaker 4>the suicide of one of my friends which </v>

496
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:38.030
<v Speaker 4>occurred over a very long period of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

497
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.090
<v Speaker 4>Not the actual suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all the pro drama to it.</v>

498
00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:43.350
<v Speaker 4>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's sick.</v>

499
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.460
<v Speaker 4>It's a contentious chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number four is</v>

500
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 4>compare yourself to who you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday,</v>

501
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.033
<v Speaker 4>not to who's someone else's today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the reason I wrote that it was </v>

502
00:25:55.411 --> 00:25:59.510
<v Speaker 4>because I had this client tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm clinical psychologist and I've spent</v>

503
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:03.080
<v Speaker 4>20 hours a week for 25 years listening </v>
<v Speaker 4>to people,</v>

504
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.260
<v Speaker 4>listening to people tell me about their </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives,</v>

505
00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:06.094
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and those people were people who were </v>

506
00:26:07.311 --> 00:26:08.144
<v Speaker 4>just barely hanging onto the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world up to people who are so </v>

507
00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:12.470
<v Speaker 4>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can hardly believe it.</v>

508
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:14.510
<v Speaker 4>Like the entire gamut of people.</v>

509
00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:17.510
<v Speaker 4>And that's been absolutely fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

510
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.420
<v Speaker 4>it's like being a clinical psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really listen,</v>

511
00:26:20.421 --> 00:26:24.470
<v Speaker 4>is like being immersed in a Dostoyevsky </v>
<v Speaker 4>novel all the time,</v>

512
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.383
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's amazing what people will </v>

513
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.000
<v Speaker 4>tell you if you listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are.</v>

514
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:29.834
<v Speaker 4>People are so interesting if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually listened to them because </v>

515
00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 4>they're so peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're like,</v>

516
00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:35.750
<v Speaker 4>penguins are right now services an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ostriches.</v>

517
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:38.660
<v Speaker 4>They're unlikely creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And anyways,</v>

518
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.230
<v Speaker 4>with regards to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

519
00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:44.403
<v Speaker 4>to a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comparing yourself to who you were </v>

520
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 4>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not as who someone else's today.</v>

521
00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm this old client of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was about 85 when he came to.</v>

522
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:54.954
<v Speaker 4>See me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was a financier and a kind of a </v>

523
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:57.234
<v Speaker 4>mathematical genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made these little pendants out of a </v>

524
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.080
<v Speaker 4>mathematical symbol for the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful mathematical equation that was</v>

525
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:04.914
<v Speaker 4>ever written.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made them out of gold and he would </v>

526
00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 4>hand those out and and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had,</v>

527
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.953
<v Speaker 4>he had studied psychology as a young man</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he introduced me to this concept </v>

528
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:14.790
<v Speaker 4>that I didn't know about called the </v>
<v Speaker 4>parades distribution,</v>

529
00:27:14.791 --> 00:27:15.624
<v Speaker 4>which see I'd been taught as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist that most human </v>

530
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:21.840
<v Speaker 4>characteristics or normally distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

531
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.040
<v Speaker 4>So most people were average and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were extreme.</v>

532
00:27:25.041 --> 00:27:29.250
<v Speaker 4>Now that's a or normal distribution </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence is like that and height.</v>

533
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.440
<v Speaker 4>There's more people of average height </v>
<v Speaker 4>than that.</v>

534
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:32.640
<v Speaker 4>Very Tall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very short,</v>

535
00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:33.483
<v Speaker 4>and weight is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And lots of things are normally </v>

536
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:38.250
<v Speaker 4>distributed and psychologists tend to </v>
<v Speaker 4>assume that everything is,</v>

537
00:27:38.251 --> 00:27:39.084
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Creative products are distributed in a </v>

538
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.593
<v Speaker 4>prieto distribution and that's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>different thing and it's really </v>

539
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:48.820
<v Speaker 4>important to know this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's another fundamental fact,</v>

540
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.440
<v Speaker 4>the knowledge of which can sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>transform the way you conceptualize,</v>

541
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the political landscape.</v>

542
00:27:54.421 --> 00:27:55.254
<v Speaker 4>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's an example of the predo </v>

543
00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:59.700
<v Speaker 4>distribution half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know there's a rule of thumb that if</v>

544
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:03.210
<v Speaker 4>you run a company that 20 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your employees do 80 percent of the work</v>

545
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.103
<v Speaker 4>or the 20 percent of your customers are </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible for 80 percent of your </v>

546
00:28:06.661 --> 00:28:07.494
<v Speaker 4>sales,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the 20 percent of them are </v>

547
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:11.610
<v Speaker 4>responsible for 80 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>customer service calls.</v>

548
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's not exactly the rule.</v>

549
00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:16.470
<v Speaker 4>The rule is worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rule is</v>

550
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:18.803
<v Speaker 4>in a given domain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the square root of the number of people </v>

551
00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:24.510
<v Speaker 4>operating in that domain do half the </v>
<v Speaker 4>productive work.</v>

552
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.250
<v Speaker 4>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you have 10 employees,</v>

553
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:27.660
<v Speaker 4>three of them do half the work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

554
00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:28.590
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

555
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 4>what if you have 100 employees?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then 10 of them do half the work.</v>

556
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.660
<v Speaker 4>What if you have a thousand employees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's 30,</v>

557
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.380
<v Speaker 4>and if it's 10,000 employees then it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>100.</v>

558
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.490
<v Speaker 4>And this actually turns out to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather ironclad rule.</v>

559
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.530
<v Speaker 4>It applies across very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very many situations.</v>

560
00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 4>It applies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

561
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.060
<v Speaker 4>to the massive stars and the size of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cities.</v>

562
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.090
<v Speaker 4>So you can see how universal it is as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>law and it's,</v>

563
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.400
<v Speaker 4>it's something like those that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

564
00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.740
<v Speaker 4>get more and those that have less good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less,</v>

565
00:28:58.741 --> 00:29:00.120
<v Speaker 4>that's the matthew principle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

566
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.570
<v Speaker 4>To those who have everything more will </v>
<v Speaker 4>be given from those who have nothing.</v>

567
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.613
<v Speaker 4>Everything will be taken away and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>economists sometimes call that the </v>

568
00:29:07.081 --> 00:29:07.914
<v Speaker 4>matthew principle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what that lays out is a world </v>

569
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:12.480
<v Speaker 4>that's rife with inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

570
00:29:12.481 --> 00:29:17.010
<v Speaker 4>you hear this idea that I think it's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>85 richest people in the world have more</v>

571
00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:20.820
<v Speaker 4>money than the bottom 2 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a pareto distribution phenomena.</v>

572
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:25.680
<v Speaker 4>And you might say to hell with </v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalism for producing that.</v>

573
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:26.551
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

574
00:29:26.551 --> 00:29:29.580
<v Speaker 4>you got your diagnosis wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a natural law.</v>

575
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.100
<v Speaker 4>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what society you study,</v>

576
00:29:32.101 --> 00:29:32.934
<v Speaker 4>you get a prieto distribution of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get a prieto distribution of number </v>

577
00:29:35.911 --> 00:29:36.744
<v Speaker 4>of records recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll get a prieto distribution of </v>

578
00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:39.174
<v Speaker 4>number of songs written or goals scored.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like creative product has that </v>

579
00:29:42.701 --> 00:29:43.534
<v Speaker 4>characteristic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's partly because as you start to </v>

580
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 4>become successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say people will offer you more and</v>

581
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 4>more opportunities.</v>

582
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.133
<v Speaker 4>And as you start to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people move away from you and you </v>

583
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:53.290
<v Speaker 4>plummet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

584
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's rough.</v>

585
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:55.924
<v Speaker 4>So what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it means is that there is always a </v>

586
00:29:57.431 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 4>landscape of inequality and not saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we shouldn't do anything about it,</v>

587
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.240
<v Speaker 4>although I am saying that we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what to do about.</v>

588
00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.353
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you can modify the prieto </v>

589
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 4>distribution of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

590
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.743
<v Speaker 4>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know how to do it without </v>

591
00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:14.830
<v Speaker 4>maybe disrupting the system so </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely that it collapses,</v>

592
00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:17.170
<v Speaker 4>which is what happened in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 4>Union for example.</v>

593
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:18.363
<v Speaker 4>And in Mao's China,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were trying at least in principle </v>

594
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:21.424
<v Speaker 4>to adjust in equality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the cure was far worse than the </v>

595
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

596
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:26.344
<v Speaker 4>the truth of the matter is we actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know technically how much </v>

597
00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 4>inequality there has to be to generate </v>
<v Speaker 4>wealth.</v>

598
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.460
<v Speaker 4>We can guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could say,</v>

599
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:35.110
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there should be less than you might say,</v>

600
00:30:35.111 --> 00:30:36.880
<v Speaker 4>well there should be more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're left wing,</v>

601
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:38.740
<v Speaker 4>you'd say less than if they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're right wing,</v>

602
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:39.251
<v Speaker 4>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

603
00:30:39.251 --> 00:30:40.084
<v Speaker 4>we'll just let the inequality flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we do know that it's inevitable and </v>

604
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 4>we also know that we don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulate it.</v>

605
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.823
<v Speaker 4>So there is inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What that means is there's always gonna </v>

606
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.780
<v Speaker 4>be people around that are better at </v>
<v Speaker 4>something than you are.</v>

607
00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.160
<v Speaker 4>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a,</v>

608
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.263
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem because you can get </v>
<v Speaker 4>jealous and you can get bitter and you </v>

609
00:30:57.701 --> 00:31:00.580
<v Speaker 4>can get resentful and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get hopeless,</v>

610
00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:01.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you look like,</v>

611
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.900
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this friend of mine,</v>

612
00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:09.430
<v Speaker 4>he told me something so funny he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was decrying his,</v>

613
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.443
<v Speaker 4>his lack of success in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he compared himself to his roommate </v>

614
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.660
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>know his roommate,</v>

615
00:31:16.661 --> 00:31:18.880
<v Speaker 4>his college roommate was doing much </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than he was.</v>

616
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.430
<v Speaker 4>And his bloody roommate was Elon Musk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

617
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.360
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

618
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.960
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not doing as well as Elon Musk.</v>

619
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:27.603
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see it would take it rather </v>

620
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.430
<v Speaker 4>personally because they were roommates </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything.</v>

621
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like he was doing badly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he wasn't doing pretty damn well.</v>

622
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:36.580
<v Speaker 4>It's not as good as Elon Musk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

623
00:31:36.581 --> 00:31:39.700
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you and 7 billion other people,</v>

624
00:31:39.701 --> 00:31:40.534
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I thought it was instructive </v>

625
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:43.970
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

626
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:44.933
<v Speaker 4>he has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be careful who you compare </v>

627
00:31:46.591 --> 00:31:47.424
<v Speaker 4>yourself to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you can't just not compare yourself </v>

628
00:31:49.951 --> 00:31:51.780
<v Speaker 4>to others to successful people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

629
00:31:51.781 --> 00:31:53.310
<v Speaker 4>Because then you don't have anything to </v>
<v Speaker 4>emap.</v>

630
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.830
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 4>young,</v>

631
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:56.783
<v Speaker 4>this was a cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make a real lateral move </v>

632
00:31:58.261 --> 00:31:59.670
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Young thought.</v>

633
00:31:59.671 --> 00:32:00.504
<v Speaker 4>The book of revelation was appended to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Bible because of the Christ in the </v>

634
00:32:04.321 --> 00:32:05.910
<v Speaker 4>Gospels was to merciful.</v>

635
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.250
<v Speaker 4>He was too nice a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he's an ideal,</v>

636
00:32:08.251 --> 00:32:09.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Young said,</v>

637
00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:11.700
<v Speaker 4>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An ideal is always a judge.</v>

638
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.013
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about an ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're not as good as your </v>

639
00:32:15.151 --> 00:32:15.984
<v Speaker 4>ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your ideal is a judge and revelation </v>

640
00:32:17.791 --> 00:32:18.624
<v Speaker 4>has Christ coming back as a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was humans explanation at the </v>

641
00:32:21.691 --> 00:32:22.524
<v Speaker 4>level of the collective unconscious for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the pasting of that remarkably strange </v>

642
00:32:25.771 --> 00:32:28.350
<v Speaker 4>and terrible book onto the end of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

643
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.440
<v Speaker 4>of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

644
00:32:31.441 --> 00:32:32.274
<v Speaker 4>my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is an ideal is if you need an ideal </v>

645
00:32:33.961 --> 00:32:34.794
<v Speaker 4>because you have nothing to aim at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but an ideal as a judge and you always </v>

646
00:32:37.291 --> 00:32:38.124
<v Speaker 4>fall short of the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how the hell can you have the </v>

647
00:32:40.341 --> 00:32:45.341
<v Speaker 4>benefits of having an ideal without </v>
<v Speaker 4>having the crushing blow that goes along</v>

648
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 4>with having the judge that always </v>
<v Speaker 4>regards.</v>

649
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:48.464
<v Speaker 4>He was insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was trying to work that out in the </v>

650
00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:51.014
<v Speaker 4>chapter and this is something I've had </v>
<v Speaker 4>to work out a lot as a clinical </v>

651
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:54.470
<v Speaker 4>psychologist.</v>

652
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:59.090
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well let's say you need a goal,</v>

653
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:03.140
<v Speaker 4>but we don't want to let your distance </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the goal crush you.</v>

654
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.860
<v Speaker 4>So you got to set up a goal and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>gotta make the goal,</v>

655
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.723
<v Speaker 4>break the goal down into parts so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can move towards it and you have a </v>

656
00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:13.370
<v Speaker 4>fairly high likelihood of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a bit a bit of practical.</v>

657
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.670
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say advice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because it's better than advice.</v>

658
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 4>It's some practical knowledge about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go about achieving an ame.</v>

659
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 4>Set a high aim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but differentiated down so you know what</v>

660
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:24.494
<v Speaker 4>the next step is and then make the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>step difficult enough so you have to </v>

661
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:29.720
<v Speaker 4>push yourself past where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

662
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 4>but also provide yourself with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonable probability of success.</v>

663
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.510
<v Speaker 4>It's also what you do with children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

664
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.500
<v Speaker 4>You want to push them because they need </v>
<v Speaker 4>to grow up and be more than they are.</v>

665
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.333
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you don't want to crush them with </v>

666
00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:42.104
<v Speaker 4>constant failure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what you do is aim high and make the </v>

667
00:33:44.901 --> 00:33:48.230
<v Speaker 4>goal approximate difficult but proximal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

668
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.420
<v Speaker 4>so that's one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

669
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.290
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one way of looking at it.</v>

670
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 4>But then the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

671
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

672
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.360
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had clients,</v>

673
00:33:56.361 --> 00:33:58.850
<v Speaker 4>many clients in their thirties who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to.</v>

674
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.013
<v Speaker 4>This is more true with women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say a lot of women who are very </v>

675
00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:03.074
<v Speaker 4>high achieving who established their </v>
<v Speaker 4>career goals at 30 and then want to </v>

676
00:34:06.801 --> 00:34:08.930
<v Speaker 4>differentiate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>differentiate out their life.</v>

677
00:34:08.931 --> 00:34:10.730
<v Speaker 4>They want to have a husband and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to have a family.</v>

678
00:34:10.731 --> 00:34:12.080
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to figure out how to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

679
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.810
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things I've noticed that </v>
<v Speaker 4>around 30,</v>

680
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.380
<v Speaker 4>you really have to stop comparing </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself in some ways to other people.</v>

681
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:19.603
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularities of your life are so </v>

682
00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:25.300
<v Speaker 4>idiosyncratic that there isn't anyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>really all that much like you,</v>

683
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.173
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the details of your life </v>

684
00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:28.430
<v Speaker 4>happened to matter.</v>

685
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.030
<v Speaker 4>And so maybe you compare yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 4>some rockstar or something like that and</v>

686
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.113
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person's rich and famous and </v>

687
00:34:34.101 --> 00:34:35.540
<v Speaker 4>glamorous and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

688
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:36.374
<v Speaker 4>they're alcoholic and they use too much </v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine and they've had three divorces </v>

689
00:34:38.661 --> 00:34:39.494
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the hell do you make sense out of </v>

690
00:34:41.751 --> 00:34:42.584
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that someone that you should judge </v>

691
00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:44.714
<v Speaker 4>yourself harshly against,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are not managers is you don't know </v>

692
00:34:46.701 --> 00:34:48.590
<v Speaker 4>because you don't know all the details </v>
<v Speaker 4>of their lives.</v>

693
00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:51.560
<v Speaker 4>And who do you know that you can compare</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself to?</v>

694
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:57.010
<v Speaker 4>That's easy you yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's a good goal.</v>

695
00:34:57.111 --> 00:34:57.950
<v Speaker 4>It's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

696
00:34:57.951 --> 00:35:00.200
<v Speaker 4>aim high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I really mean that.</v>

697
00:35:00.201 --> 00:35:01.034
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll talk about that a little bit to </v>

698
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.630
<v Speaker 4>aim high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but use as your control yourself.</v>

699
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:06.493
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so your goal is to make today some tiny </v>

700
00:35:09.561 --> 00:35:12.500
<v Speaker 4>increment better than yesterday and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can use better.</v>

701
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.333
<v Speaker 4>You can define better yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This doesn't have to be some imposition </v>

702
00:35:16.011 --> 00:35:17.390
<v Speaker 4>of external morality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

703
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.310
<v Speaker 4>you know where you're weak and </v>
<v Speaker 4>insufficient,</v>

704
00:35:19.311 --> 00:35:20.840
<v Speaker 4>where you could improve fake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

705
00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 4>well this is what I'm like yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I did this little thing,</v>

706
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:29.750
<v Speaker 4>things would be just an increment better</v>
<v Speaker 4>and well,</v>

707
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:33.980
<v Speaker 4>that's a great thing because you get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ball rolling and incremental improvement</v>

708
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:34.814
<v Speaker 4>is unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can actually implement it and it </v>

709
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 4>starts to generate pareto distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Light consequences.</v>

710
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:43.900
<v Speaker 4>It starts to compound and I've seen that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen in people's lives over and all,</v>

711
00:35:43.901 --> 00:35:46.200
<v Speaker 4>and people write me all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell me that they're doing that,</v>

712
00:35:46.201 --> 00:35:49.410
<v Speaker 4>but I've seen that happen in people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives continually.</v>

713
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.440
<v Speaker 4>They make a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a goal that the goal should be.</v>

714
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 4>How could I conceive of my life so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>if I had that life,</v>

715
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:59.690
<v Speaker 4>it would clearly be worth living so I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't have to be bitter,</v>

716
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.260
<v Speaker 4>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deceitful,</v>

717
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.670
<v Speaker 4>arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and vengeful.</v>

718
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Like that's sort of the bottom line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

719
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.890
<v Speaker 4>Because that's what endless failure does</v>
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>

720
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.053
<v Speaker 4>It's not good and that's what life </v>
<v Speaker 4>without purpose and a goal does to you </v>

721
00:36:13.381 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 4>as well because life is very hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you think,</v>

722
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:16.224
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I need to adopt a mode of being </v>

723
00:36:18.031 --> 00:36:22.500
<v Speaker 4>that would justify my suffering and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can ask yourself that question.</v>

724
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.260
<v Speaker 4>What would make this worthwhile need a </v>
<v Speaker 4>quote Nietzsche?</v>

725
00:36:26.261 --> 00:36:30.480
<v Speaker 4>I think in that chapter he said he who </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a why can bear almost.</v>

726
00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:33.140
<v Speaker 4>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a lovely lied man.</v>

727
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:36.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a lovely line and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>really worth thinking about.</v>

728
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:37.284
<v Speaker 4>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

729
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.370
<v Speaker 4>how do I manage all this misery and </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering and futility?</v>

730
00:36:41.371 --> 00:36:42.121
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

731
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:42.954
<v Speaker 4>I need to figure out what I would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do in order to make that clearly </v>

732
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:47.364
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so then you have your goal and then </v>

733
00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:49.410
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

734
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:50.243
<v Speaker 4>I need to move towards that </v>
<v Speaker 4>incrementally because I'm kind of </v>

735
00:36:52.531 --> 00:36:55.530
<v Speaker 4>useless and can only do so much and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe not even that,</v>

736
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.280
<v Speaker 4>but all I have to do is be a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than my,</v>

737
00:36:58.690 --> 00:36:59.523
<v Speaker 4>my miserable self yesterday and that'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>propel you forward very rapidly and you </v>

738
00:37:04.351 --> 00:37:05.340
<v Speaker 4>can succeed at it.</v>

739
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.670
<v Speaker 4>Which is also really lovely because why </v>
<v Speaker 4>not set yourself up for success,</v>

740
00:37:08.671 --> 00:37:09.504
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise you drove around like </v>

741
00:37:10.711 --> 00:37:13.410
<v Speaker 4>a number 10 lobster and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just not good.</v>

742
00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:16.440
<v Speaker 4>You get a pinchy when that happens and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a good thing.</v>

743
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.590
<v Speaker 4>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was chapter four,</v>

744
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:25.100
<v Speaker 4>chapter five g's recruiting long here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chapter five is the one that I thought I</v>

745
00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:27.000
<v Speaker 4>would get in the most trouble for </v>
<v Speaker 4>writing.</v>

746
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.863
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I figured people would be all over me </v>

747
00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:29.874
<v Speaker 4>for this and so far they haven't been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they still might be so in it's </v>

748
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:37.800
<v Speaker 4>called do not let your children do </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that makes you dislike them.</v>

749
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.630
<v Speaker 4>And I thought that would be contentious </v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all because people would think,</v>

750
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.790
<v Speaker 4>well I never just like my children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like</v>

751
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.250
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

752
00:37:49.251 --> 00:37:52.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to really tell me that God</v>

753
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:54.900
<v Speaker 4>when there's a more.</v>

754
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.210
<v Speaker 4>There's a more horrifying element to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that too.</v>

755
00:37:57.211 --> 00:38:01.140
<v Speaker 4>Because as a clinical psychologist I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>seen the full Friday of nightmare.</v>

756
00:38:01.141 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

757
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:04.853
<v Speaker 4>I've seen families where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like the family members are </v>

758
00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:09.900
<v Speaker 4>standing in a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say,</v>

759
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:10.913
<v Speaker 4>and each of them has their hands around </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other's neck and they're squeezing </v>

760
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:20.300
<v Speaker 4>hard enough to strangle the other person</v>
<v Speaker 4>in 20 years and that's the family.</v>

761
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.710
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

762
00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:25.200
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you haven't met a family like that or</v>

763
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.150
<v Speaker 4>well then you're not paying attention </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there is,</v>

764
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 4>there's some reasonable possibility that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're actually in a family like that.</v>

765
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:37.810
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that parents can't dislike </v>
<v Speaker 4>their children,</v>

766
00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:40.090
<v Speaker 4>it's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how naive can you get?</v>

767
00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:43.810
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just if you think that man,</v>

768
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.740
<v Speaker 4>you don't even know where you start to </v>
<v Speaker 4>straighten yourself out high could never</v>

769
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:48.930
<v Speaker 4>disliked my children's.</v>

770
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.193
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well those are the people who produce </v>

771
00:38:51.461 --> 00:38:53.860
<v Speaker 4>the most monstrous children too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you that.</v>

772
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:55.480
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

773
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:58.000
<v Speaker 4>and then there's this idea that young </v>
<v Speaker 4>had,</v>

774
00:38:58.001 --> 00:38:58.834
<v Speaker 4>which I really love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the idea of the shadow and you </v>

775
00:39:00.811 --> 00:39:01.644
<v Speaker 4>know it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it Kinda got pop psychology and trendy </v>

776
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:04.893
<v Speaker 4>sort of among the new age types too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But one thing I can tell you about Carl </v>

777
00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 4>young is no matter what else someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>might say about him,</v>

778
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.213
<v Speaker 4>he is absolutely not new age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you read Carl young and you </v>

779
00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:18.910
<v Speaker 4>understand them and you're not terrified</v>
<v Speaker 4>right to the depths of your soul,</v>

780
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.863
<v Speaker 4>you haven't understood a damn thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've read and one of the things that </v>

781
00:39:22.601 --> 00:39:25.840
<v Speaker 4>you said about the shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the dark side of humanity,</v>

782
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:26.674
<v Speaker 4>the dark side of each individual was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that its roots reached all the way to </v>

783
00:39:29.231 --> 00:39:31.120
<v Speaker 4>hell and he meant something.</v>

784
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.900
<v Speaker 4>He meant something very specific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both metaphysical and practical.</v>

785
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:39.930
<v Speaker 4>By that the metaphysical element was he </v>
<v Speaker 4>meant hell literally and metaphysically,</v>

786
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:40.864
<v Speaker 4>but he also meant the more proximal </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of hell and so what he meant was </v>

787
00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:48.931
<v Speaker 4>that if you were able to understand your</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark side than you would see in yourself</v>

788
00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 4>a reflection of the behavior that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was present at Auschwitz,</v>

789
00:39:52.571 --> 00:39:53.404
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that the reason that people don't </v>

790
00:39:55.001 --> 00:39:58.000
<v Speaker 4>take the dark side of themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously at all,</v>

791
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.863
<v Speaker 4>even confront the fact that it exists is</v>
<v Speaker 4>because no one wants to see that </v>

792
00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:06.610
<v Speaker 4>reflected within them and no wonder like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely no wonder.</v>

793
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:07.563
<v Speaker 4>You also believed that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>confrontation with the shadow was an </v>

794
00:40:10.631 --> 00:40:13.900
<v Speaker 4>inevitable barrier to enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That there was no.</v>

795
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.430
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joseph Campbell,</v>

796
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.310
<v Speaker 4>who was a popularizer of young to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree,</v>

797
00:40:18.311 --> 00:40:21.300
<v Speaker 4>has become well known for saying follow </v>
<v Speaker 4>your bliss and,</v>

798
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.910
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

799
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:27.190
<v Speaker 4>Campbell learned virtually everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>you knew from young but young that isn't</v>

800
00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:28.330
<v Speaker 4>what young said at all.</v>

801
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.163
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pursue what's meaningful and you'll </v>

802
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 4>encounter or that which you least want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to encounter.</v>

803
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.830
<v Speaker 4>And that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the dragon,</v>

804
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:38.230
<v Speaker 4>that's the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The towards gold for example.</v>

805
00:40:38.231 --> 00:40:39.064
<v Speaker 4>And the dragon is also something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives inside you and it's not something </v>

806
00:40:42.581 --> 00:40:45.160
<v Speaker 4>that you take the encounter with </v>
<v Speaker 4>lightly.</v>

807
00:40:45.161 --> 00:40:45.994
<v Speaker 4>There are very old stories about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this story about the God horus </v>

808
00:40:49.151 --> 00:40:53.560
<v Speaker 4>who was Egyptian savior in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when he encountered evil,</v>

809
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.010
<v Speaker 4>even though he was a god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he lost an eye in the battle.</v>

810
00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.500
<v Speaker 4>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the famous Egyptian I,</v>

811
00:40:59.501 --> 00:41:00.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that everyone still knows about.</v>

812
00:41:00.971 --> 00:41:01.804
<v Speaker 4>That's the eye of horus that was torn </v>
<v Speaker 4>out by seth who is the precursor to </v>

813
00:41:04.391 --> 00:41:07.120
<v Speaker 4>Satan and so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

814
00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:08.680
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's no joke.</v>

815
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.890
<v Speaker 4>It's no joke back to children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

816
00:41:11.891 --> 00:41:12.724
<v Speaker 4>I kind of knew this when I had my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had already undergone that to some </v>

817
00:41:16.121 --> 00:41:19.780
<v Speaker 4>degree and and understood what it meant </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a bad person,</v>

818
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:20.614
<v Speaker 4>a terrible person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things I knew that was </v>

819
00:41:23.471 --> 00:41:25.750
<v Speaker 4>that that manifested itself in families </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

820
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.420
<v Speaker 4>Tyrannical father over protective </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother,</v>

821
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:31.030
<v Speaker 4>more rarely over protective mother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical,</v>

822
00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.350
<v Speaker 4>overprotective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>father,</v>

823
00:41:32.351 --> 00:41:33.184
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's usually the other way around and </v>

824
00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:36.284
<v Speaker 4>the terrible pathological familial drama</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Freud made much of in the early </v>

825
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 4>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd seen that in many,</v>

826
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 4>many situations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dismal,</v>

827
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.280
<v Speaker 4>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>awful,</v>

828
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:47.653
<v Speaker 4>and I've seen parents punish their </v>
<v Speaker 4>children and you can also take a page </v>

829
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:54.470
<v Speaker 4>from niche if you really want to punish </v>
<v Speaker 4>your children or anyone else,</v>

830
00:41:54.471 --> 00:41:56.210
<v Speaker 4>if you have someone that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in punishing,</v>

831
00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.140
<v Speaker 4>including yourself when you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what ever punish someone,</v>

832
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:00.974
<v Speaker 4>you really want to punish for doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something wrong because now it's </v>

833
00:42:02.511 --> 00:42:04.570
<v Speaker 4>actually a bit of a relief to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

834
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.910
<v Speaker 4>that's the theme of Dostoyevsky's crime </v>
<v Speaker 4>and punishment.</v>

835
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.910
<v Speaker 4>The murderer gets away with it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a relief to him.</v>

836
00:42:10.911 --> 00:42:12.290
<v Speaker 4>When he gets caught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

837
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:13.590
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really want to punish somebody,</v>

838
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 4>wait until they do something good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you punish them.</v>

839
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.820
<v Speaker 4>Because that'll teach them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the maximize the hurt,</v>

840
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:20.654
<v Speaker 4>that way you decrease the probability </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they'll ever do anything good </v>

841
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:23.630
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'll tell you,</v>

842
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:24.464
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to have a good relationship </v>

843
00:42:25.491 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 4>with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing you don't do.</v>

844
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.280
<v Speaker 4>You Open your bloody eyes and if they do</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that you would like them to do</v>

845
00:42:31.281 --> 00:42:32.114
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you tell them how much you </v>

846
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:38.360
<v Speaker 4>appreciated the fact that that happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you hope that it replicates,</v>

847
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:39.194
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see that if there's one thing you </v>

848
00:42:42.381 --> 00:42:44.120
<v Speaker 4>can take away from tonight's lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

849
00:42:44.121 --> 00:42:46.020
<v Speaker 4>that's an extraordinarily useful thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to know.</v>

850
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:47.203
<v Speaker 4>Watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when people do something that they </v>

851
00:42:48.231 --> 00:42:49.430
<v Speaker 4>should do more of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>

852
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw that you did this specific thing.</v>

853
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.320
<v Speaker 4>I saw that it took some effort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's what it meant.</v>

854
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Here's this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's how I observed.</v>

855
00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep that up.</v>

856
00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.820
<v Speaker 4>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you love someone,</v>

857
00:42:58.821 --> 00:42:59.630
<v Speaker 4>you do that to them.</v>

858
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:00.920
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's encouragement.</v>

859
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:04.040
<v Speaker 4>That's such a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

860
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:04.874
<v Speaker 4>back to children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I already knew that I was pretty </v>

861
00:43:06.231 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 4>decent monster by the time I had kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

862
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.610
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my kid,</v>

863
00:43:10.611 --> 00:43:11.810
<v Speaker 4>my kid's little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

864
00:43:11.811 --> 00:43:15.230
<v Speaker 4>like a baby or two year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm horrible monster.</v>

865
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 4>And so that there's an uneven power </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem here.</v>

866
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:21.380
<v Speaker 4>I better not let that child do anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>that really makes me angry.</v>

867
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.120
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now you're here now.</v>

868
00:43:23.121 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 4>And then you hear about something </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible that happens.</v>

869
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 4>When I was in Boston years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read about a woman who pledged her two</v>

870
00:43:29.331 --> 00:43:31.430
<v Speaker 4>year old daughter's arms into boiling </v>
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>

871
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.301
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

872
00:43:32.301 --> 00:43:34.670
<v Speaker 4>how in the world can that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

873
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:35.683
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

874
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.740
<v Speaker 4>she's probably hung over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'd probably just lost her job.</v>

875
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.170
<v Speaker 4>She was probably desperate and six </v>
<v Speaker 4>different ways.</v>

876
00:43:42.171 --> 00:43:46.160
<v Speaker 4>She probably didn't have any decent </v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplinary disciplinary strategies for</v>

877
00:43:46.161 --> 00:43:46.580
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

878
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 4>She probably didn't have anyone helping </v>
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

879
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:49.813
<v Speaker 4>She was bitter and resentful and angry </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the child misbehaved at exactly the </v>

880
00:43:53.811 --> 00:43:55.360
<v Speaker 4>wrong moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

881
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:56.203
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be around your children </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot and so you might want to have it </v>

882
00:43:58.911 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Speaker 4>so that they don't misbehave at exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>the wrong moment because all,</v>

883
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.810
<v Speaker 4>all hell can break loose if they can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't want that to happen.</v>

884
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:06.644
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I knew that it was easy for people </v>

885
00:44:08.181 --> 00:44:09.014
<v Speaker 4>to hate their children even though they </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth the words that they love the bulk </v>

886
00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:12.284
<v Speaker 4>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw very little evidence of that many </v>

887
00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:16.880
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the things you know,</v>

888
00:44:16.881 --> 00:44:19.490
<v Speaker 4>you have a natural affinity for children</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even more,</v>

889
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:22.130
<v Speaker 4>maybe a more powerful natural affinity </v>
<v Speaker 4>for your own children.</v>

890
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:22.964
<v Speaker 4>So that's a good start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want to set them up as an </v>

891
00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:27.290
<v Speaker 4>enemy against you.</v>

892
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.123
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to allow them to engage </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the kind of hierarchical challenge </v>

893
00:44:31.411 --> 00:44:34.680
<v Speaker 4>that makes you irritable and resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a good idea.</v>

894
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.830
<v Speaker 4>And if the things they do make you </v>
<v Speaker 4>dislike them,</v>

895
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:38.813
<v Speaker 4>the probability that they will make </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people dislike them is </v>

896
00:44:40.831 --> 00:44:41.664
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you can consult your own </v>

897
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 4>irritability and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

898
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 4>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to tell my kids this,</v>

899
00:44:48.751 --> 00:44:50.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they were three or four and say,</v>

900
00:44:50.641 --> 00:44:51.474
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a very good mood and I'm likely </v>

901
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:54.054
<v Speaker 4>to be unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it'd be best if you'd go into your </v>

902
00:44:55.411 --> 00:44:56.760
<v Speaker 4>room and play for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

903
00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:57.600
<v Speaker 4>I like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

904
00:44:57.601 --> 00:44:58.800
<v Speaker 4>you're a great kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>

905
00:44:58.801 --> 00:45:00.810
<v Speaker 4>get the hell out of here for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

906
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.990
<v Speaker 4>and they were fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've trained them already at that point</v>

907
00:45:03.991 --> 00:45:06.250
<v Speaker 4>to be able to go play by themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their room,</v>

908
00:45:06.251 --> 00:45:07.084
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is something that a kid should be </v>

909
00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:08.190
<v Speaker 4>able to do anyways.</v>

910
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:09.023
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you need to know what sort of </v>

911
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.360
<v Speaker 4>monster you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to be a good parent.</v>

912
00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:13.111
<v Speaker 4>And if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

913
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:14.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

914
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:14.964
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just an unbelievably unconscious </v>

915
00:45:17.341 --> 00:45:19.590
<v Speaker 4>monster and that's actually the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

916
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:20.903
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the other thing about that </v>

917
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:22.494
<v Speaker 4>chapter is there's an idea in it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an idea that I think is well </v>

918
00:45:25.111 --> 00:45:25.944
<v Speaker 4>supported by the relevant literature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that your fundamental job as a </v>

919
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:31.200
<v Speaker 4>parent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if a child from zero to four,</v>

920
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.190
<v Speaker 4>is to make that child eminently </v>
<v Speaker 4>desirable socially.</v>

921
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:36.780
<v Speaker 4>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

922
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:41.781
<v Speaker 4>you're a successful parent if when your </v>
<v Speaker 4>child is for all sorts of other children</v>

923
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 4>want to play with him or her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really the.</v>

924
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:48.930
<v Speaker 4>That's like if you want one marker of </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you've been successful,</v>

925
00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:49.973
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now some children are a lot harder to </v>

926
00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:52.374
<v Speaker 4>get along with than others and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>children have a harder time playing and </v>

927
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:55.464
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not saying that every parent who </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a child that isn't popular at four </v>

928
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.380
<v Speaker 4>is is at fault for that.</v>

929
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying the reverse,</v>

930
00:46:03.451 --> 00:46:04.284
<v Speaker 4>which is you can be sure that you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been successful if your child is not </v>

931
00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:07.980
<v Speaker 4>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

932
00:46:07.981 --> 00:46:10.650
<v Speaker 4>but desirable as a playmate and so then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

933
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:12.270
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what have you done for your child?</v>

934
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.433
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've opened up the entire world of </v>

935
00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:16.950
<v Speaker 4>children to them so because they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to play,</v>

936
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:17.873
<v Speaker 4>which is a very deep knowledge and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts to become inculcated probably at </v>

937
00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:22.044
<v Speaker 4>the breast and certainly in the course </v>
<v Speaker 4>of rough and tumble play at about two </v>

938
00:46:25.171 --> 00:46:27.480
<v Speaker 4>years of age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a deep embodied knowledge.</v>

939
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:30.600
<v Speaker 4>They know how to play like a good well </v>
<v Speaker 4>trained dog knows how to play.</v>

940
00:46:30.601 --> 00:46:33.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you meet a new dog and he'd go like this</v>

941
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.860
<v Speaker 4>and the dog goes like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Think,</v>

942
00:46:34.861 --> 00:46:35.694
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that dog,</v>

943
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.340
<v Speaker 4>I can go like this and it will bite me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

944
00:46:38.341 --> 00:46:42.120
<v Speaker 4>It knows how to play and it's a kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's awake and alert is just like that.</v>

945
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.450
<v Speaker 4>Like a well socialized kit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you know anything about kids,</v>

946
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:46.284
<v Speaker 4>if you can take a four year old and make</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little play gesture at them and </v>

947
00:46:48.421 --> 00:46:49.254
<v Speaker 4>they'll smile right away and start </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing just right now and that's what </v>

948
00:46:51.781 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 4>you want for your kids and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere they go,</v>

949
00:46:54.121 --> 00:46:54.954
<v Speaker 4>other kids like them and we'll include </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in their play and play is the way </v>

950
00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:01.500
<v Speaker 4>that children develop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if other children include them in</v>

951
00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:02.334
<v Speaker 4>their play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the children develop and the poor </v>

952
00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:08.670
<v Speaker 4>kids that don't get befriended at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>age of four with the literature on.</v>

953
00:47:08.671 --> 00:47:09.504
<v Speaker 4>This is crystal clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your child is an outcast at the age </v>

954
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.373
<v Speaker 4>of four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probability that anything can be </v>

955
00:47:14.881 --> 00:47:18.420
<v Speaker 4>done about that is almost zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No matter what you do.</v>

956
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:21.010
<v Speaker 4>And I hate to be so blunt about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've.</v>

957
00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:24.630
<v Speaker 4>I know the literature and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the literature suggests and so.</v>

958
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:25.463
<v Speaker 4>And then the other thing is if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't allow your children to </v>

959
00:47:27.721 --> 00:47:28.554
<v Speaker 4>engage in dislikable behavior than </v>
<v Speaker 4>adults will like them because adults </v>

960
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:33.310
<v Speaker 4>actually like kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

961
00:47:33.311 --> 00:47:36.100
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I loved about having </v>
<v Speaker 4>little kids in Montreal,</v>

962
00:47:36.101 --> 00:47:38.800
<v Speaker 4>I lived in a poor area in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of rough guys around there</v>

963
00:47:38.801 --> 00:47:42.490
<v Speaker 4>and we used to roll our daughter around </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a stroller and these rough guys,</v>

964
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:45.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like God only knows what they were up to</v>

965
00:47:45.311 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rough looking guys.</v>

966
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.493
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we rolled our daughter by him and </v>

967
00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:50.950
<v Speaker 4>they'd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd like smile and they crouched down</v>

968
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:54.070
<v Speaker 4>and make a little goofy faces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were.</v>

969
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:55.563
<v Speaker 4>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the great things about having </v>

970
00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 4>little kids is they bring out the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>in other people.</v>

971
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:02.950
<v Speaker 4>You see a whole side of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even among the darker parts of humanity.</v>

972
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.320
<v Speaker 4>You see a whole side of them that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't normally see.</v>

973
00:48:05.321 --> 00:48:07.210
<v Speaker 4>And it's lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is,</v>

974
00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 4>if you're good to your kid in the real </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

975
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:13.900
<v Speaker 4>you can help them maintain that </v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendous attractiveness that they have</v>

976
00:48:13.901 --> 00:48:16.630
<v Speaker 4>as young children and to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 4>adults properly.</v>

977
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:19.660
<v Speaker 4>Like a puppy that wags its tail instead </v>
<v Speaker 4>of growls and you know,</v>

978
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:22.000
<v Speaker 4>goes for your ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then wherever they go,</v>

979
00:48:22.001 --> 00:48:22.834
<v Speaker 4>adults welcomed them and teach them </v>
<v Speaker 4>things and pat them on the head and </v>

980
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.880
<v Speaker 4>smile at them genuinely instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

981
00:48:27.881 --> 00:48:28.714
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here comes to couple with that Goddamn </v>

982
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 4>Brat again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

983
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:33.063
<v Speaker 4>which is the horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's horrible thing to do to a child </v>

984
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 4>because then everywhere they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the good,</v>

985
00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:39.363
<v Speaker 4>all the goodwill is false.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing that you can do to </v>

986
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:43.204
<v Speaker 4>someone that's more terrible than to put</v>
<v Speaker 4>them in a world where all the good will </v>

987
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.880
<v Speaker 4>direct it towards them is false.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a terrible thing.</v>

988
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.740
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what chapter.</v>

989
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:55.300
<v Speaker 4>It's chapter five and chapter six is </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

990
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.990
<v Speaker 4>It's a rough chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about,</v>

991
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:04.180
<v Speaker 4>I spend a lot of time reading about </v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarianism and about atrocity,</v>

992
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:06.250
<v Speaker 4>some brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

993
00:49:06.251 --> 00:49:07.084
<v Speaker 4>many brutal things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brutal beyond the capacity of </v>

994
00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:10.150
<v Speaker 4>imagination even.</v>

995
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:12.903
<v Speaker 4>And I read a lot about individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>criminals and serial killers and those </v>

996
00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:18.850
<v Speaker 4>sorts of people trying to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom row one book.</v>

997
00:49:18.851 --> 00:49:21.190
<v Speaker 4>I would really recommend this book by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Carl Parents,</v>

998
00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:22.024
<v Speaker 4>Ram,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a,</v>

999
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 4>an autobiography,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a ram is the name of the book,</v>

1000
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.130
<v Speaker 4>and he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a rough guy,</v>

1001
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:27.964
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his whatever his dying words to his </v>

1002
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:32.140
<v Speaker 4>executioner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to his hangman.</v>

1003
00:49:32.141 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurry up you who's your bastard?</v>

1004
00:49:33.821 --> 00:49:36.640
<v Speaker 4>I could kill 10 men in the time that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>takes you to hang me.</v>

1005
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:38.810
<v Speaker 4>That was his dying words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1006
00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:39.693
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wished the human race had one neck so </v>

1007
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:44.050
<v Speaker 4>that I could put my hands around it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>squeeze.</v>

1008
00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.513
<v Speaker 4>That was Carl Pans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ram and not many people like that write </v>

1009
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:48.503
<v Speaker 4>autobiographies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he did and he told you why he was </v>

1010
00:49:50.651 --> 00:49:53.710
<v Speaker 4>like that and why he thought that way in</v>
<v Speaker 4>case you want to find out,</v>

1011
00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:54.723
<v Speaker 4>which I would recommend by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's very useful to know such </v>

1012
00:49:56.861 --> 00:49:58.210
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um.</v>

1013
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:05.623
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to remember why I told you that </v>

1014
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:11.780
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1015
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:13.730
<v Speaker 4>Chapter six is about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about,</v>

1016
00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:15.620
<v Speaker 4>it's about pans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ram,</v>

1017
00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:16.933
<v Speaker 4>and it's about the columbine kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kids who shot up the high school </v>

1018
00:50:19.611 --> 00:50:23.180
<v Speaker 4>because I read their diaries and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I understood them to,</v>

1019
00:50:23.181 --> 00:50:25.480
<v Speaker 4>which is even better than just reading </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and you know,</v>

1020
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:28.400
<v Speaker 4>you see these mass shootings all time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone does the same thing.</v>

1021
00:50:28.401 --> 00:50:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did that happen?</v>

1022
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 4>Why did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can it be this way?</v>

1023
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:33.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1024
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.770
<v Speaker 4>why don't you read what they say about </v>
<v Speaker 4>why they did and just assume that that's</v>

1025
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:37.604
<v Speaker 4>the reason.</v>

1026
00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.520
<v Speaker 2>If you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go,</v>

1027
00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the columbine kids,</v>

1028
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:46.620
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1029
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.823
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they must've been.</v>

1030
00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>

1031
00:50:49.781 --> 00:50:50.614
<v Speaker 4>the natural response of anyone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>been bullied is to go arm yourself to </v>

1032
00:50:53.531 --> 00:50:56.920
<v Speaker 4>the teeth to plot the destruction of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire city.</v>

1033
00:50:56.921 --> 00:50:57.754
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Detroit to line your </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire high school ave with bombs and </v>

1034
00:51:01.751 --> 00:51:05.170
<v Speaker 4>then to go and shoot your classmates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens when you're bullied.</v>

1035
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:05.900
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1036
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.130
<v Speaker 4>that's not what happens when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullied as a stupid explanation.</v>

1037
00:51:09.131 --> 00:51:09.964
<v Speaker 4>It's shallow beyond belief and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it really emerges only because </v>

1038
00:51:12.851 --> 00:51:16.210
<v Speaker 4>people don't want to contend with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>real issue and the columbine kids,</v>

1039
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:17.980
<v Speaker 4>while they were contending with the real</v>
<v Speaker 4>issue,</v>

1040
00:51:17.981 --> 00:51:18.814
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they basically said quite forthrightly </v>

1041
00:51:20.201 --> 00:51:24.480
<v Speaker 4>that in their own arrogant estimation </v>
<v Speaker 4>being itself was corrupted,</v>

1042
00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.353
<v Speaker 4>unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it would be best if it was </v>

1043
00:51:26.501 --> 00:51:28.870
<v Speaker 4>eradicated in the most brutal possible </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1044
00:51:28.871 --> 00:51:32.080
<v Speaker 4>as fast as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you get to places like that.</v>

1045
00:51:32.081 --> 00:51:36.460
<v Speaker 4>If you dwell on revenge for three or </v>
<v Speaker 4>four years in your mom's basement,</v>

1046
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go to very dark places.</v>

1047
00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:41.470
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what chapter six is about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1048
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.433
<v Speaker 4>pans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ram,</v>

1049
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.570
<v Speaker 4>who was very brutally treated when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a kid and the column by guys who,</v>

1050
00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:47.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had their ups and downs,</v>

1051
00:51:47.921 --> 00:51:51.910
<v Speaker 4>but nothing compared to Carl Patty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Patty's Ramsay were,</v>

1052
00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.313
<v Speaker 4>were judges of being and decided that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was flawed and that they were the ones </v>

1053
00:51:57.851 --> 00:52:00.820
<v Speaker 4>to set it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a rough chapter,</v>

1054
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:03.543
<v Speaker 4>but it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a meditation on resentment because </v>

1055
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:09.430
<v Speaker 4>resentment is a key human motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say it's,</v>

1056
00:52:09.431 --> 00:52:11.370
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a great teacher to,</v>

1057
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:15.220
<v Speaker 4>to listen to your resentment is one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best things you can possibly do.</v>

1058
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:16.083
<v Speaker 4>You have to admit that it exists first </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you have to admit to the </v>

1059
00:52:18.821 --> 00:52:19.654
<v Speaker 4>fantasies that it's generating and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to admit to what you would regard </v>

1060
00:52:22.961 --> 00:52:23.794
<v Speaker 4>as the way out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's all very difficult because it </v>

1061
00:52:27.341 --> 00:52:29.860
<v Speaker 4>means learning things about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you probably don't want to learn,</v>

1062
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:34.900
<v Speaker 4>but resentment only means one of two </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1063
00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:37.090
<v Speaker 4>It means either like shut the hell up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow up,</v>

1064
00:52:37.091 --> 00:52:38.560
<v Speaker 4>quit whining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and get on with it.</v>

1065
00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:43.450
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing it means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or someone is playing the tyrant to you,</v>

1066
00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:44.523
<v Speaker 4>might even be you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have something to say and do </v>

1067
00:52:46.391 --> 00:52:48.970
<v Speaker 4>that you should say and do to put it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>a stop.</v>

1068
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:53.230
<v Speaker 4>And so maybe and resentment can show you</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pathway to doing that.</v>

1069
00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:56.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a meditation on resentment.</v>

1070
00:52:56.891 --> 00:52:57.724
<v Speaker 4>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the principles that I extracted </v>

1071
00:53:01.061 --> 00:53:04.240
<v Speaker 4>from that is like a resentful person </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants other people to change.</v>

1072
00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.810
<v Speaker 4>And if you're resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then your motivations are trustworthy.</v>

1073
00:53:07.811 --> 00:53:08.561
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very,</v>

1074
00:53:08.561 --> 00:53:11.890
<v Speaker 4>very dark and that's why I went to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme with people like pens,</v>

1075
00:53:11.891 --> 00:53:13.120
<v Speaker 4>Rehmann,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the columbine killers.</v>

1076
00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.373
<v Speaker 4>I'm resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who want to change the world are </v>

1077
00:53:17.351 --> 00:53:21.190
<v Speaker 4>not to be trusted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What should you do instead?</v>

1078
00:53:21.191 --> 00:53:23.110
<v Speaker 4>How do you treat your own resentment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

1079
00:53:23.111 --> 00:53:24.190
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a.</v>

1080
00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 4>there's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read this great</v>

1081
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.963
<v Speaker 3>line in the Tsl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eot play called the cocktail party and </v>

1082
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:32.580
<v Speaker 3>in it this woman comes up to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrist,</v>

1083
00:53:32.581 --> 00:53:34.890
<v Speaker 3>I think this is in this chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she says,</v>

1084
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:37.470
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a really rough time of it.</v>

1085
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:39.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm suffering badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My life is not going well.</v>

1086
00:53:39.591 --> 00:53:40.710
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then she says,</v>

1087
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 3>I hope that there's something wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

1088
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:46.530
<v Speaker 3>And the psychiatrist says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the Hell do you mean by that?</v>

1089
00:53:46.531 --> 00:53:47.364
<v Speaker 3>And she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1090
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:48.323
<v Speaker 3>here's how I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's either something wrong with the </v>

1091
00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:53.610
<v Speaker 3>world and I'm just in it and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1092
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 3>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do about that?</v>

1093
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:56.754
<v Speaker 3>Because it's the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe I could be fortunate and </v>

1094
00:53:58.891 --> 00:53:59.724
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with me that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>causing all this unnecessary suffering </v>

1095
00:54:02.371 --> 00:54:06.480
<v Speaker 3>and if I could just set it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could learn and I can set it right.</v>

1096
00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:11.310
<v Speaker 3>And so while I've been thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that for a very long time,</v>

1097
00:54:11.311 --> 00:54:12.144
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1098
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.100
<v Speaker 3>if your life isn't going the way it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1099
00:54:14.101 --> 00:54:14.934
<v Speaker 3>you can find someone else to blame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty convenient for you and </v>

1100
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:21.090
<v Speaker 3>also relatively easy or you could think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1101
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't like life.</v>

1102
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the way my life is </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfolding.</v>

1103
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:28.483
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I don't like life in general </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's tragic and tainted with </v>

1104
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.633
<v Speaker 3>evil.</v>

1105
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:38.540
<v Speaker 3>How do I know if my judgment is </v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate?</v>

1106
00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.180
<v Speaker 3>And the question is what have I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>done?</v>

1107
00:54:41.181 --> 00:54:42.014
<v Speaker 3>Everything I possibly could to set my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life straight because maybe I shouldn't </v>

1108
00:54:45.501 --> 00:54:46.334
<v Speaker 3>be judging it's quality or the quality </v>
<v Speaker 3>of life itself or being itself for that </v>

1109
00:54:50.451 --> 00:54:51.284
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I haven't done everything I possibly </v>

1110
00:54:53.241 --> 00:54:56.920
<v Speaker 3>could to set my life straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

1111
00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:01.040
<v Speaker 3>So there's a task,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn who I'm a great,</v>

1112
00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm a great admirer of social hits and </v>
<v Speaker 3>his book,</v>

1113
00:55:03.291 --> 00:55:04.124
<v Speaker 3>the Gulag Archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the things that brought </v>

1114
00:55:05.391 --> 00:55:06.224
<v Speaker 3>down the Soviet Union and he said that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one man who stopped lying could bring </v>

1115
00:55:09.081 --> 00:55:09.914
<v Speaker 3>down a tyranny and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that with some authority that I </v>

1116
00:55:12.891 --> 00:55:13.724
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could easily make the case </v>

1117
00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:18.230
<v Speaker 3>that the Gulag archipelago is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest book of the 20th century.</v>

1118
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's other contenders obviously,</v>

1119
00:55:20.091 --> 00:55:22.760
<v Speaker 3>but he said when he was in the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 3>camps,</v>

1120
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:25.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditating on how the hell he got there.</v>

1121
00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.780
<v Speaker 3>And he had a rough life man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1122
00:55:26.781 --> 00:55:27.614
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was on the Russian front at the </v>

1123
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:30.493
<v Speaker 3>beginning of world war two and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was thrown in the gulag camps and that </v>

1124
00:55:32.211 --> 00:55:34.040
<v Speaker 3>was just the beginning of his adventures</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1125
00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:36.130
<v Speaker 3>He had a rough life and he was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>camps.</v>

1126
00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.030
<v Speaker 3>He was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>

1127
00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1128
00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.030
<v Speaker 3>how did I get here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

1129
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:43.910
<v Speaker 3>And he had Hitler and Stalin to blame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1130
00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:46.430
<v Speaker 3>So if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you need someone to blame man,</v>

1131
00:55:46.431 --> 00:55:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Hitler and Stalin that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

1132
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:49.880
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1133
00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:52.450
<v Speaker 3>that isn't what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he meditated for awhile.</v>

1134
00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Once he realized that he might have </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to do with in some strange way</v>

1135
00:55:56.571 --> 00:55:59.780
<v Speaker 3>with the way things turned out for him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said he went over his life with a</v>

1136
00:55:59.781 --> 00:56:02.180
<v Speaker 3>fine tooth comb in his memory and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

1137
00:56:02.181 --> 00:56:04.790
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did I go wrong?</v>

1138
00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:06.260
<v Speaker 3>But by my own judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1139
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:07.160
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

1140
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:08.023
<v Speaker 3>when there was a path in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did I take the path that I knew I </v>

1141
00:56:11.151 --> 00:56:12.920
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you all know that,</v>

1142
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:13.783
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1143
00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:16.500
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you don't know if what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is good or,</v>

1144
00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.980
<v Speaker 3>or if it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just ignorance.</v>

1145
00:56:18.981 --> 00:56:19.814
<v Speaker 3>You just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes you have bloody well know </v>

1146
00:56:21.471 --> 00:56:23.410
<v Speaker 3>and you do the thing you know you </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't do anyways.</v>

1147
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:27.070
<v Speaker 3>That happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why do you do that?</v>

1148
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Spiked is part of it stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of reasons,</v>

1149
00:56:30.341 --> 00:56:32.740
<v Speaker 3>but you certainly know you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as units and thought,</v>

1150
00:56:32.741 --> 00:56:33.574
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what would happen if I took </v>

1151
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:37.930
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for where I am in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentration camp?</v>

1152
00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 3>And then I went over my whole life and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to figure out all the things I did</v>

1153
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:43.720
<v Speaker 3>that were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By my own estimation,</v>

1154
00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:44.793
<v Speaker 3>that increase the probability that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would get here and then what would </v>

1155
00:56:47.051 --> 00:56:47.884
<v Speaker 3>happen if I tried to set them all right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now in the present and that's why he </v>

1156
00:56:51.521 --> 00:56:54.130
<v Speaker 3>wrote the Gulag archipelago and one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of that,</v>

1157
00:56:54.131 --> 00:56:54.964
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it sped the dissolution of the </v>

1158
00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Empire.</v>

1159
00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.090
<v Speaker 3>So hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not bad.</v>

1160
00:56:59.091 --> 00:57:03.050
<v Speaker 3>A like you make a real confession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really repent you,</v>

1161
00:57:03.051 --> 00:57:03.884
<v Speaker 3>you do your penance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is writing this book and you </v>

1162
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:09.370
<v Speaker 3>completely changed the Geo political </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape of the world.</v>

1163
00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:10.493
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that's worth thinking about </v>

1164
00:57:11.981 --> 00:57:13.840
<v Speaker 3>because it's not only Solzhenitsyn who </v>
<v Speaker 3>did that,</v>

1165
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Nelson Mandela did something quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar.</v>

1166
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:16.803
<v Speaker 3>It's not so impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea that what you should do </v>

1167
00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:24.040
<v Speaker 3>if you're feeling resentful about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature of being,</v>

1168
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:25.720
<v Speaker 3>are suffering too much for your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1169
00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:27.910
<v Speaker 3>let's say is straightened the damn thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1170
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Like seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try it for a year.</v>

1171
00:57:30.041 --> 00:57:30.874
<v Speaker 3>Even try it for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try Not doing the things you know you </v>

1172
00:57:34.661 --> 00:57:38.980
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try Not saying the things you know to be</v>

1173
00:57:38.981 --> 00:57:43.000
<v Speaker 3>false and just watch what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might as well give it a shot,</v>

1174
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:44.110
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you say,</v>

1175
00:57:44.111 --> 00:57:45.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all in for a year,</v>

1176
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:47.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do things right,</v>

1177
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:48.873
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll just stand back and watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>how things unfold and maybe I'll </v>

1178
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.920
<v Speaker 3>reconsider at the end of that year.</v>

1179
00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try it,</v>

1180
00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.050
<v Speaker 3>try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1181
00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:03.010
<v Speaker 3>I would say I've had thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>letters now from people who are saying,</v>

1182
00:58:03.011 --> 00:58:03.791
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried that,</v>

1183
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:07.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and her worked.</v>

1184
00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:10.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I quit lying and everything quit.</v>

1185
00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.640
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen that simpsons episode </v>
<v Speaker 3>where sideshow Bob keeps stepping on the</v>

1186
00:58:15.641 --> 00:58:16.474
<v Speaker 3>rake over and over whole yard is </v>
<v Speaker 3>littered with rakes and all he does is </v>

1187
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:23.950
<v Speaker 3>walk around and step and then curse </v>
<v Speaker 3>steps on a rake and hits him in the face</v>

1188
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:26.240
<v Speaker 3>and he curse isn't any steps on another </v>
<v Speaker 3>rake and it,</v>

1189
00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:30.220
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop doing that.</v>

1190
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:32.160
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1191
00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:42.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if we'll get through all 12</v>
<v Speaker 3>rules.</v>

1193
00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Guess you'll have to read the damn book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>

1194
00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Rule seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rule seven just about killed me.</v>

1195
00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a lot of bad health in the last</v>

1196
00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:54.493
<v Speaker 3>year and having to rewrite rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven coincided with one of those </v>

1197
00:58:57.801 --> 00:58:58.634
<v Speaker 3>periods that lasted about a month and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was was the hardest chapter by far and </v>

1198
00:59:02.301 --> 00:59:06.020
<v Speaker 3>it went down the deepest by far and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was really hard to get right.</v>

1199
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:10.160
<v Speaker 3>It's called do what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is expedient,</v>

1200
00:59:10.161 --> 00:59:10.994
<v Speaker 3>and I'll just tell you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the chapter because I figured </v>

1201
00:59:13.041 --> 00:59:15.950
<v Speaker 3>something out in it that hadn't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>explained it.</v>

1202
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Something that took me decades to figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1203
00:59:17.751 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 3>So there's this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very deep Christian idea that the</v>

1204
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Messiah is the person who takes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world sins upon himself,</v>

1205
00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:27.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a characteristic of Christ,</v>

1206
00:59:27.471 --> 00:59:28.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it's something.</v>

1207
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:31.250
<v Speaker 3>The idea is something like Christ died </v>
<v Speaker 3>for your sins.</v>

1208
00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 3>It's like what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell does that mean?</v>

1209
00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1210
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:35.653
<v Speaker 3>and partly what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would say a slightly corrupted </v>

1211
00:59:38.031 --> 00:59:38.864
<v Speaker 3>form of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you just have to believe that </v>

1212
00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:42.200
<v Speaker 3>that happened in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're redeemed.</v>

1213
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:44.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's.</v>

1214
00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:47.390
<v Speaker 3>We'll leave that aside for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's an idea there,</v>

1215
00:59:47.391 --> 00:59:49.790
<v Speaker 3>a psychological idea and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

1216
00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 3>the idea doesn't go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's lasted for thousands of years.</v>

1217
00:59:53.151 --> 00:59:53.984
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1218
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 3>so the idea signifies something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a psychological reality,</v>

1219
00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 3>independent of it's metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>

1220
01:00:00.021 --> 01:00:00.854
<v Speaker 3>whatever that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I thought about that for a long </v>

1221
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:03.434
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1222
01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.420
<v Speaker 3>what in the world does that possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean?</v>

1223
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.310
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you knew this,</v>

1224
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Carl Yoga knew this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was associated with this idea of</v>

1225
01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:11.480
<v Speaker 3>the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1226
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:15.770
<v Speaker 3>I had this client once who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her parents man,</v>

1227
01:00:15.771 --> 01:00:16.910
<v Speaker 3>they were pieces of work.</v>

1228
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her parents taught her,</v>

1229
01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:20.114
<v Speaker 3>I swear to you that this is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her parents taught her that adults were </v>

1230
01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.093
<v Speaker 3>angels literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I saw her she was about 30 and </v>

1231
01:00:29.061 --> 01:00:31.940
<v Speaker 3>she had a lot of strange symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>symptoms of sorts.</v>

1232
01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:34.950
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen a psychosomatic symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1233
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:36.650
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1234
01:00:36.651 --> 01:00:38.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had kind of like,</v>

1235
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:41.220
<v Speaker 3>cause I epileptic seizures at night and </v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1236
01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.180
<v Speaker 3>but she stayed conscious during them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a very difficult to understand it</v>

1237
01:00:44.181 --> 01:00:45.290
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't walk through it,</v>

1238
01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:48.990
<v Speaker 3>but her parents told her that adults </v>
<v Speaker 3>were angels and uh,</v>

1239
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.713
<v Speaker 3>and she was like 28,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had a university degree in and I </v>

1240
01:00:53.721 --> 01:00:54.554
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1241
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:58.670
<v Speaker 3>didn't you ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder about that?</v>

1242
01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:00.410
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't you read any history?</v>

1243
01:01:00.411 --> 01:01:01.221
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1244
01:01:01.221 --> 01:01:02.054
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read something about the terrible </v>

1245
01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:06.410
<v Speaker 3>things that people did to each other and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just compartmentalize it.</v>

1246
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:11.600
<v Speaker 3>And that was actually the key that I use</v>
<v Speaker 3>to unlock what was wrong with her,</v>

1247
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 3>which was eventually fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I won't go into that.</v>

1248
01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.460
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I said,</v>

1249
01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:18.020
<v Speaker 3>I gave her this book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give her two books.</v>

1250
01:01:18.021 --> 01:01:20.960
<v Speaker 3>I gave her a book called the terror that</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes in the night,</v>

1251
01:01:20.961 --> 01:01:22.400
<v Speaker 3>which is a book about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1252
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:26.870
<v Speaker 3>about sleep paralysis and nightmares </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I thought that was,</v>

1253
01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.270
<v Speaker 3>what might it be bothering your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turned out that wasn't it.</v>

1254
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:32.960
<v Speaker 3>Then I give her this other book called </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinary ordinary men.</v>

1255
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:36.200
<v Speaker 3>And it's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible book,</v>

1256
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:37.063
<v Speaker 3>terrible dark book about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this police battalion that was </v>

1257
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:41.864
<v Speaker 3>moved into Poland during World War Two </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the Nazis had marched through and </v>

1258
01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:45.734
<v Speaker 3>it was all made of middle aged guys who </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't like victims of Nazi </v>

1259
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.750
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian propaganda when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

1260
01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:54.470
<v Speaker 3>They were just middle class guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like all of us,</v>

1261
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:55.300
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

1262
01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.133
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they went to to police Poland and </v>

1263
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.073
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to have to do some </v>

1264
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.793
<v Speaker 3>terrible things essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their commander told them quite </v>

1265
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.770
<v Speaker 3>forthrightly that if being involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>war time,</v>

1266
01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:10.604
<v Speaker 3>policing was too hard on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they felt that it f ethically </v>

1267
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:15.450
<v Speaker 3>violated them are psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically violated,</v>

1268
01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 3>that they could just go back to policing</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Germany.</v>

1269
01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.733
<v Speaker 3>And very few of them did big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Partly because they didn't want to </v>

1270
01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:22.920
<v Speaker 3>abandon their comrades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

1271
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:25.180
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want them to have to do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dirty work,</v>

1272
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they ended up,</v>

1273
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:27.533
<v Speaker 3>they were normal policeman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They ended up the sorts of people who </v>

1274
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:30.324
<v Speaker 3>could take naked pregnant women out into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the field and shoot them </v>

1275
01:02:32.671 --> 01:02:34.470
<v Speaker 3>in the back of the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how the book.</v>

1276
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:36.540
<v Speaker 3>That's the culmination of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

1277
01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.553
<v Speaker 3>It's very interesting to read about </v>
<v Speaker 3>their training because they were </v>

1278
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:42.450
<v Speaker 3>absolutely sickened by what they learned</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do,</v>

1279
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.500
<v Speaker 3>like physically sick and vomiting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shaking traumatized,</v>

1280
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:49.260
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't stop and if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know why,</v>

1281
01:02:49.261 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 3>then you can read the book and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1282
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:52.283
<v Speaker 3>read this book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't bloody well compartmentalize </v>

1283
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:59.340
<v Speaker 3>it and enough of that it's like read it </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're one of the dam policeman,</v>

1284
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.490
<v Speaker 3>which is how you should read history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1285
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 3>You read about Nazi Germany and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1286
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:07.320
<v Speaker 3>well I'm Oskar Schindler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had saved the Jews.</v>

1287
01:03:07.321 --> 01:03:08.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no you wouldn't.</v>

1288
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:11.843
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't because people didn't and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the probability is very high that you </v>

1289
01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:18.180
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't and all you have to do is think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it through.</v>

1290
01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:19.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and frank.</v>

1291
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:20.243
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're really going to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>your family at risk to hide a group of </v>

1292
01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:24.474
<v Speaker 3>another family in your attic for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple years while there's Nazis </v>

1293
01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:30.060
<v Speaker 3>parading the street and where if you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>exposed you will die.</v>

1294
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.433
<v Speaker 3>You're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you like very unlikely and no </v>

1295
01:03:34.741 --> 01:03:36.750
<v Speaker 3>wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not surprising that it's unlikely,</v>

1296
01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:38.970
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want to be inflating </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself with self,</v>

1297
01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.153
<v Speaker 3>with fictional heroism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without actually knowing the facts on </v>

1298
01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:44.400
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I told her to read,</v>

1299
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:46.800
<v Speaker 3>read it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to understand that</v>

1300
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:52.790
<v Speaker 3>the policemen were her and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to understand.</v>

1301
01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:55.663
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the savior is the person </v>

1302
01:04:01.901 --> 01:04:05.500
<v Speaker 3>who takes the world's sins upon himself </v>
<v Speaker 3>is exactly that.</v>

1303
01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.920
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the way that their stops being</v>

1304
01:04:11.501 --> 01:04:16.501
<v Speaker 3>Nazis is for you to know that the Nazis </v>
<v Speaker 3>were you and for you to decide not to do</v>

1305
01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:19.930
<v Speaker 3>that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to know.</v>

1306
01:04:19.931 --> 01:04:22.240
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing that people won't do.</v>

1307
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:23.463
<v Speaker 3>You have to understand that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>not only do what the Nazi camp guards </v>

1308
01:04:26.531 --> 01:04:29.260
<v Speaker 3>did an Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that you could actually enjoy it</v>

1309
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.150
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to decide that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to do that anymore.</v>

1310
01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:36.000
<v Speaker 3>And that's not an easy thing to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1311
01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Well then that's what that chapter is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1312
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.930
<v Speaker 3>So that's a rough chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1313
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a rough chapter and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>only,</v>

1314
01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:43.110
<v Speaker 3>a bit of what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1315
01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.460
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot in there and that's.</v>

1316
01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:50.461
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what.</v>

1317
01:04:50.461 --> 01:04:53.250
<v Speaker 3>That's about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chapter 10.</v>

1318
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:59.290
<v Speaker 3>It's chapter nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

1319
01:04:59.410 --> 01:04:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1320
01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:01.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting a little tired here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

1321
01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:02.524
<v Speaker 3>Chapter nine is I assume that the person</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are listening to who might know </v>

1322
01:05:04.811 --> 01:05:09.250
<v Speaker 3>something you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a chapter about conversation and</v>

1323
01:05:09.251 --> 01:05:10.084
<v Speaker 3>about the different forms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conversation takes and so chapter about </v>

1324
01:05:12.941 --> 01:05:13.774
<v Speaker 3>humility and it's a chapter book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listening and humility is it took me a </v>

1325
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:19.234
<v Speaker 3>long time to understand why there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious injunctions supporting </v>

1326
01:05:22.481 --> 01:05:23.314
<v Speaker 3>humility and understand what the word </v>
<v Speaker 3>really meant and that sort of technical </v>

1327
01:05:26.321 --> 01:05:27.154
<v Speaker 3>sense and it means something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means what you don't know is more </v>

1328
01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:30.334
<v Speaker 3>important than what you know and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lovely thing to then then what you </v>

1329
01:05:34.361 --> 01:05:36.310
<v Speaker 3>don't know can start to be your friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>who see.</v>

1330
01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:37.323
<v Speaker 3>People are very defensive about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know and for the reasons we've </v>

1331
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:40.384
<v Speaker 3>already discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is you don't know enough </v>

1332
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:44.643
<v Speaker 3>and you can tell you don't know enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>because your life is not what it could </v>

1333
01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:49.900
<v Speaker 3>be and neither is the life of the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>around you.</v>

1334
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:50.943
<v Speaker 3>You just don't know enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what that means is that every </v>

1335
01:05:54.461 --> 01:05:57.910
<v Speaker 3>time you encounter some evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ignorant,</v>

1336
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.983
<v Speaker 3>someone points it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be happy about that because </v>

1337
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:01.060
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1338
01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 3>you just told me how I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like great,</v>

1339
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:05.343
<v Speaker 3>like maybe I had to sift through a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of nonsense to get through the real </v>

1340
01:06:07.991 --> 01:06:08.824
<v Speaker 3>message that you're telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you could actually tell me some </v>

1341
01:06:11.081 --> 01:06:14.590
<v Speaker 3>way that I'm wrong and then maybe give </v>
<v Speaker 3>me a hint about how to not be wrong like</v>

1342
01:06:14.591 --> 01:06:15.424
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then I wouldn't have to be wrong </v>

1343
01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.014
<v Speaker 3>like that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that would be a good thing and and </v>

1344
01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.410
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

1345
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:24.790
<v Speaker 3>You can embark on that adventure by </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to people and if you listen to</v>

1346
01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:26.020
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will tell you.</v>

1347
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:27.543
<v Speaker 3>They'll tell you amazing things if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to them and many of those things </v>

1348
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:30.933
<v Speaker 3>are little tools that you can put in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your toolkit like Batman and then you </v>

1349
01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:36.880
<v Speaker 3>can go out into the world and use those </v>
<v Speaker 3>tools and you don't have to fall blindly</v>

1350
01:06:36.881 --> 01:06:38.710
<v Speaker 3>into a pit quite as often.</v>

1351
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:39.543
<v Speaker 3>And so the humility element as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to be right or do you want </v>

1352
01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:47.110
<v Speaker 3>to be learning and it's deeper than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1353
01:06:47.111 --> 01:06:47.944
<v Speaker 3>It's do you want to be that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical king who's already got </v>

1354
01:06:50.831 --> 01:06:51.664
<v Speaker 3>everything figured out or do you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the continually transforming hero or </v>

1355
01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:56.344
<v Speaker 3>fuel for that matter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's getting better all the time and </v>

1356
01:06:59.321 --> 01:07:04.321
<v Speaker 3>that's actually a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a deep choice and it's better to be</v>

1357
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:05.783
<v Speaker 3>the self transforming fool who's humble </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to make friends with what he or </v>

1358
01:07:09.731 --> 01:07:10.564
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't know and to listen when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people talk and listening is a </v>

1359
01:07:13.791 --> 01:07:14.624
<v Speaker 3>transformative exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if if you listen to the people in </v>

1360
01:07:17.231 --> 01:07:18.190
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1361
01:07:18.191 --> 01:07:19.024
<v Speaker 3>if you actually listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you what's wrong with them </v>

1362
01:07:21.251 --> 01:07:22.084
<v Speaker 3>and how to fix it and what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't even help it if you start </v>

1363
01:07:24.701 --> 01:07:28.920
<v Speaker 3>listening because people are so shocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you actually listen to them that they</v>

1364
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:31.840
<v Speaker 3>tell you all those sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they might not have even intended to,</v>

1365
01:07:31.841 --> 01:07:34.300
<v Speaker 3>things they don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you can.</v>

1366
01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.860
<v Speaker 3>You can work with that and so and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other thing that's so interesting,</v>

1367
01:07:38.861 --> 01:07:41.230
<v Speaker 3>you know now and then you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful conversation,</v>

1368
01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:42.064
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a good conversation with </v>

1369
01:07:42.941 --> 01:07:43.960
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You walk when you think,</v>

1370
01:07:43.961 --> 01:07:44.794
<v Speaker 3>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1371
01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:45.693
<v Speaker 3>we really connected and I know more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did when I came away from that </v>

1372
01:07:48.461 --> 01:07:50.530
<v Speaker 3>conversation and during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

1373
01:07:50.531 --> 01:07:53.450
<v Speaker 3>you're really engrossed in it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1374
01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:54.323
<v Speaker 3>that feeling of being engrossed is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling of meaning and the feeling of </v>

1375
01:07:57.581 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 3>meaning is engendered because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a transformative conversation.</v>

1376
01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:03.520
<v Speaker 3>Your brain produces that feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning for it says,</v>

1377
01:08:03.521 --> 01:08:04.354
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is exactly where you should be </v>

1378
01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:06.550
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's,</v>

1379
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:11.680
<v Speaker 3>it's the right place and time for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a great place to occupy,</v>

1380
01:08:11.681 --> 01:08:12.514
<v Speaker 3>and so a good conversation where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are listening has exactly that nature </v>

1381
01:08:16.191 --> 01:08:19.280
<v Speaker 3>and the reason it has that nature is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it is in fact transformative.</v>

1382
01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:22.070
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the truisms of clinical </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology,</v>

1383
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:22.904
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a clinical psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a huge part of what you do is just </v>

1384
01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:29.240
<v Speaker 3>listen to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they come in,</v>

1385
01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:30.103
<v Speaker 3>they're unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'd rather not be something like </v>

1386
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.080
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

1387
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:33.914
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you think you might be unhappy </v>

1388
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:37.910
<v Speaker 3>and they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have some ideas,</v>

1389
01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:38.763
<v Speaker 3>but they may have to ramble around for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a year before they figure out why </v>

1390
01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:42.344
<v Speaker 3>they're unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get rid of a bunch of reasons why </v>

1391
01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:46.880
<v Speaker 3>they thought they were unhappy that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>untrue,</v>

1392
01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:47.714
<v Speaker 3>and then you kind of get to the heart of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem and then you might ask them </v>

1393
01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:53.960
<v Speaker 3>all if you could have what you wanted so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your life would be okay,</v>

1394
01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.453
<v Speaker 3>what would that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they have to ramble around a bunch </v>

1395
01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.090
<v Speaker 3>about that because they don't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1396
01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.133
<v Speaker 3>but the listening will straighten them </v>
<v Speaker 3>out because people think by talking and </v>

1397
01:09:04.311 --> 01:09:05.144
<v Speaker 3>in order to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have someone to listen </v>

1398
01:09:06.651 --> 01:09:08.060
<v Speaker 3>because it's very hard to think.</v>

1399
01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.193
<v Speaker 3>Hardly anyone can think and even the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who can think can only think </v>

1400
01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:12.854
<v Speaker 3>about a limited number of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but almost everybody can talk and you </v>

1401
01:09:15.861 --> 01:09:16.694
<v Speaker 3>can listen to yourself talk and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone listens to you then well then </v>

1402
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.310
<v Speaker 3>you also have a foil for your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1403
01:09:22.311 --> 01:09:23.144
<v Speaker 3>Because you can watch the person when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking and see if you're boring </v>

1404
01:09:25.221 --> 01:09:28.550
<v Speaker 3>or see if you're amusing or if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>engrossing all of those things.</v>

1405
01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:31.850
<v Speaker 3>And so listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good thing.</v>

1406
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I outline a Carl Rogers dictum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a famous clinical psychologist.</v>

1407
01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:39.200
<v Speaker 3>This is another great little tip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogers said,</v>

1408
01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.120
<v Speaker 3>here's a trick to tell if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening.</v>

1409
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 3>So let's say someone lays out their </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective for you and then what you do</v>

1410
01:09:45.591 --> 01:09:46.424
<v Speaker 3>is say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1411
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.293
<v Speaker 3>here's what I think you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you said this and this and this </v>

1412
01:09:50.211 --> 01:09:51.320
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then this.</v>

1413
01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have I got what you're saying?</v>

1414
01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe the person says,</v>

1415
01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:57.043
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't been listening at all and </v>

1416
01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they have to straighten you out.</v>

1417
01:10:00.441 --> 01:10:01.800
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1418
01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:02.643
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got it.</v>

1419
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.943
<v Speaker 3>And then the nice thing about that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you summarize their argument for </v>

1420
01:10:07.461 --> 01:10:09.140
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which can be very helpful and for you,</v>

1421
01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:13.490
<v Speaker 3>but also you don't get to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person into a straw man.</v>

1422
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.170
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're arguing with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife,</v>

1423
01:10:15.171 --> 01:10:16.190
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or your husband,</v>

1424
01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:21.230
<v Speaker 3>big parties going to want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's stupid because if you win,</v>

1425
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.580
<v Speaker 3>you get to be top lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they get to be bottom lobster and if</v>

1426
01:10:25.581 --> 01:10:28.430
<v Speaker 3>you want to live with bottom lobster </v>
<v Speaker 3>then more power to you,</v>

1427
01:10:28.431 --> 01:10:30.210
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1428
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Because you don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to.</v>

1429
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 3>You want to defeat your wife in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

1430
01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:35.503
<v Speaker 3>Oh well great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if she was going to disappear </v>

1431
01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:38.300
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>

1432
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:41.600
<v Speaker 3>But like you're going to like live with </v>
<v Speaker 3>defeated,</v>

1433
01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:44.570
<v Speaker 3>miserable her for the next week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's no good.</v>

1434
01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:46.400
<v Speaker 3>So you listen and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1435
01:10:46.401 --> 01:10:47.234
<v Speaker 3>well here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what what I think you said and </v>

1436
01:10:48.831 --> 01:10:49.664
<v Speaker 3>maybe even make it a little stronger and</v>
<v Speaker 3>more elaborated than was the case with </v>

1437
01:10:53.421 --> 01:10:56.330
<v Speaker 3>the original audience so that you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the damn argument right.</v>

1438
01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:59.570
<v Speaker 3>And because you don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you want to fix the problem,</v>

1439
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.673
<v Speaker 3>that's the winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the summary with listening so </v>

1440
01:11:03.651 --> 01:11:06.050
<v Speaker 3>useful for that because the person can </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1441
01:11:06.051 --> 01:11:08.120
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I meant.</v>

1442
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:08.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

1443
01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:10.730
<v Speaker 3>well then you have to grapple with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Roger said,</v>

1444
01:11:10.731 --> 01:11:11.564
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will usually won't because you </v>

1445
01:11:12.741 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you live with someone</v>

1446
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.860
<v Speaker 4>and they tell you the truth about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>

1447
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:20.640
<v Speaker 4>it usually means that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 4>really stupid that you're doing,</v>

1448
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.710
<v Speaker 4>you want them to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something stupid that you're</v>

1449
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:23.544
<v Speaker 4>doing that you know you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you actually have to stop and you </v>

1450
01:11:26.671 --> 01:11:30.390
<v Speaker 4>know that's difficult and unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but well if you don't stop,</v>

1451
01:11:30.391 --> 01:11:31.224
<v Speaker 4>then you get to have the same damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem everyday or every week for the </v>

1452
01:11:33.721 --> 01:11:34.554
<v Speaker 4>rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's probably better to undergo the </v>

1453
01:11:36.481 --> 01:11:39.120
<v Speaker 4>misery of stopping it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the misery of continuing it.</v>

1454
01:11:39.121 --> 01:11:41.580
<v Speaker 4>But that's the injunction to listen.</v>

1455
01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.033
<v Speaker 4>Rule 11 is don't bother children when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're skateboarding and that's a </v>

1456
01:11:49.841 --> 01:11:54.730
<v Speaker 4>meditation on the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>weakness and goodness.</v>

1457
01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:56.253
<v Speaker 4>You see one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in our society and especially </v>

1458
01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:01.810
<v Speaker 4>with regards to our attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>men,</v>

1459
01:12:01.811 --> 01:12:05.020
<v Speaker 4>but also our attitude towards the </v>
<v Speaker 4>masculinity and women.</v>

1460
01:12:05.170 --> 01:12:06.003
<v Speaker 4>So it's just as toxic for women is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we seem to have concluded that strong </v>

1461
01:12:09.611 --> 01:12:10.444
<v Speaker 4>men are dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's partly because we think </v>

1462
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Western culture is a tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy.</v>

1463
01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:16.264
<v Speaker 4>And the only reason you get to the top </v>
<v Speaker 4>is because you misused power and so all </v>

1464
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.863
<v Speaker 4>the men who are at the top of the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all misusing their power and their all </v>

1465
01:12:23.621 --> 01:12:24.454
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical and all the guys who have the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ame an ambition to achieve that or just </v>

1466
01:12:28.661 --> 01:12:29.494
<v Speaker 4>tyrants in training and that's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the basic attitude that we have towards </v>

1467
01:12:32.861 --> 01:12:34.900
<v Speaker 4>our own culture and towards young men </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1468
01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:36.063
<v Speaker 4>And that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's everything about that is </v>

1469
01:12:39.791 --> 01:12:44.791
<v Speaker 4>pathological and inexcusable and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shameful in first the claim that western</v>

1470
01:12:45.521 --> 01:12:46.354
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

1471
01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1472
01:12:56.790 --> 01:13:01.480
<v Speaker 4>The idea that western culture is </v>
<v Speaker 4>primarily a patriarchal tyranny is like,</v>

1473
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:05.221
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1474
01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:07.740
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's historically ignorant beyond belief</v>

1475
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:12.510
<v Speaker 4>because what are you compared to what </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly how many civilized countries are</v>

1476
01:13:12.511 --> 01:13:15.200
<v Speaker 4>there in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know three dozen.</v>

1477
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:17.940
<v Speaker 4>The rest of them are run by brutal </v>
<v Speaker 4>thugs.</v>

1478
01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.360
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it isn't just thugs at the top,</v>

1479
01:13:21.361 --> 01:13:22.194
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that isn't how it works in any </v>

1480
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:25.343
<v Speaker 4>country that's corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The corruption is spread through the </v>

1481
01:13:26.551 --> 01:13:30.030
<v Speaker 4>entire country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're not like that.</v>

1482
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.530
<v Speaker 4>And that's that mean western culture is </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally honest.</v>

1483
01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:38.220
<v Speaker 4>And I can give an example of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because people don't like that idea.</v>

1484
01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.820
<v Speaker 4>Bay proved that because here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we did.</v>

1485
01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:42.683
<v Speaker 4>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a very interesting thing because </v>

1486
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:46.830
<v Speaker 4>when Ebay first popped up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the cynic would say,</v>

1487
01:13:46.831 --> 01:13:49.770
<v Speaker 4>Ebay is not going to work because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know you.</v>

1488
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.390
<v Speaker 4>You live in the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>

1489
01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:55.560
<v Speaker 4>you're going to send me junk and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to send you a check that bounces.</v>

1490
01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.480
<v Speaker 4>And that'll be the end of Ebay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1491
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:00.540
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what a cynic would say.</v>

1492
01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.990
<v Speaker 4>And then what happened was that brokers </v>
<v Speaker 4>popped up and they said,</v>

1493
01:14:03.991 --> 01:14:06.390
<v Speaker 4>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll guarantee the exchange rates for a</v>

1494
01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:09.030
<v Speaker 4>fee 10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll make sure that you don't send junk</v>

1495
01:14:09.031 --> 01:14:10.560
<v Speaker 4>and we'll make sure your check doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>bounce.</v>

1496
01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:14.710
<v Speaker 4>And what happened was the brokers </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't find enough business.</v>

1497
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.490
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that was all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transactions were honest.</v>

1498
01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.700
<v Speaker 4>All of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1499
01:14:20.701 --> 01:14:21.534
<v Speaker 4>it's like 19.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you are on Ebay and you have a </v>

1500
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:23.554
<v Speaker 4>reputation of less than 99 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's actually something wrong with </v>

1501
01:14:25.931 --> 01:14:26.764
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1502
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.390
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ninety eight percent.</v>

1503
01:14:28.391 --> 01:14:30.460
<v Speaker 4>But really it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that tight.</v>

1504
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:31.533
<v Speaker 4>And so the default position was you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>offering this all by it will make the </v>

1505
01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:39.340
<v Speaker 4>exchange fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what happened was a bunch of capital</v>

1506
01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.260
<v Speaker 4>that was frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>technically speaking,</v>

1507
01:14:41.261 --> 01:14:42.094
<v Speaker 4>junk that people had that other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>could need God freed up and he'd be </v>

1508
01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:45.693
<v Speaker 4>freed up a tremendous amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 4>for people and it was all a consequence </v>

1509
01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:50.230
<v Speaker 4>of default,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honesty.</v>

1510
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:51.423
<v Speaker 4>And we also know that one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>predictors of success in Western world </v>

1511
01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:57.880
<v Speaker 4>is conscientiousness and conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are honest and have integrity and</v>

1512
01:14:57.881 --> 01:14:59.860
<v Speaker 4>are due to full and do what they say </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll do.</v>

1513
01:14:59.861 --> 01:15:02.290
<v Speaker 4>And that's a really good predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 4>longterm life success,</v>

1514
01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:04.990
<v Speaker 4>especially as a manager and </v>
<v Speaker 4>administrator or something like that.</v>

1515
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:06.303
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1516
01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.373
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So chapter 11 is a discussion about the </v>

1517
01:15:11.031 --> 01:15:14.150
<v Speaker 4>assault on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the positive masculine.</v>

1518
01:15:14.151 --> 01:15:14.984
<v Speaker 4>And I read it partly as a continuation </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what Nietzsche announced back in the </v>

1519
01:15:18.651 --> 01:15:20.890
<v Speaker 4>late 18 hundreds as the death of God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1520
01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:21.733
<v Speaker 4>Because in western culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God was a masculine figure and the idea </v>

1521
01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:27.560
<v Speaker 4>that the divine masculine had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>decimated,</v>

1522
01:15:27.561 --> 01:15:28.394
<v Speaker 4>which was basically niches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pronouncement has filtered all the way </v>

1523
01:15:30.171 --> 01:15:31.004
<v Speaker 4>down to masculinity itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's an absolutely </v>

1524
01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.620
<v Speaker 4>appalling outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1525
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:37.663
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something that could only be </v>

1526
01:15:38.871 --> 01:15:41.810
<v Speaker 4>desired by someone who is a true enemy </v>
<v Speaker 4>of humanity.</v>

1527
01:15:41.811 --> 01:15:45.740
<v Speaker 4>And so partly chapter 11 is a call to </v>
<v Speaker 4>encouragement.</v>

1528
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:46.663
<v Speaker 4>It's like you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've been telling young men in </v>

1529
01:15:48.771 --> 01:15:50.810
<v Speaker 4>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but young women as well,</v>

1530
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:51.703
<v Speaker 4>so they don't seem to be quite as in </v>
<v Speaker 4>need of the message to adopt </v>

1531
01:15:54.981 --> 01:15:59.060
<v Speaker 4>responsibility for their life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to tell the truth and to understand that</v>

1532
01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:04.120
<v Speaker 4>their failure to participate fully in </v>
<v Speaker 4>being leaves a hole that's precisely the</v>

1533
01:16:05.601 --> 01:16:08.720
<v Speaker 4>size of their soul in the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>landscape.</v>

1534
01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:10.093
<v Speaker 4>It's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need all the light we can possibly </v>

1535
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:17.050
<v Speaker 4>bring to bear on the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And while,</v>

1536
01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:17.893
<v Speaker 4>and I firmly believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I believe that for all sorts of </v>

1537
01:16:19.761 --> 01:16:22.430
<v Speaker 4>reasons and I think they're very deep </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>

1538
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:26.240
<v Speaker 4>And that's partly why I would say rules </v>
<v Speaker 4>to life also has,</v>

1539
01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.760
<v Speaker 4>it's a funny book because it has a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious core,</v>

1540
01:16:28.761 --> 01:16:32.300
<v Speaker 4>but it's also very heavily grounded in </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary biology.</v>

1541
01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:33.134
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1542
01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:36.080
<v Speaker 4>but that's what chapter 11 is about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>10,</v>

1543
01:16:36.081 --> 01:16:40.280
<v Speaker 4>it's about people who are the enemy of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the human spirit.</v>

1544
01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:42.890
<v Speaker 4>The people who restrict children's play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1545
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:45.110
<v Speaker 4>which is a particularly pathological </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing to do,</v>

1546
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:48.080
<v Speaker 4>there's a movement now to not let </v>
<v Speaker 4>children have best friends.</v>

1547
01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.900
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really what the hell man,</v>

1548
01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.220
<v Speaker 4>that's so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are so many things wrong with that</v>

1549
01:16:55.221 --> 01:16:58.910
<v Speaker 4>idea that would take an entire nother </v>
<v Speaker 4>lecture just to scrape the surface,</v>

1550
01:16:58.911 --> 01:17:02.060
<v Speaker 4>but mostly it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1551
01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:03.243
<v Speaker 4>we're not even</v>

1552
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:04.143
<v Speaker 5>start over.</v>

1553
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.823
<v Speaker 4>Final rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's called pet a cat when you </v>

1554
01:17:10.881 --> 01:17:13.340
<v Speaker 4>encountered one on the street and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very.</v>

1555
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:16.100
<v Speaker 4>It's the most personal chapter in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>

1556
01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:16.934
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot about my daughter and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>daughter was very ill when she was well </v>

1557
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.673
<v Speaker 4>when she was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what particularly when she was a </v>

1558
01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:25.550
<v Speaker 4>teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had a very terrible time of it.</v>

1559
01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.253
<v Speaker 4>She had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis </v>
<v Speaker 4>and when she was between the ages of 14 </v>

1560
01:17:30.861 --> 01:17:31.694
<v Speaker 4>and 16 at first destroyed her hip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which had to be replaced and then it </v>

1561
01:17:34.131 --> 01:17:34.964
<v Speaker 4>destroyed the ankle on her other leg </v>
<v Speaker 4>which had to be replaced and she walked </v>

1562
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:40.304
<v Speaker 4>around for two years on broken legs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she was taking massive doses of opiates </v>

1563
01:17:44.271 --> 01:17:45.104
<v Speaker 4>and could hardly stay awake and like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she had this advanced auto immune </v>

1564
01:17:48.351 --> 01:17:49.184
<v Speaker 4>disease which produced all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>other symptoms that were just as bad as </v>

1565
01:17:51.891 --> 01:17:54.440
<v Speaker 4>the joint degeneration but which are </v>
<v Speaker 4>harder to describe.</v>

1566
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:57.410
<v Speaker 4>And so it was just bloody brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1567
01:17:57.411 --> 01:17:58.244
<v Speaker 4>and as a test of your faith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's almost nothing that's more </v>

1568
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:05.630
<v Speaker 4>direct than a serious illness inflicted </v>
<v Speaker 4>upon an innocent child.</v>

1569
01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.493
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the chapter is a meditation on </v>

1570
01:18:08.271 --> 01:18:12.530
<v Speaker 4>that and also on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what to do in a situation like that</v>

1571
01:18:12.531 --> 01:18:15.740
<v Speaker 4>because everyone is going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation like that in some sense,</v>

1572
01:18:15.741 --> 01:18:16.574
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you'll be faced with illness in </v>

1573
01:18:18.201 --> 01:18:21.220
<v Speaker 4>the people that you love and in crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a,</v>

1574
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:23.990
<v Speaker 4>it's a practical guide to coping with </v>
<v Speaker 4>those sorts of things.</v>

1575
01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:24.824
<v Speaker 4>Like in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things you do when you're </v>

1576
01:18:25.731 --> 01:18:29.240
<v Speaker 4>overwhelmed by crisis is you shorten </v>
<v Speaker 4>your timeframe.</v>

1577
01:18:29.690 --> 01:18:30.523
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you can't think about next </v>

1578
01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.013
<v Speaker 4>month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you can't even bloody well think </v>

1579
01:18:33.681 --> 01:18:35.870
<v Speaker 4>about next week or maybe not even </v>
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow.</v>

1580
01:18:36.230 --> 01:18:39.410
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because now is just so overwhelming that</v>

1581
01:18:39.411 --> 01:18:40.400
<v Speaker 4>that's all there is.</v>

1582
01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:41.773
<v Speaker 4>And that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cut your timeframe back until you </v>

1583
01:18:44.031 --> 01:18:44.864
<v Speaker 4>can cope with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if it's not the next week that you </v>

1584
01:18:47.041 --> 01:18:47.874
<v Speaker 4>see how to get through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's the next day and if it's not </v>

1585
01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:50.474
<v Speaker 4>the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's the next hour and if it's not </v>

1586
01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:54.920
<v Speaker 4>the next hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's the next minute.</v>

1587
01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:57.230
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are very,</v>

1588
01:18:57.231 --> 01:18:58.400
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1589
01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.293
<v Speaker 4>very tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it turns out that if you face </v>

1590
01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:02.624
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it turns out that if you face things </v>

1591
01:19:06.471 --> 01:19:09.200
<v Speaker 4>that you can put up with a lot more than</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think you can put up within,</v>

1592
01:19:09.201 --> 01:19:11.630
<v Speaker 4>you can do it without becoming </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrupted.</v>

1593
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:17.080
<v Speaker 4>And she did recover quite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quite fully and much as a consequence of</v>

1594
01:19:17.241 --> 01:19:18.074
<v Speaker 4>our own machinations because she figured</v>
<v Speaker 4>out what was wrong with her and then </v>

1595
01:19:20.331 --> 01:19:21.164
<v Speaker 4>took the necessary steps to fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is nothing short of a bloody </v>

1596
01:19:23.361 --> 01:19:26.150
<v Speaker 4>miracle as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1597
01:19:26.151 --> 01:19:27.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>

1598
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:28.860
<v Speaker 4>part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1599
01:19:29.170 --> 01:19:30.003
<v Speaker 4>the cat bit is I actually started by </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about our dog who actually died </v>

1600
01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.900
<v Speaker 4>about a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's still alive in the book.</v>

1601
01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:37.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1602
01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:38.503
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I let people know because dog lovers </v>

1603
01:19:40.101 --> 01:19:40.934
<v Speaker 4>love dogs and if you love cats than they</v>
<v Speaker 4>think you don't like dogs and then they </v>

1604
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:44.423
<v Speaker 4>don't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I also pointed out at the beginning </v>

1605
01:19:46.401 --> 01:19:47.510
<v Speaker 4>of the chapter that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1606
01:19:47.511 --> 01:19:49.820
<v Speaker 4>if you want a pet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dog on the street,</v>

1607
01:19:49.821 --> 01:19:50.654
<v Speaker 4>that's okay too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to get up in arms about </v>

1608
01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:53.084
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1609
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.860
<v Speaker 4>but the idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1610
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:57.200
<v Speaker 4>you have to be alert when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>

1611
01:19:57.201 --> 01:19:59.990
<v Speaker 4>You have to be alert to the beauty in </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1612
01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:01.093
<v Speaker 4>The unexpected beauty in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've kind of what I was trying to </v>

1613
01:20:03.471 --> 01:20:04.304
<v Speaker 4>get across with the idea of the cap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this cat that lives across the </v>

1614
01:20:06.351 --> 01:20:07.590
<v Speaker 4>street from us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ginger,</v>

1615
01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 4>Ginger's,</v>

1616
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.740
<v Speaker 3>assignees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Captain Cat's really aren't domesticated</v>

1617
01:20:10.741 --> 01:20:12.930
<v Speaker 3>a technically speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still wild animals,</v>

1618
01:20:12.931 --> 01:20:16.200
<v Speaker 3>but they kind of like people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God only knows why,</v>

1619
01:20:16.201 --> 01:20:17.250
<v Speaker 3>but they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1620
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:18.263
<v Speaker 3>And so ginger will come wandering over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and our dog looks at her but their </v>

1621
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:25.880
<v Speaker 3>friends and she rolls over on his back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and seek use to noser a bit and then she</v>

1622
01:20:26.771 --> 01:20:27.604
<v Speaker 3>kind of Mosey over and let you pet her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she was feeling like at that day and </v>

1623
01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:34.050
<v Speaker 3>you know you have to look for those </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of stuff,</v>

1624
01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 3>little bit of sparkling crystal in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>darkness when things are bad,</v>

1625
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:39.534
<v Speaker 3>you have to look and see where things </v>
<v Speaker 3>are still beautiful and where there's </v>

1626
01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.960
<v Speaker 3>still something that's sustaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1627
01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:45.813
<v Speaker 3>you narrow your timeframe and you be </v>
<v Speaker 3>grateful for what you have and I've can </v>

1628
01:20:49.621 --> 01:20:54.621
<v Speaker 3>get you through some very dark times and</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe even successfully if you're lucky,</v>

1629
01:20:54.841 --> 01:20:55.674
<v Speaker 3>but even if unsuccessfully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe it's only tragic and not </v>

1630
01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:02.100
<v Speaker 3>absolute hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can do that,</v>

1631
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:02.934
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the worst situation you can make it </v>

1632
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:09.470
<v Speaker 3>only tragic and not held and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big gap between tragedy and hell.</v>

1633
01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:12.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing worse at a deathbed than</v>

1634
01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:14.070
<v Speaker 3>to see the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fighting.</v>

1635
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.073
<v Speaker 3>The death is bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can take that as terrible as it </v>

1636
01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:22.140
<v Speaker 3>is and make it into something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely unbearable.</v>

1637
01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.273
<v Speaker 3>And maybe I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is sort of what I closed the </v>

1638
01:21:24.601 --> 01:21:25.680
<v Speaker 3>book with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this idea,</v>

1639
01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:26.514
<v Speaker 3>is that if we didn't all attempt to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible things even worse than they </v>

1640
01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:31.344
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe we could tolerate the </v>

1641
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:33.744
<v Speaker 3>terrible things that we have to put up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with in order to exist and maybe we </v>

1642
01:21:36.811 --> 01:21:38.700
<v Speaker 3>could make the world into a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

1643
01:21:38.701 --> 01:21:39.534
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's what we shouldn't be doing and </v>

1644
01:21:40.501 --> 01:21:43.080
<v Speaker 3>what we could be doing because we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have anything better to do.</v>

1645
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.420
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the book is about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1646
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:50.070
<v Speaker 3>that's the end of 12 rules for life.</v>

1647
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1648
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:31.913
<v Speaker 1>But we've overrun joyously and normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have a sort of cup the talk and </v>

1649
01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:40.020
<v Speaker 1>dump something so we can have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

1650
01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:41.880
<v Speaker 1>but I really didn't think it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>

1651
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this evening.</v>

1652
01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Stoke was absolutely luminous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring.</v>

1653
01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:48.150
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to do one question,</v>

1654
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:49.283
<v Speaker 1>one question only and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to leave Jordan to </v>

1655
01:22:52.561 --> 01:22:55.380
<v Speaker 1>actually decide what's the question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to ask?</v>

1656
01:22:55.381 --> 01:22:57.600
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to take three from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

1657
01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:58.633
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read out three that Ivanka </v>

1658
01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.660
<v Speaker 1>have come from the live stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1659
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.333
<v Speaker 1>one from the live stream is how'd you </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged the identity politics of </v>

1660
01:23:08.981 --> 01:23:09.814
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is a more personal one is </v>

1661
01:23:12.611 --> 01:23:13.444
<v Speaker 1>where do you fall short yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these 12 rules and is it a constant </v>

1662
01:23:17.801 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>adjustment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now let me take three questions from</v>

1663
01:23:20.891 --> 01:23:21.724
<v Speaker 1>the audience and I'll leave Jordan to </v>
<v Speaker 1>then decide which is the last question </v>

1664
01:23:26.321 --> 01:23:31.321
<v Speaker 1>that he wants to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first hand there,</v>

1665
01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:34.803
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's an honor to be as your lecturer </v>

1666
01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:40.340
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the question is I wanted to ask like</v>

1667
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:41.860
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people like,</v>

1668
01:23:41.861 --> 01:23:44.440
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stefan Molyneux who interviewed you,</v>

1669
01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:46.180
<v Speaker 6>a puts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

1670
01:23:46.181 --> 01:23:47.740
<v Speaker 6>tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1671
01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:51.640
<v Speaker 6>attention to admitting faults of </v>
<v Speaker 6>parents,</v>

1672
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:54.490
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and admitting the harm that was done,</v>

1673
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:55.383
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when getting better and working through </v>

1674
01:23:57.430 --> 01:24:00.970
<v Speaker 6>adversive childhood experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I wanted to ask you about,</v>

1675
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:02.410
<v Speaker 6>about that and what you think about </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

1676
01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:06.400
<v Speaker 1>And then if you take the young lady just</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1677
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:12.160
<v Speaker 6>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my question is about chapter nine,</v>

1678
01:24:12.161 --> 01:24:12.994
<v Speaker 6>about being humble and listening to what</v>
<v Speaker 6>your enemies are saying and criticizing </v>

1679
01:24:17.381 --> 01:24:18.200
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

1680
01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:23.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm a kind of person who kind of speak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>speak my thoughts.</v>

1681
01:24:23.171 --> 01:24:24.004
<v Speaker 6>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I speak them to my friends and see how </v>

1682
01:24:26.741 --> 01:24:29.410
<v Speaker 6>they bounced them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1683
01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:31.793
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1684
01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:37.380
<v Speaker 6>I noticed that there's always a group of</v>
<v Speaker 6>my friends who always criticize what I'm</v>

1685
01:24:38.501 --> 01:24:42.370
<v Speaker 6>saying and not even try to understand </v>
<v Speaker 6>what I'm,</v>

1686
01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:44.670
<v Speaker 6>where I'm coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

1687
01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:46.063
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've always wondered how to deal with </v>

1688
01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:48.050
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1689
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:53.050
<v Speaker 6>I want to listen to what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're not understanding what I'm,</v>

1690
01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:55.630
<v Speaker 6>they're not trying to listen to what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying.</v>

1691
01:24:55.631 --> 01:24:57.980
<v Speaker 6>So what would you do in that situation </v>
<v Speaker 6>that</v>

1692
01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:59.013
<v Speaker 3>very briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a line in the new testament </v>

1693
01:25:01.761 --> 01:25:05.890
<v Speaker 3>that's relevant to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do not cast pearls before swine.</v>

1694
01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 3>And what that means is that if people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are not listening to you,</v>

1695
01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:13.900
<v Speaker 3>stop talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's really,</v>

1696
01:25:13.930 --> 01:25:16.040
<v Speaker 3>that is the best piece of advice that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can give you.</v>

1697
01:25:16.041 --> 01:25:19.630
<v Speaker 3>And what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if you stopped talking to people</v>

1698
01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:22.420
<v Speaker 3>who aren't listening to you and start </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching them,</v>

1699
01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:24.940
<v Speaker 3>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will tell you what they're up to.</v>

1700
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:27.580
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you have things to say,</v>

1701
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:29.680
<v Speaker 3>you say them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you find people that will listen.</v>

1702
01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:30.933
<v Speaker 3>Talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones who aren't listening pullback </v>

1703
01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:36.190
<v Speaker 3>because you're a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're devaluing what you have to say by</v>

1704
01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:37.024
<v Speaker 3>offering it to an audience that does </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing but rejected and that's a good </v>

1705
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:43.420
<v Speaker 3>guideline to life in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So pull back.</v>

1706
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1707
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:49.750
<v Speaker 1>and our last question is gentlemen over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there with the blue.</v>

1708
01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:52.763
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a broad smile to my face when you </v>

1709
01:25:55.091 --> 01:25:59.350
<v Speaker 3>mentioned the work of John Taylor Gatto </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just wanted to know what you think</v>

1710
01:25:59.351 --> 01:26:03.620
<v Speaker 3>their relationship is between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>classic trivium and the Holy Trinity and</v>

1711
01:26:03.621 --> 01:26:05.360
<v Speaker 3>if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how has that changed over time?</v>

1712
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to leave you to answer one </v>
<v Speaker 3>question only and then</v>

1713
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:15.900
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be back on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dedicated?</v>

1714
01:26:16.050 --> 01:26:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1715
01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1716
01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:21.950
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to answer where do you</v>
<v Speaker 3>fall short in these 12 rules?</v>

1717
01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:24.860
<v Speaker 3>Is it a constant adjustment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1718
01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:27.873
<v Speaker 3>I wrote these rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you mean why did I write these </v>

1719
01:26:30.441 --> 01:26:31.820
<v Speaker 3>rules?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1720
01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:35.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially when I said,</v>

1721
01:26:35.781 --> 01:26:36.614
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should try to improve yourself </v>

1722
01:26:37.191 --> 01:26:38.024
<v Speaker 3>instead of trying to set the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight or instead of worrying about </v>

1723
01:26:40.221 --> 01:26:41.810
<v Speaker 3>what other people are doing wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>

1724
01:26:41.811 --> 01:26:43.280
<v Speaker 3>well that's a hell of a thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone to say,</v>

1725
01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:45.200
<v Speaker 3>you just wrote a book called 12 rules </v>
<v Speaker 3>for life.</v>

1726
01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1727
01:26:46.371 --> 01:26:49.970
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is is that I wasn't just </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing that.</v>

1728
01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:55.510
<v Speaker 3>I was reading that for me as much as for</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone else and I mean that's,</v>

1729
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.190
<v Speaker 3>I really mean that sincerely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1730
01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.053
<v Speaker 3>I had an opportunity to spend somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>around five years meditating on how you </v>

1731
01:27:02.961 --> 01:27:05.980
<v Speaker 3>should conduct yourself so that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is what it could be.</v>

1732
01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm in the group of people that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>advising you.</v>

1733
01:27:09.171 --> 01:27:10.004
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like all of these things are very </v>

1734
01:27:11.811 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 3>difficult to stand up straight to </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember that and to treat yourself like</v>

1735
01:27:15.111 --> 01:27:19.430
<v Speaker 3>you're someone worthwhile and to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with people who are good for you</v>

1736
01:27:19.431 --> 01:27:20.220
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1737
01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:22.490
<v Speaker 3>and to tell the truth or at least not to</v>
<v Speaker 3>lie.</v>

1738
01:27:22.491 --> 01:27:23.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are all ideals,</v>

1739
01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:26.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At especially taken as a whole.</v>

1740
01:27:26.061 --> 01:27:28.580
<v Speaker 3>They constitute a kind of ideal and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>

1741
01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:31.070
<v Speaker 3>you never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never attained the ideal,</v>

1742
01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:32.533
<v Speaker 3>the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not only that he receives as you </v>

1743
01:27:33.711 --> 01:27:34.550
<v Speaker 3>approach it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1744
01:27:34.551 --> 01:27:36.590
<v Speaker 3>because you straighten yourself out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

1745
01:27:36.591 --> 01:27:37.700
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got it now and you think,</v>

1746
01:27:37.890 --> 01:27:39.200
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more to go.</v>

1747
01:27:39.230 --> 01:27:41.870
<v Speaker 3>There's still more to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you get that much farther along</v>

1748
01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:42.441
<v Speaker 3>the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

1749
01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:43.760
<v Speaker 3>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1750
01:27:43.761 --> 01:27:45.500
<v Speaker 3>I thought this was the end of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1751
01:27:45.501 --> 01:27:46.334
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of imperfections left to </v>

1752
01:27:49.131 --> 01:27:52.370
<v Speaker 3>iron out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it is a constant adjustment and.</v>

1753
01:27:52.371 --> 01:27:56.660
<v Speaker 3>But there's something about that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>also positive because you might say that</v>

1754
01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.560
<v Speaker 3>it's not so much that there isn't such a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing as a good person.</v>

1755
01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.053
<v Speaker 3>It's that our idea of what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>good isn't right because a good person </v>

1756
01:28:05.961 --> 01:28:10.961
<v Speaker 3>is someone who's trying to get better </v>
<v Speaker 3>and no matter how good you are,</v>

1757
01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:15.620
<v Speaker 3>there's better that you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real goodness is in the attempt,</v>

1758
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:16.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the,</v>

1759
01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:19.760
<v Speaker 3>it's in the process to use somewhat of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cliche,</v>

1760
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:20.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this and I'll close with this </v>

1761
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:24.650
<v Speaker 3>and it's a good way to close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1762
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:26.540
<v Speaker 3>and this is the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>observation,</v>

1763
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:30.590
<v Speaker 3>the the central figure of Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture is Christ,</v>

1764
01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.053
<v Speaker 3>and we can look at that psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Christ is the dying and </v>

1765
01:28:34.071 --> 01:28:37.460
<v Speaker 3>resurrected hero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what does that mean psychologically?</v>

1766
01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:39.410
<v Speaker 3>While it means that</v>

1767
01:28:42.090 --> 01:28:47.090
<v Speaker 3>you learned things painfully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you learn something painfully a</v>

1768
01:28:49.051 --> 01:28:51.840
<v Speaker 3>part of you has to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the pain.</v>

1769
01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.660
<v Speaker 3>You know when a dream is shattered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1770
01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:57.480
<v Speaker 3>a huge part of you that that constituted</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dream,</v>

1771
01:28:57.481 --> 01:29:00.120
<v Speaker 3>maybe even the biological substrate of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that June has to be</v>

1772
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.933
<v Speaker 3>stripped away and burned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so life is a constant process of </v>

1773
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:09.953
<v Speaker 3>death and rebirth and to participate in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that fully is to allow yourself to be </v>

1774
01:29:15.661 --> 01:29:20.610
<v Speaker 3>redeemed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the good is that process of death</v>

1775
01:29:20.611 --> 01:29:21.444
<v Speaker 3>and rebirth voluntarily undertaken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're not as good as you </v>

1776
01:29:25.171 --> 01:29:27.060
<v Speaker 3>could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you let that part of you die.</v>

1777
01:29:27.210 --> 01:29:29.340
<v Speaker 3>And if someone comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1778
01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:32.370
<v Speaker 3>there's some deadwood here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1779
01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:34.020
<v Speaker 3>it needs to be burned off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

1780
01:29:34.021 --> 01:29:35.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff's still a bit alive.</v>

1781
01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.410
<v Speaker 3>When that Burns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to hurt.</v>

1782
01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.311
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1783
01:29:38.311 --> 01:29:39.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no kidding,</v>

1784
01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.530
<v Speaker 3>but maybe the thing that emerges in its </v>
<v Speaker 3>place is something better,</v>

1785
01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:46.230
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is the secret of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

1786
01:29:46.231 --> 01:29:47.550
<v Speaker 3>This is what we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1787
01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.393
<v Speaker 3>unlike any other creature is that we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>let our old cells die and let our new </v>

1788
01:29:52.741 --> 01:29:56.310
<v Speaker 3>selves be born and that's what we should</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1789
01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:01.400
<v Speaker 3>And so where do I fall short in these 12</v>
<v Speaker 3>rules?</v>

1790
01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>endlessly because.</v>

1791
01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:05.933
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a way of thinking about it until </v>

1792
01:30:07.591 --> 01:30:08.424
<v Speaker 3>the entire world is redeemed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all fall short and that's probably a </v>

1793
01:30:12.961 --> 01:30:16.320
<v Speaker 3>good</v>
<v Speaker 3>place to stop.</v>

1794
01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
