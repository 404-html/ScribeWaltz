1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually supposed to be talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.120
<v Speaker 1>about constructivism today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to continue to talking</v>

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.963
<v Speaker 1>to you about what I was talking last </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I'll collapse the </v>

4
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>constructivism lectures into one lecture</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it'll keep us on track.</v>

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.403
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you a little bit about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more about this image and </v>

6
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.940
<v Speaker 1>what it probably means and then then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good.</v>

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.953
<v Speaker 1>We're going to continue with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion of shamanic transformation </v>

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>and its relationship with personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

9
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the picture on the right,</v>

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.993
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you'll see of course is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a tree and the tree is </v>

11
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:38.934
<v Speaker 1>associated with snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I believe I told you guys about </v>

12
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:42.234
<v Speaker 1>Linnaeus bells research and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between predatory state </v>

13
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>prevalence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acuity of human vision,</v>

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>that you remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

15
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>so to me what the image on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like is,</v>

17
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.044
<v Speaker 1>first of all it's like the ancestral </v>
<v Speaker 1>home of human beings for tens of </v>

18
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>millions of years or our that's tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the snake,</v>

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>with the primary human environment maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 million years ago.</v>

20
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not human at that level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

21
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

22
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>it's part of our evolutionary heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's also part of why we have a</v>

23
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:14.244
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially that large trees are sort of </v>

24
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>statement that's one of the senses that </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives environmentalism,</v>

25
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because environmentalists are often very</v>

26
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>interested in protecting old growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>forests,</v>

27
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:24.054
<v Speaker 1>which is actually kind of weird because </v>
<v Speaker 1>old growth forests are ready to burn </v>

28
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>down and they're also kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically dead.</v>

29
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>There's no light can get to the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nothing grows down there.</v>

30
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>So they're just trees and they're almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead treatment.</v>

31
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.853
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.093
<v Speaker 1>from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of biological </v>

34
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:38.334
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not wearing that and </v>

35
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.763
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human beings still have some real </v>

36
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>kinship with those gigantic trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we feel that there's something,</v>

37
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural sacred.</v>

38
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.723
<v Speaker 1>So superimposed on that is I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the next stage of human </v>

39
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:52.510
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

40
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.483
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these representations were made by </v>

42
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>people who are trying to represent the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

43
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate reality of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so super imposed on the tree is a is</v>

44
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>a mile and a mountain is a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of a pyramid.</v>

45
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>And The pyramid is a nice representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a dominance hierarchy.</v>

46
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.013
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already mentioned to you that human </v>

47
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>beings live in Darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard because in that there are very</v>

48
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:14.244
<v Speaker 1>permanent part of our environment being </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 300 million years old and </v>

49
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>possibly older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

50
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.963
<v Speaker 1>when the human imagination is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize what constitutes ultimate </v>

51
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.164
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a reality that's often beyond </v>

52
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:27.864
<v Speaker 1>what you could merely see because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you see that are directly in </v>

53
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:31.404
<v Speaker 1>front of you are not necessarily the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most real things in that many of the </v>

54
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>things that you see are transforming </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly rapidly.</v>

55
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>They're not permanent in any real sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean automobiles to see all the time,</v>

56
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>but they've only been around for 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

57
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like we've adapted biologically</v>

58
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>to their presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a mountain in the middle and</v>

59
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:52.330
<v Speaker 1>the mountain is sort of sitting in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumscribed territory.</v>

60
00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:53.164
<v Speaker 1>And the idea there is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy that human beings </v>

61
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>inhabit and it always occupies a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>

62
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>And the dominance hierarchy is like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

63
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>the place of culture that mankind exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>

64
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.333
<v Speaker 1>that surrounded by the chaos outside and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaos outside is represented by the </v>

65
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.120
<v Speaker 1>two snakes and be in the picture on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your,</v>

66
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>in the snake in the middle isn't zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth,</v>

67
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.344
<v Speaker 1>it's a snake that eats its own tail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's representative of the chaos that's </v>

68
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>outside of the familiarity of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

69
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

70
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.313
<v Speaker 1>as we've mentioned already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very intelligent perspective </v>

71
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:32.810
<v Speaker 1>because it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well man,</v>

72
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind always lives in culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding culture is the unknown,</v>

73
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>and that's the internal habitat of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of man.</v>

74
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>So human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

75
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.363
<v Speaker 1>and then I showed you this picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>briefly and that's the picture that was </v>

76
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:47.644
<v Speaker 1>derived by a German researcher who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>examining the visions of the Peruvian </v>

77
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.141
<v Speaker 1>Amazonian Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Shaman.</v>

78
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:58.141
<v Speaker 1>And you can see it's almost staggeringly</v>
<v Speaker 1>same perspective right down to the snake</v>

79
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:00.484
<v Speaker 1>that eats its own tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is an extremely common </v>

80
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>ancient symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite remarkable.</v>

81
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now what might unite,</v>

82
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>and then I talked to you about my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son's drawing.</v>

83
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I haven't given to get to this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

84
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>or what might unite these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>visions say that Scandinavia division in</v>

85
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:17.884
<v Speaker 1>the Amazonian romantic vision are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>methods that the people who had </v>

86
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.563
<v Speaker 1>divisions use to induce them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you a little bit about </v>

87
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first of all,</v>

88
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you about this picture</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think this is one,</v>

89
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.660
<v Speaker 1>a couple of variations of this picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I found.</v>

90
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't know his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's one of the most amazing</v>

91
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:34.714
<v Speaker 1>images I've ever come across because in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways sums up Christianity in one </v>

92
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's no easy thing to do.</v>

93
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think it's important </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

94
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

95
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>to talk about the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

96
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:46.954
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've already talked about some </v>

97
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:48.754
<v Speaker 1>Dallas representations is because if in </v>
<v Speaker 1>so far as we're embedded in western </v>

98
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roots of Western civilization are,</v>

99
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>they pushed themselves down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and then deeper,</v>

100
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:01.054
<v Speaker 1>there's deeper substrata under that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The religious structures that preceded </v>

101
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.074
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to understand the </v>

102
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 1>western notions of the person and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal person as well,</v>

103
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at the structure of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that Western civilization,</v>

104
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Rhoda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the religious systems,</v>

105
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:19.114
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the systems in which the idea of the </v>

106
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:23.930
<v Speaker 1>ideal emerged and so you.</v>

107
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>You can't come to grips with the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideal or the idea of mental health,</v>

108
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:29.344
<v Speaker 1>which is which is an ideal without </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the ground out of which </v>

109
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:32.854
<v Speaker 1>these ideas emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't come to terms with it many </v>

110
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>fundamental sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

111
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing clinical psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

112
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.044
<v Speaker 1>you have to come to terms with it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental sense because a lot of the </v>

113
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:43.864
<v Speaker 1>time when people come and see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason they come and see you is </v>

114
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:46.924
<v Speaker 1>because their sense of life's meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been shattered and and they're </v>

115
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 1>unable to proceed without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>restoration of that meeting.</v>

116
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:55.414
<v Speaker 1>So maybe their belief systems fell apart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they faced some sort of tragedy </v>

117
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.724
<v Speaker 1>that's just blowing them into pieces and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no idea how to orient </v>

118
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:01.994
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because life always presents us an </v>

119
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>existential question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one that will deal with later,</v>

120
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:07.634
<v Speaker 1>which is life is difficult because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by suffering and because </v>

121
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:14.550
<v Speaker 1>of that there has to be a reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up against them.</v>

122
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason has to be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>coherence,</v>

123
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>so you have to know in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're the sort of creature that can</v>

124
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily face the tragic conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of existence and prevail.</v>

125
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's a religious presuppositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally because it's based on,</v>

126
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a hypothesis in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are like that.</v>

127
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>So let me tell you about this image is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's staggering images.</v>

128
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 1>So brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you'll notice is that</v>

129
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.853
<v Speaker 1>of course there's a tree in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it and sort of looks like the tree </v>

130
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:42.940
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid withdraw,</v>

131
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>they sort of looked like lollipops or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

132
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's a scheme of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see of course,</v>

133
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>that the snake is wrapped around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

134
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 1>The snake and the trees come along </v>
<v Speaker 1>together unbelievably often.</v>

135
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 1>So asclepius his rod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

136
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Asclepius is the Greek God of Haley.</v>

137
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>And you see the symbol of the Greek God </v>
<v Speaker 1>of healing,</v>

138
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.123
<v Speaker 1>which is that Asclepius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his rod are all steel used to represent </v>

139
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:05.594
<v Speaker 1>physicians and it's a rug with a snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapped around the two and the state </v>

140
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.210
<v Speaker 1>represents transformation because it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>

141
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it can shed its skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of be reborn and and for many other</v>

142
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>reasons besides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this representation,</v>

143
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 1>which is partly derived for genesis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then partly derived from the development</v>

144
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:23.930
<v Speaker 1>of Christian ideas for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years after that,</v>

145
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.813
<v Speaker 1>there's a particular idea that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>portrayed now you don't want to set up </v>

146
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 1>in the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are little things that looked like</v>

147
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>fruit and one of those things is a skull</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

148
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:35.684
<v Speaker 1>So the idea there is that the fruit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tree produced is in somehow is in </v>

149
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.090
<v Speaker 1>some manner equivalent to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in the,</v>

150
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.063
<v Speaker 1>in the genesis story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that eve tempts Adam </v>

151
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 1>with the fruit from the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she offers him this fruit.</v>

152
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a very interesting thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because women historically speaking,</v>

153
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>have been gathered like men do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>

154
00:07:56.391 --> 00:07:57.224
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking in archaic societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women do the gathering and human </v>

155
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:05.540
<v Speaker 1>beings have also a subsistent for large </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of their evolutionary history.</v>

156
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Before we were human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we ate fruit and are we the reason we</v>

157
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:11.234
<v Speaker 1>have color vision by the way is so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can detect right fruit and right </v>

158
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.150
<v Speaker 1>fruit is also tightly associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality.</v>

159
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 1>So like if you look through the ads that</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's magazines,</v>

160
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>the makeup adds the associations between</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripeness of fruit and say women's cheeks</v>

161
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>and women's lips are always very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're much put forward,</v>

162
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

163
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.820
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a tight association </v>
<v Speaker 1>between sexuality and food for a variety</v>

164
00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:35.064
<v Speaker 1>of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so eve basically tamps Adam in some </v>

165
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:39.164
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a conscious relationship with her </v>

166
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:41.720
<v Speaker 1>by offering him food.</v>

167
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.660
<v Speaker 1>And in the case of the genesis story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rich ripe fruit.</v>

168
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>And so that's an enticement and she also</v>
<v Speaker 1>entices him into self consciousness,</v>

169
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:51.590
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

170
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.570
<v Speaker 1>women do make men self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

171
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.720
<v Speaker 1>that's like that's the ultimate truth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

172
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.833
<v Speaker 1>of the nature of the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women and rejection in </v>

173
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:01.674
<v Speaker 1>particular is something that makes men </v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious and they're much more </v>

174
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.653
<v Speaker 1>what exposed to that that women are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of sexual dance because women </v>

175
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:09.864
<v Speaker 1>are sort of on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite quite successful at seeking out </v>

176
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>sexual encounters where men are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>average,</v>

177
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 1>very unsuccessful at doing the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

178
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:20.603
<v Speaker 1>so they suffer a lot of rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very fundamental form of </v>

179
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:23.641
<v Speaker 1>rejection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

180
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:24.391
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

181
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

182
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 1>you're good enough to tolerate being </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive and all that,</v>

183
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 1>but your genetic material shipped by no </v>
<v Speaker 1>means be allowed to move itself into the</v>

184
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

185
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a really fundamental form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejection and rejection is,</v>

186
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:37.254
<v Speaker 1>well you don't measure up and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly the ground of self </v>

187
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:40.194
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and so there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird things tangled up together in </v>

188
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.433
<v Speaker 1>genesis story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even gives Adam the fruit and what </v>

189
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 1>happens is that wakes them up with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories is,</v>

190
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:53.220
<v Speaker 1>is that the scales fall from his eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the first thing that happens is</v>

191
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:54.054
<v Speaker 1>he realizes he's naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very interesting kind of </v>

192
00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:57.024
<v Speaker 1>realization because to be one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very common nightmares that people have </v>

193
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>is that they're naked in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trout.</v>

194
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.661
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

195
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to be naked in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a crop?</v>

196
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.833
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means to have your vulnerability </v>

197
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.610
<v Speaker 1>exposed to the arbitrary judgment of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the cultural mass.</v>

198
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nightmare for most people.</v>

199
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:16.704
<v Speaker 1>And human beings are very weird animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most animals wander around on </v>

200
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 1>four legs.</v>

201
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And of course that means the armored </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of their body is what shows right?</v>

202
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Their spine and their ribs along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

203
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty tough and hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human beings are standing up.</v>

204
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 1>So the most vulnerable parts of our body</v>
<v Speaker 1>or broadcast straight forward.</v>

205
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.083
<v Speaker 1>So and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When human beings woke up during our </v>

206
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary progress towards the kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness we have,</v>

207
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.753
<v Speaker 1>when we became self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was essentially equivalent to </v>

208
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:48.024
<v Speaker 1>recognizing our naked vulnerability and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the genesis story is trying </v>

209
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:52.734
<v Speaker 1>to relate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it also points out that it says </v>

210
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:55.974
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women and fruit played an integral role </v>

211
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.630
<v Speaker 1>in the development of human self </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

212
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.823
<v Speaker 1>And so here the fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the equivalent to death and </v>

213
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:06.294
<v Speaker 1>that's why there's this in the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because what happened was when </v>

214
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 1>people became self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like consciously self conscious,</v>

215
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started to understand the full nature</v>

216
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:17.850
<v Speaker 1>of our vulnerability.</v>

217
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 1>And so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

218
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:23.420
<v Speaker 1>for human beings and in part it meant </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we discovered time like,</v>

219
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.753
<v Speaker 1>and that's a great thing to discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then it means you have the </v>

220
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:27.414
<v Speaker 1>future to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also an absolute bloody </v>

221
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:30.684
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe because you also understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the future is finite and that your </v>

222
00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>life is bounded and that you will end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as we know,</v>

223
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:41.940
<v Speaker 1>human beings are the only creatures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to contend with that knowledge.</v>

224
00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 1>And once you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like once you wake up like that,</v>

225
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:45.923
<v Speaker 1>there's no going back to sleep like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a qualitative transformation in the </v>

226
00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:51.330
<v Speaker 1>nature of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

227
00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>the genesis story pushes the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther.</v>

228
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:54.814
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we've woken up when </v>

229
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 1>they're are aware of our vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also what makes us fallen creatures.</v>

230
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>It makes us alienated from existence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a way that animals aren't.</v>

231
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And so what that also means that this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an existential idea,</v>

232
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:12.130
<v Speaker 1>is that the rise of self consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that manner,</v>

233
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>which is in part the knowledge of death </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also what's made people,</v>

234
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

235
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example in genesis,</v>

236
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.993
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a funny story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he makes Adam a self conscious and </v>

237
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 1>then they wander off and cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves up,</v>

238
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:30.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is sort of the first entry into of</v>

239
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.460
<v Speaker 1>cultural artifacts into the paradisical </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

240
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you do,</v>

241
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:37.060
<v Speaker 1>once you realize you're naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered yourself up.</v>

242
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.043
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that story is often interpreted in a </v>

243
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 1>sexual way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's elements of that,</v>

244
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:43.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more pragmatic.</v>

245
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:44.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

246
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.153
<v Speaker 1>once you figure out that you're naked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to freeze to death and </v>

247
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:48.034
<v Speaker 1>then it's cold in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the first thing you do do is </v>

248
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:50.650
<v Speaker 1>cover yourself up.</v>

249
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.733
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people have been wearing clothes </v>

250
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 1>for a very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been wearing clothes for so long.</v>

251
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:57.334
<v Speaker 1>The body lights are adapted to clothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's been tens of thousands of </v>

252
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

253
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 1>and obviously human beings are also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only creatures that were closed,</v>

254
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:06.491
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:07.324
<v Speaker 1>and it's a human universal by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were clothes everywhere that </v>

256
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.250
<v Speaker 1>virtually everywhere that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been discovered.</v>

257
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.713
<v Speaker 1>So you cover yourself up and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first indication that you're aware of </v>

258
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:17.374
<v Speaker 1>your vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also aware of the necessity </v>

259
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:22.360
<v Speaker 1>of taking care of yourself as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

260
00:13:22.361 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 1>as a separate entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

261
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.753
<v Speaker 1>which animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals don't really seem to have that </v>

262
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:26.621
<v Speaker 1>notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

263
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:30.520
<v Speaker 1>they get hungry and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obvious that they know that</v>

264
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 1>they can extend the idea of hunger into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future so that you know,</v>

265
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they're,</v>

266
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 1>they're caring about times that are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>here yet.</v>

267
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:39.903
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens after people become </v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious to cover themselves up </v>

268
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:46.130
<v Speaker 1>and then God comes into the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he's always doing.</v>

269
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.970
<v Speaker 1>You have a walk with Adam and Adam can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be found.</v>

270
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:50.110
<v Speaker 1>And so God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

271
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:50.944
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.870
<v Speaker 1>where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

273
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Hiding away in Adam's cowering behind a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bush,</v>

274
00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 1>which is really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

275
00:13:57.341 --> 00:13:58.710
<v Speaker 1>there with eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.910
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that God can't see through the</v>

277
00:14:00.911 --> 00:14:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Bush or whatever it is that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

278
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes a case that God asks him what </v>

279
00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 1>in the world he's doing hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

280
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:08.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make it.</v>

281
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

282
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:11.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how'd you figure that out?</v>

283
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:15.320
<v Speaker 1>And of course Adam being heroic figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is if point Steve and says,</v>

284
00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:17.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the woman's fault for me,</v>

285
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.630
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was her that tempted me.</v>

286
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's really quite a comical story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

287
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:27.060
<v Speaker 1>it's often being red being read by sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Patriarchal Christian interpreters as</v>

288
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:32.560
<v Speaker 1>a story that implicates implicates eve </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the initial destruction of mankind.</v>

289
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:34.690
<v Speaker 1>But from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my way of reading it,</v>

290
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:35.524
<v Speaker 1>it's just as hard on added,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were even worse because he's such a </v>

291
00:14:37.181 --> 00:14:39.880
<v Speaker 1>cringing powered when things really </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to go wrong.</v>

292
00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first thing he does is hide </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's naked.</v>

293
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.700
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as these pushed on it a bit,</v>

294
00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:47.020
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your fault.</v>

295
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:47.880
<v Speaker 1>It's your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

296
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.723
<v Speaker 1>we won't take responsibility for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also an extremely complex </v>

297
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>story because one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>implies it's brilliant,</v>

298
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.813
<v Speaker 1>brilliant idea is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can imagine metaphorically that </v>

299
00:14:58.611 --> 00:15:01.860
<v Speaker 1>walking with God means something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying in close contact with the divine</v>

301
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:07.100
<v Speaker 1>nature of being or something like that.</v>

302
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.250
<v Speaker 1>And having ultimate faith in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive nature of reality.</v>

303
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Things that might damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you became self conscious,</v>

304
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.710
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you stop believing in that?</v>

305
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Which would be to stop walking with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

306
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:19.424
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become aware of your own </v>

307
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and your own finiteness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you afraid,</v>

308
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 1>so you'll hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is what people do.</v>

309
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.930
<v Speaker 1>They do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

310
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a chronic state of human existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in many ways you hide from the best</v>

311
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:33.704
<v Speaker 1>parts of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean adolescence is usually like </v>

312
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.250
<v Speaker 1>the painful acting out of that process </v>
<v Speaker 1>over a protracted period of time.</v>

313
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 1>And people often never really recovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>

314
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.573
<v Speaker 1>They won't bring their best forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're afraid and they're </v>

315
00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:49.970
<v Speaker 1>afraid for good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so God says,</v>

316
00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now you've done it.</v>

317
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:52.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't undo this.</v>

318
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.203
<v Speaker 1>And so now out you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be in paradise </v>

319
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:56.630
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you're no longer going to be</v>

320
00:15:56.631 --> 00:16:00.200
<v Speaker 1>unconscious like a happy child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you've screwed up completely.</v>

321
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:04.010
<v Speaker 1>You know your finite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to have to work because</v>

322
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.293
<v Speaker 1>you're aware of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know all these things that </v>

323
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:07.904
<v Speaker 1>can go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to have to work because </v>

324
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.900
<v Speaker 1>you realize that the future could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

325
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.753
<v Speaker 1>You have to fix things up and he tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>the women that they're going to suffer </v>

326
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:15.824
<v Speaker 1>dreadfully in childbirth very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting because there's a </v>

327
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:20.144
<v Speaker 1>reason that women suffered childbirth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that your </v>

328
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.560
<v Speaker 1>child's heads are too big activity both </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

329
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:26.150
<v Speaker 1>The last time we met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

330
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:26.984
<v Speaker 1>and so the story there also associates </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortical expansion with self </v>

331
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and with the difficulty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth.</v>

332
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.323
<v Speaker 1>It's bloody brilliant story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just unbelievable how much </v>

333
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.970
<v Speaker 1>information is packed into it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

334
00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:42.200
<v Speaker 1>that's very characteristic of archetypal</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that also helps you see how the,</v>

335
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another manifestation of the kind of </v>

336
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:45.254
<v Speaker 1>tree symbolism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that's characteristic of the </v>

337
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:51.731
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian stories and approving an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazonian and stories and enroll snake.</v>

338
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.150
<v Speaker 1>No trees without snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no paradise snakes,</v>

339
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.283
<v Speaker 1>no ability of mankind to ever produce a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounded environment that's safe without </v>

340
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 1>something chaotic managing to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of it.</v>

341
00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:04.844
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very paradoxical element of </v>

342
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:09.560
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty.</v>

343
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.410
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what's happening with teeth.</v>

344
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 1>On the right side of the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this skeleton at the back there.</v>

345
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Representing depth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's good.</v>

346
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:24.980
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave and then on the on the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>side here you have the embodiment of the</v>

347
00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:27.080
<v Speaker 1>church and the Christian tradition.</v>

348
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:28.123
<v Speaker 1>Now she's also handing out things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are from the tree and so this is like </v>

349
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.410
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

350
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.440
<v Speaker 1>the religious stories in general are </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about tragedy and redemption.</v>

351
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of what makes them religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

352
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.224
<v Speaker 1>It's like the outline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible things that can happen to </v>

353
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:43.640
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the most brutal possible way.</v>

354
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.653
<v Speaker 1>And then they provide a theory about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mode of being that might help you </v>

355
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:49.590
<v Speaker 1>address stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the redemptive part.</v>

356
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 1>And so the redacted part here is you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the tree there's also a crucifix.</v>

357
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.620
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a counterpart to this call </v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting the tree.</v>

358
00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.603
<v Speaker 1>They're all these little fruits and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them are obviously the apple skulls </v>

359
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 1>that eve are handing out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they are on the left hand side,</v>

360
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:07.044
<v Speaker 1>our hosts and the host is the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that the Catholics eat during the </v>

361
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:14.550
<v Speaker 1>mass and the host is hypothetically part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Christ's body.</v>

362
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a derivative of the last supper.</v>

363
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:18.924
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an unbelievably archaic </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that lurks underneath that because </v>

364
00:18:22.951 --> 00:18:23.784
<v Speaker 1>it's basically basically a cannibalistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>ritual and the idea is essentially that </v>

365
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.420
<v Speaker 1>if you can identify something that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal and you can incorporate it and you</v>

366
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:34.254
<v Speaker 1>do that most basically by eating because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you incorporate most </v>

367
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:39.330
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that can become part of you.</v>

368
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.960
<v Speaker 1>So you can take on the attributes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something by incorporating it.</v>

369
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.063
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the Christian drama is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to inculcate in its followers </v>

370
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.300
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you should imitate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate ideal.</v>

371
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

372
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Speaker 1>what's the ultimate ideal in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>religions handle that in different ways.</v>

373
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:56.790
<v Speaker 1>So food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if for example,</v>

374
00:18:56.791 --> 00:19:00.780
<v Speaker 1>is an ultimate ideal for Buddhists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ isn't ultimate for Christians.</v>

375
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.823
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what exactly is this thing that's </v>

376
00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:05.634
<v Speaker 1>ideal?</v>

377
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the host is part of it.</v>

378
00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:11.820
<v Speaker 1>So partly it's the body of Christ and </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly it's a wheaton wafer.</v>

379
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.983
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's made out of wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because we was regarded as a dying </v>

380
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:18.110
<v Speaker 1>and resurrecting crop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a,</v>

381
00:19:18.111 --> 00:19:20.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a crop that you know,</v>

382
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.343
<v Speaker 1>disappears in the fall and then comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the spring like most </v>

383
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:27.120
<v Speaker 1>agricultural products too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of an eternal miracle.</v>

384
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the dying and resurrected </v>
<v Speaker 1>corn God.</v>

385
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.793
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a pagan idea that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>assembling the Christian idea and then </v>

386
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.630
<v Speaker 1>there's something that's more profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

387
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:40.643
<v Speaker 1>which is that the idea is that the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human spirit that can accept </v>

388
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:46.704
<v Speaker 1>death and die and resurrect itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to continually transform in </v>

389
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:51.564
<v Speaker 1>the face of tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the thing that's the antidote to the </v>

390
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:56.730
<v Speaker 1>painful catastrophe of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

391
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a staggering idea.</v>

392
00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.363
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've studied personality theory for a </v>

393
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:02.124
<v Speaker 1>long time and the first thing that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered relationship to this as </v>

394
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.360
<v Speaker 1>almost all the personality theories that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have that involved movement towards a</v>

395
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:10.194
<v Speaker 1>state of improved health are predicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the idea that people transform </v>

396
00:20:13.801 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 1>through well through a process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>painful transformation.</v>

397
00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:18.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like disillusion of part of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

398
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.590
<v Speaker 1>which is painful in chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the reconstruction of that into</v>

399
00:20:22.591 --> 00:20:23.424
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a more fulfilled form and the </v>

400
00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:29.020
<v Speaker 1>reason that's associated with acceptance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vulnerabilities.</v>

401
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.810
<v Speaker 1>It's van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brilliant.</v>

402
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.673
<v Speaker 1>This is why the military is a virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the religious perspective is that </v>

403
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 1>you cannot change until you admit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong and that part of you has to</v>

404
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:39.744
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have part of admitting your </v>

405
00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:42.274
<v Speaker 1>insufficiency as being willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice that insufficiency to let it </v>

406
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 1>go so that something new rise out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ashes.</v>

407
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.530
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that can be your whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

408
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:51.703
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that your pathological in </v>

409
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:54.480
<v Speaker 1>your fundamental structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

410
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:55.683
<v Speaker 1>there may be things that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give up that are huge chunks of your </v>

411
00:20:58.211 --> 00:20:59.044
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the alternative is to be in pain and </v>

412
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.620
<v Speaker 1>suffering and misery and that can turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>into cruelty and murderousness and,</v>

413
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.583
<v Speaker 1>and things that are much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more terrible than me are </v>

414
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the idea here.</v>

415
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole whole story of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>redemption in St Louis.</v>

416
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Mindboggling brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

417
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.044
<v Speaker 1>it took people like took people </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years to think about this </v>

418
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:24.430
<v Speaker 1>image or meeting ends of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

419
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.533
<v Speaker 1>So there's so much thought packed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that image is beyond virtually beyond </v>

420
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Speaker 1>comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remarkable amateur.</v>

421
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:35.883
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some other representations of </v>

422
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:40.210
<v Speaker 1>trees that I think are quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

423
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:41.044
<v Speaker 1>So the first one here is a sculpture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a living sculpture that's a </v>

424
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:48.940
<v Speaker 1>representation of a complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see how the trees,</v>

425
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.893
<v Speaker 1>the curvature of the trees and makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful arch that is echoed in </v>

426
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:55.564
<v Speaker 1>the Gothic Cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the gothic cathedrals are stone </v>

427
00:21:58.121 --> 00:21:58.954
<v Speaker 1>trees essentially being the treats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense they're </v>

428
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 1>representative of the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's human human beings private home,</v>

429
00:22:07.181 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 1>but they're representative of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than that too.</v>

430
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Because the gothic cathedrals are these </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting trees made out of stone that</v>

431
00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:17.740
<v Speaker 1>are also places of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what the gothic cathedrals are,</v>

432
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.633
<v Speaker 1>basically they're what they're made of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our is the interplay between tree like </v>

433
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 1>stone and light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This big glass windows of course,</v>

434
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:26.374
<v Speaker 1>are the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this idea that the </v>

435
00:22:27.761 --> 00:22:31.100
<v Speaker 1>ultimate structure is some tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like call them.</v>

436
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.380
<v Speaker 1>That's invadable limelight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways that's an analog of the</v>

437
00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:36.214
<v Speaker 1>body and its and its function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say symbols that are </v>

438
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:43.130
<v Speaker 1>associated with is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>

439
00:22:43.131 --> 00:22:44.350
<v Speaker 1>when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

440
00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:45.184
<v Speaker 1>these are echoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are echoes of the tree like </v>

441
00:22:46.781 --> 00:22:47.614
<v Speaker 1>structures that are with him because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree structure is a structure that many </v>

442
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:53.650
<v Speaker 1>biological farms statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know there's the,</v>

443
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.573
<v Speaker 1>that's the nervous system tree we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditating on for a bit because most of </v>

444
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:01.780
<v Speaker 1>us are convinced that our brain is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our head.</v>

445
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.810
<v Speaker 1>And really that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not that accurate.</v>

446
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.673
<v Speaker 1>But look at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the dissemination of your </v>

447
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:08.973
<v Speaker 1>nervous system throughout your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know your brain is distributed </v>

448
00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:12.800
<v Speaker 1>through your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your spinal cord.</v>

449
00:23:12.801 --> 00:23:16.120
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty damn smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can walk by itself.</v>

450
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.520
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take people who have,</v>

451
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:24.300
<v Speaker 1>who are paraplegic but have only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've managed spinal damage at a point</v>

452
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:25.834
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're no longer able to voluntarily </v>

453
00:23:27.911 --> 00:23:28.690
<v Speaker 1>controlled their legs.</v>

454
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:29.523
<v Speaker 1>If you heist the off and put them on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>treadmill until the floor with their </v>

455
00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:33.604
<v Speaker 1>legs will walk by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because your spinal cord is smart </v>

456
00:23:36.431 --> 00:23:37.264
<v Speaker 1>enough to walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you need your brain to tell it </v>

457
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:40.084
<v Speaker 1>where to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in some people who are paraplegic </v>

458
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:44.830
<v Speaker 1>have been taught to walk in a controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>

459
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:45.763
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know when your spine isn't </v>

460
00:23:47.751 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of your brain.</v>

461
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just a lower part that's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with movement.</v>

462
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.353
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole body is full of central </v>

463
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:55.694
<v Speaker 1>nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more neurons in your autonomic </v>

464
00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:59.600
<v Speaker 1>nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the part of your nervous system</v>

465
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:00.434
<v Speaker 1>that controls your internal organs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason your break so you know </v>

466
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:04.803
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck right into your body and </v>

467
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:09.260
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in your brain in some ways.</v>

468
00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hangover of the sole theory.</v>

469
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.283
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cartesian duality that makes minded </v>

470
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:18.660
<v Speaker 1>body something separate didn't united.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I believe something do that,</v>

471
00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely underestimates the degree </v>

472
00:24:22.071 --> 00:24:25.520
<v Speaker 1>to which you're an embodied nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and that this and that.</v>

473
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:26.354
<v Speaker 1>The structure of your thought is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the fact that you're in a </v>

474
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:32.330
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in a body cognitive creature</v>

475
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.810
<v Speaker 1>and you wouldn't think or be the way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are without the body.</v>

476
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not like an appendage to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

477
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:39.363
<v Speaker 1>You know how it works at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see the brain and the spinal </v>

478
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 1>cord as and you can see the neurons </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves as tree.</v>

479
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.940
<v Speaker 1>So the tree like structure Echos at </v>
<v Speaker 1>different levels of the nervous system.</v>

480
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.780
<v Speaker 1>These are very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

481
00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:58.781
<v Speaker 1>so they have a man in a lotus position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Lotus position?</v>

482
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Speaker 1>It's another tree metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lotus is a very interesting plant.</v>

483
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 1>So what Lotus is is that it grows on </v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

484
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.690
<v Speaker 1>so the water steve and maybe the top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear,</v>

485
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.280
<v Speaker 1>but then the bottom of the water is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

486
00:25:13.281 --> 00:25:17.300
<v Speaker 1>very murky and deep and dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it represents the dark elements,</v>

487
00:25:17.301 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 1>sate of the unconscious mind or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown,</v>

488
00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:20.504
<v Speaker 1>that art that we aren't privy to and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lotus grows way down into that and then </v>

489
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:27.410
<v Speaker 1>into the soil below and so it comes out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the darkness,</v>

490
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 1>the soil and the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then through the dark water and then</v>

491
00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:30.674
<v Speaker 1>up into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the clear light and on the surface </v>

492
00:25:33.201 --> 00:25:36.250
<v Speaker 1>of the water it blooms and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it opens up like,</v>

493
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:37.443
<v Speaker 1>like a Mandela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the stained glass window on the </v>

494
00:25:39.531 --> 00:25:40.830
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It opens up like that.</v>

495
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:41.664
<v Speaker 1>And in the middle of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Buddhists sits in his trying either </v>

496
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 1>position in the Lotus position and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents enlightenment.</v>

497
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:52.810
<v Speaker 1>And what the whole image represents is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the coherent ordering of multiple levels</v>

498
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:55.394
<v Speaker 1>of structure all the way from the primal</v>
<v Speaker 1>material up to the highest level of </v>

499
00:25:58.941 --> 00:25:59.774
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Buddha is like the ultimate </v>

500
00:26:02.451 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>flower of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Lotus tree.</v>

501
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:07.190
<v Speaker 1>So to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as in Christianity,</v>

502
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Christ is the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate manifestation of the,</v>

503
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.970
<v Speaker 1>of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the knowledge of good and evil.</v>

504
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.420
<v Speaker 1>The very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very analogous ideas and there's reasons</v>

505
00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:18.254
<v Speaker 1>for this to it and part of it is part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is something like if your </v>

506
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiology was properly adjusted </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you weren't working at cross purposes</v>

507
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:28.820
<v Speaker 1>to yourself so that you are nicely </v>
<v Speaker 1>aligned,</v>

508
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:29.923
<v Speaker 1>straight up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically healthy and not defeated </v>

509
00:26:31.971 --> 00:26:35.990
<v Speaker 1>lobster scuttling around the information</v>
<v Speaker 1>flow through your nervous system,</v>

510
00:26:35.991 --> 00:26:36.824
<v Speaker 1>through your body and your mind would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimized and that would enable the </v>

511
00:26:39.771 --> 00:26:42.350
<v Speaker 1>reality that you're attached to and part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

512
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.780
<v Speaker 1>to through you sort of in an untrammeled</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

513
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:46.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of you're,</v>

514
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 1>you're all full of bricks and trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>and problems and,</v>

515
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.310
<v Speaker 1>and places that are badly aligned and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

516
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.153
<v Speaker 1>you haven't got the opportunity as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence to sort of get access to </v>

517
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 1>your own wisdom as you're sort of a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of who you could be.</v>

518
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:02.843
<v Speaker 1>And so part of this and also the like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stone and glass that's represented </v>

519
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:07.523
<v Speaker 1>represented in the cathedrals is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the idea that there </v>

520
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 1>should be a balance between structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and light in you.</v>

521
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:14.214
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the metaphorical idea and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should be properly oriented </v>

522
00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 1>physically so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

523
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:19.883
<v Speaker 1>so that you're in touch with the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being in a way that makes you why </v>

524
00:27:23.301 --> 00:27:24.134
<v Speaker 1>isn't solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that </v>

525
00:27:25.501 --> 00:27:28.880
<v Speaker 1>enables you to take on the tragedy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existence without becoming weak.</v>

526
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are roads,</v>

527
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.880
<v Speaker 1>so this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an eastern Mandela and me.</v>

528
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.910
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>

529
00:27:36.911 --> 00:27:39.660
<v Speaker 1>is it's a tunnel into this tree like </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>

530
00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:40.494
<v Speaker 1>like a cross section of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like structures and if the hip you're </v>

531
00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:43.944
<v Speaker 1>looking into the tree like structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the micro elements of Ba and </v>

532
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.293
<v Speaker 1>there's representation there about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly aligned and everything is at </v>

533
00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:53.410
<v Speaker 1>every level of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

534
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.430
<v Speaker 1>of resolution and every level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation.</v>

535
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.590
<v Speaker 1>So he's back that are docs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of looking at it.</v>

536
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:05.160
<v Speaker 1>It's the same representation on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western side of things.</v>

537
00:28:05.161 --> 00:28:05.994
<v Speaker 1>It's like that stayed last window is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cross section of the trunks that </v>

538
00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:10.434
<v Speaker 1>make up the cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these buildings like the medieval </v>

539
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:15.960
<v Speaker 1>people spend a lot of time building </v>
<v Speaker 1>those cathedrals,</v>

540
00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:16.794
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things were massive works of </v>

541
00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:21.330
<v Speaker 1>culture and some of them took hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years to build.</v>

542
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.433
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine modern people building </v>

543
00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:26.010
<v Speaker 1>anything that would take like even 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

544
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like we want things to be up in six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

545
00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:31.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at most those medieval people would work</v>

546
00:28:31.411 --> 00:28:32.244
<v Speaker 1>away for like 300 years on the cathedral</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were really serious about what </v>

547
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it represented,</v>

548
00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:38.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to,</v>

549
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.540
<v Speaker 1>to produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

550
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.583
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the embodiment of the highest ideal in </v>

551
00:28:42.511 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 1>architectural form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

552
00:28:44.371 --> 00:28:46.530
<v Speaker 1>and we've lost a lot of that even on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>

553
00:28:46.531 --> 00:28:47.740
<v Speaker 1>You can see that because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

554
00:28:47.741 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 1>if you go over to the sort of classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the campus,</v>

555
00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:51.660
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

556
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.640
<v Speaker 1>cathedral like in beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

557
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:56.580
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some attention being paid to the</v>

558
00:28:56.581 --> 00:28:59.540
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic element of the wisdom that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied their knee.</v>

559
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Come over on this side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody like,</v>

560
00:29:01.411 --> 00:29:03.090
<v Speaker 1>it's hideous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a factory,</v>

561
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

562
00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.990
<v Speaker 1>the aesthetic is so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

563
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.840
<v Speaker 1>it's appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the buildings that are built to last</v>

564
00:29:09.841 --> 00:29:14.050
<v Speaker 1>for 50 years and then they're outdated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and completely cheap and hideous and</v>

565
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.070
<v Speaker 1>cinder block.</v>

566
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't want fluorescent lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like come on,</v>

567
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they have you guys sit in these</v>

568
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.333
<v Speaker 1>things that are so uncomfortable that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't put your dog in and then </v>

569
00:29:25.491 --> 00:29:26.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

570
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:27.883
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the loss to lose this sort of </v>

571
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

572
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval cathedral,</v>

573
00:29:32.701 --> 00:29:34.710
<v Speaker 1>a Gothic cathedral and this flooding </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

574
00:29:34.711 --> 00:29:35.544
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you're supposed to be in a </v>

575
00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:40.140
<v Speaker 1>university is something that's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval cathedral.</v>

576
00:29:40.141 --> 00:29:43.750
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to say it's a testament </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the best that mankind has to offer.</v>

577
00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't put it in a box like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's appalling.</v>

578
00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.840
<v Speaker 1>It's appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no excuse for it.</v>

579
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:51.003
<v Speaker 1>I actually think it's a conscious effort</v>
<v Speaker 1>to subvert the values of the university </v>

580
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.670
<v Speaker 1>because it's not a factory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not factory products.</v>

581
00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:58.803
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university is here to teach you how </v>

582
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:02.740
<v Speaker 1>to be human beings and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest thing that you can aim for.</v>

583
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.770
<v Speaker 1>It's and to subvert that to a lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders.</v>

584
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:09.190
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst thing that can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crime against humanity.</v>

585
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.210
<v Speaker 1>There's no excuse for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ugliness that goes along with it</v>

586
00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.044
<v Speaker 1>as part and parcel of the subversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a hatred of the highest </v>

587
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible thing.</v>

588
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.160
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know nobody,</v>

589
00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 1>none of you are going to go home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

590
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I feel proud that you were sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this room know,</v>

591
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:31.503
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now the Sharman are very strange </v>

592
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:40.350
<v Speaker 1>people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to know how long our</v>

593
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.930
<v Speaker 1>kick people have been practicing shabbat</v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals,</v>

594
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:44.764
<v Speaker 1>but we know that it's tens of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years and we also know that most of </v>

595
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:49.414
<v Speaker 1>the shamanic rituals and the visions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that accompany them are induced by some </v>

596
00:30:52.631 --> 00:30:55.450
<v Speaker 1>kind of hallucinogenic substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it depends,</v>

597
00:30:55.451 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 1>like it depends on the culture what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic substances.</v>

598
00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.403
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that's interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>about them is that they all have </v>

599
00:31:01.871 --> 00:31:04.660
<v Speaker 1>basically the same chemical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll show you that in a minute.</v>

600
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.400
<v Speaker 1>So the sharpen people are chosen to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>shown on our.</v>

601
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:10.234
<v Speaker 1>Basically you might think of them as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>repositories of the oral tradition of </v>

602
00:31:13.391 --> 00:31:14.440
<v Speaker 1>the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

603
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:17.260
<v Speaker 1>because most cultures have for it to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a culture,</v>

604
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.480
<v Speaker 1>first of all is it's a culture and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

605
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:21.490
<v Speaker 1>it's been around for a tremendous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>

606
00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and non knowing literate cultures have </v>

607
00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:29.800
<v Speaker 1>to carry that wisdom that they have with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in oral form or an embodied form.</v>

608
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.633
<v Speaker 1>So in ritual for more in oral form it </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody has to be the fundamental </v>

609
00:31:33.731 --> 00:31:34.564
<v Speaker 1>repository of that kind of wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this sort of the storyteller of the </v>

610
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.810
<v Speaker 1>tribe and the keeper of the flame so to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

611
00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:43.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's usually the role that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaman have.</v>

612
00:31:43.091 --> 00:31:46.240
<v Speaker 1>And they're the people who are contacted</v>
<v Speaker 1>when something's gone wrong with you,</v>

613
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.373
<v Speaker 1>if you're sick or if you're having real </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble mediating with another tribe </v>

614
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:52.930
<v Speaker 1>member or someone like that or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

615
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:56.230
<v Speaker 1>when you're maybe overcome with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're looking at the night sky,</v>

616
00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the showman who's supposed to be </v>

617
00:31:58.271 --> 00:32:01.450
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the realities that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of day to day reality.</v>

618
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.300
<v Speaker 1>And so they're like masters of sacred </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

619
00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:05.134
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes they're that way because </v>

620
00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:08.854
<v Speaker 1>their father was a or maybe their mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it's because they're kind </v>

621
00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:13.270
<v Speaker 1>of peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

622
00:32:13.271 --> 00:32:16.840
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are visionary as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of their temperament.</v>

623
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 1>And we know that visionary penis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

624
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 1>is an element of temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with trait,</v>

625
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:26.260
<v Speaker 1>openness and that's associated partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>with intelligence,</v>

626
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.273
<v Speaker 1>but also partly with creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those things aren't exactly the </v>

627
00:32:29.321 --> 00:32:30.154
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people are more imaginative and </v>

628
00:32:32.651 --> 00:32:34.570
<v Speaker 1>visionary than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in our culture,</v>

629
00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:37.060
<v Speaker 1>those would be people who tell great </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

630
00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:37.894
<v Speaker 1>Like j Dot k rowling is a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of that is she's been a </v>

631
00:32:40.731 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 1>shamanically intermediary for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

632
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:43.993
<v Speaker 1>for an entire generation of young people</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these massive books that she's </v>

633
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:47.894
<v Speaker 1>written that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a mythological core right down to </v>

634
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:51.920
<v Speaker 1>their rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to their essence.</v>

635
00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:55.640
<v Speaker 1>And Stanley who ran marvel comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another person like that,</v>

636
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:56.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has had an immense cultural influence </v>

637
00:32:57.711 --> 00:32:58.544
<v Speaker 1>because he's brought these ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories back up from the depths and put </v>

638
00:33:01.911 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 1>them into modern form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:04.754
<v Speaker 1>and the writers of these things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite consciously aware of what they're </v>

640
00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:09.860
<v Speaker 1>doing with regards to the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the underlying this.</v>

641
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.470
<v Speaker 1>They're not stupid people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if they were,</v>

642
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:16.040
<v Speaker 1>their readership rapidly informs them if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're deviating from the,</v>

643
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:16.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper narrative arc of the store </v>

644
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.573
<v Speaker 1>because those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those superheroes have their </v>

645
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.823
<v Speaker 1>dedicated cults of followers and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>make bloody sure that the new writers </v>

646
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:26.263
<v Speaker 1>don't mess around with the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so not only going to only is it top </v>

647
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.733
<v Speaker 1>down from the writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also bottom up from the </v>

648
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:33.374
<v Speaker 1>readers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're all participating in the </v>

649
00:33:34.491 --> 00:33:37.520
<v Speaker 1>construction of it continuing cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparatus.</v>

650
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:38.743
<v Speaker 1>So spontaneous vocation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're sort of designed for </v>

651
00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.210
<v Speaker 1>hereditary transmission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

652
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:47.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a familial issue and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal quest issue too,</v>

653
00:33:47.931 --> 00:33:51.020
<v Speaker 1>so that sort of associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous vocation.</v>

654
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the personal quest element with me,</v>

655
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.633
<v Speaker 1>there's always people in every culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are fundamentally obsessed with the </v>

656
00:33:58.251 --> 00:33:59.860
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

657
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:00.733
<v Speaker 1>that's their essential orientation </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards life and not particularly </v>

658
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.780
<v Speaker 1>practical like a conscientious person </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>

659
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 1>He was a conscientious person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>works you know,</v>

660
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.890
<v Speaker 1>and their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their head isn't in the clouds,</v>

661
00:34:09.891 --> 00:34:12.760
<v Speaker 1>but there are types of people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not like that at all.</v>

662
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Their heads are in the clouds </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently and all.</v>

663
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:16.423
<v Speaker 1>They're extraordinary and magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There've been creative and there are </v>

664
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:23.400
<v Speaker 1>thought leaders in many ways for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture because a lot of what culture is</v>

665
00:34:23.401 --> 00:34:24.234
<v Speaker 1>learned in an articulated sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what they become conscious of </v>

666
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.933
<v Speaker 1>is presented to them by artists in </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat unconscious farm long before </v>

667
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.870
<v Speaker 1>the full meaning of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

668
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:38.690
<v Speaker 1>of what's being portrayed as articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like that.</v>

669
00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:39.573
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just showed you that tree image with </v>

670
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Mary and the church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

671
00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:43.274
<v Speaker 1>on either side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the person who drew that </v>

672
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:46.483
<v Speaker 1>knew what they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew more about what they were </v>

673
00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:50.804
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the people who couldn't draw that </v>

674
00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:53.300
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were.</v>

675
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.580
<v Speaker 1>They were existing on the edge of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

676
00:34:55.581 --> 00:34:57.170
<v Speaker 1>making this representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

677
00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get at something here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get at something here,</v>

678
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:01.303
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't really know what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the idea is so complex that you </v>

679
00:35:04.221 --> 00:35:05.054
<v Speaker 1>know when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people have are coming up with it </v>

680
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:09.710
<v Speaker 1>over these thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your periods,</v>

681
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.693
<v Speaker 1>they don't realize the full impact of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that they're revealing and </v>

682
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.950
<v Speaker 1>just as you don't realize your own full </v>
<v Speaker 1>important</v>

683
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.913
<v Speaker 1>by whatever this is from Eritrea Eliana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by but by whatever method he may </v>

684
00:35:22.611 --> 00:35:25.370
<v Speaker 1>have been designated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a showman is recognized as such.</v>

685
00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Only after having received two methods </v>
<v Speaker 1>of instruction.</v>

686
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.470
<v Speaker 1>The first is ecstatic dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trances visions.</v>

687
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:35.870
<v Speaker 1>The second is traditional shamanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques,</v>

688
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 1>names and functions of the mythology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>genealogy of the plan.</v>

689
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:40.853
<v Speaker 1>The secret language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two full of teaching and is by the </v>

690
00:35:42.871 --> 00:35:46.350
<v Speaker 1>spirits and the old master Shaman </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes initiation.</v>

691
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.420
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very interesting.</v>

692
00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very interesting representation</v>

693
00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 1>of the manner in which personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation becomes knowledge.</v>

694
00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:56.641
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

695
00:35:56.641 --> 00:35:57.474
<v Speaker 1>let's say you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're beset by like a very frightful </v>

696
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:01.710
<v Speaker 1>series of nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

697
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.753
<v Speaker 1>what that's going to do is to drive you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to understand how to represent </v>

698
00:36:05.821 --> 00:36:06.654
<v Speaker 1>what you're having nightmares about in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the cultural elements that you </v>

699
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:12.080
<v Speaker 1>have at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what makes you saying,</v>

700
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:12.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're having experiences that are </v>

701
00:36:14.101 --> 00:36:14.934
<v Speaker 1>beyond the norm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you can incorporate them back </v>

702
00:36:18.271 --> 00:36:20.790
<v Speaker 1>into your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're alienated from your culture.</v>

703
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:21.624
<v Speaker 1>And that's a terrifying thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means like you might be the only </v>

704
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:26.940
<v Speaker 1>person that's insane like you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

705
00:36:26.941 --> 00:36:29.160
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very intolerable for people.</v>

706
00:36:29.161 --> 00:36:29.994
<v Speaker 1>It's bad enough to be different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be so different that you're </v>

707
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.350
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

708
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:36.090
<v Speaker 1>can you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sort of horror you don't want</v>

709
00:36:36.091 --> 00:36:36.990
<v Speaker 1>to encounter.</v>

710
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.823
<v Speaker 1>So the Shaman or people who are are </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed by like a rich inner fantasy </v>

711
00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:43.104
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who are simultaneously capable of </v>

712
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.503
<v Speaker 1>taking that and weaving it into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural mythology that they're part of </v>

713
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:49.344
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes them saying rather </v>

714
00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:51.204
<v Speaker 1>than insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because schizophrenia is someone who's </v>

715
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Speaker 1>has visionary experience which often </v>
<v Speaker 1>auditory,</v>

716
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.983
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hear voices and they're possessed </v>

717
00:36:58.921 --> 00:37:02.280
<v Speaker 1>by spirits in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see them wandering down the street,</v>

718
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring to their,</v>

719
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.703
<v Speaker 1>to their own internal voices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they can't integrate any of that </v>

720
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:08.850
<v Speaker 1>with the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're just,</v>

721
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.860
<v Speaker 1>they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're lost souls.</v>

722
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.280
<v Speaker 1>So the Shaman is someone who does both </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you know who,</v>

723
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.310
<v Speaker 1>who has the vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to incorporate it at the same time.</v>

724
00:37:17.311 --> 00:37:20.310
<v Speaker 1>So someone who is master of the visions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of not victim of.</v>

725
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.910
<v Speaker 1>And so there's technologies that allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to do that.</v>

726
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.670
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them are associated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said before,</v>

727
00:37:26.671 --> 00:37:31.020
<v Speaker 1>with the use of various solution agentic</v>
<v Speaker 1>substances in Siberia.</v>

728
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:32.003
<v Speaker 1>The youth who's called to be a showman </v>
<v Speaker 1>that attracts attention by a strange </v>

729
00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:35.490
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

730
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:36.324
<v Speaker 1>the Sikh solitude becomes absent minded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loves to roam in the woods or </v>

731
00:37:38.701 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 1>unfrequently places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has visions,</v>

732
00:37:40.771 --> 00:37:43.320
<v Speaker 1>and sings in his sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some instances,</v>

733
00:37:43.321 --> 00:37:47.540
<v Speaker 1>this period of incubation is marked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite serious symptoms among the yakuts.</v>

734
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:51.360
<v Speaker 1>The young man sometimes has fits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory and easily loses consciousness,</v>

735
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.940
<v Speaker 1>hides in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeds on the bark of trees,</v>

736
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.300
<v Speaker 1>throws himself into water and fire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting themselves with knives.</v>

737
00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.530
<v Speaker 1>So those are ordeals in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.303
<v Speaker 1>a future show among the Tongass as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach maturity go through a </v>

739
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:04.704
<v Speaker 1>hysterical or history crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes their vocation manifests </v>

740
00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:08.940
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At an earlier age,</v>

741
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.630
<v Speaker 1>the boy runs away into the mountains and</v>
<v Speaker 1>remains there for a week or more feeding</v>

742
00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:15.210
<v Speaker 1>on animals which tiers two pieces with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his teeth.</v>

743
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.180
<v Speaker 1>He returns to the village filthy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood state,</v>

744
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:19.014
<v Speaker 1>and it's only after 10 or more days have</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed that he begins to babble </v>

745
00:38:21.181 --> 00:38:22.260
<v Speaker 1>incoherent words.</v>

746
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.480
<v Speaker 1>So you would think from the perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>of modern human being says,</v>

747
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:26.363
<v Speaker 1>this is something like descent into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious structures that underlied </v>

748
00:38:29.481 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 1>normative cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like you descend into that at night</v>

749
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:33.503
<v Speaker 1>when you dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very peculiar process that you are </v>

750
00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:36.754
<v Speaker 1>all perfectly capable of engaging in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have most of you have virtually no </v>

751
00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:41.570
<v Speaker 1>control over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I me,</v>

752
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 1>there are people who dream lucidly you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

753
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.890
<v Speaker 1>and who can exert some conscious control</v>
<v Speaker 1>over their dreams.</v>

754
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Most people can learn how to do that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>

755
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.273
<v Speaker 1>but in our culture at least most people </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream unconsciously and it's just </v>

756
00:38:54.431 --> 00:38:55.264
<v Speaker 1>something that happens to you and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you're actively engaged </v>

757
00:38:57.341 --> 00:38:58.174
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strange behavior of future Sharman have </v>

758
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:05.200
<v Speaker 1>not failed to attract the attention of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scholars and from the middle of the past</v>

759
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.880
<v Speaker 1>century by which he meant the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

760
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Several attempts have been made to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain the phenomenon of shamanism as a</v>

761
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:12.750
<v Speaker 1>mental disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem was wrong.</v>

762
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.583
<v Speaker 1>We put from the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true that Shamans are always are </v>

763
00:39:16.211 --> 00:39:17.044
<v Speaker 1>always have to be neuropathics or </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotics are people who are not well </v>

764
00:39:20.411 --> 00:39:22.610
<v Speaker 1>put together mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On other hand,</v>

765
00:39:22.611 --> 00:39:23.444
<v Speaker 1>those among them who had been able </v>
<v Speaker 1>became shalman precisely because they </v>

766
00:39:25.871 --> 00:39:26.704
<v Speaker 1>had succeeded in becoming cured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is these are people </v>

767
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 1>who have undergone some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential crisis,</v>

768
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:34.310
<v Speaker 1>sometimes one that's induced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

769
00:39:34.311 --> 00:39:36.430
<v Speaker 1>as part of the process that turns them </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Solomon,</v>

770
00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:37.264
<v Speaker 1>but they were able to undergo that </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential crisis and then put </v>

771
00:39:40.121 --> 00:39:44.700
<v Speaker 1>themselves back together and so that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes the masters of of the chaotic</v>

772
00:39:44.701 --> 00:39:47.710
<v Speaker 1>ground so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're starting to fall apart and</v>

773
00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:48.544
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what to do while the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you can possibly do is find </v>

774
00:39:51.011 --> 00:39:51.844
<v Speaker 1>someone who's been there and come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that idea of going somewhere and </v>

775
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:58.280
<v Speaker 1>coming back is also a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common mythological story.</v>

776
00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.113
<v Speaker 1>So that's the story of the hobbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truths at the audit goes off on this </v>

777
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:04.114
<v Speaker 1>quest and he undergoes all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trials and the encounters that dragon </v>

778
00:40:07.421 --> 00:40:10.790
<v Speaker 1>that lives underneath everything and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets the gold from the Dragon,</v>

779
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:11.643
<v Speaker 1>which is the information that the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>stores and then he comes back to his </v>

780
00:40:14.051 --> 00:40:14.884
<v Speaker 1>community and he's transformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's strange like he's going off on </v>

781
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:19.060
<v Speaker 1>this big adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

782
00:40:19.061 --> 00:40:19.721
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

783
00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 1>put together a tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's also rich,</v>

784
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.890
<v Speaker 1>but he's also peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When bill,</v>

785
00:40:24.891 --> 00:40:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill,</v>

786
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Bill goes back to the Shire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know everybody.</v>

787
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.163
<v Speaker 1>No one's exactly sure what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him because now he's contaminated with </v>

788
00:40:31.811 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 1>everything that he's gone through CCS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an agent of chaos himself,</v>

789
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone who's somewhat terrifying </v>

790
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.963
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful if you have to have a </v>

791
00:40:41.201 --> 00:40:43.690
<v Speaker 1>consultation about how you might deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the next dragon.</v>

792
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.033
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I said that a lot of the shamanic </v>

793
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:49.504
<v Speaker 1>initiator editorial ritual seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with a loose use of </v>

794
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:52.834
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic drugs and so the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>common ones that we know about our </v>

795
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:58.090
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

796
00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.310
<v Speaker 1>there's this mushroom which many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably seen in fairytales,</v>

797
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.313
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's on the cover of fairytales very </v>

798
00:41:03.971 --> 00:41:04.804
<v Speaker 1>frequently and now it's called a nominee</v>
<v Speaker 1>to miscarry a mushroom and it's </v>

799
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:10.390
<v Speaker 1>generally viewed as extremely toxic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some.</v>

800
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.340
<v Speaker 1>There's some reason for that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

801
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.293
<v Speaker 1>it can make the people who eat it very </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick and now and then people do die </v>

802
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:16.864
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly it's extraordinarily </v>

803
00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:20.320
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Vikings,</v>

804
00:41:20.321 --> 00:41:22.480
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is quite a terrifying story.</v>

805
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.493
<v Speaker 1>The vikings used to take as needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>miscarrying mushrooms before they went </v>

806
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:26.554
<v Speaker 1>on there and pillaging trips and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>use the mushrooms to transform </v>

807
00:41:29.201 --> 00:41:31.950
<v Speaker 1>themselves into the equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory monster,</v>

808
00:41:31.951 --> 00:41:33.480
<v Speaker 1>so they usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

809
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:37.550
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of target was wolves or </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears and the word Berserk,</v>

810
00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:42.080
<v Speaker 1>which is what the vikings used to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>ma'am bear shirt and so they would train</v>

811
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:42.914
<v Speaker 1>their young men to eat these </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic mushrooms and turn </v>

812
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:45.974
<v Speaker 1>themselves into pain free predators and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they would take them before they </v>

813
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:50.070
<v Speaker 1>went onto pillaging rated.</v>

814
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.670
<v Speaker 1>So you just imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

815
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.513
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there in northern England</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're in your village and it's all </v>

816
00:41:55.071 --> 00:41:58.800
<v Speaker 1>peaceful in these bloody crazy fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>cakes come all feel out of the ocean and</v>

817
00:41:59.090 --> 00:41:59.750
<v Speaker 1>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

818
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:00.583
<v Speaker 1>the open boats that they've traveled </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the North Sea it and they're all </v>

819
00:42:03.951 --> 00:42:07.790
<v Speaker 1>like stoned out of their gourd on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanita must carry a mushroom mushrooms,</v>

820
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:08.624
<v Speaker 1>an old convinced that they're like </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory bears and that's exactly how </v>

821
00:42:11.841 --> 00:42:13.850
<v Speaker 1>they're acting and they have no pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

822
00:42:13.851 --> 00:42:15.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>

823
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.580
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good seed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good scene.</v>

824
00:42:19.581 --> 00:42:20.414
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the vikings come through and they </v>

825
00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:22.490
<v Speaker 1>just destroy everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

826
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.940
<v Speaker 1>so that's they're used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were used for Marshall,</v>

827
00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:27.700
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

828
00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:28.973
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a drug that's used very </v>

829
00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.253
<v Speaker 1>commonly by he goosing shamonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences among themselves across the </v>

830
00:42:34.821 --> 00:42:38.610
<v Speaker 1>whole northern part of Europe in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they grow almost everywhere.</v>

831
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.750
<v Speaker 1>So those are the original magic </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom,</v>

832
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:46.130
<v Speaker 1>magic red and white dots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look in,</v>

833
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 1>you can see these things in drawings </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere,</v>

834
00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:49.844
<v Speaker 1>especially in fairytales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common representation of fairy </v>

835
00:42:53.381 --> 00:42:54.214
<v Speaker 1>tales.</v>

836
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.003
<v Speaker 1>There is some evidence that religions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are I suppose in some ways more </v>

837
00:43:01.551 --> 00:43:02.384
<v Speaker 1>articulated and sophisticated in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more articulated like </v>

838
00:43:05.061 --> 00:43:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Christianity say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the more shock traumatic,</v>

839
00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:09.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions.</v>

840
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I have also have their roots in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic experience.</v>

841
00:43:13.161 --> 00:43:15.950
<v Speaker 1>And this may be true to a degree that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't understand.</v>

842
00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.900
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something,</v>

843
00:43:17.901 --> 00:43:21.800
<v Speaker 1>this is taken from the manuscript which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is 11th century,</v>

844
00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:25.270
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally 11th to 13th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there were copies of admitted at</v>

845
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.113
<v Speaker 1>different times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you see here is my mom and really </v>

846
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.393
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the snake is associated with </v>

847
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.573
<v Speaker 1>siliciden mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very characteristic </v>

848
00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:36.794
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the silicide as much a minute and </v>

849
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.673
<v Speaker 1>the fruit that eve is feeding to Adam is</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the siliciden mushrooms for </v>

850
00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.710
<v Speaker 1>speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

851
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.310
<v Speaker 1>among people who are sort of at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fringes of,</v>

852
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.520
<v Speaker 1>of evolutionary theory that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that human beings levered themselves</v>

853
00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:55.520
<v Speaker 1>up into increased consciousness was by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of machines.</v>

854
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:59.570
<v Speaker 1>We can see in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the representations over there,</v>

855
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.583
<v Speaker 1>some of them are absolutely remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the one on the top right hand </v>

856
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.080
<v Speaker 1>corner there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Christ.</v>

857
00:44:06.081 --> 00:44:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And he's standing there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this with his hands up.</v>

858
00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:09.644
<v Speaker 1>And then underneath the bottom half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that circle is a psilocybin mushroom </v>

859
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.510
<v Speaker 1>with a head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

860
00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:15.483
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the main body of the machine is in </v>

861
00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:19.030
<v Speaker 1>the same position as Christ's head at </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

862
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:22.910
<v Speaker 1>like the offshoots of the mushroom or in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same position as his hands.</v>

863
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:26.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well God only knows what that means.</v>

864
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:27.973
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very strange and remarkable </v>

865
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:33.120
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really don't know what to make of it.</v>

866
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.600
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot more investigation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be done on that.</v>

867
00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:38.973
<v Speaker 1>This is an Osca vine and it's part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Amazonian shamans use to prove </v>

868
00:44:44.791 --> 00:44:45.624
<v Speaker 1>their hallucinogenic mixtures and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of the Westerners who've gone to </v>

869
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.820
<v Speaker 1>study the Amazonian showman configure </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

870
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:52.653
<v Speaker 1>How the hell they determined how are </v>
<v Speaker 1>they ever going to make their mixture </v>

871
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:56.070
<v Speaker 1>because it's virtually impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>

872
00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:57.203
<v Speaker 1>You need to take the vine and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to take another plant that doesn't </v>

873
00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:01.014
<v Speaker 1>grow in the same place and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mix them together in the right </v>

874
00:45:03.091 --> 00:45:03.924
<v Speaker 1>proportions and then you have to cook </v>
<v Speaker 1>them together for 72 hours and you have </v>

875
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:08.910
<v Speaker 1>to do that without breathing in any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vapors.</v>

876
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:10.043
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's thousands and thousands of </v>

877
00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:16.770
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of plants in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazonian jungle and it isn't obvious in</v>

878
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:17.604
<v Speaker 1>any way how the people who are using </v>
<v Speaker 1>these mixtures figured out how to make </v>

879
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:21.330
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you ask them,</v>

880
00:45:21.331 --> 00:45:22.164
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

881
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:26.310
<v Speaker 1>the plants told us how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that for modern Western people,</v>

882
00:45:26.311 --> 00:45:27.144
<v Speaker 1>that's not much of an explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly the explanation that </v>

883
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.440
<v Speaker 1>the tradesmen seemed to stick to.</v>

884
00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.533
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how people gather the </v>

885
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:35.141
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

886
00:45:35.141 --> 00:45:38.150
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees use medicinal plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

887
00:45:38.151 --> 00:45:38.984
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're capable of finding plants in </v>

888
00:45:40.981 --> 00:45:43.040
<v Speaker 1>their habitat they could eat that are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>math maker.</v>

889
00:45:43.041 --> 00:45:43.874
<v Speaker 1>So one that helped them deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases and it's not clear at all how </v>

890
00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:48.294
<v Speaker 1>they figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of mysteries about the </v>

891
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:52.890
<v Speaker 1>origin of human knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

892
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:58.170
<v Speaker 1>So the three sources of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>visionary experience,</v>

893
00:45:58.171 --> 00:45:59.004
<v Speaker 1>and this is very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the biochemical construction </v>

894
00:46:02.761 --> 00:46:06.240
<v Speaker 1>of hallucinogenic chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you see on the bottom</v>

895
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:07.074
<v Speaker 1>right is a serotonin molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now serotonin is in some ways it's the </v>

896
00:46:10.951 --> 00:46:11.784
<v Speaker 1>major brain neurotransmitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I say that is because during </v>

897
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:19.070
<v Speaker 1>the embryological development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain grows out,</v>

898
00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:19.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta,</v>

899
00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:24.180
<v Speaker 1>sorta flowers for and it's guided and </v>
<v Speaker 1>its development by the serotonin system.</v>

900
00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:27.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the system that uses Serotonin as</v>
<v Speaker 1>its primary neurochemical transmitter.</v>

901
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:32.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's not only in our very archaic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and it's so old that you share it</v>

902
00:46:32.881 --> 00:46:34.620
<v Speaker 1>as I've mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with crustaceans,</v>

903
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:35.543
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the system that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts you together as you emerge out of </v>

904
00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:38.754
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you see it continuing your </v>

905
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:43.140
<v Speaker 1>chemicals structure there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you see these are all different</v>

906
00:46:43.141 --> 00:46:45.510
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic substances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

907
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:47.640
<v Speaker 1>this one is suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

908
00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:52.170
<v Speaker 1>and they're all at the empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very weird chemical,</v>

909
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:53.303
<v Speaker 1>very illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He entity it produces if part of </v>

910
00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:56.403
<v Speaker 1>IOWASCA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although Iowasca is made with a plant </v>

911
00:46:58.471 --> 00:46:59.304
<v Speaker 1>that contains dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then something called an Mao </v>

912
00:47:01.381 --> 00:47:04.590
<v Speaker 1>inhibitor which decreases the rate at </v>
<v Speaker 1>which your body breaks it down,</v>

913
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.190
<v Speaker 1>like parody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It produces an instantaneous 10 minute,</v>

914
00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.453
<v Speaker 1>a hallucinogenic high that people were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People constantly report contact with </v>

915
00:47:13.591 --> 00:47:14.424
<v Speaker 1>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a psychiatrist who spent </v>

916
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.110
<v Speaker 1>years documenting DMT experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single person,</v>

917
00:47:19.111 --> 00:47:20.180
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't,</v>

918
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:21.043
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he walked through the experience with </v>

919
00:47:22.081 --> 00:47:23.040
<v Speaker 1>recorded the same thing.</v>

920
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.023
<v Speaker 1>They're shot out of their body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're immediately in an alien </v>

921
00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:28.140
<v Speaker 1>landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full whack.</v>

922
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.250
<v Speaker 1>You know what that seems to indicate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that from a,</v>

923
00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:32.123
<v Speaker 1>from a purely rational perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that these chemicals produced </v>

924
00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:39.380
<v Speaker 1>characteristic experiences that are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with visionary experience.</v>

925
00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:41.590
<v Speaker 1>They put you in something that's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream state.</v>

926
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:42.641
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oddly,</v>

927
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:45.550
<v Speaker 1>the dream state seems to be somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar from person to person,</v>

928
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:48.740
<v Speaker 1>but there are ways that in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the young,</v>

929
00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:49.613
<v Speaker 1>the contents of the unconscious mind can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be made manifest to the conscious mind </v>

930
00:47:52.841 --> 00:47:57.220
<v Speaker 1>at least for for brief periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that can be clearly horrifying</v>

931
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:59.290
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes people take these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

932
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:00.453
<v Speaker 1>these chemicals and have like the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of their life and part of </v>

933
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:04.654
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing that might happen to you </v>

934
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 1>in psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

935
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:09.994
<v Speaker 1>if you were convinced that your psyche </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't very well ordered and you are </v>

936
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:13.444
<v Speaker 1>harboring sort of dark secrets and lies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the sorts of things that might </v>

937
00:48:16.091 --> 00:48:16.924
<v Speaker 1>complicate your life and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>femineity millennial pathology and </v>

938
00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:24.100
<v Speaker 1>cultural baggage and like the horrors </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of live inside your brain,</v>

939
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychotherapy,</v>

940
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:29.200
<v Speaker 1>sort of confront those one by one in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic experience.</v>

941
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.630
<v Speaker 1>You might confront all of those at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

942
00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:32.683
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for,</v>

943
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.160
<v Speaker 1>for many people that's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to a quick trip to hell.</v>

944
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:40.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not something they'd rather repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>

945
00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.850
<v Speaker 1>why things are set up that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

946
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:43.743
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't really understand these </v>

947
00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:46.564
<v Speaker 1>things so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand the relationship </v>

948
00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:51.184
<v Speaker 1>between the parts of the brain that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated and conscious and then the </v>

949
00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:54.514
<v Speaker 1>lower parts that are sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>repositories of traumatic information </v>

950
00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:00.880
<v Speaker 1>and there's deeper mysteries that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand too.</v>

951
00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:01.714
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel if any of you are familiar </v>

952
00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:06.220
<v Speaker 1>with the term fee genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>

953
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:07.063
<v Speaker 1>there are studies of epic genetics now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that show that there are certain </v>

954
00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:10.864
<v Speaker 1>experiences that alter your genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and while we know that partly </v>

955
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.750
<v Speaker 1>because when like if you put yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new situation,</v>

956
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:21.190
<v Speaker 1>a radically new situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new genes will turn on inside of you and</v>

957
00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:24.190
<v Speaker 1>they'll coach for new proteins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll build new structures for you.</v>

958
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.060
<v Speaker 1>So new neurological structure sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of how you can adapt.</v>

959
00:49:28.061 --> 00:49:28.894
<v Speaker 1>And it's also part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>banging yourself against various </v>

960
00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:32.590
<v Speaker 1>obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

961
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:33.463
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a kind of what systematic way is a </v>

962
00:49:35.981 --> 00:49:38.530
<v Speaker 1>good way of expanding your range of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities.</v>

963
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.513
<v Speaker 1>So we know that experience can turn new </v>
<v Speaker 1>new genetic processes on that are there </v>

964
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.620
<v Speaker 1>sort of a latent prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we didn't know was that some of</v>

965
00:49:47.621 --> 00:49:48.454
<v Speaker 1>those experiences transform your genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures in a way that you can </v>

966
00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:52.504
<v Speaker 1>transmit to your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that that's the Lamarckian </v>

967
00:49:55.721 --> 00:49:59.200
<v Speaker 1>evolution and no one ever ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesized that that was possible.</v>

968
00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:00.190
<v Speaker 1>But you can look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

969
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:01.143
<v Speaker 1>it's mainstream science now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you know people are still not </v>

970
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:04.204
<v Speaker 1>really sure what to do about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to think about it from a conceptual </v>

971
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:09.640
<v Speaker 1>perspective because that sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't supposed to be possible.</v>

972
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:11.103
<v Speaker 1>So No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have no idea to to what level of </v>

973
00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.013
<v Speaker 1>being your experiences can be encoded </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we really don't know how you encode </v>

974
00:50:21.401 --> 00:50:22.234
<v Speaker 1>experience anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the fundamental </v>

975
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:24.904
<v Speaker 1>structures of your memory are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how that's associated with your </v>

976
00:50:27.531 --> 00:50:28.364
<v Speaker 1>conceptions of time and space are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how that's related to your ongoing </v>

977
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:31.724
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those things are deeply mysterious </v>

978
00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:34.274
<v Speaker 1>to us and what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in parts of the gins is that </v>

979
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:38.024
<v Speaker 1>they seem to take all the horrors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist that you haven't dealt with </v>

980
00:50:40.731 --> 00:50:42.560
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just put them in your face now.</v>

981
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:44.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the shamanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

982
00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:48.710
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not something for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take lightly and you know,</v>

983
00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:51.800
<v Speaker 1>and generally generally people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

984
00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:52.634
<v Speaker 1>But I've often found that it was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange that these chemicals produced </v>

985
00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.300
<v Speaker 1>experiences that are so strange that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture instantly deemed illegal.</v>

986
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.673
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it's like looking at what </v>

987
00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:02.714
<v Speaker 1>happened back in the Middle Ages when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic church we went after </v>

988
00:51:05.391 --> 00:51:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Galileo because he had something strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say about the mood.</v>

989
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like these experiences have tapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>into something that's a very,</v>

990
00:51:11.811 --> 00:51:12.644
<v Speaker 1>very primordial element of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence and associated say with the </v>

991
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:16.943
<v Speaker 1>shamanic rituals that have been going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>for tens of thousands of years and that </v>

992
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.150
<v Speaker 1>human cultures have always used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>orient themselves.</v>

993
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.313
<v Speaker 1>They're so added there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much anathema to our current </v>

994
00:51:27.201 --> 00:51:28.120
<v Speaker 1>culture that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

995
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.093
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we punish people severely books with </v>

996
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:33.320
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very peculiar behavior.</v>

997
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:34.723
<v Speaker 1>So although there is no doubt that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing is dangerous and very </v>

998
00:51:38.181 --> 00:51:39.800
<v Speaker 1>peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

999
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.983
<v Speaker 1>so the seanad report relatively constant</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of experiences when they're </v>

1000
00:51:46.911 --> 00:51:49.310
<v Speaker 1>undergoing their transformative </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

1001
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:51.890
<v Speaker 1>And here's a couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is climbing the world,</v>

1002
00:51:51.891 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 1>treat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already.</v>

1003
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.103
<v Speaker 1>We've already talked about the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat and what that seems to be if you </v>

1004
00:51:56.511 --> 00:51:57.344
<v Speaker 1>look at the reports of the Sharman is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they seem they're consciousness </v>

1005
00:52:00.411 --> 00:52:01.244
<v Speaker 1>seems to be able to to move itself up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and down levels of analysis that aren't </v>

1006
00:52:04.881 --> 00:52:08.330
<v Speaker 1>necessarily available to you in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal state of consciousness.</v>

1007
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:09.163
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not that's a real phenomenon </v>

1008
00:52:10.351 --> 00:52:14.540
<v Speaker 1>or whether or not part associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream isn't exactly clear.</v>

1009
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.740
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it is for example,</v>

1010
00:52:18.741 --> 00:52:19.574
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the show him with become convinced </v>

1011
00:52:20.811 --> 00:52:24.590
<v Speaker 1>that they can communicate with things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like plants at a very fundamental level,</v>

1012
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.070
<v Speaker 1>but they are also capable of when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>climb up the tree for example,</v>

1013
00:52:28.071 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 1>of entering sort of the realm of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors and communing with them.</v>

1014
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:36.380
<v Speaker 1>And I just read a book here recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the revival of Mongolian shamanism</v>

1015
00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:37.214
<v Speaker 1>and the Mongolian situation is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because it was a pretty </v>

1016
00:52:39.771 --> 00:52:41.690
<v Speaker 1>archaic culture and then the Soviets </v>
<v Speaker 1>came in,</v>

1017
00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:43.460
<v Speaker 1>they're like carbonized it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1018
00:52:43.461 --> 00:52:44.294
<v Speaker 1>which was sort of economically useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but socially it was napster catastrophe </v>

1019
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:48.704
<v Speaker 1>because the Soviets were murderous </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond belief and then in 1989 and they </v>

1020
00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:52.274
<v Speaker 1>just left and so the Mongolians like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were completely up in the air then </v>

1021
00:52:55.431 --> 00:52:58.490
<v Speaker 1>because their traditional culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be fragmented and you know,</v>

1022
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:02.960
<v Speaker 1>the whole communist thing was a bust and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they reverted back to shamanic practices</v>

1023
00:53:02.961 --> 00:53:03.794
<v Speaker 1>and the shop and told them that part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that they were all suffering </v>

1024
00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:08.770
<v Speaker 1>was because they had lost contact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ancestral spirits.</v>

1025
00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:09.603
<v Speaker 1>And partly what they meant by that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the continuity of the culture had </v>

1026
00:53:13.401 --> 00:53:15.950
<v Speaker 1>been disrupted and so people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

1027
00:53:15.951 --> 00:53:16.784
<v Speaker 1>This knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny because when Aleksandr </v>

1028
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:20.713
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn wrote about the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union and he wrote the volume volume he </v>

1029
00:53:24.411 --> 00:53:28.800
<v Speaker 1>wrote extensively about about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet experience,</v>

1030
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:29.813
<v Speaker 1>his eventual conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the best route for the Soviets </v>

1031
00:53:33.181 --> 00:53:34.014
<v Speaker 1>to take after the collapse of communism </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a return to the sort of </v>

1032
00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:38.163
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary process of development that</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized their exploration of </v>

1033
00:53:41.401 --> 00:53:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox Christianity because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fall back to something you know,</v>

1034
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:49.020
<v Speaker 1>because people need a meaning structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know a modern people have a hard</v>

1035
00:53:49.021 --> 00:53:52.370
<v Speaker 1>time with incomprehensible religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings.</v>

1036
00:53:52.371 --> 00:53:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Structures because we demand a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of rational clarity,</v>

1037
00:53:56.101 --> 00:54:01.101
<v Speaker 1>but there's a problem with that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute mysteries of life cannot be</v>

1038
00:54:01.591 --> 00:54:02.424
<v Speaker 1>formulated with rational clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to kind of encapsulate them in </v>

1039
00:54:06.541 --> 00:54:10.200
<v Speaker 1>a mystery that's partially </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandable because because otherwise</v>

1040
00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.850
<v Speaker 1>they stay completely out of your grasp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1041
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.880
<v Speaker 1>and you have no answer to the question.</v>

1042
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1043
00:54:15.321 --> 00:54:17.890
<v Speaker 1>what's the ultimate purpose of life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1044
00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be able to get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer in a really tight box.</v>

1045
00:54:21.211 --> 00:54:24.150
<v Speaker 1>You know that you could open up in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just going to provide all the answers.</v>

1046
00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:27.840
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be murky because partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it has to apply to everyone,</v>

1047
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.213
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it's murky and </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic in a sense and sort of </v>

1048
00:54:31.951 --> 00:54:32.784
<v Speaker 1>multifaceted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it's unnecessary or </v>

1049
00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1050
00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:40.110
<v Speaker 1>the more I've studied the theories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying personality theory,</v>

1051
00:54:40.111 --> 00:54:40.944
<v Speaker 1>the more I've become convinced and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me convinced beyond a doubt that that </v>

1052
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.200
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our connection to the,</v>

1053
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:50.070
<v Speaker 1>to the archaic structures of the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>that defined our culture.</v>

1054
00:54:50.071 --> 00:54:52.350
<v Speaker 1>So like without that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're without roots,</v>

1055
00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:53.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you a week.</v>

1056
00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:55.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you weak.</v>

1057
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:59.130
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every whim can possess you.</v>

1058
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Every stupid political idea that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along is instantly you're gone.</v>

1059
00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.050
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're certainly capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of going crazy with masses of people and</v>

1060
00:55:07.051 --> 00:55:10.410
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of insane ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has direct consequences.</v>

1061
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to be grounded in something?</v>

1062
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.550
<v Speaker 1>According to a Yakut informant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirits carry the future to hell and</v>

1063
00:55:18.551 --> 00:55:22.140
<v Speaker 1>shot him in a house for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound very pleasant.</v>

1064
00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Here he undergoes is initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spirits cut off this,</v>

1065
00:55:25.291 --> 00:55:28.110
<v Speaker 1>have they set off to one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the novice,</v>

1066
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:32.580
<v Speaker 1>for the novice must watch his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismemberment with his own eyes and they</v>

1067
00:55:32.581 --> 00:55:36.210
<v Speaker 1>hack his body to bits which are later </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed among the spirits of various</v>

1068
00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:37.044
<v Speaker 1>sicknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is only on this condition that the </v>

1069
00:55:38.641 --> 00:55:40.830
<v Speaker 1>future Sharman will obtain the power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>healing.</v>

1070
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:45.240
<v Speaker 1>His bones are then covered with new </v>
<v Speaker 1>flesh and in some cases he is also given</v>

1071
00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:46.083
<v Speaker 1>new blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the the fundamental structure of </v>

1072
00:55:48.001 --> 00:55:52.230
<v Speaker 1>the shamanic ritual seems to be that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>death of the,</v>

1073
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:53.183
<v Speaker 1>of the experiencing personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to experience that as a </v>

1074
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.780
<v Speaker 1>physiological transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1075
00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:01.170
<v Speaker 1>it's the conscious experience of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own depth and their dissolution,</v>

1076
00:56:01.171 --> 00:56:01.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1077
00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To you know,</v>

1078
00:56:02.581 --> 00:56:05.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dust and ashes from which from which</v>

1079
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 1>human beings originally arise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the specific characteristics of</v>

1080
00:56:09.421 --> 00:56:12.120
<v Speaker 1>shamanic initiations aside from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates?</v>

1081
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Dismemberment is this reduction to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of the skeleton.</v>

1082
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:16.603
<v Speaker 1>We are here in the presence of a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient religious idea which belongs to </v>

1083
00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:20.244
<v Speaker 1>the hunter culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bone symbolizes the final route of </v>

1084
00:56:22.621 --> 00:56:23.454
<v Speaker 1>animal life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mold from which the flesh </v>

1085
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:25.804
<v Speaker 1>continually rises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from the bone that men and animals </v>

1086
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:28.834
<v Speaker 1>are reborn for a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may entertain themselves in an </v>

1087
00:56:31.091 --> 00:56:31.924
<v Speaker 1>existence of the flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they die and their life is reduced </v>

1088
00:56:34.571 --> 00:56:35.404
<v Speaker 1>to the essence concentrated in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeleton from which they will be born </v>

1089
00:56:38.111 --> 00:56:39.480
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

1090
00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.190
<v Speaker 1>and then people who undergo these </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences seem to,</v>

1091
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:43.383
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to experience their own death </v>

1092
00:56:44.831 --> 00:56:45.664
<v Speaker 1>in a conscious manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very difficult thing to </v>

1093
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:52.741
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1094
00:56:57.961 --> 00:57:00.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious either for people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>

1095
00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:05.640
<v Speaker 2>what would you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1096
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:09.470
<v Speaker 1>who aren't accustomed to those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremes of experiences.</v>

1097
00:57:09.471 --> 00:57:10.304
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious at all how much of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing you have to become </v>

1098
00:57:12.171 --> 00:57:13.490
<v Speaker 1>conscious of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1099
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.353
<v Speaker 1>because death is obviously one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that terrifies people deeply and </v>

1100
00:57:17.361 --> 00:57:20.420
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious how you should accustom</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to that.</v>

1101
00:57:20.421 --> 00:57:23.090
<v Speaker 1>So I can tell you a story that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite interesting.</v>

1102
00:57:23.091 --> 00:57:23.924
<v Speaker 1>I had a client at one point who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian and that actually turns out </v>

1103
00:57:28.041 --> 00:57:28.874
<v Speaker 1>to be irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason that she was a </v>

1104
00:57:29.841 --> 00:57:33.170
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian because she couldn't even go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a like a,</v>

1105
00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.570
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a what?</v>

1106
00:57:34.571 --> 00:57:37.160
<v Speaker 1>A grocery store where there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>butcher's department.</v>

1107
00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Like she couldn't even look at the array</v>
<v Speaker 1>of neat.</v>

1108
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:40.603
<v Speaker 1>It just horrified her and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with something that was like </v>

1109
00:57:43.311 --> 00:57:46.730
<v Speaker 1>a sleeping beauty complex for her </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when she was a child,</v>

1110
00:57:46.731 --> 00:57:50.000
<v Speaker 1>your parents treated her like she was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairy princess and they really protected</v>

1111
00:57:50.001 --> 00:57:52.130
<v Speaker 1>your from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from everything you know.</v>

1112
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:53.263
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have seen Walt Disney's </v>

1113
00:57:54.261 --> 00:57:56.000
<v Speaker 1>sleeping beauty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Well that's interesting and that so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you would.</v>

1115
00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.033
<v Speaker 1>You remember there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the girl is born and sleeping </v>

1116
00:58:01.401 --> 00:58:04.040
<v Speaker 1>beauty is born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't invite someone to the,</v>

1117
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:06.530
<v Speaker 1>to the Christie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do they not invite</v>

1118
00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.360
<v Speaker 1>the wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1119
00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's maleficent in sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty.</v>

1120
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:14.630
<v Speaker 1>I think that's her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the one that turns into the dragon</v>

1121
00:58:14.631 --> 00:58:16.670
<v Speaker 1>of chaos at the end of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1122
00:58:16.671 --> 00:58:17.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a message in there.</v>

1123
00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:18.794
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not shield your young people from </v>

1124
00:58:21.381 --> 00:58:25.430
<v Speaker 1>natural catastrophe because it makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>them unconscious and it'll come back and</v>

1125
00:58:25.431 --> 00:58:27.260
<v Speaker 1>revisit them when they fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially,</v>

1126
00:58:27.261 --> 00:58:28.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they grow up,</v>

1127
00:58:28.101 --> 00:58:31.310
<v Speaker 1>when they hit puberty and come back with</v>
<v Speaker 1>force and if they're unconscious,</v>

1128
00:58:31.311 --> 00:58:32.144
<v Speaker 1>like if they're not prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horror of that will make them </v>

1129
00:58:34.341 --> 00:58:36.780
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened to this girl,</v>

1130
00:58:36.781 --> 00:58:40.160
<v Speaker 1>like she was sleeping 22 hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>when she came to see me.</v>

1131
00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:43.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like she was a fairy princess until</v>
<v Speaker 1>she hit puberty and then she was like an</v>

1132
00:58:43.791 --> 00:58:46.130
<v Speaker 1>evil slopped as far as their parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>were concerned.</v>

1133
00:58:46.131 --> 00:58:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It was like bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that switch,</v>

1134
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:49.250
<v Speaker 1>things switched completely.</v>

1135
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:50.323
<v Speaker 1>Of course that was horrifying to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also tangled up for her with </v>

1136
00:58:53.571 --> 00:58:56.960
<v Speaker 1>kind of the horror of life in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of the things that made</v>

1137
00:58:56.961 --> 00:59:00.620
<v Speaker 1>her so sensitive to the saint at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>displays of these displays of me,</v>

1138
00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:02.390
<v Speaker 1>which are of course quite horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1139
00:59:02.391 --> 00:59:04.700
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of remarkable that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>wander through the,</v>

1140
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:05.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1141
00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit of discomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1142
00:59:08.241 --> 00:59:09.074
<v Speaker 1>it's slaughterhouse stuff and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be normal is to be able to tolerate </v>

1143
00:59:13.011 --> 00:59:14.270
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's quite strange.</v>

1144
00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:15.890
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't tolerate it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1145
00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took her to butcher shops.</v>

1146
00:59:17.451 --> 00:59:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Now Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you do that with people,</v>

1147
00:59:19.371 --> 00:59:20.204
<v Speaker 1>if they have an identifiable feared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually quite easy to start the </v>

1148
00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:23.943
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic process because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to expose them voluntarily to the </v>

1149
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 1>things that they want to avoid.</v>

1150
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:29.743
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took her into a butcher shop and </v>

1151
00:59:31.011 --> 00:59:32.690
<v Speaker 1>cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't just flipped her over,</v>

1152
00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:33.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she sat in the car afterwards and cried </v>

1153
00:59:34.881 --> 00:59:35.714
<v Speaker 1>for 20 minutes and told me about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible life wasn't that she couldn't </v>

1154
00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:41.940
<v Speaker 1>live in the face of all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismemberment and constant death.</v>

1155
00:59:41.941 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And she was also very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very inclined towards identification,</v>

1156
00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the little cute animals,</v>

1157
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:50.740
<v Speaker 1>which is generally a fairly solid </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine trait,</v>

1158
00:59:50.741 --> 00:59:51.574
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because females are very attracted to </v>

1159
00:59:52.701 --> 00:59:53.534
<v Speaker 1>things that are cute and cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are basically infant tile and </v>

1160
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:56.961
<v Speaker 1>helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1161
00:59:56.961 --> 00:59:59.210
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of what activates the cute </v>
<v Speaker 1>detection.</v>

1162
00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:00.403
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of,</v>

1163
01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>of maternal behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really an part,</v>

1164
01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you didn't find your baby's </v>

1165
01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:07.000
<v Speaker 1>cute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd really be in trouble because there</v>

1166
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:09.280
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1167
01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:10.123
<v Speaker 1>and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they push you because they require </v>

1168
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>so much care.</v>

1169
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.640
<v Speaker 1>So they bloody well better be cute and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smiling,</v>

1170
01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make friends with you.</v>

1171
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:16.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1172
01:00:16.281 --> 01:00:17.114
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she would like was this hyper </v>

1173
01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:20.990
<v Speaker 1>identified with like little vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

1174
01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1175
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>and that's not good because she wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little vulnerable Annabelle,</v>

1176
01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:26.443
<v Speaker 1>she was also partly a Predator and human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are partly predators and you </v>

1177
01:00:29.121 --> 01:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you think that's terrible,</v>

1178
01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:31.394
<v Speaker 1>but that's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the predatory part of yourself </v>

1179
01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:37.010
<v Speaker 1>better be incorporated and used because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>

1180
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>first of all you'll be weak without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second of all,</v>

1181
01:00:39.711 --> 01:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>if you don't incorporate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

1182
01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:42.344
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make it go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will just go out and have fun on its </v>

1183
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:47.450
<v Speaker 1>own in ways that are unconscious that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't control.</v>

1184
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:51.290
<v Speaker 1>So she was a really good dreamer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl.</v>

1185
01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:52.124
<v Speaker 1>And she could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she actually had lucid dreams quite </v>

1186
01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:54.884
<v Speaker 1>remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes she could either ask her </v>

1187
01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>dream characters what they symbolized.</v>

1188
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Right in the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1189
01:01:00.171 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 1>is the only time I've ever seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I've had some lucid dreamers in</v>

1190
01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:04.424
<v Speaker 1>my practice and one day she had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream because she was really having a </v>

1191
01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:10.130
<v Speaker 1>hard time finishing university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like their sixth year,</v>

1192
01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:10.964
<v Speaker 1>seventh year or something like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was partly because she slept all </v>

1193
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:14.024
<v Speaker 1>the time and then she wouldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything done like she was trying to </v>

1194
01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>sleep to avoid consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1195
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:19.184
<v Speaker 1>To avoid being alive because </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness was too painful for her </v>

1196
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>and so she had a dream one day that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>met.</v>

1197
01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Actually I'm mixing two dreams here </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

1198
01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:26.834
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of just sort of collapses the </v>

1199
01:01:29.391 --> 01:01:30.620
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

1200
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>she dreamt that she met at Gypsy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was traveling through the forest and the</v>

1201
01:01:33.861 --> 01:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Gypsy told her that unless she was able,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you would be willing to work in a</v>

1202
01:01:37.101 --> 01:01:38.900
<v Speaker 1>slaughterhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd never finished her degree.</v>

1203
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:40.183
<v Speaker 1>So she came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She came and told me that dream and I </v>

1204
01:01:41.901 --> 01:01:44.480
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well slaughterhouse,</v>

1205
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:47.210
<v Speaker 1>that seems a little bit difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrange.</v>

1206
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.670
<v Speaker 1>When she wasn't sure she could handle </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anyways.</v>

1207
01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:50.504
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1208
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>is there anything that you can think of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you imagine something,</v>

1209
01:01:53.661 --> 01:01:57.740
<v Speaker 1>is there anything that you can think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might serve as a substitute?</v>

1210
01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>And she came back to me about a week </v>
<v Speaker 1>later and she says,</v>

1211
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see an embalming.</v>

1212
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1213
01:02:04.551 --> 01:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's rough.</v>

1214
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:07.101
<v Speaker 1>That's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1215
01:02:07.101 --> 01:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's rough.</v>

1216
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:09.374
<v Speaker 1>So I phoned around to a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different funeral homes and I told them </v>

1217
01:02:13.341 --> 01:02:18.140
<v Speaker 1>that I had a client who was so terrified</v>
<v Speaker 1>of death that she couldn't even live and</v>

1218
01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:19.123
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1219
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:20.123
<v Speaker 1>I want her to bring her to the funeral </v>
<v Speaker 1>home and walk through it and if it was </v>

1220
01:02:22.861 --> 01:02:26.320
<v Speaker 1>possible to see an embalming preparation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1221
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>they were very understanding.</v>

1222
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>It was quite interesting because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

1223
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>funeral parlor people are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange people,</v>

1224
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:32.514
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're dealing with death all </v>

1225
01:02:33.631 --> 01:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're daisy life,</v>

1226
01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get so it's,</v>

1227
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>well they're not dying of horror every </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

1228
01:02:41.431 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are able to deal with it,</v>

1229
01:02:43.351 --> 01:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing because we'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>knee deep in bodies otherwise.</v>

1230
01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone,</v>

1231
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>someone has to do with this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1232
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently you can specialize it.</v>

1233
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>And so what that all means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you think,</v>

1234
01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funeral partners,</v>

1235
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:55.903
<v Speaker 1>directors are like completely gone human</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some fundamental way clearly </v>

1236
01:03:00.571 --> 01:03:01.404
<v Speaker 1>indicates that it's possible for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal person to become so conversant </v>

1237
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:08.540
<v Speaker 1>with death that it's daily business and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1238
01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:11.910
<v Speaker 1>emergency department people are in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of situation.</v>

1239
01:03:11.911 --> 01:03:15.870
<v Speaker 1>And people who drive ambulances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like human beings are bloody tough.</v>

1240
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:16.943
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can take something like facing death </v>

1241
01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:20.420
<v Speaker 1>and turn it into an everyday occurrence.</v>

1242
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:21.283
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of horrifying in a sense to </v>

1243
01:03:22.531 --> 01:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>think that you could be that harsh in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1244
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

1245
01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:28.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to run away screaming the</v>

1246
01:03:28.561 --> 01:03:30.330
<v Speaker 1>first time there's an emergency in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1247
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell good are you?</v>

1248
01:03:31.471 --> 01:03:32.304
<v Speaker 1>If you know someone close to you gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>really sick and all you can do is whine </v>

1249
01:03:34.891 --> 01:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>and sniffle about it because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard on you.</v>

1250
01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not your attorney for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1251
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:40.800
<v Speaker 1>You should be strong so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>help them.</v>

1252
01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:43.470
<v Speaker 1>And that means that we have to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to face these sorts of things.</v>

1253
01:03:43.471 --> 01:03:45.210
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to the funeral parlor,</v>

1254
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a weird thing for me too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I actually have rather squeamish</v>

1255
01:03:49.081 --> 01:03:52.500
<v Speaker 1>stomach kind of disgust sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's hard for me,</v>

1256
01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:55.440
<v Speaker 1>especially odors just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just not good for me at all.</v>

1257
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.750
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1258
01:03:57.751 --> 01:04:00.000
<v Speaker 1>so I could have never been a surgeon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

1259
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.983
<v Speaker 1>But we went to the funeral parlor and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>found it extremely interesting because </v>

1260
01:04:04.951 --> 01:04:05.784
<v Speaker 1>first of all actually need to know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things operate because at some </v>

1261
01:04:09.031 --> 01:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>point you're going to be called upon to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>

1262
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'd be nice if you had a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge beforehand so that,</v>

1263
01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:14.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't only have the grief that was </v>

1264
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:17.873
<v Speaker 1>knocking you over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the novelty that was associated </v>

1265
01:04:19.741 --> 01:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>with trying to orient yourself in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

1266
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:22.853
<v Speaker 1>So we talked to the funeral director and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked to him about how he sort of </v>

1267
01:04:25.711 --> 01:04:28.530
<v Speaker 1>managed his day to day encounters with </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

1268
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he,</v>

1269
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:30.743
<v Speaker 1>he sort of saw it as his role to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shepherd people through the grieving </v>

1270
01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:33.834
<v Speaker 1>process and that for him and had made </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in some ways more acutely aware of </v>

1271
01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:41.400
<v Speaker 1>the affinity of life obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also made a more conscious of,</v>

1272
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of each day of the passing of each day.</v>

1273
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:45.533
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be one of the things that </v>

1274
01:04:46.411 --> 01:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>salutary about facing your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality.</v>

1275
01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:51.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like waste time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's,</v>

1276
01:04:51.361 --> 01:04:52.194
<v Speaker 1>here's a good question for you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you waste more than four </v>

1277
01:04:55.051 --> 01:04:57.470
<v Speaker 1>hours a day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1278
01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:58.561
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1279
01:04:58.561 --> 01:04:59.394
<v Speaker 1>so I would say the reason you do that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you haven't really faced the </v>

1280
01:05:02.311 --> 01:05:04.710
<v Speaker 1>reality of your own death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had done that,</v>

1281
01:05:04.711 --> 01:05:08.040
<v Speaker 1>you would stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would not waste time,</v>

1282
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:09.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we could do a quick economic </v>

1283
01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:12.690
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to do this with people.</v>

1284
01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:15.660
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think your time's worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>an our.</v>

1285
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know it's at least 10 bucks,</v>

1286
01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:20.944
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's</v>

1287
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:26.920
<v Speaker 1>the minimum value society puts on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>labor is $10 an hour.</v>

1288
01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1289
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:29.063
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smart and healthy and young and </v>

1290
01:05:30.821 --> 01:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>so each hour is an investment in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

1291
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.263
<v Speaker 1>so it has to be considered in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter because you're one of your hours </v>

1292
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>is worth more to you than one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours is worth to me because you have so</v>

1293
01:05:40.661 --> 01:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>much of your future life still depending</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

1294
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say $50 an hour.</v>

1295
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:47.404
<v Speaker 1>It's probably reasonable for what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys are worth at somewhere between 10 </v>

1296
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>and 50 anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1297
01:05:51.461 --> 01:05:52.800
<v Speaker 1>let's assume 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1298
01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>it's 200 bucks a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 1400 bucks a week,</v>

1299
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:59.140
<v Speaker 1>it's 5,600 bucks a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$65,000 a year.</v>

1300
01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:01.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to waste it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go right ahead.</v>

1301
01:06:01.481 --> 01:06:03.700
<v Speaker 1>But that's what it's costing you at </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum,</v>

1302
01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.170
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1303
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:08.200
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no because I'm not getting paid.</v>

1304
01:06:08.201 --> 01:06:12.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're paying for your studies.</v>

1305
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:15.610
<v Speaker 1>You just get paid 10 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just deferred income.</v>

1306
01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:18.640
<v Speaker 1>And there's a huge difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have bees and aches,</v>

1307
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:22.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these door shut his doors open.</v>

1308
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wasted that time,</v>

1309
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 1>you will bloody pay for it and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it back either.</v>

1310
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1311
01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:32.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're awake and you know that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is waiting for you,</v>

1312
01:06:32.351 --> 01:06:33.184
<v Speaker 1>and if there's only so much time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that can bloody well wake you up </v>

1313
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.790
<v Speaker 1>and stop you from wasting your time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have that much of it.</v>

1314
01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:46.390
<v Speaker 1>This is a medieval representation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

1315
01:06:46.391 --> 01:06:47.224
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a crucifix and it has a </v>

1316
01:06:48.431 --> 01:06:49.360
<v Speaker 1>snake on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

1317
01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.250
<v Speaker 1>But it's a tree snake thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1318
01:06:51.251 --> 01:06:52.084
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually an echo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a story in the Old Testament </v>

1319
01:06:54.221 --> 01:06:58.030
<v Speaker 1>about Moses leading his people through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the desert and it's sort of a,</v>

1320
01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:00.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've escaped from tyranny.</v>

1321
01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:03.190
<v Speaker 1>So that's the previous place of order </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're in chaos because they've</v>

1322
01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:05.170
<v Speaker 1>left here at eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're all wandering round,</v>

1323
01:07:05.171 --> 01:07:07.870
<v Speaker 1>sort of without their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know which way they're going.</v>

1324
01:07:07.871 --> 01:07:10.870
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to run away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's bad at,</v>

1325
01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:13.090
<v Speaker 1>toward something that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know where they are.</v>

1326
01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:15.050
<v Speaker 1>And so they get all kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1327
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:15.903
<v Speaker 1>fighting and break into factions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they start worshiping false gods </v>

1328
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:22.210
<v Speaker 1>like golden calves and fragmentation </v>
<v Speaker 1>under pressure.</v>

1329
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.010
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1330
01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:24.903
<v Speaker 1>God gets irritated at them and he throws</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of poisonous snakes into the </v>

1331
01:07:27.221 --> 01:07:28.470
<v Speaker 1>desert because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1332
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.000
<v Speaker 1>he's such an easy guy to get along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1333
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:31.983
<v Speaker 1>throws a bunch of poisonous snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're nickel run biting all these </v>

1334
01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:36.310
<v Speaker 1>people who are not being faithful.</v>

1335
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:37.143
<v Speaker 1>And so all the people who are doubting </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moses are starting to freak out because </v>

1336
01:07:41.241 --> 01:07:43.270
<v Speaker 1>they keep getting hit by all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>poisonous snakes.</v>

1337
01:07:43.271 --> 01:07:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And so they finally called them Moses to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask.</v>

1338
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1339
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>call off the poisonous snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be,</v>

1340
01:07:48.681 --> 01:07:49.514
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just calling all the poisonous </v>

1341
01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:50.944
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God says to Moses to build up like </v>

1342
01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.220
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a staff with a brown snake on it.</v>

1343
01:07:57.221 --> 01:07:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And that if people will come and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this name,</v>

1344
01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.800
<v Speaker 1>then they'll be immune to the snake's </v>
<v Speaker 1>poison.</v>

1345
01:08:01.801 --> 01:08:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Or the snakes will stop biting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which.</v>

1346
01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:08.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's a lovely story because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>another exposure story and sort of means</v>

1347
01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:09.034
<v Speaker 1>that if you're willing to gaze upon the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that is most poisoned to you or </v>

1348
01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:15.430
<v Speaker 1>that you're most afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that can help you overcome it.</v>

1349
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of like this and second </v>
<v Speaker 1>patient of,</v>

1350
01:08:17.871 --> 01:08:18.704
<v Speaker 1>except it's more complex because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface pale sort of stretches down </v>

1351
01:08:22.150 --> 01:08:22.983
<v Speaker 1>anything infinity that representations </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of it sort of the manifestation of </v>

1352
01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.173
<v Speaker 1>the unknown right from the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and space that's without even to </v>

1353
01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.173
<v Speaker 1>represent something that's sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of humanity in some sense is </v>

1354
01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:42.260
<v Speaker 1>that there's an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>troubles stemming from a new source.</v>

1355
01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Remarkable representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1356
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:48.403
<v Speaker 1>you heard about near death experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine the old idea that people see </v>

1357
01:08:52.221 --> 01:08:54.220
<v Speaker 1>the light at the end of the tunnel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

1358
01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:56.970
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't make get through the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see all their ancestors there.</v>

1359
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Something that vaguely resembles God and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1360
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.360
<v Speaker 1>and that's conditioned for some group by</v>
<v Speaker 1>their cultural background.</v>

1361
01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:05.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a very common experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is actually a representation of</v>

1362
01:09:05.871 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 1>that from the twelfth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the twelfth to 13th century.</v>

1363
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Anything by Hieronymus Bosch and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it seems to be the sort of thing also</v>

1364
01:09:12.561 --> 01:09:17.561
<v Speaker 1>that's characteristic of the traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience post reduction to skeleton,</v>

1365
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.900
<v Speaker 1>so the showmans dies and then as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that,</v>

1366
01:09:20.901 --> 01:09:21.734
<v Speaker 1>he ends up in the space that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by the presence of the </v>

1367
01:09:24.051 --> 01:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>ancestral spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that means and me.</v>

1368
01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.840
<v Speaker 1>You can think about those as each of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are embodiments of ancestral spirits,</v>

1369
01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:32.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1370
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Because all the ideas you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1371
01:09:35.181 --> 01:09:36.530
<v Speaker 1>are all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all,</v>

1372
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.570
<v Speaker 1>no there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of them are your ideas or virtually</v>

1373
01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:39.404
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to have an </v>

1374
01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:41.384
<v Speaker 1>original idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the ideas you have or like the </v>

1375
01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.193
<v Speaker 1>ghostly remnants of brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers are theologians who've </v>

1376
01:09:46.821 --> 01:09:47.690
<v Speaker 1>lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1377
01:09:47.691 --> 01:09:48.524
<v Speaker 1>hundreds or thousands of years ago in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole head is populated by these </v>

1378
01:09:51.231 --> 01:09:55.130
<v Speaker 1>states and they're sort of embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>things because they tell you how to act.</v>

1379
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1380
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:58.430
<v Speaker 1>they're not just cold dead ideas and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1381
01:09:58.431 --> 01:09:59.510
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1382
01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:00.523
<v Speaker 1>you're a mixture of all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if they ancestral </v>

1383
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:04.754
<v Speaker 1>spirits that these visionaries encounter</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like personified representations of </v>

1384
01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:11.540
<v Speaker 1>the spirits that live inside their head </v>
<v Speaker 1>or what they are.</v>

1385
01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:14.240
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of the experience seems to be,</v>

1386
01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

1387
01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:18.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like a rescue and the dying father </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

1388
01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:19.940
<v Speaker 1>from the depths.</v>

1389
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of you seen Pinocchio,</v>

1390
01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:23.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1391
01:10:23.091 --> 01:10:25.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental theme there right now,</v>

1392
01:10:25.171 --> 01:10:29.600
<v Speaker 1>don't use a marionette so anyone can </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate him and he's wouldn't head.</v>

1393
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:31.310
<v Speaker 1>He's not awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not conscious.</v>

1394
01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:32.144
<v Speaker 1>He's not alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he can be led astray in 15 </v>

1395
01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:35.264
<v Speaker 1>different ways and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally his father disappears to go </v>

1396
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:41.150
<v Speaker 1>looking for them and for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that aren't exactly clear as</v>

1397
01:10:41.151 --> 01:10:43.730
<v Speaker 1>father ends up being inside a whale that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bottom of the ocean,</v>

1398
01:10:43.731 --> 01:10:44.760
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1399
01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.150
<v Speaker 1>not the first place you think of looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your father,</v>

1400
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but especially if you're a puppet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1401
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:50.663
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cricket was leaving which was all </v>

1402
01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:53.324
<v Speaker 1>observed stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although one thing I could tell you is </v>

1403
01:10:56.841 --> 01:10:59.290
<v Speaker 1>what's the cricket snake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1404
01:10:59.291 --> 01:11:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the initials?</v>

1405
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fake,</v>

1406
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:03.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1407
01:11:03.321 --> 01:11:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Jimminy cricket is sending US Slang for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1408
01:11:06.121 --> 01:11:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And you know the animators pick that up </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a joke,</v>

1409
01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:11.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a joke because of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cricket serves as the conscience and</v>

1410
01:11:11.721 --> 01:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual guide on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this quest vision,</v>

1411
01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:17.880
<v Speaker 1>and it's the cricket that leads the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket deep underground.</v>

1412
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>You actually attended to the ocean to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the deepest depths of despair,</v>

1413
01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.680
<v Speaker 1>right in death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Chabad disintegration to find the</v>

1414
01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:27.780
<v Speaker 1>spirit of his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why does he need that?</v>

1415
01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:28.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because without incorporating the </v>

1416
01:11:29.941 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>spirit of his father or his forefathers </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be real.</v>

1417
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's because human beings at </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppets apparently,</v>

1418
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:39.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're cultural creatures.</v>

1419
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's you and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>your culture.</v>

1420
01:11:42.061 --> 01:11:42.894
<v Speaker 1>It's like you are your culture and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're either the embodiment of your </v>

1421
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:47.394
<v Speaker 1>culture fleshed out and made whole or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just a fragmentary thing and </v>

1422
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:52.950
<v Speaker 1>you're only half alive and worse than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1423
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.350
<v Speaker 1>you can cope with tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1424
01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the way that Pinocchio becomes real as </v>
<v Speaker 1>he rescues his father from the whale,</v>

1425
01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:00.690
<v Speaker 1>which is also a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1426
01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:02.580
<v Speaker 1>The whales that dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that?</v>

1427
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:06.210
<v Speaker 1>What happens to the whale?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spits fire.</v>

1428
01:12:06.211 --> 01:12:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird behavior for a whale.</v>

1429
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:10.490
<v Speaker 1>That's Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lights a fire inside of,</v>

1430
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:14.340
<v Speaker 1>but of course you know that's how human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have always escaped from chaos is</v>

1431
01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:15.174
<v Speaker 1>by using fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's the master of fire and that </v>

1432
01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:20.730
<v Speaker 1>brings them up from the depths and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to rescue his father and it actually</v>

1433
01:12:20.731 --> 01:12:21.451
<v Speaker 1>kills it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1434
01:12:21.451 --> 01:12:22.281
<v Speaker 1>His father says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1435
01:12:22.281 --> 01:12:23.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me drown.</v>

1436
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Save yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't give.</v>

1437
01:12:25.481 --> 01:12:26.314
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he dies in the effort to bring them </v>

1438
01:12:27.421 --> 01:12:28.730
<v Speaker 1>to shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the,</v>

1439
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blue fairy comes down and says,</v>

1440
01:12:30.571 --> 01:12:32.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're such a good puppet,</v>

1441
01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.640
<v Speaker 1>now you're awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1442
01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:36.474
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1443
01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a remarkable story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing movie.</v>

1444
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1445
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:43.230
<v Speaker 1>it has themes in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's thousands and thousands of years</v>

1446
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:44.064
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that the hero has to </v>

1447
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 1>journey to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the darkest depths,</v>

1448
01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:50.310
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reclaim a treasure.</v>

1449
01:12:50.311 --> 01:12:51.550
<v Speaker 1>The treasure can be lots of things.</v>

1450
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:53.520
<v Speaker 1>That can be the dead father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be a princess,</v>

1451
01:12:53.521 --> 01:12:55.440
<v Speaker 1>it can be gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter.</v>

1452
01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:56.483
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing you want most is to be found </v>

1453
01:12:59.161 --> 01:13:01.980
<v Speaker 1>where you least want to look just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely little.</v>

1454
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:04.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no chemical dictum by the way,</v>

1455
01:13:04.531 --> 01:13:07.520
<v Speaker 1>that the sort of reanimated buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1456
01:13:07.530 --> 01:13:10.780
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea in the show conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that past death.</v>

1457
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.190
<v Speaker 1>There's this opening up into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestral landscape and that's the place</v>

1458
01:13:14.191 --> 01:13:18.930
<v Speaker 1>where you can commune with while the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestor gods or maybe the spirit of the</v>

1459
01:13:18.931 --> 01:13:22.140
<v Speaker 1>ancestors themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something like God.</v>

1460
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:23.303
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the Christian </v>

1461
01:13:24.121 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1462
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:28.350
<v Speaker 1>one of the elements of God is God the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

1463
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.473
<v Speaker 1>And so God the father is sort of like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>amalgam of all the great fathers of the </v>

1464
01:13:33.031 --> 01:13:34.410
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1465
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.370
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1466
01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 1>what makes person a person a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>father?</v>

1467
01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful,</v>

1468
01:13:39.811 --> 01:13:42.080
<v Speaker 1>devoted attention would be part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1469
01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.193
<v Speaker 1>That's a transpersonal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're a great father and </v>

1470
01:13:45.661 --> 01:13:46.494
<v Speaker 1>you are too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about both of your </v>

1471
01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:51.060
<v Speaker 1>actions as a great father that are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

1472
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of that as the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the great father and you know,</v>

1473
01:13:54.571 --> 01:13:55.404
<v Speaker 1>that sort of shines through individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a way of communing with </v>

1474
01:13:58.621 --> 01:14:02.880
<v Speaker 1>God through the ancestors and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what these rituals are about.</v>

1475
01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I would like even now to stress the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the psychopathology of the romantic</v>

1476
01:14:09.181 --> 01:14:10.014
<v Speaker 1>vocation is not profane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it not belong to ordinary </v>

1477
01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.114
<v Speaker 1>symptomatology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has an initiatory structure and </v>

1478
01:14:15.431 --> 01:14:16.264
<v Speaker 1>signification in short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every produces a traditional mystical </v>

1479
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:19.774
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The total crisis of the future Sharma </v>

1480
01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:25.210
<v Speaker 1>sometimes leading to complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>disintegration of the personality and to</v>

1481
01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>madness can be evaluated not only as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiatory death,</v>

1482
01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.153
<v Speaker 1>but also as a symbolic return to the pre</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmo mechanic chaos to be a morphous </v>

1483
01:14:34.051 --> 01:14:37.090
<v Speaker 1>and indescribable state that precedes </v>
<v Speaker 1>any cosmogony.</v>

1484
01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a mouthful.</v>

1485
01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:41.890
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I mentioned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1486
01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:46.800
<v Speaker 1>there's some</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggestion on the part of the artists.</v>

1487
01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.920
<v Speaker 1>This is a monster of origin point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the beginning of time.</v>

1488
01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:58.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of the infinity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretches on the fourth and that emerges</v>

1489
01:14:59.131 --> 01:15:04.000
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the initiatory process is</v>

1490
01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:05.870
<v Speaker 1>the dissolution of the personality.</v>

1491
01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.270
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1492
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:08.283
<v Speaker 1>what state of existence exists at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>level where your personality dissolved </v>

1493
01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:13.803
<v Speaker 1>because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the world through your </v>

1494
01:15:15.251 --> 01:15:18.100
<v Speaker 1>personality and the world has given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formed through your personality and then</v>

1495
01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:20.530
<v Speaker 1>when it starts to dissolve and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disintegrate,</v>

1496
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.513
<v Speaker 1>say when you sink into depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said you're sinking into a state that </v>

1497
01:15:25.061 --> 01:15:25.894
<v Speaker 1>sort of before consciousness itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me tell you something that </v>

1498
01:15:29.501 --> 01:15:34.501
<v Speaker 1>William James said about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very difficult thing to get to,</v>

1499
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:36.383
<v Speaker 1>to communicate and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll touch on it a bit more when we </v>

1500
01:15:38.891 --> 01:15:43.390
<v Speaker 1>moved into constructivism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the idea here is that you,</v>

1501
01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:44.463
<v Speaker 1>that reality itself is extracted from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown and the unknowable and you </v>

1502
01:15:48.071 --> 01:15:48.904
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that as individuals because </v>

1503
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.680
<v Speaker 1>there's all the parts of the world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand and then there's parts of</v>

1504
01:15:53.681 --> 01:15:56.530
<v Speaker 1>the world that you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even conceive of now.</v>

1505
01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:58.630
<v Speaker 1>And then you encounter them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you fail.</v>

1506
01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:02.920
<v Speaker 1>And then you interact with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by doing that you make them real and</v>

1507
01:16:02.921 --> 01:16:03.754
<v Speaker 1>describable and experienceable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like there's this late </v>

1508
01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:07.503
<v Speaker 1>possibility that surrounds existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can interact with and pull up </v>

1509
01:16:11.081 --> 01:16:11.914
<v Speaker 1>into actuality and that sort of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the action of consciousness </v>

1510
01:16:14.981 --> 01:16:16.660
<v Speaker 1>on reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

1511
01:16:16.661 --> 01:16:20.260
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning of Genesis Genesis,</v>

1512
01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:23.140
<v Speaker 1>it's the word of God that produces order</v>
<v Speaker 1>from chaos.</v>

1513
01:16:23.141 --> 01:16:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the initiative.</v>

1514
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the initiation of a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then later in Genesis,</v>

1515
01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:29.584
<v Speaker 1>God makes human beings and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're made both of you in the image of </v>

1516
01:16:32.381 --> 01:16:33.940
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

1517
01:16:33.941 --> 01:16:34.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

1518
01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might mean that God has two arms,</v>

1519
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:37.713
<v Speaker 1>two legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it seems to mean more </v>

1520
01:16:38.981 --> 01:16:39.814
<v Speaker 1>accurately is that whatever it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you conscious has this divine </v>

1521
01:16:43.841 --> 01:16:48.580
<v Speaker 1>quality and it's capable of extracting </v>
<v Speaker 1>order continually from payoffs.</v>

1522
01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:51.820
<v Speaker 1>And by doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by being conscious actors in the world,</v>

1523
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.490
<v Speaker 1>you're bringing about the creation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

1524
01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's a remarkable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1525
01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:57.370
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>

1526
01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:58.413
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing mystical about that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know perfectly well that you can make </v>

1527
01:17:01.391 --> 01:17:03.670
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow one thing or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1528
01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:05.370
<v Speaker 1>and is that freewill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1529
01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:06.204
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows that question will never be </v>

1530
01:17:07.121 --> 01:17:09.460
<v Speaker 1>solved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly seems phenomenal,</v>

1531
01:17:09.461 --> 01:17:10.294
<v Speaker 1>logically like there's an option here </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you and there's an option here for </v>

1532
01:17:13.491 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 1>you and there's an option here for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all potential and you can just</v>

1533
01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:18.224
<v Speaker 1>choose which one of those you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>head towards and make actual and that's </v>

1534
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:24.080
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing that consciousness is something we</v>

1535
01:17:24.081 --> 01:17:27.590
<v Speaker 1>don't have a clue vote and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>William James.</v>

1536
01:17:27.591 --> 01:17:30.290
<v Speaker 1>William James is the father of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic philosophy,</v>

1537
01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:31.124
<v Speaker 1>but also with modern psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a fair bit of experimentation </v>

1538
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:38.690
<v Speaker 1>with nitrous oxide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this sort of inert gas that,</v>

1539
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:40.940
<v Speaker 1>that the dentists use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1540
01:17:40.941 --> 01:17:41.774
<v Speaker 1>as an animal analgesic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that also has quite profound </v>

1541
01:17:44.001 --> 01:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>hallucinatory and mystical experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>inducing properties.</v>

1542
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.180
<v Speaker 1>And so William James used to play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1543
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:52.400
<v Speaker 1>This is a poem he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote,</v>

1544
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:53.443
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll read the description description </v>

1545
01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.860
<v Speaker 1>first from William James and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>poem he said,</v>

1546
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:59.203
<v Speaker 1>pure experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name which I give to the original </v>

1547
01:18:00.861 --> 01:18:03.320
<v Speaker 1>flux of life before reflection has </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorized it.</v>

1548
01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Only newborn Babes and persons in semi </v>
<v Speaker 1>coma from sleep,</v>

1549
01:18:06.831 --> 01:18:07.670
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses,</v>

1550
01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:11.690
<v Speaker 1>or blows can have an experience pure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the literal sense</v>

1551
01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:17.060
<v Speaker 1>of that which is not yet any definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they'll ready to be.</v>

1552
01:18:17.061 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of what's full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of oneness and of meanness,</v>

1553
01:18:20.691 --> 01:18:23.690
<v Speaker 1>but in respects that don't appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing throughout yet.</v>

1554
01:18:23.691 --> 01:18:24.524
<v Speaker 1>So confusedly that it's phases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpenetrate and no points either of </v>

1555
01:18:27.801 --> 01:18:30.290
<v Speaker 1>distinction or of identity can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught.</v>

1556
01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1557
01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's sort of an incoherent,</v>

1558
01:18:53.401 --> 01:18:54.234
<v Speaker 1>but what William James is referring to </v>
<v Speaker 1>is this idea that what the ground of </v>

1559
01:18:59.161 --> 01:18:59.994
<v Speaker 1>reality as something like a potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a potential full of many possible </v>

1560
01:19:04.171 --> 01:19:08.460
<v Speaker 1>actualities from which single </v>
<v Speaker 1>actualities can be drawn and that that's</v>

1561
01:19:08.461 --> 01:19:10.950
<v Speaker 1>what consciousness is doing would it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes decisions and it's.</v>

1562
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:13.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant idea and I think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1563
01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.153
<v Speaker 1>and I expect you to take this with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grain of salt because I know this part </v>

1564
01:19:17.581 --> 01:19:20.150
<v Speaker 1>of what I'm telling you about what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>may think this about.</v>

1565
01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.800
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what I'm telling you is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>out on the fringes,</v>

1566
01:19:22.801 --> 01:19:23.634
<v Speaker 1>but the quantum mechanics believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most accurate way to portray the </v>

1567
01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:32.160
<v Speaker 1>ground of reality is as something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>striving to manifest itself.</v>

1568
01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:33.173
<v Speaker 1>It's not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be interacted with something </v>

1569
01:19:36.361 --> 01:19:39.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a conscious observer before it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes on tangible reality.</v>

1570
01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.900
<v Speaker 1>And so the ground of being seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

1571
01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:45.930
<v Speaker 1>like a multidimensional potential from </v>
<v Speaker 1>which many things can emerge.</v>

1572
01:19:45.931 --> 01:19:49.620
<v Speaker 1>And I think I actually think that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we see when we look at the future,</v>

1573
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:52.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what the hell is the future?</v>

1574
01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.930
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1575
01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:58.760
<v Speaker 1>we certainly treated it as if it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future is a place of potential wild,</v>

1576
01:19:58.761 --> 01:19:59.281
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1577
01:19:59.281 --> 01:20:00.990
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1578
01:20:00.991 --> 01:20:04.940
<v Speaker 1>it means whatever it means is real </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that you orient yourself by it</v>

1579
01:20:04.941 --> 01:20:05.774
<v Speaker 1>and you take the future seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe your choice is bringing </v>

1580
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:08.993
<v Speaker 1>future a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>future b and two being you don't really </v>

1581
01:20:10.861 --> 01:20:12.570
<v Speaker 1>know the limits of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1582
01:20:12.571 --> 01:20:16.470
<v Speaker 1>like if you really got your act together</v>
<v Speaker 1>right down to the core,</v>

1583
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:17.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea what sort of glorious </v>

1584
01:20:19.141 --> 01:20:21.720
<v Speaker 1>future you might be able to bring into </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

1585
01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1586
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:23.303
<v Speaker 1>it's an an resolve question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you diligently work with all of your </v>

1587
01:20:27.631 --> 01:20:28.464
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1588
01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:29.413
<v Speaker 1>to perfecting the things around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea how far you might be </v>

1589
01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:33.640
<v Speaker 1>able to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want it to.</v>

1590
01:20:33.641 --> 01:20:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a real open question and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of what human beings have to</v>

1591
01:20:37.351 --> 01:20:39.780
<v Speaker 1>bring against the sort of horrors of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

1592
01:20:39.781 --> 01:20:43.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have a lot of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you made the right choices,</v>

1593
01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:47.160
<v Speaker 1>if we're awake and careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what you might be able to</v>

1594
01:20:47.161 --> 01:20:50.200
<v Speaker 1>manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's this poem.</v>

1595
01:20:50.210 --> 01:20:52.590
<v Speaker 1>He sounds like a sixties hippy from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greenwich village,</v>

1596
01:20:52.591 --> 01:20:53.424
<v Speaker 1>really written in like 1890.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No verbiage can give it because the </v>

1597
01:20:57.511 --> 01:20:58.344
<v Speaker 1>verbiage is either by which he means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that whatever this potential is exists </v>

1598
01:21:02.221 --> 01:21:04.850
<v Speaker 1>in a place before articulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1599
01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Once it's articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not potential,</v>

1600
01:21:07.171 --> 01:21:08.640
<v Speaker 1>it's all of a sudden something actual.</v>

1601
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:13.440
<v Speaker 1>That's actually why the ancient Jews </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to use the name of God.</v>

1602
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.860
<v Speaker 1>You weren't allowed to name God because </v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you named God,</v>

1603
01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:19.660
<v Speaker 1>he was no longer God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God was the unnameable.</v>

1604
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:20.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the and the,</v>

1605
01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:24.930
<v Speaker 1>and the Muslims have the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea about Mohammed in many ways.</v>

1606
01:21:24.970 --> 01:21:25.803
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to make out concrete </v>

1607
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:30.220
<v Speaker 1>representation because then you take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>

1608
01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:31.373
<v Speaker 1>the ideal space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start to make it something that </v>

1609
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:35.870
<v Speaker 1>you can like our human construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1610
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:37.500
<v Speaker 1>it's an idea of this quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's merit.</v>

1611
01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:42.540
<v Speaker 1>No verbiage can give it because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbiage just other incoherent,</v>

1612
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.690
<v Speaker 1>coherent the same and it fades and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>

1613
01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:48.720
<v Speaker 1>It's infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you see the difference?</v>

1614
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Don't you see the identity constantly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Opposites united the same me telling you</v>

1615
01:21:54.631 --> 01:21:58.530
<v Speaker 1>to write a note to write extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>something other than that thing.</v>

1616
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Intoxication and other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This intoxication,</v>

1617
01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:06.270
<v Speaker 1>every attempted betterment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every attempted other men.</v>

1618
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:10.620
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fades forever and forever as we move.</v>

1619
01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start there.</v>

1620
01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:14.213
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
