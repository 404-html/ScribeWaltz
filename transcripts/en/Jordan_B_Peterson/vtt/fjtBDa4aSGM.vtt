1
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.443
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk a little bit more </v>

2
00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 1>about the fractionation of openness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

3
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done a fair number of studies with</v>

4
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:26.020
<v Speaker 1>the big five aspect scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we've talked about a lot,</v>

5
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>which enables the big five model to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated down into two aspects per</v>

6
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those aspects have been useful for a</v>

7
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.540
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

8
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>when we're looking at political </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

9
00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:44.701
<v Speaker 1>we've been able to determine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives who are generally regarded</v>

10
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:45.694
<v Speaker 1>as higher in conscientiousness are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually more specifically higher in </v>

11
00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:49.684
<v Speaker 1>orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not a lot of difference between </v>

12
00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:54.370
<v Speaker 1>liberals and conservatives with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to industriousness.</v>

13
00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:55.204
<v Speaker 1>And we've also been able to determine at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least to some degree that orderliness </v>

14
00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.913
<v Speaker 1>seems to be associated with disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity and disgust sensitivity as </v>

15
00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:04.774
<v Speaker 1>part of the behavioral immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reasons that </v>

16
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:07.774
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are more inclined to want </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like closed borders is because </v>

17
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>they're more concerned about maintaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries between things.</v>

18
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally associated with disgust.</v>

19
00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:20.644
<v Speaker 1>And I'll talk to you a lot about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>next week because once we sorted that </v>

20
00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

21
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.860
<v Speaker 1>really illuminated my way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about things that had happened.</v>

22
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Nazi Germany because people tend to,</v>

23
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.963
<v Speaker 1>people tend to think about like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been studying conservatism </v>

24
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.183
<v Speaker 1>from a scientific perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've tended to assume that it's </v>

25
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 1>associated with fear of the outgroup say</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it conservatives are more fearful to</v>

26
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:46.354
<v Speaker 1>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that actually doesn't seem to be </v>

27
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are not hiring trait </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

28
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:51.414
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really tough one because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to make a case that a </v>

29
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>group one group is more anxious let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

30
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:57.324
<v Speaker 1>or threat sensitive than another and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get differences in trait </v>

31
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've really got a problem</v>

32
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>over political versus well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the theories,</v>

33
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>the theories seem to be more trait like </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than situation.</v>

34
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

35
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we have found is that that,</v>

36
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time people thought that all </v>

37
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>of the negative emotions loaded on </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and it was like the global,</v>

38
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>it was the global trade for negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

39
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>but discussed seems to be its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>peculiar thing.</v>

40
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.013
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will talk to you more about that </v>

41
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:33.834
<v Speaker 1>next week and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just an example of why </v>

42
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>differentiation at the aspect level </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems useful.</v>

43
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:41.184
<v Speaker 1>You also pick up differences between men</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women at the aspect level that </v>

44
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>aren't obvious at the trait level as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

45
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about the model says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.423
<v Speaker 1>you have a model that operates at </v>
<v Speaker 1>different levels of resolution and low </v>

47
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:54.084
<v Speaker 1>resolution representations are good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one set of operations in higher </v>

48
00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:00.680
<v Speaker 1>resolution representations are good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other purposes.</v>

49
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.810
<v Speaker 1>And the purpose of course is to predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

50
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the primary scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>

51
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.183
<v Speaker 1>And so you pick the level of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives you the most prediction and </v>

52
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>perhaps also the most utility in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of formulating scientific theories.</v>

53
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.653
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we'll concentrate a little bit </v>

54
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>more today on openness per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So openness to experience fragments into</v>

55
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>intellect and openness proper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the right way to think about</v>

56
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>intellect is that it's the personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiation of Iq,</v>

57
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think that is because,</v>

58
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.593
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working memory predicts intellect quite </v>

59
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>nicely and working memory tests are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

60
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:37.534
<v Speaker 1>very highly correlated with g and s </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically g being the first factor </v>

61
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>that you pull out of any set of Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests,</v>

62
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:44.644
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's the technical definition of </v>

63
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>GE.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You set up sis,</v>

64
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sets of questions,</v>

65
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>do a factor analysis and extract out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first factor,</v>

66
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly equivalent by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the total or to that to two,</v>

67
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>the mean of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the items,</v>

68
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a one factor solution,</v>

69
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not much different than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>average.</v>

70
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.980
<v Speaker 1>So the average is actually a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that,</v>

71
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.873
<v Speaker 1>that where the hypothesis is that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single item loads equally on that </v>

72
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:10.931
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Because you're adding them all up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then dividing them by the number.</v>

74
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's no different than a factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

75
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.263
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you'll hear people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Jay Gould did this when he was </v>

76
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>complaining about Iq back in the 90s he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said of factor a factor analysis.</v>

77
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Like a factor is just a mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>

78
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

79
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.903
<v Speaker 1>so is the average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think it'd be average of a set of </v>

80
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>numbers real and answer that question </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

81
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you define real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use it for certain functions,</v>

82
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>which is a pretty good definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>real as far as I'm concerned.</v>

83
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you ask questions like that,</v>

84
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.663
<v Speaker 1>you have to define both your terms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that somewhat arbitrarily </v>

85
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.413
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

86
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>People with high iqs tend to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're smart,</v>

87
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.523
<v Speaker 1>which is that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then they tend to describe </v>

88
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:52.954
<v Speaker 1>themselves as smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give them the opportunity to do </v>

89
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:56.680
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that shows up when you ask them</v>

90
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:57.514
<v Speaker 1>questions about their problem solving </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability and that loads mostly on </v>

91
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:01.114
<v Speaker 1>intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't even obvious that </v>

92
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:03.964
<v Speaker 1>there's any real utility in assessing </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect from the self report </v>

93
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:08.194
<v Speaker 1>perspective when you could replace that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an Iq test because the Iq test is </v>

94
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 1>way more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

95
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.913
<v Speaker 1>but that gives you some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about the whole five factor </v>

96
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:17.561
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>where intelligence slots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slots in underneath openness,</v>

98
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>the openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper part of openness to experience,</v>

99
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:25.594
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I tend to think about as </v>

100
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.180
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use that at least as a shorthand</v>

101
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>to sort of aid your understanding in </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

102
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.333
<v Speaker 1>Creativity seems related to Iq in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>more people with higher iqs are likely </v>

103
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:38.764
<v Speaker 1>to be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if you take people who are noted for </v>

104
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:41.524
<v Speaker 1>their creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a high probability that they'll </v>

105
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>have a higher Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's more to it than Iq.</v>

106
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

107
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.293
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what creativity seems to be associated </v>

108
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>with then again depends on whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not how in how you define creativity.</v>

109
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.433
<v Speaker 1>Because you could define it as the sum </v>
<v Speaker 1>total of creative achievements that </v>

110
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:01.064
<v Speaker 1>you've made in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be the actual production of </v>

111
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.243
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artifacts of one form or another </v>

112
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>performances or inventions or artworks </v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

113
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what have you.</v>

114
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>We'll go over the dimensions in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle in a minute.</v>

115
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.763
<v Speaker 1>Or You could also define it as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivity to engage in creative </v>

116
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we'll start with that first.</v>

117
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatively?</v>

118
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like,</v>

119
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.293
<v Speaker 1>it's something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that I tossed you out an idea </v>

120
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.483
<v Speaker 1>and there's some probability that when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught you that idea that that will </v>

121
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>trigger off other ideas in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

122
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>threshold issue.</v>

123
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.823
<v Speaker 1>If you're not very creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll throw you an idea and hardly any </v>

124
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.464
<v Speaker 1>other ideas will be triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ones that will be triggered are </v>

125
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 1>going to be very closely associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that initial idea.</v>

126
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>So let's say I tossed each of you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea and I asked you to think,</v>

127
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>tell me the first thing that comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

128
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.183
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we would see first is that the </v>

129
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:54.914
<v Speaker 1>first thing that comes to mind for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that comes to mind in </v>

130
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>like in all likelihood would be shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>by many of you.</v>

131
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.113
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you could think about that as a </v>

132
00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>common response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

133
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.903
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a less creative response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there'll be some things that </v>

134
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:08.534
<v Speaker 1>come to mind for you that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are so idiosyncratic that you're </v>

135
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 1>the only person that thinks that and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one can understand it.</v>

136
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Well that that's also not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative because the thing that you,</v>

137
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.333
<v Speaker 1>for something to be creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be novel and useful at the </v>

138
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of a rough definition,</v>

139
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something creative is novel and useful.</v>

140
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 1>And obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

142
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of judgment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes along with that clearly,</v>

143
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.883
<v Speaker 1>but if it's too novel then no one else </v>
<v Speaker 1>can understand it and it's unlikely to </v>

144
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

145
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a range of convenience.</v>

146
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.863
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to decide if something is </v>

147
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what we would do for,</v>

148
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I could say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

149
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.114
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the next three minutes I want you to </v>

150
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>write down all of the uses you can think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of for a brick.</v>

151
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.461
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

152
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:57.461
<v Speaker 1>So someone tells me to use for a brick</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking windows.</v>

153
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

154
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 1>At what else can use a brick for</v>
<v Speaker 1>build a wall.</v>

155
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>It's very small wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wall for ants.</v>

156
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And what else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paperweight.</v>

157
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

158
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get the idea.</v>

159
00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not feeling very mouthy today,</v>

160
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:20.130
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so,</v>

161
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.320
<v Speaker 1>so you see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we gathered your responses,</v>

162
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.513
<v Speaker 1>say I said you have to think of 20 items</v>
<v Speaker 1>that 20 things that that you could do </v>

163
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.144
<v Speaker 1>with a brick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a bunch of the things that you </v>

164
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:32.354
<v Speaker 1>thought would be the same and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would come up with something </v>

165
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yours was reasonably different.</v>

166
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>The one about using it as a pumice stone</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your feet,</v>

167
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 1>that's someone else might've come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

168
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:40.274
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good creative response because </v>

169
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>it's unexpected and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could actually do it,</v>

170
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

171
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 1>so you'll get a graph of probability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>

172
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.043
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

173
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.630
<v Speaker 1>And the more probable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less creative,</v>

174
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the only criteria though,</v>

175
00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 1>because you also have to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility.</v>

176
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>So if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

177
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:00.294
<v Speaker 1>you've got three minutes to write down </v>
<v Speaker 1>as many uses as you can think of for a </v>

178
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>brick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would score that in a variety of ways.</v>

179
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:07.730
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I would do is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how many uses you generated.</v>

180
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 1>That's called fluency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we could also do that.</v>

181
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I could just say write down as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>words as you can.</v>

182
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.193
<v Speaker 1>Begin with the letter s in three minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that begin with the letter c or four </v>

183
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 1>letter words that begin with the letter </v>
<v Speaker 1>d.</v>

184
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

185
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.433
<v Speaker 1>I can constrain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I counted how many words you </v>

186
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:22.854
<v Speaker 1>generated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had an Iq measure and I had a </v>

187
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:26.004
<v Speaker 1>measure of how many words you generated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq plus the number of words that you </v>

188
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>generated would be a better predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your creativity.</v>

189
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Then just Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this fluency element that's,</v>

190
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.700
<v Speaker 1>and so that's something like the rate at</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can produce,</v>

191
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 1>say verbal ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we do know about,</v>

192
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.193
<v Speaker 1>about the creativity dimension of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of openness is that it is associated </v>

193
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:49.740
<v Speaker 1>with fluency and it's also associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with originality.</v>

194
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:50.574
<v Speaker 1>And originality would be how improbable </v>
<v Speaker 1>your use was compared to the uses </v>

195
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 1>generated by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

196
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.920
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can think of you,</v>

197
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.773
<v Speaker 1>you get thrown in idea and there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that that will go activate </v>

198
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>other ideas and if it coactivators many </v>
<v Speaker 1>other ideas,</v>

199
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 1>that's like fluency and if it coactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>eights ideas that are quite distant from</v>

200
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 1>the original idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

201
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 1>And you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could track distance by comparing it</v>

202
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 1>to two probability that other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have generated it.</v>

203
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Then that's also another indication of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

204
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 1>So they have to be unlikely risk.</v>

205
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Many unlikely responses that are useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what creativity is,</v>

206
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.943
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can fractionated into </v>

207
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.880
<v Speaker 1>different dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's creative thinking.</v>

208
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.440
<v Speaker 1>But then creative achievement would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to take those original ideas</v>

209
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:39.330
<v Speaker 1>and then actually to implement them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

210
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:42.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's obviously much more different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than merely being creative.</v>

211
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.343
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what creativity is depends on </v>

212
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:48.390
<v Speaker 1>which of those measurement routes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take.</v>

213
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Now I developed a questionnaire with one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my students,</v>

214
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Shelly Carson about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gees,</v>

215
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:56.340
<v Speaker 1>it's just about 30 years ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago,</v>

216
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:57.174
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the creative achievement </v>

217
00:10:58.261 --> 00:10:59.094
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll show you that here and I'll </v>

218
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:04.680
<v Speaker 1>show you some of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are interesting about it.</v>

219
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.671
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:08.910
<v Speaker 1>you hear a very frequently people say </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like everyone's creative.</v>

221
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

222
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.573
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as wrong as saying that </v>

223
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:13.710
<v Speaker 1>everyone's extroverted.</v>

224
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.903
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be pretty damn smart to be </v>

225
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:16.794
<v Speaker 1>creative because otherwise you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get to where other people have </v>

226
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:22.230
<v Speaker 1>already got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not creative by definition.</v>

227
00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:25.440
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so be in fast and being out there at the</v>

228
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:26.940
<v Speaker 1>front of things really makes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

229
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:27.774
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have to have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>divergent thinking capabilities and </v>

230
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>that's part of your traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Structure and creative people are really</v>

231
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:35.260
<v Speaker 1>different than non creative people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

232
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.153
<v Speaker 1>partly because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're highly motivated to do creative </v>

233
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 1>things and to experience novelty and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>

234
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.403
<v Speaker 1>and to chase down aesthetic experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intuit 10 movies into read fiction and </v>

235
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:49.140
<v Speaker 1>to go to museums and to enjoy poetry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

236
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to enjoy music.</v>

237
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 1>That's not conventional music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

238
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>These aren't trivial differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so and so.</v>

239
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:57.484
<v Speaker 1>It's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real miss statement to make the </v>

240
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 1>proposition that everyone's creative.</v>

241
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just simply not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of wishful thinking.</v>

242
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying that everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>

243
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:06.941
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

244
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:07.774
<v Speaker 1>if everyone's intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the term loses all of its meaning </v>

245
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.540
<v Speaker 1>because any term that you can apply to </v>
<v Speaker 1>every member of a category,</v>

246
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 1>obs has absolutely no meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't end.</v>

247
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.083
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing you want to be thinking </v>

248
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:21.760
<v Speaker 1>about here is that don't be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that creativity is such a good thing.</v>

249
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high return strategy,</v>

250
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 1>so if you're creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just try this.</v>

251
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 1>There's creative people in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

252
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>you guys are going to have a hell of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time monetizing your creativity.</v>

253
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.280
<v Speaker 1>It's virtually impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

254
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:36.820
<v Speaker 1>really difficult because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you make an original product,</v>

255
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:39.400
<v Speaker 1>you think the world will beat a pathway </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your door.</v>

256
00:12:39.401 --> 00:12:40.690
<v Speaker 1>If you build a better mouse trap.</v>

257
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's complete rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

258
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.050
<v Speaker 1>It isn't true in the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make a good creative product,</v>

259
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:52.150
<v Speaker 1>you've probably solved about 5% of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem because then you have marketing,</v>

260
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:52.984
<v Speaker 1>which is insanely difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have sales and then you </v>

261
00:12:54.881 --> 00:12:55.714
<v Speaker 1>have customer support and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to build an organization and you have </v>

262
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's really novel,</v>

263
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>you have to tell people what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is.</v>

264
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we built this future authoring program,</v>

265
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's available for people online.</v>

266
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 1>It's how do you market that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what that is.</v>

267
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:11.644
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he wrote a book while then you have </v>

268
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:16.180
<v Speaker 1>the problem that another million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have also written a book.</v>

269
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.253
<v Speaker 1>But if you produce something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely new and doesn't have a </v>

270
00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can't search for it online,</v>

271
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:22.480
<v Speaker 1>how are they going to find it?</v>

272
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have,</v>

273
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.753
<v Speaker 1>and then you have pricing problems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really unbelievably difficult to </v>

274
00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:30.940
<v Speaker 1>produce something creative and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>monetize it.</v>

275
00:13:30.941 --> 00:13:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're the creative person,</v>

276
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 1>invention,</v>

277
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.970
<v Speaker 1>you've got no money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 1>You've got no customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are big problems.</v>

279
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.860
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you go and you find a </v>
<v Speaker 1>venture capitalist.</v>

280
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 1>We start with family and friends because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it works.</v>

281
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:44.944
<v Speaker 1>He raised money for your product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You raise money from your family and </v>

282
00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:47.464
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's assuming you have family and </v>

283
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:52.480
<v Speaker 1>friends that have some money and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to give it to you and most</v>

284
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:55.720
<v Speaker 1>people aren't in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a terrible barrier right off the</v>

285
00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:56.554
<v Speaker 1>bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course you're putting your </v>

286
00:13:57.401 --> 00:13:58.234
<v Speaker 1>family and friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's substantial financial risk because </v>

287
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.850
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're stupid idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to make money is virtually zero</v>

288
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.890
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a really brilliant idea.</v>

289
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.040
<v Speaker 1>And so then let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you get past family and friends and</v>

290
00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:09.874
<v Speaker 1>you get venture capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalists involved cause that's often </v>

291
00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:15.100
<v Speaker 1>the next step or an angel investor </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's there's,</v>

292
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 1>there's steps in building a business </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and friends,</v>

293
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Angel investor that some rich guy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you happened to meet some manner is some</v>

294
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's who's into this sort of thing.</v>

295
00:14:24.311 --> 00:14:25.144
<v Speaker 1>Is is willing to provide you with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to get your product off the </v>

296
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:28.324
<v Speaker 1>ground?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well how much of your product is that </v>

297
00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:32.680
<v Speaker 1>person going to take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

298
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.810
<v Speaker 1>most of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of it.</v>

299
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:35.883
<v Speaker 1>And then if you get a venture and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder because you know you don't have </v>

300
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:40.990
<v Speaker 1>any money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to bargain for control</v>

301
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:42.610
<v Speaker 1>over your product?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll just say,</v>

302
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want the money or not?</v>

303
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And if your answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he'll go and do something else with</v>

304
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 1>his money.</v>

305
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's no shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you can do with your money.</v>

306
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a million things you can do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

307
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 1>so you're not in a great bargaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

308
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 1>And then if you get venture capitalists </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

309
00:14:58.431 --> 00:14:59.264
<v Speaker 1>they'll take another big chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if they're not very straight </v>

310
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just throw you out.</v>

311
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe by that point in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company's development,</v>

312
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 1>you're nothing but a pain in the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what do you know about marketing</v>

313
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.343
<v Speaker 1>and sales and customer service and </v>
<v Speaker 1>building an organization and running a </v>

314
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:14.060
<v Speaker 1>business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have a clue.</v>

315
00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:14.894
<v Speaker 1>So why do they need you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if you're a successful at </v>

316
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 1>generating a new idea and you put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a business,</v>

317
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>originator of the,</v>

318
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.960
<v Speaker 1>of the idea are going to make some money</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it is very,</v>

319
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:27.800
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>

320
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.470
<v Speaker 1>So don't be thinking that creativity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a,</v>

321
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.573
<v Speaker 1>it's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something you would want to curse </v>

322
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 1>yourself with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

323
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not all bad because it opens up </v>

324
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.113
<v Speaker 1>avenues of experience for creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that aren't available to people </v>

325
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 1>who aren't creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it definitely is a high risk,</v>

326
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:45.130
<v Speaker 1>high return strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

327
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.290
<v Speaker 1>So the overwhelming probability is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you will fail,</v>

328
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 1>but a small proportion of creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>people succeed spectacularly.</v>

329
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.360
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like a lottery in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

330
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.640
<v Speaker 1>You're probably gonna lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't lose,</v>

331
00:15:58.641 --> 00:15:59.474
<v Speaker 1>you could win big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that keeps a lot of creative people </v>

332
00:16:01.371 --> 00:16:02.204
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also they don't really have much </v>

333
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:05.420
<v Speaker 1>choice in it because if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative person,</v>

334
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:05.980
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

335
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fruit tree that's,</v>

336
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.950
<v Speaker 1>that's bearing fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't really have,</v>

337
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 1>you can suppress it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very bad for you.</v>

338
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creative people I've worked with as </v>

339
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 1>if they're not creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're miserable.</v>

340
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.650
<v Speaker 1>So they have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

341
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

342
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.480
<v Speaker 1>there's real joy and pleasure in it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

343
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and psychological utility.</v>

344
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.490
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an intelligent,</v>

345
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.713
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy for moving forward through </v>

346
00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:33.110
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

347
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:34.603
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I talk to people who are </v>

348
00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 1>creative and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys should listen to this because I</v>

349
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:40.220
<v Speaker 1>know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you happen to be creative,</v>

350
00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:43.700
<v Speaker 1>if you're a songwriter or another kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of musician or an artist or,</v>

351
00:16:43.701 --> 00:16:44.534
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or any of the other number of things </v>

352
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:46.754
<v Speaker 1>that you might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a way to make money and then </v>

353
00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:54.710
<v Speaker 1>practice your craft on the side because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you will starve to death otherwise.</v>

354
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Now some for some of you that won't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

355
00:16:56.781 --> 00:16:57.614
<v Speaker 1>but it's a tiny minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're best bet is to find a job that </v>

356
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:00.734
<v Speaker 1>will keep body and soul together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>parse off some time that you can pursue </v>

357
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:05.180
<v Speaker 1>your creative thing.</v>

358
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Because then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

359
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 1>as a longterm strategy of medium to </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm strategy,</v>

360
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.094
<v Speaker 1>it's a better one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's got incredibly difficult for </v>

361
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:12.920
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Musicians,</v>

362
00:17:12.921 --> 00:17:13.754
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly difficult for new </v>

363
00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:18.020
<v Speaker 1>musicians to monetize their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their craft,</v>

364
00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 1>even if they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at it.</v>

365
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

366
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:22.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

367
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:23.780
<v Speaker 1>so don't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I say,</v>

368
00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:25.850
<v Speaker 1>well everyone's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's not creative.</v>

369
00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:26.571
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

370
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:27.590
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

371
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:29.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something,</v>

372
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:30.194
<v Speaker 1>it's not self evident that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>curse someone with high levels of </v>

373
00:17:32.271 --> 00:17:33.860
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

374
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.423
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's how our creative achievement </v>

375
00:17:36.771 --> 00:17:37.604
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we did essentially was we thought </v>

376
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:44.090
<v Speaker 1>up how many domains there are in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be creative.</v>

377
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.243
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when you're designing a </v>

378
00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:47.084
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be over inclusive because </v>

379
00:17:48.171 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 1>the statistics will take care of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

380
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:52.670
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take a big area of,</v>

381
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of potential.</v>

382
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.433
<v Speaker 1>You can take a large area and aim your </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire at it and you can do </v>

383
00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:01.140
<v Speaker 1>statistics post hoc to see if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>covering the area.</v>

384
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.130
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

385
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 1>if the things that you're measuring or </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely correlated there,</v>

386
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:05.240
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.073
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about them that's </v>

388
00:18:06.411 --> 00:18:08.100
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're not correlated,</v>

389
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:08.934
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you're measuring two </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things and you can get rid of </v>

390
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:11.700
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

391
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 1>So we did start with a pretty wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>

392
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:14.551
<v Speaker 1>We thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

393
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:16.980
<v Speaker 1>well what domains can you be creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>in?</v>

394
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Visual Arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting and sculpture.</v>

395
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.033
<v Speaker 1>Then we had experts sort of rank order </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of achievement within those </v>

396
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:24.504
<v Speaker 1>domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you are a painter you could </v>

397
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:26.963
<v Speaker 1>zero gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no training or recognized talent </v>

398
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 1>in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

399
00:18:29.851 --> 00:18:31.860
<v Speaker 1>so you really want to keep an eye on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zeros.</v>

400
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.040
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then I've taken lessons.</v>

401
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:36.720
<v Speaker 1>People have commented on my talents.</v>

402
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.553
<v Speaker 1>I have won a prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My work has been critiqued in national </v>

403
00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:41.430
<v Speaker 1>publications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

404
00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:42.870
<v Speaker 1>so you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

405
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.920
<v Speaker 1>you get zero to seven points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can indicate more than,</v>

406
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:47.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's happened to you more than </v>

407
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

408
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:50.814
<v Speaker 1>and what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is interesting and is that the </v>

409
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:53.754
<v Speaker 1>higher you are up in this hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is that those things </v>

410
00:18:57.001 --> 00:18:58.800
<v Speaker 1>have happened to you more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

411
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.903
<v Speaker 1>that's another example of this weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing called the pareto principle or </v>

412
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:03.624
<v Speaker 1>price's law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is that it's sort of as good </v>

413
00:19:06.631 --> 00:19:07.464
<v Speaker 1>things happen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probability that more good things </v>

414
00:19:08.971 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 1>will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Increases,</v>

415
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because once you're famous,</v>

416
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:14.850
<v Speaker 1>people give you all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to do other things,</v>

417
00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:15.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>

418
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:16.614
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your success doesn't go like this goes </v>

419
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 1>like this zero zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero skyrocket.</v>

420
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.350
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>

421
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.470
<v Speaker 1>But getting from zero to getting from </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero to one,</v>

422
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.513
<v Speaker 1>if you're starting a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardest customer you'll ever get is </v>

423
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.334
<v Speaker 1>your first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second hardest one will be </v>

424
00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:33.210
<v Speaker 1>your second one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's virtually impossible to get a first</v>

425
00:19:33.211 --> 00:19:34.950
<v Speaker 1>customer because they're going to say to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

426
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be selling to people who</v>

427
00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:40.500
<v Speaker 1>are basically conservative and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to be evaluate.</v>

428
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be willing or able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to evaluate whether your damn product is</v>

429
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:45.570
<v Speaker 1>good for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll say,</v>

430
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.720
<v Speaker 1>well who are your other customers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if your answer to that is,</v>

431
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 1>well we don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like well then why they're going to</v>

432
00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:53.160
<v Speaker 1>be the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

433
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.620
<v Speaker 1>because people don't stick their necks </v>
<v Speaker 1>out at all.</v>

434
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Not a bit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so unless you're well established in</v>

435
00:19:59.371 --> 00:20:00.204
<v Speaker 1>the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're dealing with a big </v>

436
00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.120
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just bloody well forget it.</v>

437
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like a three year sales cycle </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

438
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.190
<v Speaker 1>it's re because big corporations move </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

439
00:20:08.191 --> 00:20:09.024
<v Speaker 1>very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might be able to find a small </v>

440
00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:11.274
<v Speaker 1>company that doesn't have much money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would be willing to use your stupid </v>

441
00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:14.184
<v Speaker 1>product for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're really nice to them and you </v>

442
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 1>get one customer that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

443
00:20:18.631 --> 00:20:20.730
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll,</v>

444
00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:21.900
<v Speaker 1>you'll end up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

445
00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:24.750
<v Speaker 1>And what do you think the royalty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just out of curiosity,</v>

446
00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:25.584
<v Speaker 1>so I've written a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be published by penguin </v>

447
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:29.580
<v Speaker 1>random house in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in January.</v>

448
00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the royalty is for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>author on a book?</v>

449
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.010
<v Speaker 1>So you make something creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a percentage of the sale.</v>

450
00:20:35.011 --> 00:20:37.800
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the percentages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just out of curiosity?</v>

451
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Guests?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

452
00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:42.354
<v Speaker 1>it's like 5% so think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that you make your thing </v>

453
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:46.644
<v Speaker 1>and 95% of it belongs to someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's if things are going quite </v>

454
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:50.314
<v Speaker 1>well for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't really matter what you </v>

455
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:54.190
<v Speaker 1>manufacture or produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about what you can expect.</v>

456
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing,</v>

457
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it eats,</v>

458
00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 1>he eats it all up so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so well anyways,</v>

459
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you need to know these things because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not self evident.</v>

460
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

461
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.880
<v Speaker 2>seems to be working all by itself.</v>

462
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:08.990
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take a look.</v>

463
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:09.843
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how else can you have creative </v>

464
00:21:10.701 --> 00:21:11.660
<v Speaker 1>achievement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

465
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.480
<v Speaker 1>you can be a musician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no training or recognized talent.</v>

466
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Recordings of my composition have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold publicly.</v>

467
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the top end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My composition has been copyrighted,</v>

468
00:21:19.971 --> 00:21:20.804
<v Speaker 1>recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>critiqued in local population pop </v>

469
00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.413
<v Speaker 1>publication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have composed an original piece of </v>

470
00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:25.790
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

471
00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:26.624
<v Speaker 1>let's try this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have composed an </v>

472
00:21:27.951 --> 00:21:30.840
<v Speaker 1>original piece of music?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

473
00:21:30.841 --> 00:21:33.150
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of creative people in here </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very impressive.</v>

474
00:21:33.151 --> 00:21:35.490
<v Speaker 1>So there must be 10 or 11 people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

475
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.623
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

476
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.100
<v Speaker 1>So how about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

477
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.563
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your copies of composition has been </v>

478
00:21:40.411 --> 00:21:43.460
<v Speaker 1>copyrighted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about it's been,</v>

479
00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.240
<v Speaker 1>the recordings have been sold publicly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually sold.</v>

480
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.223
<v Speaker 1>How many people?</v>

481
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two.</v>

482
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.721
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

483
00:21:51.721 --> 00:21:55.170
<v Speaker 1>So what you can see is there's a rapid </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop off in the number of people who say</v>

484
00:21:55.171 --> 00:21:57.280
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you fit into categories?</v>

485
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:58.114
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no training or recognized talent </v>

486
00:21:59.341 --> 00:22:00.174
<v Speaker 1>in this area.</v>

487
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

488
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

489
00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Zero is the median score on all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

490
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:06.703
<v Speaker 1>Median is the score.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most likely for people to </v>

491
00:22:08.691 --> 00:22:09.051
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

492
00:22:09.051 --> 00:22:11.540
<v Speaker 1>It's different than the mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Median score is zero.</v>

493
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.613
<v Speaker 1>So what's the median score and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire creative achievement </v>

494
00:22:14.301 --> 00:22:16.070
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

495
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.850
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you add up all over all 13 domains.</v>

496
00:22:19.851 --> 00:22:24.140
<v Speaker 1>The most typical score is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how creative people are.</v>

497
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.530
<v Speaker 1>There's zero creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

498
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.573
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

499
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.700
<v Speaker 2>certainly that everybody has a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of creativity,</v>

500
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.690
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part,</v>

501
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.300
<v Speaker 1>most of them are not really creative and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

502
00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.940
<v Speaker 1>The thing is you could say that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have people,</v>

503
00:22:40.941 --> 00:22:43.850
<v Speaker 1>all people are creative and that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can generate ideas,</v>

504
00:22:43.851 --> 00:22:46.040
<v Speaker 1>but the issue isn't whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can generate ideas.</v>

505
00:22:46.041 --> 00:22:46.874
<v Speaker 1>It's whether or not you can generate </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that are different from the ideas </v>

506
00:22:48.831 --> 00:22:49.664
<v Speaker 1>that other people generate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the critical issue because I </v>

507
00:22:52.401 --> 00:22:53.960
<v Speaker 1>didn't mean it depends on how you define</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

508
00:22:53.961 --> 00:22:56.690
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the novelty is a huge part of it,</v>

509
00:22:56.691 --> 00:22:57.524
<v Speaker 1>but that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of built into the definition </v>

510
00:22:59.241 --> 00:23:01.250
<v Speaker 1>of creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be novel and useful.</v>

511
00:23:01.251 --> 00:23:02.084
<v Speaker 1>And if your idea that you generate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as the idea that a bunch of </v>

512
00:23:05.001 --> 00:23:06.290
<v Speaker 1>other people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

513
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.790
<v Speaker 1>it's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

514
00:23:07.791 --> 00:23:10.520
<v Speaker 1>And if you define creativity that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everyone's creative.</v>

515
00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.150
<v Speaker 1>But it's a foolish way of defining </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity because everyone does it.</v>

516
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.230
<v Speaker 1>And we know that there has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something novel about creativity.</v>

517
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these categories all seem to be artistic</v>

518
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.330
<v Speaker 2>as well as requiring specific of skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

519
00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:34.940
<v Speaker 2>the music and answer choir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanical motor fields.</v>

520
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Are there ways to be creative outside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the artistic director?</v>

521
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go through the rest of the domains</v>

522
00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.450
<v Speaker 1>because we did include domains that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>

523
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.840
<v Speaker 1>that aren't and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

524
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Speaker 1>engineering is a good example of that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing nonfiction,</v>

525
00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.213
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things tend to tilt more in the </v>

526
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:53.324
<v Speaker 1>intellect direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm concentrating most particularly </v>

527
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:56.624
<v Speaker 1>here on the sort of creativity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a soap associated with </v>

528
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:01.040
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

529
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So dance,</v>

530
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.940
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's roughly the same as music,</v>

531
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:05.774
<v Speaker 1>so we won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we won't move forward into that </v>

532
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.740
<v Speaker 1>architectural design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My architectural design,</v>

533
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.580
<v Speaker 1>my architectural design has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized in a national publication,</v>

534
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:14.414
<v Speaker 1>creative writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My work has been reviewed in national </v>

535
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:18.830
<v Speaker 1>publications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Million books sold last year.</v>

536
00:24:18.831 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 1>250 of them sold more than a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand copies.</v>

537
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another,</v>

538
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.540
<v Speaker 1>that's another example of high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high return.</v>

539
00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 1>So probably you won't write a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you write a book,</v>

540
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:32.360
<v Speaker 1>probably no one would publish it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you publish it,</v>

541
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.150
<v Speaker 1>almost certainly no one will buy it.</v>

542
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.160
<v Speaker 1>So you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see what I mean?</v>

543
00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:38.120
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's exclusion.</v>

544
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.840
<v Speaker 1>The exclusion criteria there are so are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so thoroughly,</v>

545
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 1>they're so difficult because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to write a book,</v>

546
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:45.554
<v Speaker 1>even a bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to work a long time to write a </v>

547
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:48.374
<v Speaker 1>bad book and then your book has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn good before you're going to </v>

548
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:53.230
<v Speaker 1>get it published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

549
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.510
<v Speaker 1>and you also have to know about know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go about getting it published.</v>

550
00:24:56.511 --> 00:24:58.550
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't send a book to a publisher,</v>

551
00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want your stupid book.</v>

552
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.210
<v Speaker 1>They want a summary of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want an outline of the book,</v>

553
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.133
<v Speaker 1>they want three chapters of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to know who the hell you are </v>

554
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:09.344
<v Speaker 1>and why anyone should listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to know what other books your </v>

555
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:13.940
<v Speaker 1>book is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most importantly,</v>

556
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.380
<v Speaker 1>perhaps they want to know where it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in a bookshelf in a bookstore.</v>

557
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.400
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have trouble this has trouble with</v>

558
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:24.710
<v Speaker 1>the books that I write is no one who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>where to put them.</v>

559
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:25.723
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem because then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing people don't know how to </v>

560
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:28.244
<v Speaker 1>market them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's because they're more </v>

561
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 1>creative than usual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if there isn't a place</v>

562
00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:34.010
<v Speaker 1>that you can put the book where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can find it,</v>

563
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to publish it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you do,</v>

564
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:38.450
<v Speaker 1>you can't sell it because no one can </v>
<v Speaker 1>find it.</v>

565
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.480
<v Speaker 1>So you just think about the difficulties</v>
<v Speaker 1>in being a successful author.</v>

566
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.910
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to write a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard.</v>

567
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.130
<v Speaker 1>There's no damn way you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>it published,</v>

568
00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:46.964
<v Speaker 1>and if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably won't be a very good </v>

569
00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:48.494
<v Speaker 1>publisher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they have to do a really good job </v>

570
00:25:50.001 --> 00:25:51.200
<v Speaker 1>of selling it and marketing it.</v>

571
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to enter the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the market at the right time,</v>

572
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.993
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to be reviewed by the </v>

573
00:25:57.321 --> 00:25:59.750
<v Speaker 1>right people and then it has to be put </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the right places.</v>

574
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:01.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is your book,</v>

575
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 1>we'll go out for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one will buy it and it'll disappear.</v>

576
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's if you've done 99.99% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

577
00:26:08.331 --> 00:26:09.740
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

578
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.860
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creative writing or humor.</v>

579
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.890
<v Speaker 1>My humor has been recognized in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>national publication that's the top yet.</v>

580
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.160
<v Speaker 1>And I've written a joke or cartoon that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been published.</v>

581
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I've written jokes for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked as a professional comedian.</v>

582
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:23.503
<v Speaker 1>Inventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I regularly find novel uses for </v>

583
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:27.890
<v Speaker 1>household objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've built a prototype of what it,</v>

584
00:26:27.891 --> 00:26:31.040
<v Speaker 1>my designed inventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sold one of my inventions to people</v>

585
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:31.874
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has anyone in here built a prototype of </v>

586
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:38.261
<v Speaker 1>a design invention?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

587
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um Ha.</v>

588
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Is anyone in here created original </v>
<v Speaker 1>software for a</v>

589
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.140
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

590
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.720
<v Speaker 1>three people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

591
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Three people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about um,</v>

592
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I've sketched out an invention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked on its design flaws.</v>

593
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:54.024
<v Speaker 1>How many people?</v>

594
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.780
<v Speaker 1>So maybe two or three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

595
00:26:57.781 --> 00:26:58.614
<v Speaker 1>I mean if this was an engineering class </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in all likelihood there would be </v>

596
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:03.690
<v Speaker 1>more people in that category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that this is more in the domain.</v>

597
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:07.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not the exactly the artsy end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the creativity distribution.</v>

598
00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:10.200
<v Speaker 1>It's more on the ideas and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mechanical end of it.</v>

599
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's a reasonable way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

600
00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

601
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific discovery,</v>

602
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I do not have training or recognized </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability in this field.</v>

603
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I've received a scholarship based on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>work in science or medicine.</v>

604
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.903
<v Speaker 1>How many people have received a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scholarship based in their work on </v>

605
00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:26.574
<v Speaker 1>science and medicine?</v>

606
00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

607
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.220
<v Speaker 1>So we don't have anybody that goes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>that high.</v>

608
00:27:31.221 --> 00:27:33.920
<v Speaker 1>I have won a prize at a science fair or </v>
<v Speaker 1>other local competition.</v>

609
00:27:33.921 --> 00:27:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Anybody there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

610
00:27:36.441 --> 00:27:38.540
<v Speaker 1>There's maybe two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four people there.</v>

611
00:27:38.541 --> 00:27:41.870
<v Speaker 1>So that means we've got four people in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>class of about 150.</v>

612
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Who hit the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

613
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.313
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second level of scientific </v>

614
00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:49.250
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody received a grant to pursue their</v>

615
00:27:49.251 --> 00:27:50.720
<v Speaker 1>work in science and medicine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

616
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.583
<v Speaker 1>Highly Unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are mostly too young to have </v>

617
00:27:52.851 --> 00:27:54.740
<v Speaker 1>had that happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

618
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.350
<v Speaker 1>So theater and film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

619
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.663
<v Speaker 1>anybody who's at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people have performed in </v>

620
00:28:01.131 --> 00:28:02.450
<v Speaker 1>theater or film?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

621
00:28:02.451 --> 00:28:03.284
<v Speaker 1>You're an artsy bud shea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my acting abilities have been </v>

622
00:28:05.781 --> 00:28:08.720
<v Speaker 1>recognized in local publication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people for that one?</v>

623
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:11.660
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody higher than that?</v>

624
00:28:11.661 --> 00:28:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I've directed or produced to theater or </v>
<v Speaker 1>film production one too.</v>

625
00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been paid.</v>

626
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:23.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been paid to pay one to two.</v>

627
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

628
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.513
<v Speaker 1>my theatrical work has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been paid to direct a theater or </v>

629
00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:29.540
<v Speaker 1>film production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>

630
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Got You there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've done that.</v>

631
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulations.</v>

632
00:28:34.911 --> 00:28:37.310
<v Speaker 1>You're way the hell up on the list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

633
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:38.750
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

634
00:28:38.751 --> 00:28:40.310
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard to monetize.</v>

635
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.340
<v Speaker 1>How many films did you make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You made?</v>

636
00:28:43.341 --> 00:28:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you make any money?</v>

637
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did?</v>

638
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulations.</v>

639
00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

640
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a</v>

641
00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Canadian filmmakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

642
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.393
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>queerness and then also piracy got </v>

643
00:29:05.211 --> 00:29:06.410
<v Speaker 1>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

644
00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the big problems with</v>

645
00:29:08.061 --> 00:29:09.800
<v Speaker 1>anything that can be distributed </v>
<v Speaker 1>digitally.</v>

646
00:29:09.801 --> 00:29:11.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

647
00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.713
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

648
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Timing is everything and that's,</v>

649
00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.220
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

650
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.083
<v Speaker 1>that's another one of the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>cutoffs is that not only do you have to </v>

651
00:29:22.101 --> 00:29:25.160
<v Speaker 1>be right and have yourself together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce the proper thing,</v>

652
00:29:25.161 --> 00:29:25.994
<v Speaker 1>but the market has to open its exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that moment so that you could walk </v>

653
00:29:27.951 --> 00:29:28.130
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

654
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.963
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a demand so people won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy anything that they don't have a </v>

655
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.160
<v Speaker 1>crying need for it because they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>

656
00:29:34.161 --> 00:29:34.994
<v Speaker 1>Say it's magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has 10 priorities and tet </v>

657
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.990
<v Speaker 1>number 10 is important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one ever does it.</v>

658
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.090
<v Speaker 1>And number eight is important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one ever does.</v>

659
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.440
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to go talk to someone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy what you have.</v>

660
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.530
<v Speaker 1>And that has to be priority one or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them because they'll say,</v>

661
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 1>oh that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really need it,</v>

662
00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:50.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's priority eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like forget it.</v>

663
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.423
<v Speaker 1>They'll never buy your thing cause they </v>
<v Speaker 1>never get to priority eight on their </v>

664
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:54.334
<v Speaker 1>list of 10 priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to get down to like priority </v>

665
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:56.704
<v Speaker 1>for so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that'll happen </v>

666
00:29:58.661 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 1>too is if you go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to sell your product,</v>

667
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:04.210
<v Speaker 1>you won't know who to talk to it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll end up spending 95% of your time.</v>

668
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:08.080
<v Speaker 1>This is especially true in companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the people who will talk to you,</v>

669
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

670
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.680
<v Speaker 1>But those aren't the people who ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>make any decisions.</v>

671
00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:12.514
<v Speaker 1>So they'll tell you all sorts of good </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about your product and how </v>

672
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:16.750
<v Speaker 1>interested they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they'll never buy because they can't</v>

673
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:17.584
<v Speaker 1>make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make decisions and you won't be </v>

674
00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:19.714
<v Speaker 1>able to get to the people who make </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions because other people who know </v>

675
00:30:21.731 --> 00:30:24.490
<v Speaker 1>how to do that have already got there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not you.</v>

676
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's very difficult as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culinary Arts,</v>

677
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.430
<v Speaker 1>my recipes have been published </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationally.</v>

678
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about,</v>

679
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often experiment with,</v>

680
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.970
<v Speaker 1>and this is purposeful experimentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

681
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Not accidental experimentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

682
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

683
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.900
<v Speaker 1>My recipes have been published in local </v>
<v Speaker 1>cookbook.</v>

684
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

685
00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:45.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

686
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the,</v>

687
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 1>you get the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

688
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.700
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see how this works?</v>

689
00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:49.271
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

690
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:50.104
<v Speaker 1>here are ways you can be creative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here are a strata of accomplishment </v>

691
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:53.890
<v Speaker 1>within those ways.</v>

692
00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is what does it</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like?</v>

693
00:30:56.170 --> 00:31:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

694
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:02.470
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

695
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

696
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.190
<v Speaker 1>and this probably needs to be updated to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect that.</v>

697
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

698
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:10.780
<v Speaker 1>there's the distribution of scores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's dismal.</v>

699
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a dismal thing to look out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that,</v>

700
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:17.530
<v Speaker 1>why look at this zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

701
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:18.723
<v Speaker 1>The median person has not done anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative ever in their life with </v>

702
00:31:21.821 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 1>anything on any dementia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

703
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:25.024
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have these horrible people </v>

704
00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:29.680
<v Speaker 1>out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

705
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.930
<v Speaker 1>They do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do everything.</v>

706
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Price's law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's price's law.</v>

707
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.160
<v Speaker 1>This is something to hammer into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>

708
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.000
<v Speaker 1>The square root of the number of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a domain do 50% of the work.</v>

709
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.861
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

710
00:31:41.861 --> 00:31:43.750
<v Speaker 1>let's go through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have 10 employees,</v>

711
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.210
<v Speaker 1>three of them do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the work makes sense.</v>

712
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.220
<v Speaker 1>That's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a hundred employees,</v>

713
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.500
<v Speaker 1>10 of them do half the work.</v>

714
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:51.963
<v Speaker 1>That's problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other 90% are doing the other </v>

715
00:31:54.251 --> 00:31:56.050
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who cares about them?</v>

716
00:31:56.051 --> 00:31:59.530
<v Speaker 1>You have 10,000 employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred of them do half the work,</v>

717
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.031
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a,</v>

718
00:32:01.031 --> 00:32:05.470
<v Speaker 1>here's a nasty little law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As your company grows in,</v>

719
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:09.490
<v Speaker 1>competence grows into exponentially and </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence grows linearly.</v>

720
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

721
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Because it with 10 it's three who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing half the work,</v>

722
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:16.150
<v Speaker 1>but at 10,000 it's a hundred that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing half the work.</v>

723
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:16.984
<v Speaker 1>So 9,900 of your employees are doing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as the best 100 you might not even </v>

724
00:32:21.911 --> 00:32:22.744
<v Speaker 1>know who the best 100 are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably they know and maybe their </v>

725
00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:25.984
<v Speaker 1>peers know too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's really </v>

726
00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:29.890
<v Speaker 1>interesting when big companies start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shake,</v>

727
00:32:29.891 --> 00:32:31.660
<v Speaker 1>which means maybe they've had a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter,</v>

728
00:32:31.661 --> 00:32:34.600
<v Speaker 1>two bad quarters and the stock price </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to tip down.</v>

729
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.190
<v Speaker 1>And the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart,</v>

730
00:32:36.191 --> 00:32:38.740
<v Speaker 1>people who have options are not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy about that.</v>

731
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.660
<v Speaker 1>And maybe they start to announce </v>
<v Speaker 1>layoffs.</v>

732
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.790
<v Speaker 1>The hundred people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities leave and they're the ones</v>

733
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:44.624
<v Speaker 1>who were doing half the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So boy that puts your company in a </v>

734
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:47.354
<v Speaker 1>pretty rough situation because now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the 19 900 people left over </v>

735
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 1>who were only doing half the work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next time you announce layoffs,</v>

736
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.793
<v Speaker 1>the next most productive hundred leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're left with nobody </v>

737
00:32:58.191 --> 00:33:03.050
<v Speaker 1>who's productive at a massive overhead </v>
<v Speaker 1>payroll price's law.</v>

738
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.180
<v Speaker 1>You can look that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Desal,</v>

739
00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.103
<v Speaker 1>a price to solar price is a guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at scientific productivity and </v>

740
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:09.344
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he found was when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was looking at Phd students is that the </v>

741
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:17.060
<v Speaker 1>median number of publications for a phd </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate when he did his work,</v>

742
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:20.450
<v Speaker 1>which was in the early sixties was one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

743
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:21.403
<v Speaker 1>half as many had two half as many as </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had three half as many as that had </v>

744
00:33:24.801 --> 00:33:25.370
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

745
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.203
<v Speaker 1>It's a real step down and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corollaries of that is that there's a </v>

746
00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:29.444
<v Speaker 1>certain number of people who are hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive and that's these people out </v>

747
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:32.804
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you were graphing the </v>

748
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:36.800
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you graft,</v>

749
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:41.420
<v Speaker 1>how many people in that population of </v>
<v Speaker 1>300 had $10,000 in a savings account?</v>

750
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.533
<v Speaker 1>It would look very much like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them would have are some of </v>

751
00:33:45.961 --> 00:33:46.820
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them would.</v>

752
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Most people would have like no savings </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

753
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.980
<v Speaker 1>The median person would have no savings </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

754
00:33:51.981 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 1>And then you go up here where the 1% is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all the money.</v>

755
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.090
<v Speaker 1>But the thing you want to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that 1% issue that you always hear</v>

756
00:33:59.091 --> 00:33:59.924
<v Speaker 1>about is that it applies in every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>realm where there's difference in </v>

757
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:05.570
<v Speaker 1>creative production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every realm,</v>

758
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number of records produced,</v>

759
00:34:07.911 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 1>number of records sold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of compositions written.</v>

760
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

761
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.013
<v Speaker 1>here's an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five composers produce the music that </v>

762
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:19.040
<v Speaker 1>occupies 50% of the classical rep </v>
<v Speaker 1>repertoire,</v>

763
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.001
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bach,</v>

764
00:34:20.001 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Beethoven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brahms,</v>

765
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Tchaikovsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mozart.</v>

766
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.860
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those five.</v>

767
00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's something cool.</v>

768
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.410
<v Speaker 1>So you take all the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people wrote 5% of the music.</v>

769
00:34:30.411 --> 00:34:31.244
<v Speaker 1>All those people wrote occupies 50% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the music that of their writing that's </v>

770
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:38.090
<v Speaker 1>played.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only do,</v>

771
00:34:38.091 --> 00:34:40.710
<v Speaker 1>almost all the composers never get </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alyson,</v>

772
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.040
<v Speaker 1>but even among the composers who do get </v>
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>

773
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.140
<v Speaker 1>almost none of their music ever gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>played.</v>

774
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:47.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then that's a,</v>

775
00:34:47.461 --> 00:34:49.850
<v Speaker 1>that's another example of this price's </v>
<v Speaker 1>law scaling.</v>

776
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.980
<v Speaker 1>So when it applies to all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

777
00:34:51.981 --> 00:34:55.040
<v Speaker 1>like number of hockey goal scored is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also distributed this way.</v>

778
00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Number of basketball basketball backs </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketballs successfully put through the</v>

779
00:35:00.411 --> 00:35:02.210
<v Speaker 1>hoop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follows the same distribution.</v>

780
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.413
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>size of cities follows the same </v>

781
00:35:04.401 --> 00:35:06.260
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird,</v>

782
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:07.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird law.</v>

783
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.530
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it in part a,</v>

784
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.790
<v Speaker 1>why does this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While imagine what happens when you play</v>

785
00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:16.160
<v Speaker 1>monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

786
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has the same amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with,</v>

787
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you start playing,</v>

788
00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:21.674
<v Speaker 1>it's basically a random game while some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people start to win a bit and some </v>

789
00:35:24.411 --> 00:35:26.360
<v Speaker 1>people start to lose a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you win,</v>

790
00:35:26.361 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 1>the high probability that you'll keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning starts to increase.</v>

791
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.870
<v Speaker 1>And if you lose your vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases as you lose.</v>

792
00:35:32.871 --> 00:35:35.330
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you've got say six people</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing monopoly,</v>

793
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.010
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One person has zero.</v>

794
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 1>What happens when they have zero?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out of the game.</v>

795
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.590
<v Speaker 1>So zero's a weird number because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit zero,</v>

796
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.780
<v Speaker 1>you're out of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

797
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.900
<v Speaker 1>so then if you keep playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people start to stack up at zero,</v>

798
00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens at the end of the game?</v>

799
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 1>One person has all the property and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money and everyone else has none,</v>

800
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:56.933
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens if you play an </v>

801
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 1>iterated trading game to its final </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion,</v>

802
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.033
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the law in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's underlying this kind of </v>

803
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

804
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

805
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.273
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a consequence necessarily of </v>

806
00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:10.704
<v Speaker 1>structural inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's built into the system at a deeper </v>

807
00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:15.240
<v Speaker 1>level than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we get know people talk about all the</v>

808
00:36:15.241 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 1>time about how unfair it is that the 1% </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the population has the vast amount of</v>

809
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:22.710
<v Speaker 1>the money and 1% of the 1% has most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that money.</v>

810
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 1>And 1% of the 1% of the 1% has most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that money.</v>

811
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.290
<v Speaker 1>But it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

812
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:32.280
<v Speaker 1>it's an inevitable conclusion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>iterated trading games and we don't know</v>

813
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:33.114
<v Speaker 1>how to fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to take from the </v>

814
00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:36.504
<v Speaker 1>people who have and move it to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom without an instantly moving back </v>

815
00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:40.224
<v Speaker 1>up to the top.</v>

816
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Different people maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still back up to the top.</v>

817
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause even the 1% churns a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think you have a 10% chance,</v>

818
00:36:48.631 --> 00:36:49.464
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a 10% chance of being in the </v>

819
00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:52.374
<v Speaker 1>top 1% for at least one year of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and a 40% chance of being in the </v>

820
00:36:57.061 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 1>top 10% for at least one year in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

821
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.950
<v Speaker 1>That's in Canada and the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's less so in Europe,</v>

822
00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.800
<v Speaker 1>so there's a fair bit of churning at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top end.</v>

823
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same people all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have the money,</v>

824
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.980
<v Speaker 1>but it is a tiny fraction of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time who have all the money.</v>

825
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people</v>

826
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:20.423
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people inside redistribute to </v>

827
00:37:22.301 --> 00:37:24.380
<v Speaker 2>recreate the scene?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

828
00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.890
<v Speaker 2>unusually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they do,</v>

829
00:37:26.891 --> 00:37:30.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's attenuated because the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

830
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.090
<v Speaker 1>few reshuffled the entire company and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put everywhere somewhere else.</v>

831
00:37:35.091 --> 00:37:35.924
<v Speaker 1>There's some probability that some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people would rise to the top that </v>

832
00:37:38.031 --> 00:37:40.520
<v Speaker 1>weren't at the top before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in that company,</v>

833
00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.180
<v Speaker 1>that isn't generally what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get stuck in their niche and they</v>

834
00:37:44.181 --> 00:37:46.880
<v Speaker 1>don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

835
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:48.740
<v Speaker 1>this is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wonder sometimes,</v>

836
00:37:48.741 --> 00:37:50.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can companies die so quickly?</v>

837
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:51.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

838
00:37:51.321 --> 00:37:52.154
<v Speaker 1>they go into a death spiral that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost impossible for them to get out </v>

839
00:37:54.291 --> 00:37:55.470
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

840
00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.500
<v Speaker 1>and it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can happen extraordinarily quickly.</v>

841
00:37:57.501 --> 00:37:58.510
<v Speaker 1>This is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

842
00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.310
<v Speaker 1>the typical fortune 500 company only </v>
<v Speaker 1>lasts 30 years.</v>

843
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.233
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy for these Bay Ammas </v>

844
00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.830
<v Speaker 1>to continue existence across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

845
00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.020
<v Speaker 1>and it's because it's really easy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to die.</v>

846
00:38:09.021 --> 00:38:11.150
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely that it will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>built.</v>

847
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.960
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely that it will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and one successful.</v>

848
00:38:14.961 --> 00:38:15.794
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely that it will continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>to duplicate it success because the </v>

849
00:38:18.231 --> 00:38:21.770
<v Speaker 1>underlying landscape shifts on it and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know where to go.</v>

850
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.083
<v Speaker 1>And that's also partly because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that easy to integrate creative people </v>

851
00:38:26.841 --> 00:38:28.130
<v Speaker 1>into your company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

852
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.203
<v Speaker 1>You certainly don't want them at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom because they're supposed to be </v>

853
00:38:30.891 --> 00:38:32.570
<v Speaker 1>people who are doing what they're told </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

854
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:33.703
<v Speaker 1>So you filter out a lot of them at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and then you need them at the </v>

855
00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they've already been filtered out.</v>

856
00:38:37.631 --> 00:38:41.530
<v Speaker 1>And also creative people are troublesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work with because they're always,</v>

857
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.830
<v Speaker 1>how do you evaluate a creative person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't,</v>

858
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.693
<v Speaker 1>you almost can't by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they keep coming up with new </v>

859
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:51.910
<v Speaker 1>things and you don't have a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluative strategy for a new thing.</v>

860
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.030
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be new if you had a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluative strategy for it,</v>

861
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:55.864
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be the member of a </v>

862
00:38:56.681 --> 00:38:58.900
<v Speaker 1>class that you've already encountered </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially.</v>

863
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.123
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the take home lesson from this is </v>

864
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:05.950
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

865
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's like,</v>

866
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:10.750
<v Speaker 1>that's like a graph of of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monetary distribution as well.</v>

867
00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:11.763
<v Speaker 1>And the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with being at zero is very </v>

868
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:13.894
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get out of zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also why people get stuck in </v>

869
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:17.410
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

870
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.350
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a bank account if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have any money,</v>

871
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.213
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of things that start to </v>

872
00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:26.380
<v Speaker 1>move against you when you're at zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't shake.</v>

873
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.453
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to get out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of the pit here because zero </v>

874
00:39:32.191 --> 00:39:33.070
<v Speaker 1>is a kind of pit.</v>

875
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.273
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we've got the creative </v>

876
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.693
<v Speaker 1>achievement questionnaire and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take your score and your score </v>

877
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:42.124
<v Speaker 1>has a summed across all the categories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the exemplars of the categories </v>

878
00:39:45.821 --> 00:39:47.950
<v Speaker 1>that you've chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>

879
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you predict creative achievement?</v>

880
00:39:50.351 --> 00:39:52.750
<v Speaker 1>And and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

881
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.300
<v Speaker 1>this is how we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was construct validation.</v>

882
00:39:55.301 --> 00:39:56.134
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we wanted to know was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it was the creative achievement </v>

883
00:39:58.211 --> 00:39:59.044
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire actually associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you might regard his </v>

884
00:40:01.121 --> 00:40:02.350
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

885
00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:04.080
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got uh,</v>

886
00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:05.190
<v Speaker 1>a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

887
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.113
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of students to come in and we gave them </v>

888
00:40:08.321 --> 00:40:09.154
<v Speaker 1>a collage kit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then everybody got exactly the </v>

889
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:14.800
<v Speaker 1>same Kipp and then we had to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collage out of the collage kit.</v>

890
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.190
<v Speaker 1>And then we have five artists rate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collage for quality.</v>

891
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.410
<v Speaker 1>And then we averaged across the ratings.</v>

892
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.243
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you would do if you did </v>

893
00:40:22.061 --> 00:40:23.620
<v Speaker 1>that is cause he would might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

894
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.573
<v Speaker 1>can artists actually come up with an a </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure of how creative a collages and </v>

895
00:40:29.981 --> 00:40:31.690
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>technical.</v>

896
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:33.303
<v Speaker 1>If all say you guys are the panel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all of you identified the same </v>

897
00:40:36.341 --> 00:40:39.970
<v Speaker 1>collages as of high quality and the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones as of low quality,</v>

898
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.013
<v Speaker 1>then we can assume that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about your judgment that's </v>

899
00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.420
<v Speaker 1>like independent of your idiosyncrasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could say,</v>

900
00:40:46.421 --> 00:40:50.320
<v Speaker 1>well there is a judgment that emerges as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consensus across artists.</v>

901
00:40:50.321 --> 00:40:52.530
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing we found was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

902
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.573
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was quite a high correlation </v>

903
00:40:54.431 --> 00:40:59.431
<v Speaker 1>between each artists judgement of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of the collages.</v>

904
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what the interrater </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliability was,</v>

905
00:41:01.691 --> 00:41:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but it was something like 0.8 it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really high.</v>

906
00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.283
<v Speaker 1>So it was clear that trained artists </v>
<v Speaker 1>could make reliable judgments about the </v>

907
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:09.214
<v Speaker 1>quality of collages because you had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>check that out first because if they're </v>

908
00:41:12.491 --> 00:41:13.960
<v Speaker 1>all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got no measure.</v>

909
00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:14.943
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone's using a different </v>

910
00:41:15.731 --> 00:41:16.564
<v Speaker 1>rulers got no measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have to be using the same </v>

911
00:41:18.731 --> 00:41:19.564
<v Speaker 1>router.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we found that the correlation </v>

912
00:41:21.041 --> 00:41:21.874
<v Speaker 1>between the creative evaluation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>collages and the total caq was 0.59 </v>

913
00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:27.094
<v Speaker 1>which is mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you last time that under 5% of </v>

914
00:41:31.151 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>published social studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social science studies have,</v>

915
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.410
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are uh,</v>

916
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.940
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate at a correlation coefficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an effect size greater than 0.5.</v>

917
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.570
<v Speaker 1>This is 0.6 and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you square it,</v>

918
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.433
<v Speaker 1>0.5 squared is 25% of the variance 0.6 </v>
<v Speaker 1>squared is 36% of the variance 0.6 is a </v>

919
00:41:49.731 --> 00:41:50.564
<v Speaker 1>lot more than 0.5 and 0.5 is unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that you could estimate </v>

920
00:41:55.581 --> 00:41:56.414
<v Speaker 1>someone's lifetime creative achievement </v>
<v Speaker 1>by having them do a collage that for </v>

921
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:01.170
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

922
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 1>rate was an indication that there really</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something real at the bottom of it,</v>

923
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:05.684
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's like the definition of </v>

924
00:42:06.381 --> 00:42:09.350
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creative personality scale.</v>

925
00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.353
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you circle adjectives that are </v>

926
00:42:11.871 --> 00:42:12.704
<v Speaker 1>associated with creativity from a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>large list of adjectives that work </v>

927
00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:17.420
<v Speaker 1>pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goldberg's adjective markers.</v>

928
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:20.930
<v Speaker 1>That's another big five variant that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlated at about 0.5.</v>

929
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 1>One it doesn't measure openness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

930
00:42:23.271 --> 00:42:25.770
<v Speaker 1>it just measures intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

931
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but be that as it mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still an personality marker of,</v>

932
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.400
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trade openness.</v>

933
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.323
<v Speaker 1>It was correlated at 0.5.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One the neo pir openness was correlated </v>

934
00:42:35.931 --> 00:42:36.764
<v Speaker 1>at 0.3,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three and then we use the divergent </v>

935
00:42:38.241 --> 00:42:40.670
<v Speaker 1>thinking tests and I told you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>those already's.</v>

936
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.640
<v Speaker 1>How many uses can you think of for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brick for example.</v>

937
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.220
<v Speaker 1>And so those are scored according to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluency,</v>

938
00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:48.770
<v Speaker 1>how many answers you provide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also originality,</v>

939
00:42:48.771 --> 00:42:51.290
<v Speaker 1>how many unique useful answers do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide.</v>

940
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:52.363
<v Speaker 1>And that was nicely correlated as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overall correlation of 0.47 and then </v>

941
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.880
<v Speaker 1>fluency 0.38,</v>
<v Speaker 1>originality 0.4,</v>

942
00:42:58.881 --> 00:43:01.100
<v Speaker 1>six and flexibility 0.37.</v>

943
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:03.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean?</v>

944
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:04.003
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creative achievement questionnaire </v>

945
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:06.853
<v Speaker 1>indexes lifetime creative achievement in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way that's powerfully associated with </v>

946
00:43:10.371 --> 00:43:11.204
<v Speaker 1>actual creative production of a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>item plus creative create creativity as </v>

947
00:43:15.441 --> 00:43:18.090
<v Speaker 1>it's indexed by personality markers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

948
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 1>the Caq is also potently predicted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq,</v>

949
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:24.980
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you'd expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can do at an extraordinarily good</v>

950
00:43:24.981 --> 00:43:25.814
<v Speaker 1>job of determining how likely someone is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have high levels of creative </v>

951
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:31.880
<v Speaker 1>achievement across their life span by </v>
<v Speaker 1>using psychometric tests.</v>

952
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.070
<v Speaker 1>So it means that creativity is a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

953
00:43:34.071 --> 00:43:37.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both in terms of thinking creatively and</v>

954
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.833
<v Speaker 1>that would be the divergent thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests and also in terms of creative </v>

955
00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:42.104
<v Speaker 1>production and the and that creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>production and creative thinking are </v>

956
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 1>quite tightly aligned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

957
00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 1>so that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been a very influential paper.</v>

958
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's got about 500 citations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

959
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:52.543
<v Speaker 1>People use the creative achievement </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire a lot to assess </v>

960
00:43:54.351 --> 00:43:55.184
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also associated with a higher than </v>

961
00:43:57.141 --> 00:43:57.974
<v Speaker 1>average likelihood of psychosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing you see with </v>

962
00:44:00.441 --> 00:44:02.720
<v Speaker 1>creative people is that they tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're writers,</v>

963
00:44:02.721 --> 00:44:03.554
<v Speaker 1>they tend the pathology that goes along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that is often manic depressive </v>

964
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:07.964
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because manic people </v>

965
00:44:09.411 --> 00:44:11.540
<v Speaker 1>become unbelievably fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

966
00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:13.610
<v Speaker 1>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they speak incredibly quickly.</v>

967
00:44:13.611 --> 00:44:14.444
<v Speaker 1>They generate ideas like mad and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper arousal of the positive emotions </v>

968
00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:19.940
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

969
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.280
<v Speaker 1>And that can have as a side effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

970
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:27.350
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a cool study.</v>

971
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I just found this one today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terror management study,</v>

972
00:44:31.591 --> 00:44:32.880
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

973
00:44:32.881 --> 00:44:33.714
<v Speaker 1>I'll read it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between creativity and </v>

974
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:38.460
<v Speaker 1>symbolic immortality had been long </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged by scholars.</v>

975
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.983
<v Speaker 1>In your review of the literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found 12 papers that empirically </v>

976
00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:46.500
<v Speaker 1>examined the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity and mortality awareness using</v>

977
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:47.334
<v Speaker 1>it terror management theory paradigm </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall supporting the notion that </v>

978
00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:54.000
<v Speaker 1>creativity plays an important role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the management of existential concerns.</v>

979
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.433
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mini metro analysis of the impact of </v>

980
00:44:57.301 --> 00:44:59.670
<v Speaker 1>death awareness on creativity resulted </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a small,</v>

981
00:44:59.671 --> 00:45:00.504
<v Speaker 1>medium weighted mean effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We examine the existential buffering </v>

982
00:45:03.241 --> 00:45:04.074
<v Speaker 1>functions of creative achievement as </v>
<v Speaker 1>assessed by the creative achievement </v>

983
00:45:06.721 --> 00:45:11.520
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire in a sample of 108 </v>
<v Speaker 1>students at a high but not low levels of</v>

984
00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:14.730
<v Speaker 1>creative goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creative achievement was associated with</v>

985
00:45:14.731 --> 00:45:18.780
<v Speaker 1>lower death thought accessibility under </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality salients.</v>

986
00:45:18.781 --> 00:45:19.614
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means if you remind people that </v>

987
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:21.804
<v Speaker 1>they're going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creative people were less likely to </v>

988
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:27.840
<v Speaker 1>generate death related thoughts as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence to our knowledge,</v>

989
00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:28.674
<v Speaker 1>this is the first empirical report of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the anxiety buffering functions of a </v>

990
00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:32.364
<v Speaker 1>creative achievement among people for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whom creativity constitutes a central </v>

991
00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:35.724
<v Speaker 1>part of their cultural worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a empirical examination of </v>

992
00:45:38.821 --> 00:45:42.150
<v Speaker 1>some of the existential theories that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was presenting to previously.</v>

993
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.043
<v Speaker 1>Because part of the idea that was put </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth to say by people like nature was </v>

994
00:45:46.081 --> 00:45:46.914
<v Speaker 1>that one of the ways to fight back </v>
<v Speaker 1>against existential anxiety and death </v>

995
00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:53.370
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and all of that is to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative production.</v>

996
00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And so that was actually put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>empirical test in this study.</v>

997
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:01.460
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that was quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's another paper.</v>

998
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:10.410
<v Speaker 1>This was by Kauffman and a couple of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

999
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Jacob Hersch and Colin Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on that paper as well,</v>

1000
00:46:13.201 --> 00:46:14.760
<v Speaker 1>near the end there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1001
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:15.743
<v Speaker 1>they were interested in whether openness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and intellect predicted different </v>

1002
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:23.040
<v Speaker 1>elements of creative achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of goes back to your question about</v>

1003
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:23.933
<v Speaker 1>the differentiation between the artsy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of creativity and maybe the more </v>

1004
00:46:26.401 --> 00:46:28.350
<v Speaker 1>practical it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1005
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:29.243
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1006
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.370
<v Speaker 1>the practical land associated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1007
00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:34.140
<v Speaker 1>with a proclivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like nonfiction,</v>

1008
00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.300
<v Speaker 1>the big five personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>

1009
00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.280
<v Speaker 1>openness slash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect</v>

1010
00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.693
<v Speaker 1>is the trait most closely associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with creativity and creative </v>

1011
00:46:43.101 --> 00:46:44.620
<v Speaker 1>achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little is known.</v>

1012
00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.493
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regarding the discriminant validity of </v>

1013
00:46:47.181 --> 00:46:48.014
<v Speaker 1>it's two aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discriminant validity is whether one </v>

1014
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:52.303
<v Speaker 1>aspect predicts one set of things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other aspect predicts a different </v>

1015
00:46:54.801 --> 00:46:57.260
<v Speaker 1>set of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's no discriminant validity,</v>

1016
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.450
<v Speaker 1>if they can't be used for different </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>

1017
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.930
<v Speaker 1>then there's no point having them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to see that they're actually</v>

1018
00:47:02.931 --> 00:47:07.010
<v Speaker 1>capable of differentiating between </v>
<v Speaker 1>between real world phenomena,</v>

1019
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.180
<v Speaker 1>two of its aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness to experience.</v>

1020
00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1021
00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Reflecting cognitive engagement with </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>

1022
00:47:15.701 --> 00:47:19.300
<v Speaker 1>fantasy aesthetics and emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect,</v>

1023
00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.313
<v Speaker 1>reflecting cognitive engagement with </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract and semantic information </v>

1024
00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:26.980
<v Speaker 1>primarily through reasoning in relation </v>
<v Speaker 1>to creativity.</v>

1025
00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:31.090
<v Speaker 1>In four demographically diverse totaling</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a thousand participants,</v>

1026
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:32.283
<v Speaker 1>we investigated the independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictive validity of openness and </v>

1027
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:37.510
<v Speaker 1>intellect by assessing the relations </v>
<v Speaker 1>among cognitive ability,</v>

1028
00:47:37.511 --> 00:47:38.344
<v Speaker 1>divergent thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and creative achievement </v>

1029
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.013
<v Speaker 1>across the arts and sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We confirmed that hypothesis that </v>

1030
00:47:45.111 --> 00:47:47.390
<v Speaker 1>openness predicts creative achievement </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the arts</v>

1031
00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:52.950
<v Speaker 1>and intellect predicts creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement in the sciences,</v>

1032
00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.070
<v Speaker 1>inclusion of performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measures of general cognitive ability.</v>

1033
00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:57.083
<v Speaker 1>That's Iq and divergent thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicated that the relationship of </v>

1034
00:48:00.901 --> 00:48:03.090
<v Speaker 1>intellect to scientific creativity may </v>
<v Speaker 1>be due,</v>

1035
00:48:03.091 --> 00:48:05.580
<v Speaker 1>at least in part to these abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lastly,</v>

1036
00:48:05.581 --> 00:48:06.414
<v Speaker 1>we found that extroversion additionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted creative achievement in the </v>

1037
00:48:08.791 --> 00:48:09.624
<v Speaker 1>arts independently of openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that creative </v>

1038
00:48:13.411 --> 00:48:14.244
<v Speaker 1>achievement in the arts is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>function of the higher order trait </v>

1039
00:48:17.521 --> 00:48:18.900
<v Speaker 1>plasticity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1040
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Cause plasticity was openness plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

1041
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:22.703
<v Speaker 1>and that's associated fundamentally with</v>
<v Speaker 1>activation of the underlying </v>

1042
00:48:25.441 --> 00:48:26.274
<v Speaker 1>dopaminergic system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the system that mediates </v>

1043
00:48:27.841 --> 00:48:31.410
<v Speaker 1>exploratory behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're dominated by that,</v>

1044
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.990
<v Speaker 1>the function of that system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an exploratory,</v>

1045
00:48:33.991 --> 00:48:34.824
<v Speaker 1>gregarious person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're more likely to manifest </v>

1046
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.020
<v Speaker 1>creative ability in the arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1047
00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.673
<v Speaker 3>apparently</v>

1048
00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:44.573
<v Speaker 1>it's time to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the same student who </v>

1049
00:48:47.101 --> 00:48:48.210
<v Speaker 1>always does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1050
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:51.360
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see you on Tuesday.</v>
