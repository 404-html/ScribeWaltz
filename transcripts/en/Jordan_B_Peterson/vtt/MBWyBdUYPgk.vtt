1
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.770
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to discuss some very </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough things today.</v>

2
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're somewhat accustomed to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

3
00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:22.130
<v Speaker 1>but this is particularly brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell it,</v>

5
00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:27.710
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about a body of research </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been produced over about the last</v>

6
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:31.550
<v Speaker 1>10 years and I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perhaps it's,</v>

7
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.983
<v Speaker 1>it's a body of research that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>outline some of the most important </v>

8
00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 1>things that psychologists have ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered.</v>

9
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It's really changed my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

10
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:40.664
<v Speaker 1>on what happened in Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're going to talk about a lot </v>

11
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

12
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:46.604
<v Speaker 1>we've already talked a fair bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the temperamental determinance of </v>

13
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>political belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

14
00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:50.954
<v Speaker 1>And I've made a case for you that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are liberal or leaning to the left </v>

15
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.803
<v Speaker 1>tend to be high in trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness and low in trait </v>

16
00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially orderliness and people on the</v>

17
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>right tend to be low in openness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>high in conscientiousness,</v>

18
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>especially orderliness and the effect is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not trivial.</v>

19
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.053
<v Speaker 1>If you look at just voting behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get the typical sort of effect </v>

20
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:14.570
<v Speaker 1>sizes that are characteristic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality research.</v>

21
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:15.351
<v Speaker 1>Point two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

22
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>point four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

23
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:17.474
<v Speaker 1>correlations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you start to analyze people's </v>

24
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>political beliefs in detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so so you get your measurement up to the</v>

25
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>point where it's nice and reliable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid,</v>

26
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 1>then temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a accounts for substantial,</v>

27
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>a substantially higher proportion of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>variance.</v>

28
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:31.334
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of what people seem to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is one thing you could think of is that </v>

29
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

30
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.933
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they politicize their temperament by </v>

31
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>constructing post-hoc arguments about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the world is.</v>

32
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:48.410
<v Speaker 1>But it's deeper than that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we already know that you have to</v>

33
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>use filtering mechanisms in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orient Yourself in the world,</v>

34
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:52.484
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the world is just too </v>

35
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>complicated for you to Orient Yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>without using filtering mechanisms.</v>

36
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.220
<v Speaker 1>what are the filtering mechanisms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to large degree,</v>

38
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.063
<v Speaker 1>they're temperamental proclivities </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they set up your value </v>

39
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

40
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:06.584
<v Speaker 1>And that sets up your perceptual frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that you </v>

41
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>screen the world at the level of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts that display themselves to you.</v>

42
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

43
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:16.154
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a dispassionate observer of the </v>

44
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:19.184
<v Speaker 1>universe of facts and that you extract </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the conclusions that are reasonable </v>

45
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>person would extract out from that body </v>
<v Speaker 1>of facts,</v>

46
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:26.384
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately that's not the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your perceptions are biased by </v>

47
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 1>your temperament and they have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

48
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to screen things and so</v>

49
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 1>you screened things in accordance with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your temperament,</v>

50
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're oriented toward certain things in</v>

51
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain values for example,</v>

52
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.143
<v Speaker 1>and that's a perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's perfectly reasonable because you </v>

53
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:44.444
<v Speaker 1>can't do everything at once anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no reason for you not to be </v>

54
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:49.454
<v Speaker 1>directional.</v>

55
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.630
<v Speaker 1>The question is what are the pathologies</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with directionality?</v>

56
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Now conscientiousness is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

57
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.463
<v Speaker 1>I'm a trait relationship to that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are obvious benefits to being </v>

58
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the best long term predictor</v>
<v Speaker 1>of job performance for example,</v>

60
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.513
<v Speaker 1>and all outlined some other data that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be more associated with </v>

61
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>industriousness than orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's utility orderliness as well,</v>

62
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>and we'll cover that in detail today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

63
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.553
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue is that you never get a </v>

64
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>benefit without a price and so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that with agreeableness.</v>

65
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.604
<v Speaker 1>If you're agreeable high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness than you're compassionate </v>

66
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>and polite and you're empathic and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can work well in teams,</v>

67
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.244
<v Speaker 1>but the price you pay for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't negotiate very well on your </v>

68
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>own behalf and that you can be easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken advantage of,</v>

69
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>and then if you're very low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

70
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:44.641
<v Speaker 1>well then you're more competitive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more out to win,</v>

71
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:45.664
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the price you pay for that is that </v>

72
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:47.494
<v Speaker 1>if you become too disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're likely to be sufficiently </v>

73
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>antisocial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

74
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>so that you might end up in prison so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a cost without a benefit.</v>

75
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't get a benefit without a cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the question might be,</v>

76
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with conscientiousness?</v>

77
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:04.054
<v Speaker 1>Because it seems all things considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would be a good thing to be </v>

78
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:07.234
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can think of some exceptions to </v>

79
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So conscientious people are dutiful,</v>

80
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>industrious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly,</v>

81
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.393
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they tend to sacrifice the present </v>

82
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:21.360
<v Speaker 1>for the future and that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

83
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>you save up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you save up wealth,</v>

84
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>you save up labor and effort for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

85
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't live for today,</v>

86
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>don't be impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work hard and all that.</v>

87
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>That will accrue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use success over the long run.</v>

88
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.873
<v Speaker 1>The downside of that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the long run has to be stable in order </v>

89
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:41.614
<v Speaker 1>for that to be a reasonable strategy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so conscientiousness is not a good </v>

90
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.113
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least under some conditions in </v>

91
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>situations that are radically unstable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in situations that are radically</v>

92
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:52.834
<v Speaker 1>unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well get what you can now </v>

93
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>or that's one way of looking at it.</v>

94
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.913
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing about being </v>

95
00:04:57.671 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you store up wealth,</v>

96
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.633
<v Speaker 1>say as a consequence of hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that can make you targets for </v>

97
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 1>people who would like to come and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>your wealth.</v>

98
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:05.674
<v Speaker 1>And so it's also one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to many people in the 20th </v>

99
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most recently in in Venezuela,</v>

100
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 1>is that let's say you're conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you save money.</v>

101
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens in that period of </v>

102
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>hyperinflation while your money is wiped</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

103
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened to Germany,</v>

104
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.660
<v Speaker 1>say the 19 twenties and you got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what hyperinflation does to a</v>

105
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.503
<v Speaker 1>society because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what hyperinflation does is destroy the </v>

106
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:29.944
<v Speaker 1>people who worked hardest to construct </v>
<v Speaker 1>the society because they're the people </v>

107
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 1>who've been prudent and careful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed and so forth.</v>

108
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>And then when a period of high inflation</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes along,</v>

109
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything they have disappears.</v>

110
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Not happened in Germany during the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties.</v>

111
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Now there was a bunch of reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

112
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 1>But so Germany was very unstable in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 twenties,</v>

113
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the war had just ended.</v>

114
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>They had been subjected to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Versailles Treaty,</v>

115
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>which was a very punitive treaty aimed </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Germany.</v>

116
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the allies had lacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons to impose a punitive treaty,</v>

117
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:05.740
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany lost a lot of territory,</v>

118
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>including their industrial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including their industrial areas.</v>

119
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.653
<v Speaker 1>Germany was flooded by men who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutalized in the trenches in world war </v>

120
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.733
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could hardly imagine how terrible </v>

121
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:22.361
<v Speaker 1>trench warfare is and you can't imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you'd be like after a month of that</v>

122
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>day of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone a couple of years of that,</v>

123
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.753
<v Speaker 1>and then Germany under a period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperinflation at the same time in the </v>

124
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.703
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the Communist Revolution had had </v>

125
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Speaker 1>been successful and so there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous political upheaval in Germany</v>

126
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>during the 19 twenties as well.</v>

127
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to just set the stage for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

128
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>but the hyperinflation wiped out older </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were</v>

129
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.083
<v Speaker 1>prudent and saved and left them with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible sense that the entire system </v>

130
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:50.624
<v Speaker 1>had betrayed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course exactly what had </v>

131
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

132
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

133
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.173
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is a bit of a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know we've looked at plasticity right </v>

134
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a combination of extraversion and</v>

135
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:03.974
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to walk you through again </v>

136
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 1>where conscientiousness is located in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big five space.</v>

137
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:08.054
<v Speaker 1>So plasticity is a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraversion and openness and then </v>

138
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 1>stability is a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

139
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:14.144
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability and agreeableness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and conscientiousness is made out of </v>

140
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 1>industriousness and orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's,</v>

141
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>here's some markers for for </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

142
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:23.414
<v Speaker 1>So here's what you're like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're ordering or if you're </v>

143
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 1>industrious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you carry out your plans,</v>

144
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.063
<v Speaker 1>you don't waste time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't find it difficult to get down </v>

145
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>

146
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't mess things up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you finish what you start,</v>

147
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>you put your mind on the task at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get things done quickly,</v>

148
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.623
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't postpone decisions and you're </v>

149
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:41.234
<v Speaker 1>not easily distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what an industrious person is </v>

150
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know anything about industrious</v>

151
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:46.124
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cannot figure out why they're </v>

152
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:47.924
<v Speaker 1>industrious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read the neuropsychological </v>

153
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.683
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might assume that people who have </v>

154
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.023
<v Speaker 1>highly functioning prefrontal cortex is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be more conscientious because </v>

155
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:57.014
<v Speaker 1>people associate the prefrontal cortex </v>
<v Speaker 1>with such things as the capacity to </v>

156
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:03.310
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is that we've,</v>

157
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:04.144
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested now thousands of people using </v>

158
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:07.214
<v Speaker 1>tests of dorsolateral prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability which are basically </v>

159
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 1>cognitive tests and as you know from </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in this class,</v>

160
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.313
<v Speaker 1>if you take a battery of cognitive tests</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you subject them to a factor </v>

161
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:18.404
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can extract out a first factor and </v>

162
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:20.594
<v Speaker 1>that's fluid intelligence and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between fluid intelligence </v>

163
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 1>and conscientiousness is zero.</v>

164
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.473
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

165
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>

166
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>very strange because you would tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that people who were smarter might</v>

167
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 1>be better at planning and maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

168
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:34.244
<v Speaker 1>but they're not necessarily better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementing and that we don't </v>

169
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>understand the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>planning and implementation.</v>

170
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.663
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think about it this way </v>

171
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:45.584
<v Speaker 1>too though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because you're better at planning </v>

172
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.793
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't necessarily imply that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at implementing because actually </v>

173
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:56.171
<v Speaker 1>one of the prerequisites for thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractly is that can detach your plans</v>

174
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>from your action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

175
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise you just automatically</v>
<v Speaker 1>act out everything you planned,</v>

176
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>but that is what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They separate out their thinking so that</v>

177
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>they can work in an abstract space </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's divorced from their action and so</v>

178
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>they can lay out multiple plans without </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily acting them out,</v>

179
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.313
<v Speaker 1>but then that introduces the additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>complication of having to implement and </v>

180
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>industrious people seem to be good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementation,</v>

181
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know why.</v>

182
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.463
<v Speaker 1>We've done all sorts of laboratory </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies trying to see if we could get </v>

183
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.633
<v Speaker 1>some sort of laboratory task that </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrious people would do better in </v>

184
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The non industrious people,</v>

185
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd think that would be a snap snap.</v>

186
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.413
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We probably tested 50 things and have </v>

187
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:37.914
<v Speaker 1>never got anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Differences in language use is as close </v>

188
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:41.544
<v Speaker 1>as we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can extract out estimates of </v>

189
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:44.784
<v Speaker 1>people's conscientiousness or they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrious does from the way they use </v>

190
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:48.204
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a lot different than </v>

191
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 1>using self report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personality scales.</v>

192
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It's different but it's not a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

193
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.540
<v Speaker 1>So we've done things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

194
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 1>like imagine we present people with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>row of h's n's,</v>

195
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.390
<v Speaker 1>m's and use row after row of letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small type.</v>

196
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>You say go through and circle all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

197
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.763
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you would think that that </v>

198
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:11.760
<v Speaker 1>would be a task that would require </v>
<v Speaker 1>diligence and industriousness.</v>

199
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 1>You could time how long it took people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

200
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.910
<v Speaker 1>You could see how accurate they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correlation with conscientiousness,</v>

201
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

202
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 1>It's an ICU task as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the best we've been able to do so</v>

203
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:27.720
<v Speaker 1>far maybe with industriousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is so vague,</v>

204
00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:28.554
<v Speaker 1>it's embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we think that may be </v>

205
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>industrious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People find inactivity aversive,</v>

206
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.430
<v Speaker 1>so it did because they're not motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by enthusiasm,</v>

207
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:39.264
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the task that would be an extrovert </v>

208
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:43.290
<v Speaker 1>and they're not motivated by intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in the task.</v>

209
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.483
<v Speaker 1>That would be someone who is open and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not motivated by the desire to </v>

210
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:51.510
<v Speaker 1>decrease anxiety or emotional pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that would be someone who's high</v>

211
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:52.580
<v Speaker 1>in neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

212
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.423
<v Speaker 1>and they're not motivated by the desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>to foster affiliative relationships or </v>

213
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.480
<v Speaker 1>to compete because that looks like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>loads on it,</v>

214
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.800
<v Speaker 1>on agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something else.</v>

215
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.130
<v Speaker 1>It does a good job of predicting </v>
<v Speaker 1>military prowess.</v>

216
00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:05.964
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tested a number of people who worked </v>

217
00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:10.290
<v Speaker 1>in the US military in a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different places.</v>

218
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness was a deadly predictor</v>
<v Speaker 1>of of,</v>

219
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.213
<v Speaker 1>of ranking in military performance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools like the US Naval Academy for </v>

220
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:21.180
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also on on military basis themselves</v>

221
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.253
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the military is a conservative </v>

222
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:25.254
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd expect people who are </v>

223
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:28.800
<v Speaker 1>conscientious and dutiful to do better </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a place like that,</v>

224
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but so they're good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're good at implementation,</v>

225
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:34.350
<v Speaker 1>they're good at following orders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good at doing their duty.</v>

226
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Now we're starting to understand a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit about the value concerns that</v>

227
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.913
<v Speaker 1>conscientious people would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so let's go through orderliness so </v>

228
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:46.650
<v Speaker 1>you can decide whether you're orderly or</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorderly.</v>

229
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Leave your belongings around that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorderly.</v>

230
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if you do that like order </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

231
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:52.370
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

232
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>that's a no brainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep things tidy.</v>

233
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Follow a schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bothered,</v>

234
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 1>is bothered by messy people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants everything to be just right,</v>

235
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 1>is bothered by disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>likes routine,</v>

236
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.210
<v Speaker 1>sees that rules are observed and wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>every detail taken care of.</v>

237
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine all sorts of occupations</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that would be useful.</v>

238
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Accounting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

239
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.160
<v Speaker 1>or there are people who go around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>check,</v>

240
00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural gas fittings and that sort of </v>

241
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:16.804
<v Speaker 1>thing by a checklist and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want someone like that every in any </v>

242
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 1>position where careful attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail is absolutely vital.</v>

243
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said before,</v>

244
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the potential downside?</v>

245
00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 1>So with industriousness we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>

246
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

247
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broadly speaking,</v>

248
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.813
<v Speaker 1>there's no theoretical bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has any idea why people are </v>

249
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 1>conscientious except for the few things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've told you,</v>

250
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.173
<v Speaker 1>there's no neuropsychological model </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the prediction would be </v>

251
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:49.354
<v Speaker 1>something like people who are higher in </v>
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal cortical ability because </v>

252
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:54.880
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with planning would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>more conscientious.</v>

253
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.940
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no psychological model.</v>

254
00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.053
<v Speaker 1>That's partly because conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a trait was extracted out of the </v>

255
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 1>linguistic pools that we described by </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor analytic processes.</v>

256
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Nobody predicted that that would emerge </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a fundamental trait.</v>

257
00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 1>It just came out of this statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was no.</v>

258
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.860
<v Speaker 1>There's no model surrounding it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no pharmacological model.</v>

259
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:18.694
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to make people more </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious with the possible </v>

260
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 1>exception of drugs like Ritalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines,</v>

261
00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:24.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that seemed to be able to make </v>

262
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:26.674
<v Speaker 1>people focus in more and so maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an association to some degree </v>

263
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.230
<v Speaker 1>between conscientiousness and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to pay attention,</v>

264
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 1>but when we've used attentional tasks in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lab,</v>

265
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.453
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they load on fluid intelligence and </v>

266
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 1>second they don't correlate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

267
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 1>There was another dead end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

268
00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:43.444
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real mystery to me because we </v>

269
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 1>don't have that many good predictors of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life outcome Iq.</v>

270
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness.</v>

271
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:53.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

272
00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 1>what's conscientiousness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

273
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know anything about it.</v>

274
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.253
<v Speaker 1>W W with the exception of the things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>told you and I'm going to describe some </v>

275
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:02.890
<v Speaker 1>of the other things that we found out </v>
<v Speaker 1>more recently.</v>

276
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.533
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

277
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.733
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what else is useful about </v>

278
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:10.810
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

279
00:14:10.811 --> 00:14:13.960
<v Speaker 1>it's strongly related to life </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction and happiness.</v>

280
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the big five,</v>

281
00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.400
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the traits that are most </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlated within the big five,</v>

282
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.830
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and neuroticism are </v>
<v Speaker 1>negatively correlated.</v>

283
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Make sure I got that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more conscientious you are,</v>

284
00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:27.184
<v Speaker 1>the less likely you are to suffer from </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and emotional pain and I think </v>

285
00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:32.980
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know,</v>

286
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.920
<v Speaker 1>but I think the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>by being conscientious,</v>

287
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>you stabilize your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

288
00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Because everything becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable,</v>

289
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:41.740
<v Speaker 1>more scheduled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more routine.</v>

290
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.813
<v Speaker 1>You're more likely to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if things aren't going wrong around </v>

291
00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be less anxious and</v>

292
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:48.274
<v Speaker 1>less emotional pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that there's a direct </v>

293
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.740
<v Speaker 1>relationship between being more </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious and less neurotic,</v>

294
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:55.783
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's one that's mediated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the environment and this is very </v>

295
00:14:58.551 --> 00:14:59.384
<v Speaker 1>interesting you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll hear all sorts of social </v>

296
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:06.110
<v Speaker 1>psychologists tell you and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are more likely to be high</v>

297
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>in negative emotion.</v>

298
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 1>They're more threat sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the liberals,</v>

299
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 1>but the weird thing about that is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the conservatives are not higher in</v>

300
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:14.270
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The liberals actually,</v>

301
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 1>the contrary happens to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The liberals have slightly more neurotic</v>

302
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:18.104
<v Speaker 1>than the Conservatives and so of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are threat sensitive </v>

303
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:21.770
<v Speaker 1>because that's supposed to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

304
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:22.903
<v Speaker 1>Then why the hell don't they show up as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being higher in trait neuroticism and </v>

305
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:26.091
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

306
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:26.924
<v Speaker 1>they're so effective at their </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism that they've reduced their </v>

307
00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:30.284
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism by organizing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and to some degree that's </v>

308
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Jesus,</v>

309
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 1>if your theory predicts one thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite happens to be true,</v>

310
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 1>you can't just post hoc say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

311
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:42.740
<v Speaker 1>there's some other reasons we didn't pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>any attention to to account for that,</v>

312
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:43.933
<v Speaker 1>like it's really bothered me because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does seem to be the case that the </v>

313
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:48.494
<v Speaker 1>political landscape is shaped to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree by some sort of negative emotion </v>

314
00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:52.874
<v Speaker 1>that's broadcast at the people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the political </v>

315
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:55.754
<v Speaker 1>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the evidence that it's anxiety </v>

316
00:15:57.621 --> 00:15:59.540
<v Speaker 1>related seems to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very thin.</v>

317
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

318
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:01.694
<v Speaker 1>what else might there be so well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness is related to </v>

319
00:16:05.661 --> 00:16:06.494
<v Speaker 1>depression and guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a researcher named Faye Art who </v>

320
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.113
<v Speaker 1>looked to show use a med analysis to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that conscientiousness was </v>

321
00:16:13.701 --> 00:16:16.670
<v Speaker 1>associated with specific emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall negative emotion,</v>

322
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.950
<v Speaker 1>but was most strongly associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt.</v>

323
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.283
<v Speaker 1>It was most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was negatively related to guilt </v>

324
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:22.364
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but positively related to guilt </v>

325
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:24.703
<v Speaker 1>proneness and so maybe guilt is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion that you feel when you don't do </v>

326
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:28.940
<v Speaker 1>your duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that,</v>

327
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly why we were thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

328
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.753
<v Speaker 1>It's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly why we were thinking </v>

329
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:39.911
<v Speaker 1>that conscientiousness is motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>our inability to tolerate inactivity,</v>

330
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:43.303
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a finding that's along the same </v>

331
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:48.380
<v Speaker 1>sort of theoretical lays out the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of theoretical territory,</v>

332
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.543
<v Speaker 1>so you must know people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the maybe the person is your </v>

333
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:53.270
<v Speaker 1>mother or perhaps it's your father.</v>

334
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.313
<v Speaker 1>They come over to your place or you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there and they're just working all </v>

335
00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:57.740
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't sit down and relax.</v>

336
00:16:57.741 --> 00:17:00.070
<v Speaker 1>They just work all the time and they say</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

337
00:17:00.071 --> 00:17:02.750
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell you if you ask them all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand sitting around.</v>

338
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.673
<v Speaker 1>I have to be doing something and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine to how that might have been </v>

339
00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:09.920
<v Speaker 1>selected for across the evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>time span.</v>

340
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're living in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where resources are somewhat limited,</v>

341
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.720
<v Speaker 1>like we pretty much all do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want.</v>

342
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 1>You're going to demand of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you that they at least pull their</v>

343
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>fair share of the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

344
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.643
<v Speaker 1>and so you could imagine that the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were likely to feel a negative </v>

345
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:33.170
<v Speaker 1>emotion of some sort for not chipping in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing their share or more than their</v>

346
00:17:33.171 --> 00:17:34.004
<v Speaker 1>share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be a neat way of indicating </v>

347
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:36.440
<v Speaker 1>their value to the community.</v>

348
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.543
<v Speaker 1>We're more likely to be well less likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be less likely to be selected as </v>

349
00:17:41.571 --> 00:17:45.920
<v Speaker 1>mates and also perhaps more likely to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>severely punished from time to time.</v>

350
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

351
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:50.370
<v Speaker 1>how do people get away with not </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious then?</v>

352
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that would be there are </v>

353
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:53.934
<v Speaker 1>other things that you can offer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community that are a value that aren't </v>

354
00:17:57.781 --> 00:18:01.380
<v Speaker 1>associated with to fullness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think comedians are a good example</v>

355
00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:02.214
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that comedians are </v>

356
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:06.570
<v Speaker 1>particularly conscientious because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the kind of lifestyle you would pick</v>

357
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 1>if you were a conscientious person or </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who grow out on the road and play</v>

358
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:11.490
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

359
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:12.503
<v Speaker 1>Because that's such an erratic lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so unlikely to be stable across any </v>

360
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:17.214
<v Speaker 1>reasonable amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you could be valuable to the </v>

361
00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 1>community by being a music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An extrovert would do that or or by,</v>

362
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.780
<v Speaker 1>by helping ensure success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>security and safety,</v>

363
00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:28.614
<v Speaker 1>and maybe someone high in neuroticism </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do that or maybe you would be </v>

364
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 1>useful because you're really good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing affiliative relationships.</v>

365
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.590
<v Speaker 1>That would be someone who is agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're creative,</v>

366
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.430
<v Speaker 1>but the conscientious person </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrates their value by working hard</v>

367
00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:42.264
<v Speaker 1>and being beautiful and contributing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the broader community and and following </v>

368
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.570
<v Speaker 1>rules and all that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there may be other things they do as</v>

369
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:49.404
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now here's the downside to being </v>

370
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:56.670
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're working in a big company,</v>

371
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:57.504
<v Speaker 1>say and there's mass layoffs and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to be effected independently of </v>

372
00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:01.044
<v Speaker 1>your work history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll become </v>

373
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:03.624
<v Speaker 1>depressed is quite a lot higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're conscientious and some of you </v>

374
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.740
<v Speaker 1>may be conscientious people and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you fail at something or even if</v>

375
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you think you might be failing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

376
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you're going to tear yourself apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find it,</v>

377
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:17.670
<v Speaker 1>you're going to blame yourself for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because conscientious people,</v>

378
00:19:17.671 --> 00:19:20.550
<v Speaker 1>especially orderly people are also </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgmental,</v>

379
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

380
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.313
<v Speaker 1>And so which is something the liberals </v>
<v Speaker 1>always accused the conservatives of </v>

381
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:25.764
<v Speaker 1>doing is being judgmental and laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>down their value structure on </v>

382
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're conscientious,</v>

383
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:30.984
<v Speaker 1>you're going to tend to assume that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>things aren't going well for you that </v>

384
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:34.734
<v Speaker 1>it's your fault and that's you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why that might be a useful </v>

385
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:38.964
<v Speaker 1>supposition when it is the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something you could have done </v>

386
00:19:42.091 --> 00:19:46.320
<v Speaker 1>that would have stabilized you were or </v>
<v Speaker 1>improved your chances,</v>

387
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.350
<v Speaker 1>and you can often think of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's trivial,</v>

388
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:54.351
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so good when you happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be caught up in waves of mass movement,</v>

389
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.760
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're laid off by a big company,</v>

390
00:19:56.761 --> 00:19:57.594
<v Speaker 1>that where the relationship between that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and your own work ethic is </v>

391
00:20:01.231 --> 00:20:02.550
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tenuous.</v>

392
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll still pull yourself apart.</v>

393
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.383
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

394
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.583
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take a look at orderliness </v>

395
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.953
<v Speaker 1>because we don't have much to say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness because we don't know </v>

396
00:20:15.031 --> 00:20:15.864
<v Speaker 1>anything about industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're starting to understand a lot </v>

397
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 1>about orderliness and it's extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

398
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>So we we'd only managed to parse out </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness,</v>

399
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.473
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only managed to parse out </v>

400
00:20:26.521 --> 00:20:27.354
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness into orderliness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness over about the last 10 </v>

401
00:20:30.841 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

402
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.830
<v Speaker 1>people have had placed orderliness under</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness before that,</v>

403
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:35.664
<v Speaker 1>but psychometrically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become with the big five aspect </v>

404
00:20:38.051 --> 00:20:38.884
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become more straightforward to </v>

405
00:20:39.751 --> 00:20:44.400
<v Speaker 1>measure and so here's what we know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness so far.</v>

406
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It predicts conservatism along with low </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>

407
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.423
<v Speaker 1>low openness is a better predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism and high openness of </v>

408
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:52.324
<v Speaker 1>liberalism than conscientiousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but conscientiousness is a pretty good </v>

409
00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:57.910
<v Speaker 1>predictor and that's almost all </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness.</v>

410
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>It's also associated with disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>

411
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.553
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a very cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Jonathan Heit has done a lot of work </v>

412
00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:06.934
<v Speaker 1>on disgust sensitivity and so as a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Paul Rosen and I knew their </v>

413
00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:12.990
<v Speaker 1>research from really almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's almost 30 years ago now,</v>

414
00:21:12.991 --> 00:21:15.730
<v Speaker 1>and I thought they were really onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>something back in the nineties.</v>

415
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I really thought that investigating </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed would be useful because no one</v>

416
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:19.774
<v Speaker 1>had ever really talked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't conceptualized it as a separate </v>

417
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:23.044
<v Speaker 1>emotion system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we found that that disgust </v>

418
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness,</v>

419
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 1>with a preference for order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition and not with egalitarianism.</v>

420
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.903
<v Speaker 1>It's also associated orderliness with </v>
<v Speaker 1>harsh judgments of moral transgression </v>

421
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the kicker here.</v>

422
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>function of something that psychologists</v>

423
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:43.294
<v Speaker 1>have started to describe as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral immune system and so we're </v>

424
00:21:45.941 --> 00:21:46.774
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about the behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune system and then we're going to </v>

425
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:49.504
<v Speaker 1>talk more speculatively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say about the role that the </v>

426
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:53.374
<v Speaker 1>behavioral immune system might play in </v>
<v Speaker 1>political choice and also in political </v>

427
00:21:56.861 --> 00:22:00.070
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I find this overwhelmingly shocking,</v>

428
00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.123
<v Speaker 1>this body of data because it's opened up</v>
<v Speaker 1>a view for me of why people are </v>

429
00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:08.850
<v Speaker 1>prejudice that I had no idea existed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

430
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:09.893
<v Speaker 1>It's make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually makes prejudice a more </v>

431
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 1>terrifying thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified about prejudice before I</v>

432
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:15.850
<v Speaker 1>do any of this stuff I'm going to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you about today,</v>

433
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.070
<v Speaker 1>but this makes it more terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it.</v>

434
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.250
<v Speaker 1>It locks it so deeply into people you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't believe it,</v>

435
00:22:21.251 --> 00:22:22.084
<v Speaker 1>and the worst than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you understand why it's locked so </v>

436
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:26.374
<v Speaker 1>deeply into people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also understand why it emerged as a </v>

437
00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:32.320
<v Speaker 1>necessity and that's the terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing now.</v>

438
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:35.860
<v Speaker 1>So we're stuck with that now and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>really knows what to do about it.</v>

439
00:22:35.861 --> 00:22:38.140
<v Speaker 1>And so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll walk through this and you can tell</v>

440
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:40.990
<v Speaker 1>me what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the behavioral immune system?</v>

441
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.400
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the parasite,</v>

442
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.323
<v Speaker 1>stress hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of parasitic infection within a </v>

443
00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:54.520
<v Speaker 1>region may drive variability at both </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and societal levels.</v>

444
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.383
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're talking about individual </v>

445
00:22:56.801 --> 00:23:00.430
<v Speaker 1>variability in political attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in personality traits,</v>

446
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.000
<v Speaker 1>both among individuals and both in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social world.</v>

447
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll outline that in some great </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail.</v>

448
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.553
<v Speaker 1>The avoidance of death or disability </v>
<v Speaker 1>through avoidance of infection is a </v>

449
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 1>major evolutionary driving force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

450
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:18.220
<v Speaker 1>until times that are recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in evolutionary terms,</v>

451
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:19.263
<v Speaker 1>almost 50 percent of children failed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive to reproductive age with the </v>

452
00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 1>majority of deaths being due to </v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious diseases.</v>

453
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.153
<v Speaker 1>Now we're less cognizant of that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern people because of the invention </v>

454
00:23:31.871 --> 00:23:32.704
<v Speaker 1>of antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're currently in the process of </v>

455
00:23:36.731 --> 00:23:39.160
<v Speaker 1>destroying as rapidly as we possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat,</v>

456
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.053
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're given widescale to </v>

457
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:47.100
<v Speaker 1>animals and to people too far too great </v>
<v Speaker 1>a degree and all over the world.</v>

458
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 1>We're generating new infectious diseases</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are resistant to antibiotics,</v>

459
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.520
<v Speaker 1>all known antibiotics and we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any new antibiotics in the pipeline,</v>

460
00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 1>so although we've had a 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 year hiatus where infectious diseases</v>

461
00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:01.454
<v Speaker 1>were well controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're back on the march again and for </v>

462
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:05.774
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are multiple strains that have </v>

463
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:07.874
<v Speaker 1>emerged of antibiotic resistant </v>
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis that can't be treated by </v>

464
00:24:11.331 --> 00:24:13.580
<v Speaker 1>any known combination of antibiotics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will.</v>

465
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Those are actually 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a terrible thing.</v>

466
00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:16.724
<v Speaker 1>They tend to be bred in hospitals and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess is if we did the epidemiology </v>

467
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:21.224
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hospitals kill more people than </v>

468
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:23.474
<v Speaker 1>they save and the reason they do that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they bring people together who </v>

469
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:29.690
<v Speaker 1>have diseases and they breed infectious </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease of all sorts.</v>

470
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 1>That's antibiotic resistant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely insane.</v>

471
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.270
<v Speaker 1>And here's another thing we do that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely crazy.</v>

472
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you bring cattle to a feed lot,</v>

473
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.483
<v Speaker 1>they're fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is particularly the case in in the </v>

474
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:44.210
<v Speaker 1>US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the case in Ontario.</v>

475
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.520
<v Speaker 1>They're fattened up on corn and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason they're fattened up on corn,</v>

476
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.610
<v Speaker 1>because corn is heavily subsidized as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crop,</v>

477
00:24:52.611 --> 00:24:53.444
<v Speaker 1>so it's damn near free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's corn syrup in </v>

478
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:55.821
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

479
00:24:55.821 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a very low cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low cost source of calories,</v>

480
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.640
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well hooray.</v>

481
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a low cost source of calories.</v>

482
00:25:02.841 --> 00:25:03.674
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that wonderful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that means that people don't </v>

483
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 1>have any who don't have any money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to eat and right,</v>

484
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:08.863
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the subsidy is made corn so cheap </v>

485
00:25:10.791 --> 00:25:11.624
<v Speaker 1>that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can feed it to cows to fatten them </v>

486
00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:14.174
<v Speaker 1>up because they get quite fat fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave a lot of weight fast with </v>

487
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:17.024
<v Speaker 1>corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is cows can digest corn so </v>

488
00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it makes them sick or they digest it </v>
<v Speaker 1>very badly.</v>

489
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 1>It makes them sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not designed for it.</v>

490
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:26.420
<v Speaker 1>They're designed to eat grass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not corn,</v>

491
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.880
<v Speaker 1>and so in order to stop the cows from </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying,</v>

492
00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:29.714
<v Speaker 1>when you feed them corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pump them full of antibiotics and </v>

493
00:25:31.911 --> 00:25:34.700
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that's breeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotic resistance,</v>

494
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.593
<v Speaker 1>so it's not very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what we're doing and no one </v>

495
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:40.610
<v Speaker 1>really notices and that's a very bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

496
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.040
<v Speaker 1>so you can be sure.</v>

497
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.933
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually certain of is that whatever </v>

498
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:48.170
<v Speaker 1>you're worried about happening terribly </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future,</v>

499
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.183
<v Speaker 1>it will be something else that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not worrying about that will actually </v>

500
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:53.960
<v Speaker 1>cause the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this could certainly be one of those</v>

501
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:54.794
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local parasite types and host defense </v>

502
00:25:57.231 --> 00:25:58.064
<v Speaker 1>systems will typically typically be </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in a coal evolutionary arms </v>

503
00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so at any given time,</v>

504
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:08.930
<v Speaker 1>a host's immunological defenses will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized to be most effective against</v>

505
00:26:08.931 --> 00:26:12.710
<v Speaker 1>local parasite species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the extent that a host defense system</v>

506
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:13.544
<v Speaker 1>is specialized locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with out groups will be </v>

507
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:17.894
<v Speaker 1>associated with an increased risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure to infectious diseases against </v>

508
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:24.080
<v Speaker 1>which there is no a priori immunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

509
00:26:24.081 --> 00:26:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read that again because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should think about it to the extent that</v>

510
00:26:28.551 --> 00:26:29.384
<v Speaker 1>a host defense system is specialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>locally contact with out groups will be </v>

511
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:34.304
<v Speaker 1>associated with an increased risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure to infectious diseases against </v>

512
00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:40.070
<v Speaker 1>which there is no a priori immunity.</v>

513
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Black Plague Europe came in on ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

514
00:26:43.801 --> 00:26:46.230
<v Speaker 1>The Europeans started to spread out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came back with the ships.</v>

515
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:48.030
<v Speaker 1>The rats came off the ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof.</v>

516
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Third of the European population died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The relevant infection,</v>

517
00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:58.011
<v Speaker 1>avoiding behaviors such as avoidance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangers and high conscientiousness in,</v>

518
00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.753
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food preparation are assumed to arise </v>

519
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 1>from the operation of a behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune system.</v>

520
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.573
<v Speaker 1>The behavioral immune system comprises </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptive psychological response </v>

521
00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:09.354
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms that are sensitive to cues </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might predict the presence of </v>

522
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:13.644
<v Speaker 1>infectious pathogens and which respond </v>
<v Speaker 1>with appropriate cognitive processing </v>

523
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:19.920
<v Speaker 1>and affective reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a system.</v>

524
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.320
<v Speaker 1>This is the next thing that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to.</v>

525
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Such a system is likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>oversensitive.</v>

526
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 1>The cost of a false positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding non existent infection is small</v>

527
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:34.470
<v Speaker 1>relative to the possible cost catching </v>
<v Speaker 1>an avoidable infection.</v>

528
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.513
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're walking through the grass and </v>

529
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.340
<v Speaker 1>your snake detectors go off.</v>

530
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.940
<v Speaker 1>They're full or the perifoveal of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>

531
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:42.990
<v Speaker 1>the periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>periphery,</v>

532
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.590
<v Speaker 1>especially for the detection of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might threaten you,</v>

533
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.030
<v Speaker 1>and so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

534
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.163
<v Speaker 1>your snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have snake detection systems in the </v>

535
00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:51.534
<v Speaker 1>periphery of your vision that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypersensitive because if you see a </v>

536
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.730
<v Speaker 1>stick and you think snake and you jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the air,</v>

537
00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:57.743
<v Speaker 1>the cost is you jumped up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who cares that you miss identified </v>

538
00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:02.064
<v Speaker 1>the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there's a snake there and you </v>

539
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 1>don't see it and it bites you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're dead.</v>

540
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:10.320
<v Speaker 1>So the logic is why not set the systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that protect you to be hypersensitive?</v>

541
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:11.154
<v Speaker 1>Because the cost of the hypersensitivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>is low compared to the cost of </v>

542
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.810
<v Speaker 1>hyposensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

543
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.063
<v Speaker 1>In social terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an important component of the parasite </v>

544
00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:26.211
<v Speaker 1>stress hypothesis is that high levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>infection may lead to ethnocentrism,</v>

545
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:27.924
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distrust of different others and </v>

546
00:28:29.851 --> 00:28:30.684
<v Speaker 1>conformity because such behaviors will </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce the likelihood of exposure to </v>

547
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 1>unfamiliar of infections to which </v>
<v Speaker 1>immunity has not been developed.</v>

548
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:38.243
<v Speaker 1>Why is there strict sexual morality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because promiscuity is a prime vector </v>

549
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:45.510
<v Speaker 1>for disease transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons</v>

550
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 1>conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the social immune system,</v>

551
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 1>disgust is considered to be one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic human emotions defined by a strong</v>

552
00:28:55.951 --> 00:29:00.090
<v Speaker 1>revulsion and desire to withdraw from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliciting stimulus or event.</v>

553
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:01.223
<v Speaker 1>Physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disgust is accompanied by a distinct </v>

554
00:29:03.181 --> 00:29:04.014
<v Speaker 1>facial expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>involve involving constriction of the </v>

555
00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:07.104
<v Speaker 1>oral and the nasal cavity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the disgust face which closes </v>

556
00:29:10.111 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 1>up your nose and your mouth so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things can get in.</v>

557
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.673
<v Speaker 1>Evolutionary models of discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposed that this emotion evolved to </v>

558
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:16.734
<v Speaker 1>help us avoid contaminated or harmful </v>
<v Speaker 1>foods or other potential sources of </v>

559
00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:20.904
<v Speaker 1>disease such as sexual contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's lots of psychoanalytic </v>

560
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 1>theories about sexual shame and sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>

561
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's much more straightforward as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned,</v>

562
00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:31.164
<v Speaker 1>to view it as a biological battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's approach systems and sexual </v>

563
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:35.904
<v Speaker 1>arousal systems that are involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving you forward towards a sexual </v>

564
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:39.594
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's disgust systems that guard </v>

565
00:29:41.231 --> 00:29:42.064
<v Speaker 1>you against it and those two things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually regulatory and so you're </v>

566
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 1>basically stuck in the middle.</v>

567
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.133
<v Speaker 1>It's half move forward and half be </v>
<v Speaker 1>repelled and that's partly also the </v>

568
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:51.514
<v Speaker 1>balance of those two things has helped </v>
<v Speaker 1>is what helps you select a sexual </v>

569
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:58.270
<v Speaker 1>partner and people generally are quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>selective about their sexual partners.</v>

570
00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.860
<v Speaker 1>So and we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

571
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 1>why are you selective about your sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners?</v>

572
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the obvious practical reasons,</v>

573
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:06.123
<v Speaker 1>but then there's the reasons that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more tightly associated with biological </v>

574
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:14.080
<v Speaker 1>protection and so even though we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to think that way,</v>

575
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:16.623
<v Speaker 1>in addition to its role indirectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping to expel harmful foods from the </v>

576
00:30:20.531 --> 00:30:21.364
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust also forms an important </v>

577
00:30:22.781 --> 00:30:24.910
<v Speaker 1>component of the behavioral immune </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

578
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.193
<v Speaker 1>the suite of psychological mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aid in the detection and avoidance </v>

579
00:30:29.891 --> 00:30:33.070
<v Speaker 1>of potential contaminants before they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can make contact with the body.</v>

580
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.323
<v Speaker 1>Although disgust may have its origins in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the protection against physical </v>

581
00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:37.234
<v Speaker 1>contamination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of studies have implicated </v>

582
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 1>disgust responses in moral decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>

583
00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.373
<v Speaker 1>There's been experiments that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically associated with the </v>

584
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:45.874
<v Speaker 1>elicitation of disgust and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation of the corresponding </v>

585
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:49.930
<v Speaker 1>behaviors in the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

586
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.793
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine I gave you a sterilized </v>

587
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 1>beaker and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

588
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:57.280
<v Speaker 1>expel some saliva into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now wait 10 seconds and drink it,</v>

589
00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.960
<v Speaker 1>will you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

590
00:30:58.961 --> 00:31:01.090
<v Speaker 1>people know you see you made a disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

591
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:02.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the question is why?</v>

592
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's sterile.</v>

593
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 1>It was in your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds before.</v>

594
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Why all of a sudden have have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>switched from it being part of your body</v>

595
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:11.524
<v Speaker 1>to not being part of your body and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>being part of your body that wasn't </v>

596
00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:15.934
<v Speaker 1>ingested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was part of you to being something </v>

597
00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:20.590
<v Speaker 1>that there's no damn way you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have anything to do with so</v>

598
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good example.</v>

599
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:24.514
<v Speaker 1>That's a good example of the of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the disgust mechanism and in </v>

600
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:27.993
<v Speaker 1>operation.</v>

601
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Distinguishing between self and nonself </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very,</v>

602
00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:34.400
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple mechanisms that do it and it's.</v>

603
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:38.410
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although disgust may have its origins in</v>

604
00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:40.540
<v Speaker 1>protection against physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>contamination,</v>

605
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.300
<v Speaker 1>a number of studies have implicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust response,</v>

606
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.850
<v Speaker 1>disgust responses in moral decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>

607
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:46.863
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you can see the activity </v>

608
00:31:49.301 --> 00:31:50.134
<v Speaker 1>of the behavioral immune system in such </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple things as avoiding sources of </v>

609
00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:56.800
<v Speaker 1>contamination on a sidewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

610
00:31:56.801 --> 00:31:57.634
<v Speaker 1>If you see something that's disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say rotting food or something like that </v>

611
00:32:00.401 --> 00:32:01.234
<v Speaker 1>on a sidewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>

612
00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:03.850
<v Speaker 1>step in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very low.</v>

613
00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:04.684
<v Speaker 1>You're going to see it and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a face and you're going to go </v>

614
00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:07.654
<v Speaker 1>around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is because you </v>

615
00:32:08.411 --> 00:32:09.244
<v Speaker 1>don't want that attached to you in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and the reason for that is while </v>

616
00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:13.714
<v Speaker 1>it's disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's contaminating and the association </v>

617
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:16.360
<v Speaker 1>there is that.</v>

618
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a place where you could conceivably</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up a disease.</v>

619
00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Now you see pathologies of this system </v>
<v Speaker 1>arise,</v>

620
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 1>generally obsessive compulsive disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so chronic hand washing,</v>

621
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:28.924
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this is classified as an anxiety </v>

622
00:32:30.971 --> 00:32:33.490
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is an anxiety component to it,</v>

623
00:32:33.491 --> 00:32:35.830
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe that that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate classification.</v>

624
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:36.664
<v Speaker 1>I think that obsessive compulsive </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder is actually a disorder of </v>

625
00:32:38.651 --> 00:32:39.484
<v Speaker 1>disgust because all of the behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including hyper grooming people </v>

626
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:43.604
<v Speaker 1>sometimes have trichotillomania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll pull out the hairs on their </v>

627
00:32:46.011 --> 00:32:46.844
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grooming behaviors and that sort of </v>

628
00:32:48.111 --> 00:32:48.944
<v Speaker 1>thing seemed to be more associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the operation of the disgust system and </v>

629
00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:56.801
<v Speaker 1>almost everything about obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsive disorder has a disgust basis.</v>

630
00:32:56.901 --> 00:32:58.970
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

631
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.333
<v Speaker 1>who have OCD obsess about is that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a client once who was this poor </v>

632
00:33:04.311 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 1>woman by the time her ocd was done with </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

633
00:33:06.801 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 1>she built the equivalent of an airlock </v>
<v Speaker 1>on her house,</v>

634
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:11.870
<v Speaker 1>like not technically proficient or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

635
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.943
<v Speaker 1>And her husband and her children had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go through an elaborate decontamination </v>

636
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:17.750
<v Speaker 1>process before they were allowed to step</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot in the house.</v>

637
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.823
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things she was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about was that she would go </v>

638
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:23.940
<v Speaker 1>out to a supermarket and touch a piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fruit and,</v>

639
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.833
<v Speaker 1>and become contaminated and then come </v>
<v Speaker 1>home and touch her children and then </v>

640
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:28.454
<v Speaker 1>they would become contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so while she ended up in the </v>

641
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 1>hospital and she was divorced and I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>just did it in her life,</v>

642
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then people who have obsessive </v>

643
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:37.490
<v Speaker 1>compulsive disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

644
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:38.324
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll wash their hands until the soap </v>

645
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:41.750
<v Speaker 1>is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a whole bar of soap.</v>

646
00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:42.584
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can often tell who they are </v>

647
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:46.940
<v Speaker 1>because their hands are shiny from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington much and they'll shower,</v>

648
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.833
<v Speaker 1>it can't get out of the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll shower until the hot water is </v>

649
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:54.260
<v Speaker 1>completely gone and their self cleaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism so to speak,</v>

650
00:33:54.261 --> 00:33:55.094
<v Speaker 1>have gone seriously astray and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you treat them as by exposing them to </v>

651
00:33:58.131 --> 00:34:00.770
<v Speaker 1>things that are disgusting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminating.</v>

652
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I had a client with OCD once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was quite the character and I.</v>

653
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.970
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I had him do was we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would look for things on the Internet,</v>

654
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:12.680
<v Speaker 1>pictures of things that really disgusted</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

655
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not that much fun by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treating someone who has ocd because I'm</v>

656
00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 1>rather disgust sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was also rather hard on me.</v>

657
00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:22.250
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would look for things on the Internet</v>

658
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:23.690
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he really didn't like.</v>

659
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:26.360
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd print them out and have him</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them on his fridge,</v>

660
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.450
<v Speaker 1>which he did not like at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would,</v>

661
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:30.583
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a bunch of other problems and we </v>

662
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:32.594
<v Speaker 1>got along quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for a long time I treated him for </v>

663
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:35.564
<v Speaker 1>about three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would phone me like three or four </v>

664
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:41.490
<v Speaker 1>times a day because he had obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsive disorder and just swear at me</v>

665
00:34:41.491 --> 00:34:42.480
<v Speaker 1>like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

666
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.610
<v Speaker 1>just swear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

667
00:34:43.611 --> 00:34:44.630
<v Speaker 1>get these messages.</v>

668
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:45.350
<v Speaker 1>He'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

669
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:46.183
<v Speaker 1>he phoned me and he just so mad at me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'd have to put these things on </v>

670
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:49.980
<v Speaker 1>his fridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

671
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.133
<v Speaker 1>and so he'd curse and swear and yell at </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and then two minutes later he would </v>

672
00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.120
<v Speaker 1>phone and apologize and say he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really sorry.</v>

673
00:34:56.121 --> 00:34:58.340
<v Speaker 1>It helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would continue to see them and god,</v>

674
00:34:58.341 --> 00:35:00.530
<v Speaker 1>that just went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just went on forever.</v>

675
00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.940
<v Speaker 1>But I felt sorry for the poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

676
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.580
<v Speaker 1>He eventually ended up getting a puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

677
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:07.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

678
00:35:07.241 --> 00:35:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I see you agreeable people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

679
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Papi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

680
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.200
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

681
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:13.110
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

682
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.533
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was good for him because he had to </v>

683
00:35:15.921 --> 00:35:17.540
<v Speaker 1>go around and clean up after the PA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>PA,</v>

684
00:35:17.541 --> 00:35:20.200
<v Speaker 1>but that had poor puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was quite dominant and it,</v>

685
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.820
<v Speaker 1>the things that happened to that poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

686
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:27.950
<v Speaker 1>so the puppy would dominate him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he'd take it outside to take it for a</v>

687
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:30.170
<v Speaker 1>walk and he wasn't a very skilled person</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many,</v>

688
00:35:30.171 --> 00:35:31.004
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>

689
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.353
<v Speaker 1>He had a very large number of severe </v>
<v Speaker 1>impediments and so he really liked this </v>

690
00:35:36.141 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 1>puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have any or anything like that</v>

691
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.540
<v Speaker 1>and he was supported by his aged mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

692
00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:42.573
<v Speaker 1>it was just a catastrophe and he'd go </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside and try to walk the puppy and </v>

693
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 1>the puppy would just sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

694
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.073
<v Speaker 1>because it was doing dominant stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know how to overcome it and </v>

695
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:52.403
<v Speaker 1>then these crazy people from across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way who styled themselves as animal </v>

696
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:56.274
<v Speaker 1>rights activists started to harass me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they phoned up his mother and told </v>

697
00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:00.210
<v Speaker 1>them that if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

698
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:02.520
<v Speaker 1>if she didn't take the dog away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that retard,</v>

699
00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:03.354
<v Speaker 1>they were going to come over and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things to him and then he got </v>

700
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:06.804
<v Speaker 1>harassed on the street and then he went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a park with his dog and they came up </v>

701
00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:13.890
<v Speaker 1>to him and pushed him on the card and </v>
<v Speaker 1>swiped his dog and ran off to the,</v>

702
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.490
<v Speaker 1>to the SPCA and dumped it there.</v>

703
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.560
<v Speaker 1>He had to move away from his apartment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and God,</v>

704
00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:22.200
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just an absolute catastrophe.</v>

705
00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 1>They had plenty of sympathy for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn dog.</v>

706
00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:26.790
<v Speaker 1>But no sympathy whatsoever for the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

707
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.830
<v Speaker 1>it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really something.</v>

708
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that story ended happily weirdly enough.</v>

709
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.600
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got a job with a woman who used to be</v>

710
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:37.434
<v Speaker 1>a psychiatric nurse who was training </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs and she gave him a little job </v>

711
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:44.880
<v Speaker 1>setting up the dog training thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he got to learn to train his dog.</v>

712
00:36:44.881 --> 00:36:46.800
<v Speaker 1>He lost like he was a thin guy to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

713
00:36:46.801 --> 00:36:49.530
<v Speaker 1>He lost like 30 pounds trying to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to take care of this puppy.</v>

714
00:36:49.531 --> 00:36:51.810
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was going to die,</v>

715
00:36:51.811 --> 00:36:54.060
<v Speaker 1>but there is no way he was going to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>up that dog.</v>

716
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocd,</v>

717
00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.210
<v Speaker 1>it's square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite the bloody catastrophe.</v>

718
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.193
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a good thing for someone who </v>

719
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:03.940
<v Speaker 1>has ocd to have a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

720
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Because dogs are messy and so there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things that are messy about</v>

721
00:37:07.891 --> 00:37:08.724
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have to kind of live with the </v>

722
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:11.130
<v Speaker 1>mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to live with the mess.</v>

723
00:37:11.131 --> 00:37:11.964
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have a child or if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a partner of any </v>

724
00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:14.364
<v Speaker 1>sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you can't let the orderliness </v>

725
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:21.180
<v Speaker 1>part of you get the upper hand so </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly that it's impossible for you to</v>

726
00:37:21.181 --> 00:37:22.014
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to girls who have </v>

727
00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:24.630
<v Speaker 1>anorexia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

728
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.633
<v Speaker 1>You know how you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea with regards to </v>

729
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:30.980
<v Speaker 1>anorexia that it's often high achieving </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls who have it well,</v>

730
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:33.900
<v Speaker 1>it's hyper conscientious girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get so disgust sensitive.</v>

731
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 1>They can't stand their own bodies and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

732
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:38.003
<v Speaker 1>then they start being able to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies properly and so what they </v>

733
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:42.000
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of looking at their whole body,</v>

734
00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:43.560
<v Speaker 1>they lose the ability to do that.</v>

735
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.633
<v Speaker 1>They only can see parts of their body </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they can't tell the difference </v>

736
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.264
<v Speaker 1>between a part that's healthy and well </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped and a fat part and so anything </v>

737
00:37:51.961 --> 00:37:55.830
<v Speaker 1>that's that's that's what would you call</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dubious.</v>

738
00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's hard to measure becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to see.</v>

739
00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.370
<v Speaker 1>So either an anorexic client at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

740
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.670
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't a very big woman maybe about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this big and thin.</v>

741
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

742
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.153
<v Speaker 1>and so I was trying to work with her on </v>
<v Speaker 1>her body perception disorder and one of </v>

743
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 1>the things I did was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had her come and sit beside me,</v>

744
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 1>so I was sitting like this and so is </v>
<v Speaker 1>she.</v>

745
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:18.690
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you look at our two thighs,</v>

746
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 1>which one is bigger than mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like 40 percent bigger.</v>

747
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.363
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can't tell they look the same to </v>

748
00:38:25.291 --> 00:38:26.071
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

749
00:38:26.071 --> 00:38:27.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're going to do.</v>

750
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I let her do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

751
00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:32.970
<v Speaker 1>you take a pencil and all sit on a piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>of paper and you just trace my thigh.</v>

752
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can put that piece of paper</v>

753
00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 1>underneath your thigh and trace it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can look at the difference.</v>

754
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:39.004
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had her do that and she looked at </v>

755
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:42.970
<v Speaker 1>the two pieces of paper and she couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>

756
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 1>She could not believe that that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the case because her perception</v>

757
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:52.210
<v Speaker 1>had become so disordered that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for her to see the real shape</v>

758
00:38:52.211 --> 00:38:53.044
<v Speaker 1>of her body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we would go outside and I would ask </v>

759
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:56.500
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that person fan,</v>

760
00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:59.200
<v Speaker 1>is that person fap and with other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could tell,</v>

761
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:01.180
<v Speaker 1>but with her own body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a chance.</v>

762
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.193
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't see it properly at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a real obsession with </v>

763
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:07.450
<v Speaker 1>purity among women who have anorexia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

764
00:39:07.451 --> 00:39:08.284
<v Speaker 1>they'd like to starve themselves right </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the bone because the bone is </v>

765
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:14.530
<v Speaker 1>sort of pure and white and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>excess tissue on it.</v>

766
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.800
<v Speaker 1>And so anorexia also looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease of disgust.</v>

767
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to.</v>

768
00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:20.723
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thought in very black and white </v>

769
00:39:21.521 --> 00:39:22.354
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I had her do at one </v>

770
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:25.960
<v Speaker 1>point was said she hasn't music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

771
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I either really liked a song or I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it at all.</v>

772
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.491
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

773
00:39:30.491 --> 00:39:31.324
<v Speaker 1>well you've got a music collection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you go through like 20 of </v>

774
00:39:33.521 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 1>those songs and rate them on a scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one to 10.</v>

775
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 1>And she couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was either yes or no orderly,</v>

776
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.013
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boundaries around the categories </v>

777
00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 1>were absolutely segregated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And her apartment tended to be decorated</v>

778
00:39:47.021 --> 00:39:49.300
<v Speaker 1>in black and white and she was hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>clean,</v>

779
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:50.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything in the apartment was </v>

780
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well put away.</v>

781
00:39:53.171 --> 00:39:56.040
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't stand to see anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting on the counters and that sort</v>

782
00:39:56.041 --> 00:39:56.770
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

783
00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:57.603
<v Speaker 1>So very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult disorder to treat </v>

784
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:01.390
<v Speaker 1>anorexia very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>

785
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

786
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.210
<v Speaker 1>you can see how it can go wrong because </v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

787
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:10.300
<v Speaker 1>when you're eating your disgust systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>are on alert,</v>

788
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

789
00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:12.203
<v Speaker 1>you want the thing you want to eat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely don't want the thing you </v>

790
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:15.634
<v Speaker 1>don't want to eat and your mouth is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to that sort of thing to the </v>

791
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.473
<v Speaker 1>texture and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your sense of smell is very </v>

792
00:40:21.101 --> 00:40:21.934
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to that sort of thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you don't want to eat anything </v>

793
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:27.760
<v Speaker 1>that's contaminated or poisonous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's another situation like sex where</v>

794
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.040
<v Speaker 1>the reward system is driving you forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

795
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.610
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to engage in a conservatory behavior.</v>

796
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:37.810
<v Speaker 1>But the disgust system is right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ma modulating and moderating it.</v>

797
00:40:37.811 --> 00:40:39.580
<v Speaker 1>And there's a tension between those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

798
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:42.550
<v Speaker 1>That's already always at work with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anorexic types.</v>

799
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:45.790
<v Speaker 1>The discuss sense the disgust system </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets the upper hand,</v>

800
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.150
<v Speaker 1>so she was also extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgemental and perfectionistic,</v>

801
00:40:49.151 --> 00:40:49.984
<v Speaker 1>but that goes along with it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly people are judgemental and </v>

802
00:40:52.811 --> 00:40:55.600
<v Speaker 1>perfectionistic and so if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a perfectionist.</v>

803
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Often what that means is you have very </v>
<v Speaker 1>high levels of orderliness and very high</v>

804
00:40:59.741 --> 00:41:00.574
<v Speaker 1>levels of neuroticism and those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things chase each other around like mad </v>

805
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:04.803
<v Speaker 1>because you can't stand the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would make a mistake and you get </v>

806
00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:07.834
<v Speaker 1>anxious about it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you get stuck in this </v>

807
00:41:09.611 --> 00:41:11.920
<v Speaker 1>perfectionistic mindset and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of it.</v>

808
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:16.540
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>inducing disgust responses,</v>

809
00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:17.374
<v Speaker 1>whether via fall order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a disgusting work environment or </v>

810
00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:20.404
<v Speaker 1>recalling a disgusting experience led </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals to assign harsher </v>

811
00:41:23.921 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 1>punishments to others who had committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>a moral transgression.</v>

812
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:31.390
<v Speaker 1>So you you describe a moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgression,</v>

813
00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:35.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe breaking a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You exposed the people in the experiment</v>

814
00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:37.880
<v Speaker 1>to some disgusting stimulus and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the.</v>

815
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:42.290
<v Speaker 1>You asked them about the probability </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the person was guilty and then also</v>

816
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:44.990
<v Speaker 1>how long they should be imprisoned or </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much they should be fined.</v>

817
00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:48.110
<v Speaker 1>And if you get the people disgusted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the probability,</v>

818
00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:48.944
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the probability of assigning a </v>

819
00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:53.340
<v Speaker 1>harsh punishment goes upward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

820
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:56.540
<v Speaker 1>so if you're ever in court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't discuss the judge,</v>

821
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the deal.</v>

822
00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.053
<v Speaker 1>Harsher moral consump judgments can even</v>
<v Speaker 1>be induced following the consumption of </v>

823
00:42:03.051 --> 00:42:03.884
<v Speaker 1>a bitter drink because bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter substances are often poisoned or </v>

824
00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:08.984
<v Speaker 1>poisonous substances are often bitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that induces a disgust response as </v>

825
00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:14.240
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you can overcome that,</v>

826
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 1>coffee is bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our bitter so you can,</v>

827
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.240
<v Speaker 1>you can retrain your system to accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things as food,</v>

828
00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:23.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's not particularly easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

829
00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:24.733
<v Speaker 1>the same disgust related facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressions or observed in response to </v>

830
00:42:27.531 --> 00:42:28.364
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant tastes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting photographs and receiving </v>

831
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:33.890
<v Speaker 1>unfair treatment in an economic game.</v>

832
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Concerns about cleanliness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

833
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.850
<v Speaker 1>So some of you may know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at mcmaster university a couple of</v>

834
00:42:40.851 --> 00:42:41.684
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago and there were a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>protesters there and I went up to meet </v>

835
00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 1>the protesters because I kind of wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what would happen.</v>

836
00:42:46.821 --> 00:42:47.654
<v Speaker 1>There were a bunch of them around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of the room now offered to shake </v>

837
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 1>their hands and mostly what I got was </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed faces,</v>

838
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not good.</v>

839
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.450
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's something to know too.</v>

840
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:57.703
<v Speaker 1>Here's the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a good predictor of whether or </v>

841
00:42:58.641 --> 00:43:02.690
<v Speaker 1>not you're going to get divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go into the therapist office and you</v>

842
00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:03.524
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two of you talk and you roll your </v>

843
00:43:04.671 --> 00:43:07.140
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll predict if you roy,</v>

844
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're rolling your eyes at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>

845
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.820
<v Speaker 1>you're going to divorce them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

846
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a disgust response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

847
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:13.603
<v Speaker 1>It's something like I'm lifting you up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my eyes and throwing you into the </v>

848
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:17.450
<v Speaker 1>garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>

849
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.480
<v Speaker 1>but I rolling is a great predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability of divorce.</v>

850
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:21.314
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's something to keep in mind with </v>

851
00:43:22.401 --> 00:43:23.234
<v Speaker 1>regards to your relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're starting to develop some </v>

852
00:43:25.191 --> 00:43:29.630
<v Speaker 1>contempt or some disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bloody well better get on that right</v>

853
00:43:29.631 --> 00:43:33.950
<v Speaker 1>away because that's a bad road to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and so well so.</v>

854
00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to do whatever you have</v>

855
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:38.720
<v Speaker 1>to do not to go down that road.</v>

856
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So see,</v>

857
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening on the political landscape and</v>

858
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.233
<v Speaker 1>like we know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the more authoritarian political </v>

859
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:53.450
<v Speaker 1>correct types are high in agreeableness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and high in orderliness,</v>

860
00:43:53.451 --> 00:43:54.284
<v Speaker 1>so that's a very interesting combination</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think what's happening is that </v>

861
00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:00.830
<v Speaker 1>they're very rapidly dividing the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>into contemptible Predator.</v>

862
00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Like a snake often elicit a disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>response rate.</v>

863
00:44:03.951 --> 00:44:04.784
<v Speaker 1>A Predator will elicit a disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>response like a crocodile or an </v>

864
00:44:07.221 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 1>alligator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a snake or something like that,</v>

865
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.153
<v Speaker 1>and so it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the Predator response that's being </v>

866
00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 1>evoked to the people who are on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side of the political spectrum,</v>

867
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.693
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're categorized as like </v>

868
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.510
<v Speaker 1>contemptible Predator or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

869
00:44:20.511 --> 00:44:23.390
<v Speaker 1>and the people that are being protected </v>
<v Speaker 1>or like innocent victims.</v>

870
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.253
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

871
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.890
<v Speaker 1>That's how it appears and that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous thing to have happen.</v>

872
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:28.723
<v Speaker 1>As I'll show you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concerns about cleanliness and feelings </v>

873
00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:33.960
<v Speaker 1>of disgust have likewise been related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>political attitudes.</v>

874
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Situational reminders of the importance </v>
<v Speaker 1>of physical cleanliness,</v>

875
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:38.663
<v Speaker 1>such as asking participants to wipe </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hands with antiseptic wipes tend </v>

876
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:42.804
<v Speaker 1>to increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self reported political conservatism </v>

877
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:46.463
<v Speaker 1>such as fine finding is consistent with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion that purity tends to be </v>

878
00:44:49.981 --> 00:44:52.920
<v Speaker 1>valued more highly by conservatives than</v>
<v Speaker 1>by liberals.</v>

879
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:54.413
<v Speaker 1>Individuals who report being disgusted </v>
<v Speaker 1>more easily also tend to hold more </v>

880
00:44:58.171 --> 00:45:00.690
<v Speaker 1>conservative political views on topics </v>
<v Speaker 1>including abortion,</v>

881
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:02.850
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage tax cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and affirmative action.</v>

882
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.720
<v Speaker 1>In addition to the effects that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged when using self reported disgust</v>

883
00:45:06.721 --> 00:45:07.554
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more conservative political views have </v>

884
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:09.984
<v Speaker 1>also been associated with stronger </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological reactivity to disgusting </v>

885
00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:14.430
<v Speaker 1>images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lawyer,</v>

886
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.293
<v Speaker 1>Martha Nussbaum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is also a political philosopher who </v>

887
00:45:17.101 --> 00:45:22.101
<v Speaker 1>says that we should eliminate the effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of disgust on our political theorizing,</v>

888
00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:23.604
<v Speaker 1>that disgust shouldn't be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's considered as a valid means of </v>

889
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:33.020
<v Speaker 1>information from which you might drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>derive political conclusions.</v>

890
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.983
<v Speaker 1>So if I find your behavior disgusting or</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you find my behavior disgusting </v>

891
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.000
<v Speaker 1>according to Nussbaum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be independent.</v>

892
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.660
<v Speaker 1>You should try to make that rationally </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent of your political views.</v>

893
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:43.703
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a problem and this is the </v>

894
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:46.434
<v Speaker 1>problem that we're going to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't muck about with these </v>

895
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 1>underlying systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just say ignore the reports of</v>

896
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:53.064
<v Speaker 1>your disgust system because it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't like your emotions are insane </v>

897
00:45:57.841 --> 00:45:58.674
<v Speaker 1>and irrational and you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality on top of that that's </v>

898
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 1>guiding you properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how it works.</v>

899
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:06.910
<v Speaker 1>All of these underlying biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems guide you and to the degree that</v>

900
00:46:06.911 --> 00:46:11.280
<v Speaker 1>you're the degree to which you're guided</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly is a consequence of the balance</v>

901
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.100
<v Speaker 1>of the action of these underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological systems,</v>

902
00:46:14.101 --> 00:46:14.934
<v Speaker 1>but the balance is very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We maintained you need a disgust system </v>

903
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:18.893
<v Speaker 1>because if you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd eat something that would kill you </v>

904
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:21.503
<v Speaker 1>and then you would die or you'd do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something stupid and you'd end up like </v>

905
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.210
<v Speaker 1>you get caught and it would be dirty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't clean it and then you would</v>

906
00:46:27.211 --> 00:46:27.960
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

907
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.793
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that you can somehow just </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalize the output of the disgust </v>

908
00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:33.204
<v Speaker 1>system and decontaminate your political </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints as a consequence seems to be </v>

909
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:39.210
<v Speaker 1>to be an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to be very,</v>

910
00:46:39.211 --> 00:46:42.210
<v Speaker 1>very naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that there's no danger to it because</v>

911
00:46:42.211 --> 00:46:43.044
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of danger to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to large literature has </v>

912
00:46:46.801 --> 00:46:47.634
<v Speaker 1>converged on the notion that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>two core dimensions of conservative </v>

913
00:46:50.491 --> 00:46:52.950
<v Speaker 1>political ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance to change,</v>

914
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:57.570
<v Speaker 1>and tolerance of inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resistance to change reflects the extent</v>

915
00:46:57.571 --> 00:46:59.820
<v Speaker 1>to which people wish to maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>status quo.</v>

916
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:00.863
<v Speaker 1>While tolerance of inequality reflects </v>
<v Speaker 1>the acceptance of an unequal </v>

917
00:47:03.031 --> 00:47:06.180
<v Speaker 1>distribution of resources and </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities within society.</v>

918
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.253
<v Speaker 1>Joest has done a lot of that work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jostes supervisor as Banerji and </v>

919
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.433
<v Speaker 1>Missouri and Banerji is unknown Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so this is another place where </v>

920
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 1>political ideology contaminates as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned,</v>

921
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:24.921
<v Speaker 1>scientific inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because jostes work on on on,</v>

922
00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:26.423
<v Speaker 1>let's say resistance to change is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that the </v>

923
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:30.214
<v Speaker 1>conservative in the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclination to support the maintenance </v>

924
00:47:34.871 --> 00:47:35.704
<v Speaker 1>of already existing structures is </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely equivalent to supporting an </v>

925
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:42.400
<v Speaker 1>unjust system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a reasonable thing to do.</v>

926
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.490
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking at these sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things from a scientific perspective,</v>

927
00:47:45.491 --> 00:47:47.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to make judgments like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

928
00:47:47.021 --> 00:47:49.210
<v Speaker 1>but they're built into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaires,</v>

929
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:50.703
<v Speaker 1>so resistance to change reflects the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent to which people wish to maintain </v>

930
00:47:54.131 --> 00:47:54.964
<v Speaker 1>the status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While tolerance of inequality reflects </v>

931
00:47:57.071 --> 00:47:57.904
<v Speaker 1>the acceptance of an unequal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution of resources and </v>

932
00:47:59.561 --> 00:48:00.394
<v Speaker 1>opportunities within society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two dimensions appear roughly </v>

933
00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:04.384
<v Speaker 1>aligned with social and economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism as expressed in the </v>

934
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:07.714
<v Speaker 1>constructs of right wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism and social dominance </v>

935
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:10.714
<v Speaker 1>orientation respectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no left wing authoritarian </v>

936
00:48:13.751 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 1>psychological scales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to derive one right now,</v>

937
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.620
<v Speaker 1>but the reason for that is that after </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War Two,</v>

938
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.153
<v Speaker 1>the social science community was </v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to what had happened in Nazi </v>

939
00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:24.903
<v Speaker 1>Germany and perfectly appropriately and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they examined right wing </v>

940
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:28.383
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they never examined left wing </v>

941
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:34.030
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism because the prevailing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

942
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:35.103
<v Speaker 1>political landscape of the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>proscribed made the idea that there </v>

943
00:48:39.881 --> 00:48:40.714
<v Speaker 1>could be left wing authoritarianism </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently incorrect politically so </v>

944
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:47.260
<v Speaker 1>that it was never analyzed from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of social science.</v>

945
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:48.303
<v Speaker 1>Even though the evidence for left wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism say by the end of the </v>

946
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:53.890
<v Speaker 1>19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was absolutely overwhelming.</v>

947
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the 19 thirties,</v>

948
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:58.420
<v Speaker 1>people were reporting on what had </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the Soviet Union.</v>

949
00:48:58.421 --> 00:49:00.890
<v Speaker 1>You know the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forest decolonization,</v>

950
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.133
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the agricultural industry in the </v>

951
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:06.333
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union and the consequence death </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequent deaths of several million </v>

952
00:49:08.321 --> 00:49:09.154
<v Speaker 1>people in the Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all extraordinarily well </v>

953
00:49:10.571 --> 00:49:11.404
<v Speaker 1>documented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These core facets of conservatism are </v>

954
00:49:14.471 --> 00:49:15.304
<v Speaker 1>also closely related to the two higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>order value dimensions described in </v>

955
00:49:18.101 --> 00:49:18.934
<v Speaker 1>moral foundations theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which reflect preferences for order and </v>

956
00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:22.684
<v Speaker 1>tradition on the one hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences for egalitarianism on the </v>

957
00:49:25.361 --> 00:49:27.040
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Importantly,</v>

958
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:31.300
<v Speaker 1>the motivational basis of these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions appears to vary independently</v>

959
00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:32.134
<v Speaker 1>from one another with an individual's </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall political attitudes on the left </v>

960
00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:37.690
<v Speaker 1>right spectrum emerging from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>relative balance.</v>

961
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:39.543
<v Speaker 1>These motives are also strongly rooted </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted in basic personality </v>

962
00:49:42.671 --> 00:49:43.504
<v Speaker 1>characteristics such that preferences </v>
<v Speaker 1>for order and tradition are associated </v>

963
00:49:46.541 --> 00:49:48.040
<v Speaker 1>with higher levels of orderliness.</v>

964
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that's obvious,</v>

965
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:50.494
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While obviously orderliness is </v>

966
00:49:51.761 --> 00:49:54.820
<v Speaker 1>associated with preference for order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the issue.</v>

967
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.390
<v Speaker 1>The issue is whether or not you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure it right?</v>

968
00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these things seem self evident,</v>

969
00:50:01.181 --> 00:50:04.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's taken a very long time to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the instruments that allow them to be</v>

970
00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:05.344
<v Speaker 1>measured in such a way that you can also</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to look at the correlates and the </v>

971
00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:12.730
<v Speaker 1>underlying psychophysiology so it's by </v>
<v Speaker 1>no means obvious</v>

972
00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.693
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of orderliness and aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>of conscientiousness and politeness and </v>

973
00:50:18.971 --> 00:50:22.600
<v Speaker 1>aspect of agreeableness as well as lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of openness and intellect.</v>

974
00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:23.943
<v Speaker 1>In contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences for egalitarianism are </v>

975
00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:29.150
<v Speaker 1>uniquely associated with compassion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of agreeableness,</v>

976
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.433
<v Speaker 1>so and that's exactly what we found when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were looking at political </v>

977
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:34.004
<v Speaker 1>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is primarily predicted not by </v>

978
00:50:35.301 --> 00:50:38.060
<v Speaker 1>openness or by conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by agreeableness.</v>

979
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:39.643
<v Speaker 1>Political conservatism can therefore be </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of as a social immune system </v>

980
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:47.990
<v Speaker 1>reflecting the extension of pathogen </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoidance mechanisms to the integrity of</v>

981
00:50:47.991 --> 00:50:48.890
<v Speaker 1>the social system.</v>

982
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Borders boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

983
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:54.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the orderly person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll keep borders between concepts.</v>

984
00:50:54.081 --> 00:50:57.290
<v Speaker 1>We'll keep borders between people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll keep borders between towns.</v>

985
00:50:57.291 --> 00:51:01.190
<v Speaker 1>We'll keep borders between political </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and religions and states.</v>

986
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:02.203
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't want that terrible </v>

987
00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 1>things flooding in from everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the liberal will say,</v>

988
00:51:07.071 --> 00:51:07.904
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the things flooding in from </v>

989
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:12.470
<v Speaker 1>everywhere aren't terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have great utility and that's true,</v>

990
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:13.423
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is they're both true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both true at the same time </v>

991
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:19.610
<v Speaker 1>because well and will document that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we move forward.</v>

992
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:20.870
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

993
00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:23.900
<v Speaker 1>how do you know when things should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more open and when things should be more</v>

994
00:51:23.901 --> 00:51:26.000
<v Speaker 1>closed and the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

995
00:51:26.001 --> 00:51:26.834
<v Speaker 1>you better have a chat with everyone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what they think because it's a </v>

996
00:51:29.481 --> 00:51:30.314
<v Speaker 1>balance of probabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of determining at a </v>

997
00:51:32.301 --> 00:51:33.134
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a balance of probabilities and so </v>

998
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:35.444
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a discussion to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine how wide the gates should be </v>

999
00:51:38.841 --> 00:51:40.850
<v Speaker 1>open and how narrow they should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>closed,</v>

1000
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:41.803
<v Speaker 1>and that's also going to depend on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances and the situation so </v>

1001
00:51:44.451 --> 00:51:45.284
<v Speaker 1>there's no way of the faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing that's so terrible </v>

1002
00:51:47.091 --> 00:51:50.150
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of determining a priority</v>

1003
00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:51.440
<v Speaker 1>who's positioning is correct.</v>

1004
00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Just as the behavioral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1005
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.963
<v Speaker 1>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social immune system would help to </v>

1006
00:51:57.201 --> 00:52:00.890
<v Speaker 1>maintain order by suppressing any </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions or individuals that deviate from</v>

1007
00:52:00.891 --> 00:52:04.340
<v Speaker 1>a group's accepted social traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been reported,</v>

1008
00:52:04.341 --> 00:52:05.174
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that regions with higher levels of </v>

1009
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:07.664
<v Speaker 1>disease prevalence tend to be associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with higher levels of social conformity </v>

1010
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and autocratic rule.</v>

1011
00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.393
<v Speaker 1>Individuals who feel more vulnerable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease likely likewise report higher </v>

1012
00:52:17.731 --> 00:52:20.070
<v Speaker 1>levels of ethnocentrism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia,</v>

1013
00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:21.383
<v Speaker 1>such basic concerns about pathogen </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoidance may thus contribute to the </v>

1014
00:52:23.941 --> 00:52:27.420
<v Speaker 1>desire for order and tradition among </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives along with the harsh moral</v>

1015
00:52:27.421 --> 00:52:30.330
<v Speaker 1>judgements associated with violations of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social order.</v>

1016
00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:33.480
<v Speaker 1>How do you purify something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about with fire?</v>

1017
00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:34.883
<v Speaker 1>That's something to keep in mind as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>move towards the more political </v>

1018
00:52:36.931 --> 00:52:41.220
<v Speaker 1>expressions of this and the thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's disgusting is you don't</v>

1019
00:52:41.221 --> 00:52:43.560
<v Speaker 1>isolate it exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You destroy it,</v>

1020
00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:44.483
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing you do with rats and </v>

1021
00:52:46.441 --> 00:52:47.640
<v Speaker 1>insects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1022
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:50.710
<v Speaker 1>is destroy them right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that with poison.</v>

1023
00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:51.563
<v Speaker 1>You do it with fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it by cleaning things up and you </v>

1024
00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:54.504
<v Speaker 1>do that because while the rats will eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>all your crops and the insects carry </v>

1025
00:52:56.971 --> 00:53:00.000
<v Speaker 1>disease and all of that so it or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infest your food,</v>

1026
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.140
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know what proportion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>today's food production is eaten by rats</v>

1027
00:53:04.141 --> 00:53:06.170
<v Speaker 1>and insects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a huge proportion still</v>

1028
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.540
<v Speaker 1>according to the parasite stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis,</v>

1029
00:53:12.541 --> 00:53:13.374
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governments are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to emerge in regions </v>

1030
00:53:16.561 --> 00:53:19.710
<v Speaker 1>characterized by a high prevalence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease causing pathogens.</v>

1031
00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:20.693
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell would have ever guessed </v>

1032
00:53:21.361 --> 00:53:21.811
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1033
00:53:21.811 --> 00:53:22.644
<v Speaker 1>this is where you see the real utility </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a genuine social because it's by no </v>

1034
00:53:26.281 --> 00:53:27.114
<v Speaker 1>means self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This hypothesis and this paper that I'm </v>

1035
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:32.610
<v Speaker 1>going to discuss with you right now just</v>
<v Speaker 1>blew me away when I read it.</v>

1036
00:53:32.611 --> 00:53:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I thought it should have been front page</v>
<v Speaker 1>news across the world,</v>

1037
00:53:35.311 --> 00:53:37.740
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't really track that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

1038
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Recent cross national evidence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent with this hypothesis,</v>

1039
00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:44.640
<v Speaker 1>but there are inferential limitations </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with that evidence.</v>

1040
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:45.703
<v Speaker 1>We report to studies that address some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the limitations and provide further </v>

1041
00:53:48.331 --> 00:53:49.164
<v Speaker 1>tests of the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Study one revealed that parasite </v>

1042
00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:54.173
<v Speaker 1>prevalence strongly predicted cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>national differences on measures </v>

1043
00:53:57.451 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 1>assessing individual's authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>

1044
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Speaker 1>so that's very interesting.</v>

1045
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:07.100
<v Speaker 1>So the more parasitic and transmissible </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases in a particular locale,</v>

1046
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:09.443
<v Speaker 1>the higher the probability that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>when measured at the individual level </v>

1047
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:15.120
<v Speaker 1>held authoritarian attitudes because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

1048
00:54:15.121 --> 00:54:15.954
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's parasite prevalence that </v>

1049
00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:17.934
<v Speaker 1>produces a repressive government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really affect people at </v>

1050
00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:23.130
<v Speaker 1>the level of personality and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>what was found in the studies.</v>

1051
00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:27.000
<v Speaker 1>It was reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parasite prevalence slash infectious</v>

1052
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:27.834
<v Speaker 1>diseases made people more authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was what was driving the more </v>

1053
00:54:30.961 --> 00:54:33.450
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's something cool.</v>

1054
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Who knows about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1055
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:37.920
<v Speaker 1>So how do you fight authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments across the world?</v>

1056
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.850
<v Speaker 1>You get rid of infectious disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be it,</v>

1057
00:54:41.851 --> 00:54:43.890
<v Speaker 1>that could be the key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in there,</v>

1058
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:46.170
<v Speaker 1>and again not that is by no means is </v>
<v Speaker 1>self evident.</v>

1059
00:54:46.171 --> 00:54:47.004
<v Speaker 1>Hypothesis study one that revealed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>parasite prevalence strongly predicted </v>

1060
00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:52.554
<v Speaker 1>cross national differences on measures </v>
<v Speaker 1>assessing individual's authoritarian </v>

1061
00:54:55.171 --> 00:54:56.004
<v Speaker 1>personalities and this effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically mediated the relationship </v>

1062
00:54:58.681 --> 00:55:02.040
<v Speaker 1>between parasite prevalence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governance parasites,</v>

1063
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:04.230
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian state.</v>

1064
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:05.093
<v Speaker 1>That's the causal pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mediation result is inconsistent </v>

1065
00:55:07.921 --> 00:55:08.754
<v Speaker 1>with alternative explanations for </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous findings to address further </v>

1066
00:55:11.161 --> 00:55:11.994
<v Speaker 1>limitations associated with cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>national comparison study to tested the </v>

1067
00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:19.770
<v Speaker 1>parasite stress hypothesis on a sample </v>
<v Speaker 1>of traditional small scale societies,</v>

1068
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.023
<v Speaker 1>results revealed that parasite </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevalence predicted measures of </v>

1069
00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:29.070
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governance and did so even</v>
<v Speaker 1>when statistically controlling for other</v>

1070
00:55:29.071 --> 00:55:29.904
<v Speaker 1>threats to human welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What additional threat famine also </v>

1071
00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:33.624
<v Speaker 1>uniquely predicted authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Together these results further </v>

1072
00:55:36.511 --> 00:55:37.344
<v Speaker 1>substantiate the parasite stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis of authoritarianism and </v>

1073
00:55:40.651 --> 00:55:41.484
<v Speaker 1>suggested societal differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governance result in part </v>

1074
00:55:44.671 --> 00:55:45.504
<v Speaker 1>from cultural differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual's authoritarian </v>

1075
00:55:47.521 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the effect sizes,</v>

1076
00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:52.740
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're mind boggling.</v>

1077
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.680
<v Speaker 1>So first that's authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments one,</v>

1078
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.350
<v Speaker 1>pathogen prevalence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correlation is point four,</v>

1079
00:55:58.351 --> 00:56:00.840
<v Speaker 1>two</v>
<v Speaker 1>point four,</v>

1080
00:56:00.841 --> 00:56:01.920
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1081
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.260
<v Speaker 1>There's malnutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's warfare,</v>

1082
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:06.360
<v Speaker 1>it's actually negatively correlated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare.</v>

1083
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Famine point two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>

1084
00:56:07.891 --> 00:56:08.724
<v Speaker 1>So if you square that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about eight percent of the </v>

1085
00:56:09.751 --> 00:56:10.350
<v Speaker 1>variance.</v>

1086
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:15.350
<v Speaker 1>That's about 16 percent of the variance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are walloping effect sizes,</v>

1087
00:56:16.861 --> 00:56:18.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That effect size is about.</v>

1088
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.153
<v Speaker 1>So that 16 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the typical effect size for a </v>

1089
00:56:21.931 --> 00:56:22.764
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>variables about point two to point </v>

1090
00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:25.510
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say point two five.</v>

1091
00:56:25.511 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's about seven percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variance,</v>

1092
00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:28.773
<v Speaker 1>that 16 to 17 percent of the variance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You almost never see a correlation of </v>

1093
00:56:32.381 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 1>that size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1094
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.313
<v Speaker 1>it's an absolutely remarkable piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and it has all sorts of terrifying </v>

1095
00:56:40.151 --> 00:56:41.920
<v Speaker 1>implications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

1096
00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 1>now why would you have such a powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune system?</v>

1097
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Behavioral Immune System,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust system.</v>

1098
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at some little known facts</v>

1099
00:56:50.051 --> 00:56:50.884
<v Speaker 1>about the history of North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you guys know </v>

1100
00:56:53.021 --> 00:56:54.700
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth knowing.</v>

1101
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was the pre Colombian population</v>

1102
00:56:57.581 --> 00:56:58.414
<v Speaker 1>of the Americas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is we don't really have any </v>

1103
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:00.610
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1104
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:01.443
<v Speaker 1>The estimates vary from 10 million to </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100 million with an emerging consensus </v>

1105
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:06.280
<v Speaker 1>of 50 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1106
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:07.180
<v Speaker 1>it's halfway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1107
00:57:07.181 --> 00:57:08.014
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could be out by one order of </v>

1108
00:57:09.011 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 1>magnitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a fair number of people.</v>

1109
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:13.120
<v Speaker 1>So what happened to all the native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans?</v>

1110
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:14.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>

1111
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:16.390
<v Speaker 1>They all died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1112
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:17.493
<v Speaker 1>Because when the Spaniards came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see there was no diseases in the new </v>

1113
00:57:20.321 --> 00:57:21.154
<v Speaker 1>world except for maybe syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some evidence that syphilis was </v>

1114
00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:24.544
<v Speaker 1>trends mended back to Europe as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of contact with North </v>

1115
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.860
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>north and South America,</v>

1116
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.560
<v Speaker 1>but there are almost no diseases in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1117
00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:33.820
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Americas,</v>

1118
00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:34.803
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because there were no </v>
<v Speaker 1>big cities and also because even where </v>

1119
00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:42.160
<v Speaker 1>there weren't compared to Europe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also because where there were big cities</v>

1120
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.500
<v Speaker 1>in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people live close with animals and there</v>

1121
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:45.334
<v Speaker 1>was lots of movement of disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathogens back and forth between the </v>

1122
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:48.820
<v Speaker 1>animals and the human beings.</v>

1123
00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.460
<v Speaker 1>And so lots of Europeans died as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

1124
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:52.833
<v Speaker 1>Huge numbers of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially from diseases say like </v>

1125
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:56.770
<v Speaker 1>smallpox or or measles or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

1126
00:57:57.010 --> 00:58:00.940
<v Speaker 1>But the Europeans built up a whopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>immunity to all these diseases including</v>

1127
00:58:00.941 --> 00:58:01.774
<v Speaker 1>influenza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they came to the Americas with </v>

1128
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.960
<v Speaker 1>their diseases and bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it killed all of the native Americans if</v>

1129
00:58:06.961 --> 00:58:09.520
<v Speaker 1>figured 90 percent of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's some of the statistics.</v>

1130
00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.010
<v Speaker 1>What are the diseases that wiped them </v>
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

1131
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Influenza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bluebonnet plagues,</v>

1132
00:58:14.261 --> 00:58:15.250
<v Speaker 1>smallpox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Measles.</v>

1133
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Chicken pox was deadly to the native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

1134
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So from 1492 to 1650,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a death toll of 90 percent.</v>

1135
00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:26.493
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the puritans landed in the US at </v>

1136
00:58:28.751 --> 00:58:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Plymouth Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a long time after the Spaniards</v>

1137
00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:32.440
<v Speaker 1>had landed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1138
00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 1>in the more southern areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indians,</v>

1139
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:35.674
<v Speaker 1>the native Americans there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were desperate to see them because </v>

1140
00:58:37.901 --> 00:58:39.910
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have enough people to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>off their crops.</v>

1141
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have enough people left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine nine out of 10 people died.</v>

1142
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.540
<v Speaker 1>That's everyone right that you're done </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that point.</v>

1143
00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:47.953
<v Speaker 1>So there were 20 to 25 to 30 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in Mexico before the arrival of </v>

1144
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Cortez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty years later there were 3 million.</v>

1145
00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:56.663
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the aboriginal population in Canada </v>

1146
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.910
<v Speaker 1>estimates this is accepted by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian government.</v>

1147
00:59:00.911 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 1>No one really knows and the estimates do</v>
<v Speaker 1>vary substantially.</v>

1148
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.690
<v Speaker 1>There might have been 500,000 people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada in 1450,</v>

1149
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:11.350
<v Speaker 1>and that decreased by 80 percent after </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with the Europeans.</v>

1150
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.780
<v Speaker 1>There's the population collapse in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>

1151
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Sixteenth Century population collapse in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>

1152
00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.140
<v Speaker 1>So the 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 and 15,</v>

1153
00:59:20.141 --> 00:59:20.974
<v Speaker 1>76 appeared to have been hemorrhagic </v>
<v Speaker 1>fevers caused by an indigenous viral </v>

1154
00:59:24.771 --> 00:59:28.100
<v Speaker 1>agent and aggravated by unusual climatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>

1155
00:59:28.101 --> 00:59:31.970
<v Speaker 1>The Mexican population did not recover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recover to pre Hispanic levels until the</v>

1156
00:59:31.971 --> 00:59:36.110
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely catastrophic consequences.</v>

1157
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:38.690
<v Speaker 1>So then you look at that and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1158
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:39.763
<v Speaker 1>is it really all that surprising that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have evolved extraordinarily </v>

1159
00:59:42.441 --> 00:59:45.710
<v Speaker 1>powerful immune systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust responses,</v>

1160
00:59:45.711 --> 00:59:47.150
<v Speaker 1>and behavioral immune systems.</v>

1161
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is no joke.</v>

1162
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.393
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I want to talk to you a little </v>

1163
00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:57.740
<v Speaker 1>bit about Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I was sorting some of this stuff</v>

1164
00:59:57.741 --> 00:59:58.574
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to look at this disgust </v>

1165
01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:01.364
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity literature and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding finally that it was </v>

1166
01:00:03.741 --> 01:00:04.574
<v Speaker 1>associated with orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness is associated with </v>

1167
01:00:06.681 --> 01:00:07.514
<v Speaker 1>conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was also reading a book by Adolf </v>

1168
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was called Hitler's table talk.</v>

1169
01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:12.883
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting book and Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 1>had secretaries at his dinner tables </v>

1170
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:18.283
<v Speaker 1>from 1939 to 1942 and they basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>took shorthand notes of what he said </v>

1171
01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:22.724
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a book that you can buy </v>

1172
01:00:24.051 --> 01:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>called Hitler's table talk that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1173
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:27.133
<v Speaker 1>that is nothing but a presentation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his spontaneous utterances across that </v>

1174
01:00:30.741 --> 01:00:31.574
<v Speaker 1>time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1175
01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was a very strange person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very high in openness,</v>

1176
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:38.000
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also extremely high in orderliness.</v>

1177
01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:40.820
<v Speaker 1>At least that's what you can infer from </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading the historical data,</v>

1178
01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>so he bathed four times a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

1179
01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>He was also a great admirer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>willpower,</v>

1180
01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:46.184
<v Speaker 1>so which is something that's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with conscientiousness and </v>

1181
01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.273
<v Speaker 1>orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very proud of his ability to </v>

1182
01:00:50.901 --> 01:00:51.734
<v Speaker 1>stand like this for eight hours in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of a car and his ability to </v>

1183
01:00:54.231 --> 01:00:55.520
<v Speaker 1>withstand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1184
01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>what would you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying circumstances by willpower alone.</v>

1185
01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:00.283
<v Speaker 1>One of the most famous film </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries that was made in the Nazi </v>

1186
01:01:02.391 --> 01:01:04.610
<v Speaker 1>era was called triumph of the will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1187
01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Triumph of willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was by Leni Riefenstahl.</v>

1188
01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look at that on youtube.</v>

1189
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrifying film,</v>

1190
01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>but a very interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1191
01:01:15.261 --> 01:01:16.930
<v Speaker 1>if you're wondering about orderliness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mean,</v>

1192
01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.030
<v Speaker 1>take a look at that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's Nuremberg,</v>

1193
01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:20.864
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the biggest rally grounds ever </v>

1194
01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:22.544
<v Speaker 1>made in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuremberg and Hitler was unbelievably </v>

1195
01:01:24.591 --> 01:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>good at spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at how absolutely perfectly ordered</v>

1196
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:28.343
<v Speaker 1>daddy's.</v>

1197
01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're several hundred thousand because</v>

1198
01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:33.650
<v Speaker 1>they could all fit on the parade ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>

1199
01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>All in absolutely perfect formation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orderliness gone out of control.</v>

1200
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:44.350
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because people think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Nazi-ism Nazi as a method descends</v>

1201
01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.560
<v Speaker 1>into barbarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1202
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>But what it looks like is a disease of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

1203
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:51.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness predicts,</v>

1204
01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>be predict success in complex industrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies,</v>

1205
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:55.783
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone out of control on the orderly end </v>

1206
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.230
<v Speaker 1>of things and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1207
01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:01.093
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the twenties,</v>

1208
01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.213
<v Speaker 1>the World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was plenty chaotic and there was a </v>

1209
01:02:04.311 --> 01:02:07.520
<v Speaker 1>huge famine after World War One right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

1210
01:02:07.521 --> 01:02:12.521
<v Speaker 1>Influenza killed more people than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war did and he'd actually mutated in the</v>

1211
01:02:13.011 --> 01:02:13.844
<v Speaker 1>trenches because if people are packed </v>
<v Speaker 1>close together than viruses or other </v>

1212
01:02:17.241 --> 01:02:18.074
<v Speaker 1>pathogens can be very deadly because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to live very long to give it </v>

1213
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:22.660
<v Speaker 1>to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people are dispersed,</v>

1214
01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:23.523
<v Speaker 1>then the virus or the bacteria can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>afford to kill you as fast because then </v>

1215
01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>it dies too.</v>

1216
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:28.703
<v Speaker 1>And so if you pack people together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can breed unbelievably variant </v>

1217
01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>forms of pathogens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious pathogens.</v>

1218
01:02:33.241 --> 01:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened in World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

1219
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Packed all the men together in </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsanitary conditions,</v>

1220
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.341
<v Speaker 1>poof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up came,</v>

1221
01:02:38.341 --> 01:02:39.174
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenza went all around the world </v>

1222
01:02:40.531 --> 01:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>after World War One and killed more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people than the war.</v>

1223
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>So after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after World War One,</v>

1224
01:02:46.351 --> 01:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany descended into utter chaos.</v>

1225
01:02:49.921 --> 01:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens when you descend </v>
<v Speaker 1>into chaos?</v>

1226
01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>corresponding call for order.</v>

1227
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.063
<v Speaker 1>And that was answered by the that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>answered by Hitler and the National </v>

1228
01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Socialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Hitler was very good at listening to</v>

1229
01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:02.274
<v Speaker 1>the German population and what they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding in a period of chaos was </v>

1230
01:03:05.821 --> 01:03:06.654
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was exactly what he decided </v>

1231
01:03:08.431 --> 01:03:09.264
<v Speaker 1>to provide spectacles of order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you'd expect from </v>

1232
01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:15.210
<v Speaker 1>someone who is really high in openness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and high in orderliness.</v>

1233
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Spectacles of order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Hitler was also extremely interested</v>

1234
01:03:19.261 --> 01:03:20.094
<v Speaker 1>in art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he categorized art into like proper </v>

1235
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.083
<v Speaker 1>hygienic art and improper chaotic art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he often would have art exhibits at </v>

1236
01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:33.600
<v Speaker 1>the same time have the approved art that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he approved of.</v>

1237
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.270
<v Speaker 1>So those were in the official museums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1238
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.313
<v Speaker 1>and then there would be a corresponding </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibit of degenerate art and that that </v>

1239
01:03:41.321 --> 01:03:44.040
<v Speaker 1>was art that was associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements like expression isn't,</v>

1240
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:44.874
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has garish colors and it's very </v>

1241
01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:47.304
<v Speaker 1>emotionally expressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler sort of preferred Kinda </v>

1242
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:53.910
<v Speaker 1>eroticized Greco Roman representations </v>
<v Speaker 1>of heroic people.</v>

1243
01:03:53.911 --> 01:03:54.744
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the Nazi aesthetic ascent </v>

1244
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.633
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are some more examples of </v>

1245
01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:00.211
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1246
01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything,</v>

1247
01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:03.210
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geometric,</v>

1248
01:04:03.211 --> 01:04:05.640
<v Speaker 1>everything regular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The borders completely well defined.</v>

1249
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Everything here is squares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's lined up perfectly.</v>

1250
01:04:08.551 --> 01:04:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Everything is uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1251
01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Look at there's pathways between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rows of people.</v>

1252
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.940
<v Speaker 1>This is again at Nuremberg,</v>

1253
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:21.470
<v Speaker 1>perfect order along with his plans for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world capital Germania,</v>

1254
01:04:21.471 --> 01:04:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Elbert spear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the Nazi architect,</v>

1255
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:26.450
<v Speaker 1>made the plans for the world's largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>stadium,</v>

1256
01:04:26.451 --> 01:04:28.250
<v Speaker 1>which was to be located on the Nuremberg</v>
<v Speaker 1>rally.</v>

1257
01:04:28.251 --> 01:04:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Grounds derived from the pen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic stadium of Athens.</v>

1258
01:04:31.161 --> 01:04:31.994
<v Speaker 1>It would have offered 400,000 seats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good to get the shape of a horse </v>

1259
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:38.120
<v Speaker 1>shoe planned dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>800 meters wide,</v>

1260
01:04:38.121 --> 01:04:38.954
<v Speaker 1>450 meters high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 meters with a building area of </v>

1261
01:04:41.451 --> 01:04:42.284
<v Speaker 1>350,000 square meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The laying of the foundation stone was </v>

1262
01:04:45.141 --> 01:04:46.970
<v Speaker 1>on ninth of July,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1937.</v>

1263
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:51.590
<v Speaker 1>It was to be finished for the party </v>
<v Speaker 1>congress of 1945 in 38.</v>

1264
01:04:51.591 --> 01:04:53.480
<v Speaker 1>The construction began with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>excavation.</v>

1265
01:04:53.481 --> 01:04:55.640
<v Speaker 1>It was stopped in 39,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but during the whole war,</v>

1266
01:04:55.641 --> 01:04:59.270
<v Speaker 1>the casting pitt had to be kept dry for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentoring groundwater after the war,</v>

1267
01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:00.104
<v Speaker 1>the northern half of the pit filled up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with water and is today called silver </v>

1268
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.823
<v Speaker 1>silver lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The southern half was used to deposit </v>

1269
01:05:05.811 --> 01:05:08.390
<v Speaker 1>the debris of the destroyed downtown </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuremberg.</v>

1270
01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:12.443
<v Speaker 1>That's Nuremberg at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what Hitler did because he was very </v>

1271
01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>good at using fire and as display as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1272
01:05:18.341 --> 01:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>So those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that curtain there.</v>

1273
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:22.263
<v Speaker 1>So you see there's the Nuremberg </v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings that we saw in the last </v>

1274
01:05:24.611 --> 01:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>photograph that those are the search </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights from the from the Nazi air force.</v>

1275
01:05:28.481 --> 01:05:29.314
<v Speaker 1>So they had the parade all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the grounds there and pointed </v>

1276
01:05:32.801 --> 01:05:33.634
<v Speaker 1>straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that night time rallies were </v>

1277
01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>illuminated by a cube of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very effective.</v>

1278
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Display?</v>

1279
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.233
<v Speaker 1>Artistic display of orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's where things get seriously </v>

1280
01:05:47.231 --> 01:05:48.760
<v Speaker 1>ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a.</v>

1281
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:52.330
<v Speaker 1>This is a pamphlet from I think 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1282
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.313
<v Speaker 1>1944.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pamphlet is called a Jew as </v>

1283
01:05:57.341 --> 01:06:00.250
<v Speaker 1>world parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is something I found on the net.</v>

1284
01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll share it with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very rare,</v>

1285
01:06:01.841 --> 01:06:02.830
<v Speaker 1>original,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late 19,</v>

1286
01:06:02.831 --> 01:06:05.170
<v Speaker 1>44,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti Jewish Third Reich pamphlet.</v>

1287
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:08.380
<v Speaker 1>This very scare six by eight and three </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters.</v>

1288
01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:09.214
<v Speaker 1>20 page soft cover booklet by MRI for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erik Schwartzberg was published 1944 in </v>

1289
01:06:14.081 --> 01:06:14.914
<v Speaker 1>Frankfurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was published at a time when a great </v>

1290
01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:16.834
<v Speaker 1>percentage of the European Jews had </v>
<v Speaker 1>already been deported to concentration </v>

1291
01:06:19.091 --> 01:06:19.924
<v Speaker 1>camps in the east perhaps to justify </v>
<v Speaker 1>what had happened to the Jews since the </v>

1292
01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:23.584
<v Speaker 1>Nazi seizure of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The authors compared the Jews with </v>

1293
01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:26.374
<v Speaker 1>parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most unpleasant forms of life on </v>

1294
01:06:28.511 --> 01:06:30.160
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it is only natural,</v>

1295
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:31.023
<v Speaker 1>unjustified against them to free </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity of them for the sake of </v>

1296
01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:34.450
<v Speaker 1>survival of mankind.</v>

1297
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.433
<v Speaker 1>This is from the pamphlet the people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world will recognize the Jew as </v>

1298
01:06:40.991 --> 01:06:42.880
<v Speaker 1>world parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there will be a time when there will</v>

1299
01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:46.030
<v Speaker 1>be one united front of all people </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the Jewish world parasite,</v>

1300
01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:46.893
<v Speaker 1>the pamphlet ends and humanity will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>freed from the most severe illness from </v>

1301
01:06:50.081 --> 01:06:51.610
<v Speaker 1>which he suffered from thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1302
01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Here's what happened in Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

1303
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:55.690
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Hitler came to power,</v>

1304
01:06:55.870 --> 01:07:00.870
<v Speaker 1>he was very interested in public health </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns and so he said he formulated a</v>

1305
01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:01.984
<v Speaker 1>number of policies including formulating</v>
<v Speaker 1>these vans that went around screening </v>

1306
01:07:06.311 --> 01:07:09.130
<v Speaker 1>people for tuberculosis at the same time</v>
<v Speaker 1>be announced,</v>

1307
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.890
<v Speaker 1>announced a policy to beautify and </v>
<v Speaker 1>purify Germany.</v>

1308
01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:12.963
<v Speaker 1>And so he encouraged the factory owners </v>
<v Speaker 1>to clean up the factories to get rid of </v>

1309
01:07:16.451 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 1>the rats and the insects and to plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>flowers and so forth in front.</v>

1310
01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was cleanliness and beauty.</v>

1311
01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.203
<v Speaker 1>They used Zyklon b as the agent for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for disinfecting the factories as icon </v>

1312
01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:28.024
<v Speaker 1>be cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And B was the gas that was used in the </v>

1313
01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:30.514
<v Speaker 1>gas chambers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hitler started out by getting rid of </v>

1314
01:07:32.321 --> 01:07:35.440
<v Speaker 1>the rats and the parasites and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>insects in Germany,</v>

1315
01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.453
<v Speaker 1>along with this public health campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he moved into the insane </v>

1316
01:07:38.711 --> 01:07:40.780
<v Speaker 1>asylums and started a euthanasia </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign,</v>

1317
01:07:40.781 --> 01:07:41.614
<v Speaker 1>and then he moved outside into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader political sphere and started to </v>

1318
01:07:43.871 --> 01:07:47.230
<v Speaker 1>target the people that he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider pure as parasites,</v>

1319
01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:48.243
<v Speaker 1>capitalizing on the behavioral immune </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and people's intrinsic sense of </v>

1320
01:07:51.491 --> 01:07:53.410
<v Speaker 1>disgust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to show you some of the</v>

1321
01:07:53.411 --> 01:07:56.650
<v Speaker 1>propaganda that did that so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how this sort of thing works.</v>

1322
01:07:57.850 --> 01:08:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is from Richard Koenigsberg,</v>

1323
01:08:01.601 --> 01:08:02.434
<v Speaker 1>who wrote a book called Hitler's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology embodied metaphor fantasy in </v>

1324
01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:06.910
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've already.</v>

1325
01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.130
<v Speaker 1>We've already sort of discussed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1326
01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:13.000
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of an archetypal idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grounded in biology.</v>

1327
01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:13.834
<v Speaker 1>You know that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're running in some on this </v>

1328
01:08:15.501 --> 01:08:16.334
<v Speaker 1>underlying biological platform of deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted hypothalamic systems and </v>

1329
01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.193
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] systems and so forth that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and that you're a collection of </v>

1330
01:08:24.141 --> 01:08:24.974
<v Speaker 1>those underlying systems organized at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some higher order level while those </v>

1331
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.160
<v Speaker 1>underlying systems manifest themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fantasy.</v>

1332
01:08:31.161 --> 01:08:33.140
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're hungry,</v>

1333
01:08:33.141 --> 01:08:33.974
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a fantasy about </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get something to eat and if </v>

1334
01:08:35.601 --> 01:08:36.434
<v Speaker 1>you're lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a fantasy about </v>

1335
01:08:37.251 --> 01:08:39.350
<v Speaker 1>someone that you'd like to be with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so forth,</v>

1336
01:08:39.351 --> 01:08:40.184
<v Speaker 1>because the fantasy is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner in which these underlying </v>

1337
01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:45.380
<v Speaker 1>biological motivation systems think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1338
01:08:45.381 --> 01:08:46.214
<v Speaker 1>so what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you think and talk if you're </v>

1339
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.630
<v Speaker 1>possessed by disgust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1340
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 1>The state did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

1341
01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:55.670
<v Speaker 1>This is from Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler's utterances.</v>

1342
01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.880
<v Speaker 1>The state did not possess the power to </v>
<v Speaker 1>master the disease.</v>

1343
01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:01.460
<v Speaker 1>The menacing decay of the Reich was </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest.</v>

1344
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.533
<v Speaker 1>The masses feel that the mere fact of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jews existence is as bad as the </v>

1345
01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:06.164
<v Speaker 1>plague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politicians tinkering around on the </v>

1346
01:09:08.151 --> 01:09:08.984
<v Speaker 1>German national body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so most of the forms of our general </v>

1347
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:12.614
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but blindly ignored the virus at the </v>

1348
01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:16.184
<v Speaker 1>time of the unification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inner decay was already in full </v>

1349
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:22.100
<v Speaker 1>swing and the general situation was </v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorating from year to year.</v>

1350
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.680
<v Speaker 1>The Nation did not grow inwardly </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthier,</v>

1351
01:09:24.681 --> 01:09:27.920
<v Speaker 1>but obviously languished more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all disease metaphor.</v>

1352
01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:28.754
<v Speaker 1>It's all disease metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The symptoms of decay of the prewar </v>

1353
01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:36.191
<v Speaker 1>period can be reduced to racial causes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who wants to cure this era,</v>

1354
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:37.783
<v Speaker 1>which is inwardly sick and rotten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must first of all summoned up the </v>

1355
01:09:40.101 --> 01:09:42.500
<v Speaker 1>courage to make clear the causes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

1356
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:45.740
<v Speaker 1>They think that they must demonstrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are ready for appeasement,</v>

1357
01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:50.270
<v Speaker 1>so as to stay the deadly cancerous ulcer</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a potter policy of moderation.</v>

1358
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:53.210
<v Speaker 1>The Jew must take care of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plague does not die.</v>

1359
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:54.703
<v Speaker 1>If this battle should not come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany would decay and it best would </v>

1360
01:09:57.021 --> 01:09:57.854
<v Speaker 1>sync to ruin like a rotting corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see in the right today an </v>

1361
01:10:00.591 --> 01:10:01.424
<v Speaker 1>example of mortal decay that is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech of someone who's possessed by </v>

1362
01:10:06.111 --> 01:10:06.944
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the speech of someone who's </v>

1363
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:12.590
<v Speaker 1>possessed by disgust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are not the same thing.</v>

1364
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.900
<v Speaker 1>The first of May can only be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberation of the nation spirit from the</v>

1365
01:10:17.901 --> 01:10:18.734
<v Speaker 1>infection of internationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the restoration to health of people's </v>

1366
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.340
<v Speaker 1>against the infection of materialism </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the Jewish pestilence.</v>

1367
01:10:25.341 --> 01:10:28.040
<v Speaker 1>We must hold a loft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a flaming ideal,</v>

1368
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.963
<v Speaker 1>another purification metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The restoration to health of our people </v>

1369
01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:34.900
<v Speaker 1>must start from the restoration to </v>
<v Speaker 1>health of the body politics.</v>

1370
01:10:34.901 --> 01:10:39.901
<v Speaker 1>So that was Hitler's essential metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the nation was a body,</v>

1371
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:42.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a pure body,</v>

1372
01:10:42.741 --> 01:10:43.574
<v Speaker 1>it was a pure area in body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was being assaulted by parasites </v>

1373
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.920
<v Speaker 1>that were subjecting it to disease and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decay.</v>

1374
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:55.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental metaphor at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of his political message.</v>

1375
01:10:56.030 --> 01:11:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I gave the order to burn burned down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the raw flesh.</v>

1376
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:01.213
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ulcers have this poisoning of the </v>

1377
01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.310
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1378
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.233
<v Speaker 1>pretty rough man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the battle against a veritable </v>

1379
01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:09.764
<v Speaker 1>world sickness which threatens to infect</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people's a plague which devastates </v>

1380
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.033
<v Speaker 1>peoples and international pestilence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The international carry of the Bacillus </v>

1381
01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:20.850
<v Speaker 1>must be fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is if within this community,</v>

1382
01:11:20.851 --> 01:11:21.684
<v Speaker 1>one state is infected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that infection is decisive for all in </v>

1383
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:26.573
<v Speaker 1>European Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no common life of the nations is </v>

1384
01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:29.184
<v Speaker 1>possible when amongst their number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some who are suffering from a </v>

1385
01:11:32.311 --> 01:11:35.970
<v Speaker 1>poisonous infection and who openly </v>
<v Speaker 1>preserved profess their desire to infect</v>

1386
01:11:35.971 --> 01:11:36.804
<v Speaker 1>others with the same disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shall have a very real interest in </v>

1387
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:43.650
<v Speaker 1>seeing to it that the bolshevist plague </v>
<v Speaker 1>does not spread over Europe.</v>

1388
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:44.963
<v Speaker 1>National Socialism has made our people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore the right immune from a </v>

1389
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Bolshevik infection.</v>

1390
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll read you one more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although obviously you get the point.</v>

1391
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Table seven is called the national body </v>
<v Speaker 1>is being consumed.</v>

1392
01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:00.660
<v Speaker 1>The Jew is and remains the typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>parasite,</v>

1393
01:12:00.661 --> 01:12:03.360
<v Speaker 1>a sponger who likes to know like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>noxious bacillus,</v>

1394
01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:06.510
<v Speaker 1>keeps spreading as soon as a favorable </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium invites him.</v>

1395
01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I want to show you a brief film</v>

1396
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.580
<v Speaker 1>and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look here at at the,</v>

1397
01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.613
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Artistic and propaganda stick </v>

1398
01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.290
<v Speaker 1>transformation of the idea of order into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a politicized message.</v>

1399
01:12:22.291 --> 01:12:23.124
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that's so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Hitler's particular brand of </v>

1400
01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:28.920
<v Speaker 1>fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't precisely and it see it wasn't</v>

1401
01:12:28.921 --> 01:12:32.670
<v Speaker 1>precisely a movement that was predicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>on ideas like communism.</v>

1402
01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Communism is predicated on ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Nazis went out.</v>

1403
01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:38.430
<v Speaker 1>It was something that wasn't really in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the realm of idea.</v>

1404
01:12:38.431 --> 01:12:41.520
<v Speaker 1>It was more in the realm of embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed and the image,</v>

1405
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.430
<v Speaker 1>and so it was also very much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to fight against.</v>

1406
01:12:44.431 --> 01:12:46.770
<v Speaker 1>From the ideational perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1407
01:12:46.771 --> 01:12:49.530
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a well developed intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

1408
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:50.543
<v Speaker 1>It was an embodied movement and Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 1>was extraordinarily good at using the </v>

1409
01:12:54.271 --> 01:12:55.104
<v Speaker 1>metaphors and the images and then his </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible capacity for for propaganda </v>

1410
01:12:59.521 --> 01:13:00.354
<v Speaker 1>stick display to fire people up at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis that they weren't </v>

1411
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:06.510
<v Speaker 1>really even aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take a look at this film</v>

1412
01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:21.730
<v Speaker 2>campaign then gave us the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>really get to know the Jewish people.</v>

1413
01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Nearly 4 million Jews live here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Poland,</v>

1414
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.580
<v Speaker 2>but they won't be found among the rural </v>
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>

1415
01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:39.940
<v Speaker 2>nor have they suffered from the chaos of</v>
<v Speaker 2>war as has the native pole.</v>

1416
01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:44.550
<v Speaker 2>They set it out in differently in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gloomy streets and the Polish ghetto</v>

1417
01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:50.880
<v Speaker 2>within an hour after the German </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupation.</v>

1418
01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.073
<v Speaker 2>They were back in business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>German and his head to look at the </v>

1419
01:15:15.051 --> 01:15:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Polish ghetto 25 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This time,</v>

1420
01:15:18.351 --> 01:15:22.010
<v Speaker 2>our eyes are sharpened by our experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the last few decades.</v>

1421
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:22.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1422
01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 1914,</v>

1423
01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:29.013
<v Speaker 2>we no longer see just the most grotesque</v>
<v Speaker 2>and chemical of these questionable </v>

1424
01:15:32.951 --> 01:15:33.784
<v Speaker 2>ghetto figures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This time we recognize that there's a </v>

1425
01:15:36.251 --> 01:15:37.084
<v Speaker 2>plague here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plague that threatens the health of </v>

1426
01:15:40.121 --> 01:15:45.000
<v Speaker 2>the Aryan peoples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once said,</v>

1427
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.820
<v Speaker 2>the Jew is the demon behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption of mankind.</v>

1428
01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:56.620
<v Speaker 2>These pictures prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish home life reveals remarkable lack</v>

1429
01:16:22.631 --> 01:16:27.631
<v Speaker 2>of creative ability to civilize</v>
<v Speaker 2>in plain language.</v>

1430
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Jewish dwellings are filthy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>neglected</v>

1431
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:43.840
<v Speaker 2>bidding on it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor after decades of business,</v>

1432
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:47.590
<v Speaker 2>they've hoarded enough to acquire a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decent comfortable home,</v>

1433
01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:56.040
<v Speaker 2>but they live for generations in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same dirty and bug or written dwellings.</v>

1434
01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:05.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm troubled by their surroundings.</v>

1435
01:17:05.601 --> 01:17:09.950
<v Speaker 2>They go right on with their prayers</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on the vehicle.</v>

1436
01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:15.090
<v Speaker 4>And the rubbing motion is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ritual for reading Jewish scripture.</v>

1437
01:17:15.281 --> 01:17:20.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:28.660
<v Speaker 4>How part of Jewish so-called community </v>
<v Speaker 4>life even takes place in the street.</v>

1439
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:51.560
<v Speaker 4>The connection with trade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1440
01:17:51.561 --> 01:17:53.960
<v Speaker 4>you see what's going on in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1441
01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.450
<v Speaker 4>So what's the juxtaposition of those two</v>
<v Speaker 4>films?</v>

1442
01:17:56.451 --> 01:18:00.560
<v Speaker 4>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The juxtaposition of order versus chaos.</v>

1443
01:18:00.561 --> 01:18:04.100
<v Speaker 4>And so part of the order versus chaos </v>
<v Speaker 4>archetype obviously is,</v>

1444
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:08.120
<v Speaker 4>is rooted in the dichotomy between </v>
<v Speaker 4>disgust and purity.</v>

1445
01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.073
<v Speaker 4>It's not the only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the only access of our opposition </v>

1446
01:18:11.961 --> 01:18:12.794
<v Speaker 4>between order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then so this is all invocation of </v>

1447
01:18:16.941 --> 01:18:21.941
<v Speaker 4>archetipal chaos and it starts with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>use of the disease imagery.</v>

1448
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:28.210
<v Speaker 4>And then also the use of music composed </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a minor key and threatening and low,</v>

1449
01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:29.953
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's all juxtaposed together and </v>

1450
01:18:31.971 --> 01:18:32.804
<v Speaker 4>then they switched to trade again with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this undertone of threat and there's a </v>

1451
01:18:36.321 --> 01:18:39.270
<v Speaker 4>hand to hand exchange of goods and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>seems to me that they're,</v>

1452
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:44.600
<v Speaker 4>they're using the image to continue the </v>
<v Speaker 4>metaphor that in this situation trade is</v>

1453
01:18:44.601 --> 01:18:47.540
<v Speaker 4>associated with contamination rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>than productivity.</v>

1454
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.433
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you and you can see obviously a </v>

1455
01:18:50.991 --> 01:18:51.824
<v Speaker 4>dichotomy with regards to trade because </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're taking goods from someone </v>

1456
01:18:54.531 --> 01:18:55.460
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question is,</v>

1457
01:18:55.461 --> 01:18:57.560
<v Speaker 4>are the goods of high quality and useful</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

1458
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:58.623
<v Speaker 4>and are they useful?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they something that is going to </v>

1459
01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:00.734
<v Speaker 4>introduce a foreign element or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or an unexpected element into your </v>

1460
01:19:04.011 --> 01:19:07.840
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this film is obviously taking the</v>

1461
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:09.583
<v Speaker 4>ambivalence that's associated with trade</v>
<v Speaker 4>and placing it into the chaos order </v>

1462
01:19:14.391 --> 01:19:16.730
<v Speaker 4>archetype and then associating it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>disgust.</v>

1463
01:19:16.731 --> 01:19:19.640
<v Speaker 4>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very sneaky and it's not done.</v>

1464
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:22.940
<v Speaker 4>It's done by inference rather than </v>
<v Speaker 4>directly,</v>

1465
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:25.520
<v Speaker 4>which I think is much more powerful way </v>
<v Speaker 4>of doing this sort of thing.</v>

1466
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:52.640
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that's interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>too is that you know,</v>

1467
01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 4>you can imagine that if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're seeing people who are poor and</v>

1468
01:19:56.151 --> 01:19:59.840
<v Speaker 4>downtrodden at that might evoke two </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible sets of responses.</v>

1469
01:19:59.841 --> 01:20:03.050
<v Speaker 4>When might be a compassionate response,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be the desire to help,</v>

1470
01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:04.293
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other would be the desire to </v>

1471
01:20:05.031 --> 01:20:06.650
<v Speaker 4>distance yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1472
01:20:06.651 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 4>you feel the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

1473
01:20:08.311 --> 01:20:09.144
<v Speaker 4>if you're walking down bloor and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>find somebody who's completely wreck </v>

1474
01:20:11.651 --> 01:20:14.820
<v Speaker 4>street person lying there in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping bag in a doorway,</v>

1475
01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:15.541
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1476
01:20:15.541 --> 01:20:17.910
<v Speaker 4>what's your response going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it compassionate or is it.</v>

1477
01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.950
<v Speaker 4>Is it fear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it disgust?</v>

1478
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:20.963
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to depend on your mood and </v>

1479
01:20:22.141 --> 01:20:22.974
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna depend on the particulars of </v>

1480
01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:25.404
<v Speaker 4>the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to depend on your </v>

1481
01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.890
<v Speaker 4>temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can see that those two things,</v>

1482
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:30.143
<v Speaker 4>they're both automatically vocable </v>
<v Speaker 4>responses and it isn't self evident </v>

1483
01:20:34.051 --> 01:20:35.520
<v Speaker 4>which one is going to come to the fore.</v>

1484
01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.250
<v Speaker 4>Nor is it always self evident which one </v>
<v Speaker 4>should come to the fore.</v>

1485
01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:39.084
<v Speaker 4>Because part of the reason that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>ambivalent about a situation like that </v>

1486
01:20:41.581 --> 01:20:42.414
<v Speaker 4>is because you have no idea what would </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen even if you did choose to </v>

1487
01:20:44.911 --> 01:20:49.911
<v Speaker 4>interact and so you can't just simply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>

1488
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:51.743
<v Speaker 4>There's no simple way of solving a </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem like that and so that's why </v>

1489
01:20:54.751 --> 01:20:57.050
<v Speaker 4>there's a war of competing emotions when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in a,</v>

1490
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:58.223
<v Speaker 4>when you're in a situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you could imagine as well you could </v>

1491
01:21:00.331 --> 01:21:01.164
<v Speaker 4>have taken the same images and put them </v>
<v Speaker 4>to different music and used a different </v>

1492
01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:06.090
<v Speaker 4>overlay and it could have been a call to</v>
<v Speaker 4>compassion,</v>

1493
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:07.223
<v Speaker 4>but that's not what it is here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a call to contempt and </v>

1494
01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:10.074
<v Speaker 4>extermination</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's also another danger of I </v>

1495
01:21:15.301 --> 01:21:20.301
<v Speaker 4>suppose insisting upon the fact that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>given population is</v>

1496
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:22.103
<v Speaker 3>cool,</v>

1497
01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.113
<v Speaker 4>victimized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose that might be way of one way </v>

1498
01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:25.754
<v Speaker 4>of thinking about because there's two </v>
<v Speaker 4>different sets of categorical responses </v>

1499
01:21:29.121 --> 01:21:29.954
<v Speaker 4>to people who are at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy and one of them is </v>

1500
01:21:32.211 --> 01:21:34.340
<v Speaker 4>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the other one is more like this.</v>

1501
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.580
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessarily something that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to carelessly evoke.</v>

1502
01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:06.740
<v Speaker 2>One might want to regard these haggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Children as a sign of great poverty,</v>

1503
01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:10.653
<v Speaker 2>watch them awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes clear that they're proud to </v>

1504
01:22:14.331 --> 01:22:15.830
<v Speaker 2>act as their grownups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>

1505
01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.073
<v Speaker 2>You use young people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have the idealism that ours do </v>

1506
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:22.783
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The egoism of the individual is not in </v>

1507
01:22:25.131 --> 01:22:30.131
<v Speaker 2>the service of higher common goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

1508
01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:31.123
<v Speaker 2>Jewish morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In kras contradiction of the Aryan </v>

1509
01:22:33.651 --> 01:22:34.484
<v Speaker 2>concept of ethics proclaims the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unrestrained egoism of every Jew to be </v>

1510
01:22:38.211 --> 01:22:39.110
<v Speaker 2>divine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Law</v>

1511
01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:44.810
<v Speaker 2>is religion makes cheating and usury a </v>
<v Speaker 2>duty.</v>

1512
01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:49.330
<v Speaker 2>In the fifth book of Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1513
01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:53.650
<v Speaker 2>it has stated that a non Jew vow may </v>
<v Speaker 2>loan to upon usury,</v>

1514
01:22:53.770 --> 01:22:58.770
<v Speaker 2>but not my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Lord may bless thee in all ID lanes</v>

1515
01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:07.670
<v Speaker 2>for the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then doing business is something holy.</v>

1516
01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:11.043
<v Speaker 2>This is totally incomprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did Non Jews Aryan man attaches a sense </v>

1517
01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:21.250
<v Speaker 2>of worth to every activity he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create something worthwhile.</v>

1518
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>houses or machines.</v>

1519
01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:27.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's a contrast there.</v>

1520
01:23:27.571 --> 01:23:28.404
<v Speaker 4>They actually use a contrast there </v>
<v Speaker 4>between industrious and non industrious </v>

1521
01:23:30.991 --> 01:23:32.490
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is quite interesting.</v>

1522
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:33.660
<v Speaker 4>Works of art</v>

1523
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:34.583
<v Speaker 2>or anything else of value to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's ruled by the feeling of being </v>

1524
01:23:39.811 --> 01:23:41.770
<v Speaker 2>responsible for his achievements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1525
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:10.470
<v Speaker 2>For the Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing of value money,</v>

1526
01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.270
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets it,</v>

1527
01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:17.160
<v Speaker 2>makes no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first trade goods,</v>

1528
01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:22.850
<v Speaker 2>generally worthless trash of all sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how the little Jews start out.</v>

1529
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:29.350
<v Speaker 2>So they reached the point where they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell from a tray and before long they've</v>

1530
01:24:29.701 --> 01:24:34.701
<v Speaker 2>assembled a complete line of goods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not long after the owner,</v>

1531
01:24:38.601 --> 01:24:42.020
<v Speaker 2>regular stand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most ambitious,</v>

1532
01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.990
<v Speaker 2>soon own a small shop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a bigger shop</v>

1533
01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:57.170
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be the most cunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the most unscrupulous eventually</v>

1534
01:24:57.591 --> 01:24:58.424
<v Speaker 2>have warehouses in banks and move it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most splendid mentions in the city </v>

1535
01:25:02.061 --> 01:25:02.894
<v Speaker 2>is provided that they don't get in each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other's way as in the narrow ghettos of </v>

1536
01:25:07.461 --> 01:25:08.294
<v Speaker 2>the east.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they try to escape to witch </v>

1537
01:25:18.641 --> 01:25:20.480
<v Speaker 2>lands with rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right</v>

1538
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.830
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>

1539
01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:29.663
<v Speaker 4>So when the next part of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's another something else that's </v>

1540
01:25:32.251 --> 01:25:33.084
<v Speaker 4>done implicitly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you'll see a globe and then their </v>

1541
01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:41.210
<v Speaker 4>spread of of migration and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>underlying metaphor there is again,</v>

1542
01:25:42.811 --> 01:25:44.040
<v Speaker 4>the spread of disease</v>

1543
01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:47.650
<v Speaker 2>peoples because they need the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with which to do business</v>

1544
01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.633
<v Speaker 2>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aryan people's find the value has been </v>

1545
01:25:54.641 --> 01:25:59.641
<v Speaker 2>reduced by the Jew to the mere </v>
<v Speaker 2>merchandise he buys and sells.</v>

1546
01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:05.130
<v Speaker 2>That produces nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1547
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:10.310
<v Speaker 2>he leaves to the workers and farmers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the host nation.</v>

1548
01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.313
<v Speaker 4>It's funny there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an echo of Marxist ideology in </v>

1549
01:26:14.001 --> 01:26:14.834
<v Speaker 4>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's very interesting because what </v>

1550
01:26:16.191 --> 01:26:17.024
<v Speaker 4>they're there to get the insistence is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the Labor that goes into basic </v>

1551
01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:24.044
<v Speaker 4>production qualifies as Labor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the labor that goes into mercantile </v>

1552
01:26:26.631 --> 01:26:28.460
<v Speaker 4>activity doesn't qualify as Labor at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1553
01:26:28.461 --> 01:26:29.294
<v Speaker 4>It's not like the Nazis were pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalist by any stretch of the </v>

1554
01:26:31.191 --> 01:26:32.024
<v Speaker 4>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's this strange distinction </v>

1555
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:36.830
<v Speaker 4>drawn between like it's almost like </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical production.</v>

1556
01:26:36.831 --> 01:26:38.570
<v Speaker 4>That seems to be something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>valued.</v>

1557
01:26:38.571 --> 01:26:39.404
<v Speaker 4>It's the use of your musculature say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then as soon as it's elevated up </v>

1558
01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:43.334
<v Speaker 4>into trade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is obviously a value added </v>

1559
01:26:44.871 --> 01:26:45.900
<v Speaker 4>process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that.</v>

1560
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:46.743
<v Speaker 4>That's almost self evident,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's put forward here as something </v>

1561
01:26:48.921 --> 01:26:52.440
<v Speaker 4>that's only.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's only a parasitical that's right.</v>

1562
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 4>That and that's commonality with Marxism</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the time.</v>

1563
01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:08.010
<v Speaker 2>The Jews are people without farmers or </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers or race of parasites</v>

1564
01:27:19.450 --> 01:27:20.283
<v Speaker 2>in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wherever the body of a nation shows a </v>

1565
01:27:22.931 --> 01:27:23.764
<v Speaker 2>wound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they anchor themselves and feed on the </v>

1566
01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:27.274
<v Speaker 2>decaying organism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make business out of the sickness </v>

1567
01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:34.930
<v Speaker 2>of the nations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore endeavor to deepen and prolong</v>

1568
01:27:34.931 --> 01:27:38.680
<v Speaker 2>all conditions of sickness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it is.</v>

1569
01:27:38.681 --> 01:27:39.514
<v Speaker 2>In Poland and was in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jews had been this way throughout </v>

1570
01:27:45.251 --> 01:27:49.180
<v Speaker 2>their entire history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their faces bear the age old features of</v>

1571
01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:50.014
<v Speaker 2>the perpetual sponger eternal Jew who in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the course of time on worldwide </v>

1572
01:27:55.250 --> 01:28:00.250
<v Speaker 2>wonderings has always been the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no difference between these Jews</v>

1573
01:28:01.571 --> 01:28:02.404
<v Speaker 2>in Poland and those in Palestine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>though the two are geographically </v>

1574
01:28:06.341 --> 01:28:07.174
<v Speaker 2>separated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Palestine is the spiritual center of </v>

1575
01:28:36.371 --> 01:28:38.360
<v Speaker 2>international jewelry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1576
01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:41.080
<v Speaker 2>the Jews are numerically insignificant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're</v>

1577
01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.613
<v Speaker 2>here at the Wailing Wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gather and more in the fall of </v>

1578
01:28:46.871 --> 01:28:47.704
<v Speaker 2>Jerusalem.</v>

1579
01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.393
<v Speaker 2>Homelessness though is a matter of and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in keeping with their entire history </v>

1580
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:06.383
<v Speaker 2>4,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their Hebrew ancestors were already </v>

1581
01:29:09.061 --> 01:29:09.894
<v Speaker 2>wondering out of the land of two rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wandered along the sea to Egypt </v>

1582
01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.133
<v Speaker 2>where they ran a lucrative grain </v>
<v Speaker 2>business for awhile when the country </v>

1583
01:29:19.381 --> 01:29:22.530
<v Speaker 2>farmer is and other Egyptians rose </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the foreign use,</v>

1584
01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:23.364
<v Speaker 2>yours and speculators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wondered once more and plundered </v>

1585
01:29:26.521 --> 01:29:31.320
<v Speaker 2>their way to the promised land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They settled there mercilessly.</v>

1586
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Looting the culturally superior rightful</v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants.</v>

1587
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bigger windows here in the course of</v>

1588
01:29:38.521 --> 01:29:43.521
<v Speaker 2>centuries from the oriental far eastern </v>
<v Speaker 2>racial mixture with negroid admixture,</v>

1589
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:45.083
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate mom realized Jews developed</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign from us Europeans born of </v>

1590
01:29:49.681 --> 01:29:50.514
<v Speaker 2>totally different racial elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They differ from us in body and above </v>

1591
01:29:54.451 --> 01:29:55.284
<v Speaker 2>all in Seoul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We probably would never have been </v>

1592
01:29:58.841 --> 01:30:01.780
<v Speaker 2>bothered by them had they stayed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their oriental home</v>

1593
01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:05.253
<v Speaker 2>about the cosmopolitan empire of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexander the great reaching from the </v>

1594
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.273
<v Speaker 2>Near East across half the Mediterranean </v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially the boundless world </v>

1595
01:30:13.581 --> 01:30:17.210
<v Speaker 2>empire of the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought about the evolution of the trade</v>

1596
01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:18.044
<v Speaker 2>and migratory traits of the Jews who </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon spread across the open </v>

1597
01:30:21.411 --> 01:30:22.244
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While some of them settled in the large </v>

1598
01:30:24.891 --> 01:30:27.500
<v Speaker 2>urban traffic and trade centers of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean,</v>

1599
01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.520
<v Speaker 3>it could be up on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing</v>

1600
01:30:31.810 --> 01:30:35.110
<v Speaker 2>others wandered relentlessly on across </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spain,</v>

1601
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:36.423
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>southern Germany and England and </v>

1602
01:30:40.090 --> 01:30:44.920
<v Speaker 2>everywhere they made themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>unwelcome in Spain and France.</v>

1603
01:30:44.921 --> 01:30:45.754
<v Speaker 2>The people rose openly against them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 13th and 14th centuries and they </v>

1604
01:30:49.661 --> 01:30:54.661
<v Speaker 2>wandered on mainly to Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Follow the path of the Aryan culture,</v>

1605
01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:00.023
<v Speaker 2>creative Germans colonizing the east.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They finally found the gigantic new </v>

1606
01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:08.400
<v Speaker 2>untapped reservoir in the Polish and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian sections of eastern Europe.</v>

1607
01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:12.150
<v Speaker 4>So well let's let's tie that together.</v>

1608
01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:20.460
<v Speaker 4>We talked about the use of archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>archetypes in stories.</v>

1609
01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:22.733
<v Speaker 4>We talked about the the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>between archetypal symbolism and the </v>

1610
01:31:27.601 --> 01:31:29.880
<v Speaker 4>biological underpinnings of the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>psyche,</v>

1611
01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:35.010
<v Speaker 4>and then you can see that manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself in this sort of propaganda in the</v>

1612
01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:38.520
<v Speaker 4>political positions that come out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he tap into the archetype?</v>

1613
01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Archetypal dimension?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's chaos versus order.</v>

1614
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.843
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can place one against the other </v>

1615
01:31:45.031 --> 01:31:45.864
<v Speaker 4>however you want from a propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective because you could make a </v>

1616
01:31:48.511 --> 01:31:52.440
<v Speaker 4>film decrying excessive order that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not a difficult thing to do,</v>

1617
01:31:52.441 --> 01:31:53.274
<v Speaker 4>but that isn't what happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Order is associated with the sun and </v>

1618
01:31:55.471 --> 01:31:56.304
<v Speaker 4>with what's good and with honest labor </v>
<v Speaker 4>and with purity and with and chaos is </v>

1619
01:32:00.461 --> 01:32:05.461
<v Speaker 4>associated with decay and disgust and </v>
<v Speaker 4>and impurity and also with trade,</v>

1620
01:32:05.621 --> 01:32:08.020
<v Speaker 4>which is extremely interesting and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>trade dynamic.</v>

1621
01:32:08.021 --> 01:32:10.470
<v Speaker 4>You could see that in the second part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the film there,</v>

1622
01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:11.430
<v Speaker 4>there was a.</v>

1623
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:14.650
<v Speaker 4>There was the implication that it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>involvement in trade that was associated</v>

1624
01:32:14.651 --> 01:32:16.510
<v Speaker 4>with this pathological spread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1625
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:17.623
<v Speaker 4>and so trade ins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's another reflection of the </v>

1626
01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:22.540
<v Speaker 4>ambivalence towards the transgression of</v>
<v Speaker 4>borders.</v>

1627
01:32:22.541 --> 01:32:24.190
<v Speaker 4>Is trade a good thing or is it a bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing?</v>

1628
01:32:24.191 --> 01:32:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's always a political issue.</v>

1629
01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:27.340
<v Speaker 4>It's a huge political issue right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1630
01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:29.260
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have internationalist </v>
<v Speaker 4>trade.</v>

1631
01:32:29.261 --> 01:32:30.094
<v Speaker 4>You're going to close the borders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can have internationalist trade and </v>

1632
01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.510
<v Speaker 4>open editor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to close the borders and so</v>

1633
01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:37.090
<v Speaker 4>the degree to which the border should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>open or closed.</v>

1634
01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:37.983
<v Speaker 4>I think generally speaking is the prime </v>
<v Speaker 4>political question and of course we're </v>

1635
01:32:40.871 --> 01:32:43.540
<v Speaker 4>going through an absolute convulsion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of argumentation.</v>

1636
01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:44.374
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1637
01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:47.050
<v Speaker 4>Part of the reason I wanted to show you </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1638
01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to show you</v>

1639
01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:51.903
<v Speaker 4>how the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the archetype and the underlying </v>

1640
01:32:53.921 --> 01:32:54.754
<v Speaker 4>biology are are tightly associated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also wanted to show you how those </v>

1641
01:32:59.141 --> 01:32:59.974
<v Speaker 4>associations can be hijacked essentially</v>
<v Speaker 4>and used for propagandistic and </v>

1642
01:33:03.701 --> 01:33:04.534
<v Speaker 4>political purposes because you need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that because these sorts of things </v>

1643
01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.370
<v Speaker 4>have a very powerful.</v>

1644
01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.353
<v Speaker 4>They have the capacity for a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful emotional appeal and the only </v>

1645
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:16.570
<v Speaker 4>possible way of resisting that I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1646
01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:18.273
<v Speaker 4>and and avoiding the temptation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowing extraordinarily complex issues </v>

1647
01:33:21.941 --> 01:33:24.630
<v Speaker 4>to be catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We reduced to there too.</v>

1648
01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:29.170
<v Speaker 4>Two principals that are far too simple </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do them justice is to become at least</v>

1649
01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:30.004
<v Speaker 4>aware to some degree of what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms for the production of such </v>

1650
01:33:33.671 --> 01:33:34.504
<v Speaker 4>propaganda are and why they have such </v>
<v Speaker 4>potency than you have at least some </v>

1651
01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:41.860
<v Speaker 4>ghost of a chance of reducing your own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would you call it?</v>

1652
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:43.143
<v Speaker 4>Proclivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could even call it a temperamental </v>

1653
01:33:44.411 --> 01:33:45.244
<v Speaker 4>proclivity to the kind of propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 4>stick information that happens to suit </v>

1654
01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:49.204
<v Speaker 4>your temperament best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so while we all know the aftermath of </v>

1655
01:33:52.181 --> 01:33:53.170
<v Speaker 4>this sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1656
01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.093
<v Speaker 4>It was absolutely dreadful and we're by </v>
<v Speaker 4>no means out of the woods on that yet </v>

1657
01:33:58.320 --> 01:33:59.153
<v Speaker 4>you see in Europe and in the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States increasingly calls for the </v>

1658
01:34:04.481 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 4>nationalistic enclosure of borders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1659
01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:08.254
<v Speaker 4>you saw that with trump and the building</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the wall between Mexico and the </v>

1660
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.823
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so these things can get very badly out </v>

1661
01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:14.614
<v Speaker 4>of hand and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very bad idea to allow things to </v>

1662
01:34:17.981 --> 01:34:18.814
<v Speaker 4>swing too far to one way or too far to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other because all hell breaks loose </v>

1663
01:34:21.611 --> 01:34:23.610
<v Speaker 4>when you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>

1664
01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.680
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll see you on Thursday.</v>
