1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Have asked me some questions about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exam.</v>

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.093
<v Speaker 1>There's not much to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the descriptions listed on the </v>

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>syllabus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it be in this class.</v>

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my idol regard my exams is particularly </v>

5
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:14.264
<v Speaker 1>tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you come to the lectures and done </v>

6
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:18.530
<v Speaker 1>the reading and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people generally do,</v>

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>you know as well in this class as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do in other classes,</v>

8
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all multiple choice</v>

9
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>and you won't run out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>that's about all there is to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are sample questions posted on the</v>

11
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.060
<v Speaker 1>website so you can go there and see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the questions are going to light.</v>

12
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.463
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just select the dem random lead from </v>

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>questions I've used before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're representative of what you're</v>

14
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>going to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

15
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

16
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 1>back to Sigmund Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I found a recording of Freud.</v>

17
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the only known recording.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from a BBC broadcast.</v>

18
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too long before he died,</v>

19
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.440
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Play it.</v>

20
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 1>You can listen along or we long because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a pretty heavy accent,</v>

21
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:24.650
<v Speaker 1>so it's somewhat difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow.</v>

22
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

23
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

24
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ow.</v>

25
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Ow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ow,</v>

26
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 2>ow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ow,</v>

27
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.790
<v Speaker 2>ow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember</v>

28
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.070
<v Speaker 2>why</v>
<v Speaker 2>was</v>

29
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.403
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

30
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.940
<v Speaker 1>few introductory comments to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture.</v>

31
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to imagine the degree to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud re-introduce,</v>

32
00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:45.744
<v Speaker 1>biological or introduced biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas into the study of the human </v>

33
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:52.850
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because by the time Freud came along,</v>

34
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.450
<v Speaker 1>most of the formal thought about thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>and about the human,</v>

35
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human psychology was very influenced by </v>

36
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.580
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a</v>

37
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.753
<v Speaker 1>relatively widespread belief that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were rational and scientific and </v>

38
00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:17.144
<v Speaker 1>becoming increasingly more so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps people were becoming </v>

39
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.943
<v Speaker 1>increasingly more so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Freud put the biology back in </v>

40
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.900
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:34.901
<v Speaker 1>he was a medical doctor and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trained as a neurologist and he was also</v>

42
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.473
<v Speaker 1>part of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like burgeoning interest in placing </v>

43
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.913
<v Speaker 1>human beings firmly in that category of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Animal Kingdom that was </v>

44
00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:50.531
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of the late 19 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in relationship to Darwin</v>

45
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.043
<v Speaker 1>and was Freud who most particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>established the fact that our </v>

46
00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:01.844
<v Speaker 1>rationality is in some sense nested </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside our motivations and emotions and </v>

47
00:05:07.851 --> 00:05:10.460
<v Speaker 1>our unconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

48
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.830
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no doubt that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>claims are correct.</v>

49
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists have always had an animus </v>

50
00:05:20.331 --> 00:05:22.550
<v Speaker 1>towards Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly clear why he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist.</v>

52
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.460
<v Speaker 1>He was a medical doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's part of it.</v>

53
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the distinction between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different professions.</v>

54
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also have this proclivity to </v>

55
00:05:37.101 --> 00:05:37.934
<v Speaker 1>believe that psychologists tend more </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the type of person who's </v>

56
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 1>convinced that the primary activities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that characterize human,</v>

57
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.210
<v Speaker 1>the human psyche are our rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive.</v>

58
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.943
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

59
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>and we certainly have fried to think in </v>
<v Speaker 1>large part for making a strong case that</v>

60
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:04.484
<v Speaker 1>that's not not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll encounter lots of psychologists </v>

61
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.203
<v Speaker 1>who</v>
<v Speaker 1>do their best in some sense to push </v>

62
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.870
<v Speaker 1>freud to one side and consider his </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories outdated and unproven.</v>

63
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think that's fair,</v>

64
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.463
<v Speaker 1>partly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the literature regarding psychoanalysis </v>

65
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:32.564
<v Speaker 1>as an effective treatment seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate quite clearly that it's as at </v>

66
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.250
<v Speaker 1>least as or more effective than other </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic schools.</v>

67
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.143
<v Speaker 1>And it's basically showed that since </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome studies of cycle psychotherapy </v>

68
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>have been conducted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's three or four decades.</v>

69
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.533
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

70
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there are gender </v>

71
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:00.974
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd actually different looked into that </v>

72
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:03.344
<v Speaker 1>with regards to outcome studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's there </v>

73
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>substantative so cause I've never heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>much made of them.</v>

74
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Now the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other issues that Freud described,</v>

75
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.183
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that much of our psychological life is </v>

76
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:18.284
<v Speaker 1>unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and much of it is motivated by what are </v>

77
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 1>both implicit memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So memories we don't really realize that</v>

78
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:27.764
<v Speaker 1>we have anymore or basic biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives that seems to me to be </v>

79
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>unquestioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

80
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.853
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago a little more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists rediscovered the </v>

81
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and they made a big fuss </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

82
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:48.641
<v Speaker 1>But I have was well first at </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic thinking by that time and</v>

83
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:49.814
<v Speaker 1>certainly didn't regard that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly revolutionary because as </v>

84
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>far as I could tell the psychoanalysts </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been there 60 years before.</v>

85
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:56.804
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the experimental procedures </v>

86
00:07:58.821 --> 00:07:59.654
<v Speaker 1>that psychologists use to examine the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious are derived from the sorts </v>

87
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:06.104
<v Speaker 1>of Word Association studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Priming Studies in some sense that Carl </v>

88
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Young pioneer when he was still working </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Freud.</v>

89
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.970
<v Speaker 1>So we have a lot to thank Freud for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also</v>

90
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 1>introduced and developed the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy as something distinct from</v>

91
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:31.060
<v Speaker 1>medical treatment for mental disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

92
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.473
<v Speaker 1>I think there's room for a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions about the overall social and </v>

93
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:39.914
<v Speaker 1>cultural utility of psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read interesting critiques making </v>

94
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:47.054
<v Speaker 1>the claim that it's reduced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity for familial and friendship </v>

95
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:53.390
<v Speaker 1>ties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

96
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.523
<v Speaker 1>as it's proliferated society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be that as it may all of the </v>

97
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:02.364
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic fields that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>practically applied I think have freud </v>

98
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 1>to thank for their founding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems a bit on the ungrateful side</v>

99
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>to criticize him too harshly.</v>

100
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.213
<v Speaker 1>I've also found that Freud's </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizations of certain pathways </v>

101
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:23.454
<v Speaker 1>to psychological pathology are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally correct and I'll discuss </v>

102
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:30.954
<v Speaker 1>those in a little bit more detail as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>proceed through today's lecture now </v>

103
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 1>because the late 1900 is now a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

104
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 1>It's useful to put Freud in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical context.</v>

105
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is partly history of psychology </v>

106
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:47.004
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also shed some light on how the </v>

107
00:09:50.911 --> 00:09:51.744
<v Speaker 1>nature of psychiatric and psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorders transform with time because </v>

108
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think of them as,</v>

109
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're more</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically oriented,</v>

110
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.030
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think of a disorder or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness as something that approximates a</v>

111
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 1>scientific category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think about illnesses,</v>

112
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.723
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say is they're not precisely </v>

113
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 1>scientific categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

114
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 1>they might not be scientific categories </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

115
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.163
<v Speaker 1>They're informed by science sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say increasingly as we </v>

116
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 1>develop the diagnostics and statistics </v>
<v Speaker 1>manual,</v>

117
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:26.754
<v Speaker 1>which is the fundamental book that </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlands psychiatric and psychological </v>

118
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in North America,</v>

119
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:33.054
<v Speaker 1>but increasingly around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science is being used to inform the </v>

120
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:38.754
<v Speaker 1>language that sits at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions along which the pathologies </v>

121
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:45.000
<v Speaker 1>are defined.</v>

122
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.223
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the personality </v>

123
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:50.220
<v Speaker 1>disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's increasing emphasis,</v>

124
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.630
<v Speaker 1>although not enough emphasis yet on </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional models such as the big five.</v>

125
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.453
<v Speaker 1>But you have to understand that medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic categories serve a number of </v>

126
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:02.514
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you shouldn't get cynical about </v>

127
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often people start out by thinking about</v>

128
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:07.254
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic categories is scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they soon find out that the </v>

129
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:11.424
<v Speaker 1>idea that their scientific can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized on multiple different fronts </v>

130
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:16.980
<v Speaker 1>and quite severely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michel Foucault,</v>

131
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has done a lot of that.</v>

132
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.683
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his works were regarded as </v>

133
00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:21.594
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary by people who didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about the history of </v>

134
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:25.044
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric disorders because most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he outlined was already known by </v>

135
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:30.684
<v Speaker 1>people who took the time to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly went through code line was the </v>

136
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:34.944
<v Speaker 1>fact that psychiatric diagnostic </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories like medical diagnostic </v>

137
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:43.281
<v Speaker 1>categories play a sociological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political and economic role as well as a</v>

138
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.530
<v Speaker 1>scientific and treatment oriented role.</v>

139
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.453
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of it because as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned at the beginning of the </v>

140
00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:50.874
<v Speaker 1>lecture series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're attempting to move someone </v>

141
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:54.424
<v Speaker 1>from abnormality say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or ill health towards normality or </v>

142
00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:00.140
<v Speaker 1>health and the Noah's Ark precisely at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>

143
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.550
<v Speaker 1>not precisely parallel lines there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

144
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.193
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a lot more than science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also involved in athletics and </v>

145
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>you can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

146
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have to think about why it is </v>

147
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 1>that we have psychiatric diagnostic </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>

148
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

149
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 1>some of the critics of psychiatry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the 1960s,</v>

150
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.993
<v Speaker 1>regarded that as primarily an economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>or political movement that was designed </v>

151
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>to categorize people who engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 1>abnormal behavior and to,</v>

152
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and to prevent them from exercising </v>
<v Speaker 1>their full rights.</v>

153
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>In society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

154
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 1>because it was thought of as a purely </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive</v>

155
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.933
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all you have to do is take a walk </v>

156
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:47.644
<v Speaker 1>around Toronto and see all the d </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutionalized schizophrenia ix </v>

157
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.933
<v Speaker 1>wandering around and enjoying their </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom to understand that the </v>

158
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:57.124
<v Speaker 1>description of psychiatry as a purely</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical rural pressive sociological </v>

159
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:09.181
<v Speaker 1>regime has a lot to account for because </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people were Ddd,</v>

160
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 1>institutionalized in the late sixties </v>
<v Speaker 1>and early seventies and the institutions</v>

161
00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:15.580
<v Speaker 1>have never been rebuilt.</v>

162
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.713
<v Speaker 1>And all that happened was that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumped on the streets where they </v>

163
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 1>generally stop taking your medication </v>
<v Speaker 1>and survived very poorly.</v>

164
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.573
<v Speaker 1>So even if psychiatry plays a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociological and political and economic </v>

165
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be thinking that,</v>

166
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:30.904
<v Speaker 1>that it validates it as an enterprise </v>
<v Speaker 1>just me and said it's a very complex </v>

167
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 1>enterprise that has to span multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of,</v>

168
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.170
<v Speaker 1>it stands on many different </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical and scientific foundations</v>

169
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.353
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric diagnostic categories and </v>

170
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.640
<v Speaker 1>the symptomatology that's associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them also transforms with time.</v>

171
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.453
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of a strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you think about </v>

172
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric ill health as a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>

173
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 1>But the language transforms across time </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

174
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.433
<v Speaker 1>And it's grounded in biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth of the matter is that </v>

175
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.660
<v Speaker 1>nothing that human beings do or </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience exists in a cultural vacuum.</v>

176
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.720
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was young,</v>

177
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Carmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia delusions,</v>

178
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.610
<v Speaker 1>especially for the paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia,</v>

179
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.473
<v Speaker 1>was that the TV was talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously they didn't have that </v>

180
00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:34.350
<v Speaker 1>delusion in 1920 because there weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>any televisions.</v>

181
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.320
<v Speaker 1>So by the time it was saying 1930 it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be in the radio.</v>

182
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.410
<v Speaker 1>And now the most common focus of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoia is the internet.</v>

183
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.003
<v Speaker 1>And there's some reasons for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even if the TV wasn't spying on </v>

184
00:14:48.151 --> 00:14:49.920
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet probably is.</v>

185
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.523
<v Speaker 1>So that's a simple example showing how </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural transformation can change the </v>

186
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:58.064
<v Speaker 1>content and send the phenomenology </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with a given </v>

187
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.273
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can take them to them as being </v>

188
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:08.831
<v Speaker 1>characterized by some combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology,</v>

189
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:15.460
<v Speaker 1>biological pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical pathology,</v>

190
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.240
<v Speaker 1>pathology that's limited to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual's experience.</v>

191
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Speaker 1>And then you can think of it that all as</v>
<v Speaker 1>nested inside a given cultural context,</v>

192
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.620
<v Speaker 1>which in itself may be pathological or </v>
<v Speaker 1>normative.</v>

193
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.713
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the interplay of all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors that makes understanding mental </v>

194
00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:37.850
<v Speaker 1>illness and diagnostic categories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very challenging enterprise,</v>

195
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:42.940
<v Speaker 1>especially when you also add to that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity for social control,</v>

196
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 1>which would be the political and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic dimension,</v>

197
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 1>and then also for intervention at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual level.</v>

198
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself as well,</v>

199
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.013
<v Speaker 1>what serves society better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Society served better by putting people </v>

200
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:00.674
<v Speaker 1>who are completely unable of adopting </v>
<v Speaker 1>normative behavior and who may be </v>

201
00:16:05.121 --> 00:16:05.954
<v Speaker 1>disruptive and frightening somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they cannot disturb the bulk of </v>

202
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:17.110
<v Speaker 1>the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's question number one.</v>

203
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 1>The answer of that is all not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's a mistake.</v>

204
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.723
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be a mistake and it certainly </v>

205
00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:24.314
<v Speaker 1>would be a mistake in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't just simply say that it's </v>

206
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:31.580
<v Speaker 1>a mistake all the time because you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to walk around on the streets</v>

207
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:33.523
<v Speaker 1>relatively on harassed and free of fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>to not an unreasonable desire for a </v>

208
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 1>civilized society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the next question,</v>

209
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:42.560
<v Speaker 1>or maybe even the first question might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

210
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.633
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do these institutions help the </v>

211
00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:48.980
<v Speaker 1>individuals with whom they're directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacted?</v>

212
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 1>And then the right answer to that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to what?</v>

213
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Because compared to perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is no,</v>

214
00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 1>but compared to no help whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is probably yes.</v>

215
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.860
<v Speaker 1>And so it's also worthwhile to be useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

216
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:07.460
<v Speaker 1>or to be realistic in your expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

217
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:08.294
<v Speaker 1>most people who are schizophrenia don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to take their psychiatric </v>

218
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:11.054
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because </v>

219
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:13.634
<v Speaker 1>antipsychotic medications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were only really popularized at </v>

220
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:21.290
<v Speaker 1>the end of the 1950s work on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological axis,</v>

221
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.050
<v Speaker 1>the dopaminergic system that produces </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>

222
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.153
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take an anti psychotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to flatten out your positive </v>

223
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:28.964
<v Speaker 1>emotion and demotivate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivate you and sort of take the color </v>

224
00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:34.280
<v Speaker 1>out of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine that that's not very</v>

225
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.013
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course if you take them and </v>

226
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:38.564
<v Speaker 1>you start to feel better and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling better for three or four </v>

227
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:43.520
<v Speaker 1>months or six months or a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be thinking,</v>

228
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.133
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I kept her and then you're going </v>

229
00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:47.524
<v Speaker 1>to stop taking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you ask a schizophrenia very </v>

230
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:54.030
<v Speaker 1>frequently about their medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>

231
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not very happy to be taking it,</v>

232
00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 1>and they'd like to quit as soon as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

233
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.740
<v Speaker 1>But that does not necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the medication is not</v>

234
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:03.420
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

235
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.253
<v Speaker 1>doing something that's beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means that the best they can </v>

236
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:07.764
<v Speaker 1>hope for is not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't point directly to a </v>

237
00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 1>flaw in the system that's dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

238
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:15.683
<v Speaker 1>It just points to the terrible nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disease and it's fundamentally </v>

239
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 1>intractable qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

240
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:24.954
<v Speaker 1>so back to front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that now a lot of what Freud saw was </v>

241
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:33.710
<v Speaker 1>sexual pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask yourself why.</v>

242
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.783
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we could point out is </v>

243
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:37.854
<v Speaker 1>that when Freud was alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>society was very highly divided by </v>

244
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:42.683
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was divided by gender roles and man's </v>

245
00:18:45.521 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 1>were authorities and women's were by and</v>
<v Speaker 1>large subordinate.</v>

246
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:50.933
<v Speaker 1>Although</v>

247
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.790
<v Speaker 1>that situation is more complex than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple reading of history might lead you</v>

248
00:18:57.791 --> 00:19:00.310
<v Speaker 1>to conclude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

249
00:19:00.311 --> 00:19:01.144
<v Speaker 1>if you read tolstoy's novels </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizing Russian society in the </v>

250
00:19:05.081 --> 00:19:05.914
<v Speaker 1>late 1900 you find out that among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aristocratic women and after all only </v>

251
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.633
<v Speaker 1>the aristocrats have power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was plenty of power being </v>

252
00:19:12.971 --> 00:19:13.804
<v Speaker 1>exercised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women essentially structured </v>

253
00:19:14.921 --> 00:19:15.754
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men were involved in politics and they </v>

254
00:19:17.951 --> 00:19:18.784
<v Speaker 1>were involved in war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but women were setting up the social </v>

255
00:19:22.721 --> 00:19:26.380
<v Speaker 1>interactions that characterize the bulk </v>
<v Speaker 1>of of society</v>

256
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.270
<v Speaker 1>in their groups and in there and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own interactions.</v>

257
00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.910
<v Speaker 1>So it's not clear who was doing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>when.</v>

258
00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.330
<v Speaker 1>What is clear though is that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Victorian times,</v>

259
00:19:37.331 --> 00:19:42.130
<v Speaker 1>sex was a lot more dangerous for women </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it is now and it's plenty dangerous</v>

260
00:19:42.131 --> 00:19:43.390
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

261
00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.390
<v Speaker 1>there was no reliable form of birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

262
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>

263
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.673
<v Speaker 1>there was tremendous risk of syphilis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and selfless for all intensive purposes </v>

264
00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.490
<v Speaker 1>was as bad or is as bad or worse than </v>
<v Speaker 1>aids.</v>

265
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Now what's controllable now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't controllable then.</v>

266
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.143
<v Speaker 1>And syphilis could also be passed on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and it was a neurological </v>

267
00:20:07.511 --> 00:20:10.210
<v Speaker 1>disease that could take virtually any </v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

268
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.880
<v Speaker 1>So it was a real terror for European </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

269
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.953
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason that's a Europe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the victorians were sort of repressive </v>

270
00:20:17.321 --> 00:20:21.010
<v Speaker 1>in sexual matters was because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment demanded it.</v>

271
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.640
<v Speaker 1>And we know and more research has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>done on this recently.</v>

272
00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:25.474
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that as the rate of contagious </v>

273
00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:30.843
<v Speaker 1>pathogen in the environment increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which is society becomes </v>

274
00:20:35.921 --> 00:20:38.950
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian increases and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>

275
00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.053
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's recent data showing that it was </v>

276
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.143
<v Speaker 1>a paper published just a few months ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that the correlation between </v>

277
00:20:46.391 --> 00:20:47.224
<v Speaker 1>infectious prevalence in a given </v>
<v Speaker 1>geographical locale and authoritarian </v>

278
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.413
<v Speaker 1>political views held by the individuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that locale approaches 0.7 which is </v>

279
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.420
<v Speaker 1>absolutely phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a high correlation that it,</v>

280
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.383
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost eats up all of the </v>

281
00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:05.374
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

282
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And so as the risk of infectious disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>rises,</v>

283
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.060
<v Speaker 1>people become less and less tolerant in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

284
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>views on interpersonal behavior and a </v>

285
00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:18.490
<v Speaker 1>lot of back scoring can be associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with sexual behavior cause that's a very</v>

286
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 1>good vector for the transmission of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

287
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.330
<v Speaker 1>We should remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:26.470
<v Speaker 1>if we hadn't been so technologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced in the 1980s,</v>

289
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:27.783
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>age wouldn't have spread because it </v>

290
00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:34.121
<v Speaker 1>spread because of air travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apart from that you don't,</v>

291
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.493
<v Speaker 1>age could have taken us all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just luck of the draw and </v>

292
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 1>technological power that enabled us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it under control.</v>

293
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to assume that another</v>

294
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:51.040
<v Speaker 1>sexually transmissible play like age </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't come along.</v>

295
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.910
<v Speaker 1>So does that price promiscuity increases</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rate at which sexually transmissible</v>

296
00:21:57.461 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 1>diseases are transmitted rises </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponentially.</v>

297
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a connected world,</v>

298
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.333
<v Speaker 1>that's bad news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my point is the Friday and the </v>

299
00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:06.634
<v Speaker 1>victorians had their reasons to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively repressive from a sexual </v>

300
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:12.560
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

301
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 1>there was another problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for women in particular,</v>

302
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 1>which was that</v>

303
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.533
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

304
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.133
<v Speaker 1>apart from the danger of pregnancy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the danger of sexually transmitted </v>

305
00:22:24.291 --> 00:22:25.124
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was also the danger of the </v>

306
00:22:26.301 --> 00:22:27.134
<v Speaker 1>destruction of their social reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if a woman got a reputation for </v>

307
00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promiscuity at any level,</v>

308
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:36.163
<v Speaker 1>the probability that she was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>tossed out of her sociological niche </v>

309
00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:45.350
<v Speaker 1>into some God awful life of prostitution</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

310
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:49.730
<v Speaker 1>was really quite high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

311
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.680
<v Speaker 1>so that sets up the sociological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

312
00:22:54.681 --> 00:22:57.260
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sociological surround.</v>

313
00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 1>You don't repress something unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in it has high cost.</v>

314
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:09.270
<v Speaker 1>And certainly for the Victorian sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior was a high cost enterprise,</v>

315
00:23:09.271 --> 00:23:11.940
<v Speaker 1>especially for the women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so freud,</v>

316
00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.440
<v Speaker 1>given Freud's emphasis on biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation</v>

317
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and given his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his belief that section sexual drive was</v>

318
00:23:25.341 --> 00:23:28.510
<v Speaker 1>a fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's one of the fundamental biological</v>

319
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:32.440
<v Speaker 1>motivations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that the stage is set for in</v>

320
00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:34.300
<v Speaker 1>some sense for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no amount of conflict.</v>

321
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Now the conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm already there.</v>

322
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.730
<v Speaker 1>When you were a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say of 11 or 10</v>

323
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.183
<v Speaker 1>you exist in a world where the demand or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the desire for engaging in sexual </v>

324
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:48.620
<v Speaker 1>behavior is low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as puberty kicks in,</v>

325
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.663
<v Speaker 1>things changed dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the child was faced with a problem </v>

326
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:53.204
<v Speaker 1>of integrating the new demand that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>placed on them by the maturation of </v>

327
00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:59.300
<v Speaker 1>their body into their personality and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>end to the social surround.</v>

328
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's no simple matter when there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine conflicts between its expression</v>

329
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.560
<v Speaker 1>and other important considerations like </v>
<v Speaker 1>social propriety and health,</v>

330
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe medium to longterm relationship</v>

331
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:16.910
<v Speaker 1>stability or maybe the provision of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe place to raise children,</v>

332
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.013
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

333
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.573
<v Speaker 1>So that's the situation that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] or the victorians found </v>

334
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.890
<v Speaker 1>themselves in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

335
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Freud believed that many of the patients</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he saw,</v>

336
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:35.350
<v Speaker 1>the female patients had been sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>abused or molested as children.</v>

337
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:37.303
<v Speaker 1>He wavered in that belief throughout his</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and has been called to task rather </v>

338
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 1>severely for that by more current </v>
<v Speaker 1>critics.</v>

339
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.780
<v Speaker 1>But Freud was one of the first observers</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the extreme malleability of memory.</v>

340
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And he found it very difficult when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was interacting with his clients,</v>

341
00:24:57.471 --> 00:24:59.930
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones who are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>hysterical in,</v>

342
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.063
<v Speaker 1>in their essential orientation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguish between memories that they </v>

343
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:08.840
<v Speaker 1>had made up or fantasies and things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happened to them.</v>

344
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:13.841
<v Speaker 1>And until you encounter someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory structure is extremely incoherent</v>

345
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:17.743
<v Speaker 1>and chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to realize to </v>

346
00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:21.614
<v Speaker 1>what degree people can wonder around in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world with no sense whatsoever of </v>

347
00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:28.400
<v Speaker 1>what's happened to them.</v>

348
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.233
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a client at one point who told me </v>

349
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.230
<v Speaker 1>that she thought she had been raped five</v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

350
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:38.383
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing you might know if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard a statement like that is that </v>

351
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:42.703
<v Speaker 1>the word thought is a very peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>insertion in that sentence because it's </v>

352
00:25:46.641 --> 00:25:47.474
<v Speaker 1>not exactly all that straightforward to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how you would have any doubt </v>

353
00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:56.111
<v Speaker 1>about that if it happened five times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was a very strange woman,</v>

354
00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:58.993
<v Speaker 1>and she was a person who was very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone Freud would have described </v>

355
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.800
<v Speaker 1>in the late 19th century as a hysteric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had virtually no catalyzed identity.</v>

356
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.040
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I could tell,</v>

357
00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:13.874
<v Speaker 1>almost completely hollow in that none of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that have ever happened to </v>

358
00:26:17.961 --> 00:26:18.794
<v Speaker 1>her see you have been processed beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mere fact that they occurred and I </v>

359
00:26:23.721 --> 00:26:24.554
<v Speaker 1>think that a big part of that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she didn't really ever have </v>

360
00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:28.130
<v Speaker 1>anyone to talk to.</v>

361
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.700
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's emerged as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of Freud's work in part is</v>

362
00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:34.544
<v Speaker 1>a realization of the degree to which </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication about your experiences is </v>

363
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.170
<v Speaker 1>advantageous or even necessary in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance of mental health.</v>

364
00:26:42.171 --> 00:26:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud believed that</v>

365
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.043
<v Speaker 1>you needed to talk about experiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were particularly emotionally </v>

366
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:49.704
<v Speaker 1>significant part in it because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary to release or or ab react the </v>

367
00:26:54.481 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 1>emotions that were associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience he called that Catharsis more</v>

368
00:26:59.161 --> 00:26:59.994
<v Speaker 1>recent research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly on like that and done by </v>

369
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:02.154
<v Speaker 1>James Pennebaker has indicated that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the articulation of those </v>

370
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:06.264
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the verbalization and their </v>

371
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.283
<v Speaker 1>transformation into a coherent </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation that seems to be </v>

372
00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 1>beneficial for mental health rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mere expression of it</v>

373
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.150
<v Speaker 3>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

374
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:22.893
<v Speaker 1>just because Freud was only partially </v>
<v Speaker 1>right about why his method worked </v>

375
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.830
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean he was wrong about the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it did work.</v>

376
00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Now this woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>was unemployed and had been for years,</v>

377
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:38.913
<v Speaker 1>although she dressed in a business suit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she had talked her way into hosting </v>

378
00:27:45.011 --> 00:27:50.011
<v Speaker 1>a cable television show in the town I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was working with in,</v>

379
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.043
<v Speaker 1>in the city I was working in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a program about fostering the </v>

380
00:27:54.431 --> 00:27:55.264
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial spirit even though she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was unemployed and it never started a </v>

381
00:27:58.361 --> 00:27:59.194
<v Speaker 1>business in her life and she has also </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked her way on to a government board </v>

382
00:28:03.161 --> 00:28:08.080
<v Speaker 1>that was charged with investigating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of a high speed rail lake in</v>

383
00:28:08.081 --> 00:28:12.070
<v Speaker 1>southern Ontario even though she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no experience whatsoever with</v>

384
00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.623
<v Speaker 1>business or railways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she had a reasonably well developed </v>

385
00:28:17.831 --> 00:28:18.664
<v Speaker 1>persona from a union perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked her at one point to show me her </v>

386
00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.653
<v Speaker 1>resume and she brought me in a binder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know those three ring binders that </v>

387
00:28:30.551 --> 00:28:31.384
<v Speaker 1>was an inch and a half thick with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>little tab dividers that you use to </v>

388
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.823
<v Speaker 1>segregate different sections of your cv </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in which she had included a 20 page </v>

389
00:28:44.051 --> 00:28:44.884
<v Speaker 1>description of her recent dreams and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion or a list of all the novels </v>

390
00:28:49.901 --> 00:28:54.130
<v Speaker 1>she read in the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was completely</v>

391
00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:55.930
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

392
00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:56.763
<v Speaker 1>incapable of noting that every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about that cv was inappropriate </v>

393
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:05.140
<v Speaker 1>even though she didn't suffer from any </v>
<v Speaker 1>formal thought disorder.</v>

394
00:29:05.141 --> 00:29:05.974
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't schizophrenia or a psychotic </v>

395
00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:13.291
<v Speaker 1>in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With regards to the rape statement,</v>

396
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.873
<v Speaker 1>she told me that what happened to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently was that she would go to a </v>

397
00:29:18.671 --> 00:29:19.504
<v Speaker 1>bar in her vague and ill defined way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd have a few drinks or maybe more </v>

398
00:29:24.341 --> 00:29:25.174
<v Speaker 1>than a few and then she'd end up back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>her place with some mat or at his place </v>

399
00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.660
<v Speaker 1>and then that night they would have</v>

400
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:35.973
<v Speaker 1>sexual relations and then in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was unclear about whether or not </v>

401
00:29:38.561 --> 00:29:39.394
<v Speaker 1>that was voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this was a fascinating case for me </v>

402
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:45.700
<v Speaker 1>because she outlined that story to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

403
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:49.090
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have become somewhat familiar with the</v>

404
00:29:49.091 --> 00:29:54.091
<v Speaker 1>danger of therapists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulation of patient memories because</v>

405
00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:57.040
<v Speaker 1>therapists can implant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

406
00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.380
<v Speaker 1>memories in clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

407
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:00.214
<v Speaker 1>very complicated because when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with someone who's as chaotic </v>

408
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.040
<v Speaker 1>and vague as this particular person was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's virtually impossible not to implant</v>

409
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:12.250
<v Speaker 1>memories just by talking about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

410
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.620
<v Speaker 1>so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she told me the story and I thought,</v>

411
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:15.454
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a chance to reorganize this </v>

412
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:18.874
<v Speaker 1>woman's entire concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conception of her past sexual </v>

413
00:30:21.191 --> 00:30:25.450
<v Speaker 1>experiences by uttering a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

414
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.920
<v Speaker 1>So I could have said,</v>

415
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.213
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

416
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:34.610
<v Speaker 1>unless you give express consent to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage of the sexual transaction,</v>

417
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.073
<v Speaker 1>then you're clearly being victimized and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your claim that you may have been raped </v>

418
00:30:41.731 --> 00:30:45.090
<v Speaker 1>five times could be transformed into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim that you work.</v>

419
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Or it could have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you completely out of your mind?</v>

420
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.773
<v Speaker 1>If you go to a bar and a single's bar by</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you have six or seven </v>

421
00:30:56.941 --> 00:30:57.774
<v Speaker 1>drinks or however many drinks you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you bring someone home or go to </v>

422
00:31:01.351 --> 00:31:06.210
<v Speaker 1>their place and you end up in bed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and that happens five times,</v>

423
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.820
<v Speaker 1>then probably you have something to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

424
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And making a claim of rape is observed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might ask yourself which of</v>

425
00:31:14.911 --> 00:31:15.744
<v Speaker 1>those opposing interpretations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct and it doesn't matter because I </v>

426
00:31:19.231 --> 00:31:20.064
<v Speaker 1>did tell her either of them because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was up to her to sort out exactly what </v>

427
00:31:24.211 --> 00:31:25.044
<v Speaker 1>had happened.</v>

428
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:27.563
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

429
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that exist,</v>

430
00:31:30.831 --> 00:31:31.664
<v Speaker 1>but they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was someone who had never </v>

431
00:31:34.791 --> 00:31:39.740
<v Speaker 1>reflected on any of her experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had no real articulated identity.</v>

432
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.370
<v Speaker 1>And a big part of that was because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was completely isolated.</v>

433
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:44.803
<v Speaker 1>And so when Freud got confused about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether his client's memories of sexual </v>

434
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.720
<v Speaker 1>trauma in childhood were accurate or </v>
<v Speaker 1>inaccurate,</v>

435
00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:55.123
<v Speaker 1>the reason that he got confused was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was frequently dealing with </v>

436
00:31:58.281 --> 00:31:59.114
<v Speaker 1>people who were confused right down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of their souls and who for </v>

437
00:32:02.751 --> 00:32:03.584
<v Speaker 1>one reason or another had never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to engage in the process of </v>

438
00:32:06.651 --> 00:32:07.484
<v Speaker 1>articulation that would've allowed them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to established a well establish a well </v>

439
00:32:11.301 --> 00:32:13.070
<v Speaker 1>differentiated identity.</v>

440
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.493
<v Speaker 3>The</v>

441
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.033
<v Speaker 1>texted I'm showing you in these slides </v>
<v Speaker 1>is based department work by book by a </v>

442
00:32:26.491 --> 00:32:30.840
<v Speaker 1>man named Henry Henri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually Ellen [inaudible],</v>

443
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:34.980
<v Speaker 1>who is an existentialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was an existentialist psychologist,</v>

444
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.083
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist who lived in Montreal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a book called the discovery of </v>

445
00:32:38.611 --> 00:32:39.444
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're interested in </v>

446
00:32:40.971 --> 00:32:43.700
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic thought and the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychoanalytic thought,</v>

447
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the best book that's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>

448
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.050
<v Speaker 1>It's called the discovery of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

449
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing Alan Bridgej points </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

450
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.823
<v Speaker 1>cause I paraphrased his book here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that punishments for transgressions </v>

451
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:58.700
<v Speaker 1>in the Victorian Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're also fairly draconian.</v>

452
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.600
<v Speaker 1>And that also sets up the situation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

453
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.273
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're driven by something that's a </v>

454
00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:05.954
<v Speaker 1>very strong drive and you're liable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter tremendous trouble as a </v>

455
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:13.130
<v Speaker 1>consequence of engaging in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a very easy thing for you to do</v>

456
00:33:13.131 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to negotiate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular landscape.</v>

457
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Alabama Shay says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis evidently belongs to that</v>

458
00:33:25.531 --> 00:33:26.364
<v Speaker 1>unmasking trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The search for hidden unconscious </v>

459
00:33:28.381 --> 00:33:33.270
<v Speaker 1>motivations characteristic of the 1880s </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nineties in Freud as a nature,</v>

460
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.343
<v Speaker 1>words and deeds are viewed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of unconscious </v>

461
00:33:36.721 --> 00:33:37.554
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly of instincts and conflicts have </v>

462
00:33:39.631 --> 00:33:44.280
<v Speaker 1>instincts for both men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unconscious is the wild realm of the</v>

463
00:33:44.281 --> 00:33:45.114
<v Speaker 1>wild bruce instincts that cannot find </v>
<v Speaker 1>permissible outlets that derive from </v>

464
00:33:48.631 --> 00:33:49.464
<v Speaker 1>earlier stages of the individual and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind and that find expression in </v>

465
00:33:52.711 --> 00:33:54.000
<v Speaker 1>passion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>

466
00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:54.893
<v Speaker 1>and mental illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the term id does s originates from </v>

467
00:33:59.761 --> 00:34:00.594
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dynamic concept of mind with the </v>

468
00:34:04.321 --> 00:34:05.154
<v Speaker 1>notions of mental energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quanta of latent or inhibited energy or </v>

469
00:34:08.551 --> 00:34:09.384
<v Speaker 1>release of energy or transfer from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive to another is also to be found in </v>

470
00:34:12.151 --> 00:34:12.984
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before Freud nature conceived the mind </v>

471
00:34:15.991 --> 00:34:20.160
<v Speaker 1>as a system of drives that can collide </v>
<v Speaker 1>or be fused into each other.</v>

472
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.343
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

473
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.510
<v Speaker 1>this is from</v>

474
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.670
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

475
00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:37.060
<v Speaker 1>The life and work of Sigmund Freud by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones,</v>

476
00:34:37.061 --> 00:34:42.061
<v Speaker 1>who was Freud's biographer</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the process that</v>

477
00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:48.400
<v Speaker 1>resulted in Freud's hypothesis about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

478
00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:53.800
<v Speaker 1>John says in the summer of 1897 freud </v>
<v Speaker 1>undertook his most heroic feat.</v>

479
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.813
<v Speaker 1>A psychoanalysis of his own unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that's akin in some sense </v>

480
00:34:58.841 --> 00:34:59.674
<v Speaker 1>to the initiatory routines that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>described for you at the beginning of </v>

481
00:35:02.441 --> 00:35:05.380
<v Speaker 1>this course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for us nowadays to imagine how</v>

482
00:35:05.381 --> 00:35:06.214
<v Speaker 1>momentous this achievement was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that difficulty being the fate of most </v>

483
00:35:09.221 --> 00:35:10.054
<v Speaker 1>pioneering exploits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet the uniqueness of the feet remains </v>

484
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.490
<v Speaker 1>once done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has done forever</v>

485
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.050
<v Speaker 1>for no one again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be the first to explore those depths</v>

486
00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:21.723
<v Speaker 1>and the long history of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The task has often been attempted </v>

487
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.370
<v Speaker 1>philosophers and writers from Salon to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana,</v>

488
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.353
<v Speaker 1>from juvenile to show up and hire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schopenhauer had essay to follow the </v>

489
00:35:31.871 --> 00:35:34.630
<v Speaker 1>advice of the delphic oracle know </v>
<v Speaker 1>thyself,</v>

490
00:35:34.631 --> 00:35:35.464
<v Speaker 1>but all had succumb to the effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inner had borrowed advance there had </v>

491
00:35:40.111 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 1>from time to time being flashes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition to point the way,</v>

492
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.820
<v Speaker 1>but they'd always flickered out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of the unconscious whose existence</v>

493
00:35:47.821 --> 00:35:49.950
<v Speaker 1>was so often postulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remained dark,</v>

494
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.170
<v Speaker 1>and the words of Hair Clyde is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>stood,</v>

495
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.183
<v Speaker 1>stood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The soul of man is a far country which </v>

496
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:56.934
<v Speaker 1>cannot be approached or explored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud had no hell no one to assist the </v>

497
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:03.900
<v Speaker 1>undertaking in the slightest degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than this,</v>

498
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.113
<v Speaker 1>the very thing that drove him onwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must've definitely divine however </v>

499
00:36:08.641 --> 00:36:09.474
<v Speaker 1>much he tried to conceal it from himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>could only result it profoundly </v>

500
00:36:13.681 --> 00:36:14.514
<v Speaker 1>affecting his relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even severing them with the one </v>

501
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:20.160
<v Speaker 1>being who he was so closely bound and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who had steadied his mental equilibrium.</v>

502
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.000
<v Speaker 1>It was daring bunch and risking much </v>
<v Speaker 1>what courage,</v>

503
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.160
<v Speaker 1>intellectual and moral must've be </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed,</v>

504
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:31.250
<v Speaker 1>but it was forthcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously Jones is a real admirer of</v>

505
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:33.114
<v Speaker 1>Freud</v>

506
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.953
<v Speaker 1>and he believed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's hypothesis emerged from a </v>

507
00:36:39.831 --> 00:36:44.720
<v Speaker 1>careful analysis from Freud's careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of his own fantasies and drives</v>

508
00:36:44.721 --> 00:36:46.010
<v Speaker 1>an unconscious life.</v>

509
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:55.853
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

510
00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.403
<v Speaker 1>The Friday and model divides the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche and in a variety of different </v>

511
00:37:02.071 --> 00:37:02.904
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the simplest of which is conscious and </v>

512
00:37:05.131 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and elman bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He points out that by 1,904 functions of</v>

513
00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:14.460
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious had been described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the conservative,</v>

514
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.580
<v Speaker 1>so that's memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's memory,</v>

515
00:37:17.581 --> 00:37:20.640
<v Speaker 1>so in some manner that we don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand</v>

516
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.423
<v Speaker 1>your psyche is the storehouse of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of experiences that </v>

517
00:37:28.831 --> 00:37:29.664
<v Speaker 1>you've had prior to today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some of those are recallable as the </v>

518
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:36.984
<v Speaker 1>stories that constitute your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those would be the sorts of things that </v>

519
00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:40.374
<v Speaker 1>come up in your mind is images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe dreamlike images or movie like </v>

520
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:43.854
<v Speaker 1>images or stories that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly tell people about your past </v>

521
00:37:47.461 --> 00:37:50.700
<v Speaker 1>experiences where you're the actor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those experiences.</v>

522
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:52.973
<v Speaker 1>There's also the elements of memory that</v>
<v Speaker 1>enabled you to do things like to speak </v>

523
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.503
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have conscious access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is that you know how to speak or </v>

524
00:38:01.021 --> 00:38:01.854
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is that you know how to ride a </v>

525
00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:05.280
<v Speaker 1>bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more implicit forms of memory.</v>

526
00:38:05.281 --> 00:38:06.114
<v Speaker 1>So that unconscious contains the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information or the skills or the </v>

527
00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:12.414
<v Speaker 1>circuitry that enables you to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex motor acts that you've learned </v>

528
00:38:15.871 --> 00:38:16.704
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

529
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Does alluded the unconscious contains </v>
<v Speaker 1>habits.</v>

530
00:38:22.001 --> 00:38:22.834
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the more procedural elements </v>

531
00:38:24.791 --> 00:38:25.624
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I just described and dissociated </v>

532
00:38:27.911 --> 00:38:31.240
<v Speaker 1>elements of the personality which may </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead a parasitic existence.</v>

533
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:32.223
<v Speaker 1>Now that's an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of that's predicated the notion </v>

534
00:38:35.591 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 1>that I showed you this hierarchy before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

535
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:40.120
<v Speaker 1>you've seen this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

536
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.720
<v Speaker 1>So now you can imagine that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching,</v>

537
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 1>when you're interacting with maybe your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

538
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:47.080
<v Speaker 1>your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sister,</v>

539
00:38:47.081 --> 00:38:47.914
<v Speaker 1>your great aunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that there are chunks of their </v>

540
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:50.494
<v Speaker 1>personality that you incorporate into </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself sort of from whole cloth that </v>

541
00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're doing that in the PS Yeti </v>
<v Speaker 1>incense by imitating them and,</v>

542
00:38:58.770 --> 00:38:59.603
<v Speaker 1>and so the and and that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being is full of these </v>

543
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:05.703
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies are sub hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of which is devoted towards a </v>

544
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:13.750
<v Speaker 1>single per purpose or maybe singular </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of purposes.</v>

545
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.063
<v Speaker 1>And that you can switch back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>between being dominated by one of these </v>

546
00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:20.860
<v Speaker 1>or the other.</v>

547
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 1>And some of them are more straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

548
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:23.284
<v Speaker 1>like the state of perception and action </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might characterize you if you're </v>

549
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.390
<v Speaker 1>simply angry or if you're simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed by sexual desire.</v>

550
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:32.403
<v Speaker 1>But the more complicated ones would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>those that make those who know you say </v>

551
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.983
<v Speaker 1>you're acting just like your mother now </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're acting just like your father </v>

552
00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:45.370
<v Speaker 1>now and what that means in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the [inaudible] perspective,</v>

553
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:49.270
<v Speaker 1>and I think as well from the Piagetian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and perspective that you've incorporated</v>

554
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:50.403
<v Speaker 1>huge subsets of the habits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptual scheme is that make up the </v>

555
00:39:54.071 --> 00:39:57.610
<v Speaker 1>people who were closest to you in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental history.</v>

556
00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Now Freud would believe that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things can motivate you on unconsciously</v>

557
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:02.523
<v Speaker 1>in that for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be living out your parents </v>

558
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.053
<v Speaker 1>unconscious dreams or maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>living out your parents unconscious </v>

559
00:40:08.891 --> 00:40:13.891
<v Speaker 1>dreams that you'd be a bad child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens very frequently.</v>

560
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I've seen families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

561
00:40:15.971 --> 00:40:16.804
<v Speaker 1>where a daughter was born instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>son to the great dissatisfaction of the </v>

562
00:40:21.341 --> 00:40:22.174
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the consequence of that was that </v>

563
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.383
<v Speaker 1>that child was essentially demonized </v>
<v Speaker 1>from day one and to the degree to which </v>

564
00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:34.450
<v Speaker 1>that was precisely unconscious behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the part of the mother was debatable,</v>

565
00:40:34.451 --> 00:40:35.284
<v Speaker 1>but certainly if you asked her if she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was out to destroy her child with every </v>

566
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:41.470
<v Speaker 1>action she ever cooked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would say no.</v>

567
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:44.290
<v Speaker 1>But if you watched her carefully across </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

568
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.840
<v Speaker 1>you would see that that was precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>what she was doing.</v>

569
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

570
00:40:48.191 --> 00:40:50.530
<v Speaker 1>why would someone develop an attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>

571
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:51.603
<v Speaker 1>And this particular person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother had grown up in a culture </v>

572
00:40:55.270 --> 00:41:00.270
<v Speaker 1>where boys were more valued than girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly within the confines of a given</v>

573
00:41:02.321 --> 00:41:04.680
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she'd already had daughter.</v>

574
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.950
<v Speaker 1>So was that her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the culture?</v>

575
00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Was it something that she picked up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whom parents,</v>

576
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.423
<v Speaker 1>God only knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with this free floating spirit in a </v>

577
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:16.084
<v Speaker 1>sense that happened to inhabit her and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped the way that she was interacting </v>

578
00:41:19.181 --> 00:41:20.014
<v Speaker 1>with the world without her really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding what she was doing at an </v>

579
00:41:24.041 --> 00:41:25.750
<v Speaker 1>articulated level at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

580
00:41:25.751 --> 00:41:26.584
<v Speaker 1>if you ever more or less confronted her </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the evidence that she was doing </v>

581
00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:30.124
<v Speaker 1>such a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did out solutely everything you </v>

582
00:41:32.081 --> 00:41:32.914
<v Speaker 1>could possibly to refuse to take any </v>
<v Speaker 1>ownership for that whatsoever or to </v>

583
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:38.294
<v Speaker 1>articulate it or even to conceive that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being might be capable of such a </v>

584
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:43.634
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the situation to her and </v>

585
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:48.890
<v Speaker 1>family made a polling look like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation.</v>

586
00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

587
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:51.913
<v Speaker 1>Creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unconscious serves as the Matrix of </v>

588
00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 1>new ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

589
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:58.040
<v Speaker 1>here's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do your thoughts come from?</v>

590
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

591
00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.460
<v Speaker 1>you say you think them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

592
00:42:02.461 --> 00:42:05.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as black sexplanations goal,</v>

593
00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.590
<v Speaker 1>that's a prime one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

594
00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.320
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean you think of them off </v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

595
00:42:10.321 --> 00:42:12.060
<v Speaker 1>pointed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not even accurate.</v>

596
00:42:12.061 --> 00:42:15.660
<v Speaker 1>It's more like they appear in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience more or less.</v>

597
00:42:15.661 --> 00:42:16.494
<v Speaker 1>Unbidden you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny thing because you can </v>

598
00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:19.494
<v Speaker 1>concentrate and that seems to facilitate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process of the generation of new </v>

599
00:42:22.801 --> 00:42:23.634
<v Speaker 1>ideas at least sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time it just seems like </v>

600
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you're standing in a room by yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark and the thought comes.</v>

601
00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.630
<v Speaker 1>And where does it come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

602
00:42:33.631 --> 00:42:37.690
<v Speaker 1>The psychoanalytic explanation for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more of a description is tall.</v>

603
00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It comes from the unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the unconscious that's producing</v>

604
00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:44.310
<v Speaker 1>those Mytho poetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious constructs,</v>

605
00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:47.570
<v Speaker 1>narratives and fantasies that appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythic or roulette,</v>

606
00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:48.443
<v Speaker 1>religious in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means at least in part is </v>

607
00:42:53.431 --> 00:42:54.264
<v Speaker 1>that some of the dissociated fragments </v>
<v Speaker 1>of personality say that inhabit you and </v>

608
00:43:01.561 --> 00:43:06.561
<v Speaker 1>guide your actions are so ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because of their biological basis</v>

609
00:43:06.841 --> 00:43:11.160
<v Speaker 1>and part of that because of the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical overlay on top of that,</v>

610
00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:12.323
<v Speaker 1>that they take the form of great myths </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stories that look like they're </v>

611
00:43:17.131 --> 00:43:20.670
<v Speaker 1>common to everyone in one form or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

612
00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:21.923
<v Speaker 1>So for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a good example of that might be </v>

613
00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:29.730
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which you are possessed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rivalry with your sibling,</v>

614
00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:33.420
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the oldest stories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

615
00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.293
<v Speaker 1>the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual members of mankind tell </v>

616
00:43:36.401 --> 00:43:41.400
<v Speaker 1>it to one another because it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>common experience and because the manner</v>

617
00:43:41.401 --> 00:43:42.234
<v Speaker 1>in which that experience is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself has been shaped by </v>

618
00:43:45.181 --> 00:43:46.660
<v Speaker 1>cultural representation.</v>

619
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:51.103
<v Speaker 1>Freud was also very much convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind was a composite of </v>

620
00:43:53.661 --> 00:43:54.494
<v Speaker 1>contradictory drives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very interesting proposition </v>

621
00:43:57.811 --> 00:44:00.170
<v Speaker 1>and I think one that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can,</v>

622
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.123
<v Speaker 1>you can see it most particularly if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider the behavior of two year olds </v>

623
00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:07.070
<v Speaker 1>and as I've already discussed with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch a two year old,</v>

624
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:11.480
<v Speaker 1>they rapidly cycle from one intensely </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated state to another.</v>

625
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.780
<v Speaker 1>And I think I'm reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing that is that much of the</v>

626
00:44:17.061 --> 00:44:22.061
<v Speaker 1>underlying biology of the two year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>is already in place in terms of it's his</v>

627
00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:27.620
<v Speaker 1>or her fundamental motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two year old can be hungry in a two year</v>

628
00:44:27.621 --> 00:44:28.454
<v Speaker 1>old can be hot or colder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable in a variety of different </v>

629
00:44:31.711 --> 00:44:36.711
<v Speaker 1>ways or feel pain or feel anxiety or </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel joy or feel exhilaration.</v>

630
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Your curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your surprise,</v>

631
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:39.773
<v Speaker 1>all that circuitry is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not integrated at a higher </v>

632
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:45.900
<v Speaker 1>level into a functioning personality.</v>

633
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Because in part what the functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality is is a collective agreement</v>

634
00:44:52.261 --> 00:44:57.261
<v Speaker 1>among all those fundamental drives as to</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is going to take priority when and</v>

635
00:44:57.991 --> 00:44:58.824
<v Speaker 1>under what conditions and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration of that with the entire </v>

636
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 1>broader cultural meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

637
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.531
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

638
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:12.531
<v Speaker 1>by the time your two year old is for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would expect them to be able to rate</v>

639
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.673
<v Speaker 1>self regulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means when they step into a </v>

640
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:17.723
<v Speaker 1>particular circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be able to determine which </v>

641
00:45:20.341 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 1>of their motivational states is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be allowed to manifest itself.</v>

642
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.170
<v Speaker 1>We would think about that as a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned inhibition,</v>

643
00:45:28.171 --> 00:45:29.004
<v Speaker 1>even though it's really not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like the integration of those </v>

644
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:36.950
<v Speaker 1>motivated states into a higher order </v>
<v Speaker 1>game where each of them gets a chance to</v>

645
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:38.003
<v Speaker 1>express themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only in a particular order and only </v>

646
00:45:40.021 --> 00:45:44.070
<v Speaker 1>under particular circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the four year old has</v>

647
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:44.904
<v Speaker 1>to have learned to do that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of other children and in the </v>

648
00:45:47.491 --> 00:45:49.410
<v Speaker 1>presence of other adults.</v>

649
00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:50.483
<v Speaker 1>So that that fundamental motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures are integrated into a higher </v>

650
00:45:55.771 --> 00:45:56.604
<v Speaker 1>order structure that allows everybody to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get along just fine and for everyone to </v>

651
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:02.400
<v Speaker 1>pursue the things that they need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue.</v>

652
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:04.103
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason you might think that </v>

653
00:46:07.561 --> 00:46:08.394
<v Speaker 1>you have a cortex is so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the more fundamental elements of </v>

654
00:46:13.921 --> 00:46:14.754
<v Speaker 1>your drives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could think of as part of the </v>

655
00:46:16.111 --> 00:46:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Friday and Ed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means it.</v>

656
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.433
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that in you isn't you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the things that you're subject to </v>

657
00:46:23.011 --> 00:46:23.844
<v Speaker 1>from within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that you have a cortex in </v>

658
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:30.990
<v Speaker 1>many ways is so that you can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to integrate those complex states of</v>

659
00:46:30.991 --> 00:46:31.824
<v Speaker 1>being that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that keep you alive in some fundamental </v>

660
00:46:35.071 --> 00:46:35.904
<v Speaker 1>sense into a society that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by hundreds or thousands </v>

661
00:46:41.551 --> 00:46:44.490
<v Speaker 1>of other creatures trying to do the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing at the same time.</v>

662
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.713
<v Speaker 1>And so you can imagine that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires particular adaptation to the </v>

663
00:46:48.811 --> 00:46:53.340
<v Speaker 1>particulars of this society and that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more general functions of the,</v>

664
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.570
<v Speaker 1>of the deep end.</v>

665
00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:00.410
<v Speaker 1>So the unconscious is partly the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this collection of drives,</v>

666
00:47:01.441 --> 00:47:02.274
<v Speaker 1>Freud concentrated mark mostly on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual drives and the aggressive drives </v>

667
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.220
<v Speaker 1>because those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or instincts,</v>

668
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.350
<v Speaker 1>the sexual instincts and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive instincts.</v>

669
00:47:10.351 --> 00:47:11.184
<v Speaker 1>It's a better term that drive because </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the most difficult to </v>

670
00:47:14.911 --> 00:47:15.744
<v Speaker 1>integrate into the surrounding social </v>
<v Speaker 1>male you because sex for example is a </v>

671
00:47:20.401 --> 00:47:21.234
<v Speaker 1>pretty selfish act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't an altruistic act in any </v>

672
00:47:24.991 --> 00:47:28.440
<v Speaker 1>sentence and in some sense it's also a </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero sum game.</v>

673
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:29.483
<v Speaker 1>You're in competition with everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your success at that particular </v>

674
00:47:33.641 --> 00:47:34.474
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say the same thing about </v>

675
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:36.184
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you think about it in </v>

676
00:47:37.901 --> 00:47:38.734
<v Speaker 1>relationship to dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy striving because there are </v>

677
00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 1>very few positions in any given </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy that are at the talk</v>

678
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:47.883
<v Speaker 1>and so in some ways the competition is </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero sum and it's every person against </v>

679
00:47:52.151 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 1>every other person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well that's happening.</v>

680
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 1>You have to keep the dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in place,</v>

681
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:58.833
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no sense in destroying </v>

682
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:00.664
<v Speaker 1>the structure that you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>climb and so fried points of considered </v>

683
00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 1>constantly that this is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult process of integration.</v>

684
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.693
<v Speaker 1>He also points out that in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that people solve that problem </v>

685
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:16.420
<v Speaker 1>is not by integrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they do instead is rip press.</v>

686
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Now repression has two elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One might be,</v>

687
00:48:20.261 --> 00:48:23.860
<v Speaker 1>and this is maybe more what's dealt with</v>
<v Speaker 1>by cognitive behavioral psychologist,</v>

688
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:28.930
<v Speaker 1>one form of repression is you just don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop the capacity.</v>

689
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:30.723
<v Speaker 1>So let's say</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a sophisticated child and </v>

690
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:35.764
<v Speaker 1>you're a fairly aggressive child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you learned to do is to </v>

691
00:48:39.491 --> 00:48:43.630
<v Speaker 1>integrate your aggression into the games</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you play with other people.</v>

692
00:48:43.631 --> 00:48:47.260
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you turned into a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive and skilled child,</v>

693
00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.800
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't mean precisely that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've inhibited your aggression.</v>

694
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:52.023
<v Speaker 1>It means that you've developed it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>an unbelievably sophisticated set of </v>

695
00:48:54.881 --> 00:48:55.714
<v Speaker 1>skills so that you can manifest it </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the games that people play </v>

696
00:48:59.140 --> 00:48:59.973
<v Speaker 1>without blowing the games apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can be a competitive and skilled </v>

697
00:49:03.161 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball player,</v>

698
00:49:04.481 --> 00:49:05.314
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can be extremely aggressive or a </v>

699
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:07.264
<v Speaker 1>hockey player or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everyone still wants to play with </v>

700
00:49:09.971 --> 00:49:11.880
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that the,</v>

701
00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.153
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been no repression of the </v>

702
00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:15.724
<v Speaker 1>aggression drive or limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just being integrated into all the </v>

703
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 1>things that it could conceivably </v>
<v Speaker 1>informed.</v>

704
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.860
<v Speaker 1>The alternative to that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

705
00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:24.694
<v Speaker 1>let's say your parents said you're never</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be angry with anyone under any </v>

706
00:49:27.941 --> 00:49:31.800
<v Speaker 1>circumstances whatsoever because good </v>
<v Speaker 1>people never get nap.</v>

707
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Now lots of people believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

708
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.980
<v Speaker 1>identifying the aggression with evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>

709
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:42.850
<v Speaker 1>or at least with the kinds of actions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that only people they despise engaging,</v>

710
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.983
<v Speaker 1>which generally means that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for aggression is still there </v>

711
00:49:46.871 --> 00:49:49.270
<v Speaker 1>in a very nascent and underdeveloped </v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

712
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.313
<v Speaker 1>but that they have absolutely no skills </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever that would be useful for </v>

713
00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:55.600
<v Speaker 1>integrating it into their lives.</v>

714
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:56.463
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one manifestation of the integration of </v>

715
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:01.354
<v Speaker 1>aggression is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you're negotiating for a </v>

716
00:50:04.331 --> 00:50:05.164
<v Speaker 1>jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an aggressive negotiation because </v>

717
00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:14.130
<v Speaker 1>they want you cheat and you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be taken chiefly.</v>

718
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:21.490
<v Speaker 1>So if you're good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing on your aggressive ability,</v>

719
00:50:21.491 --> 00:50:24.040
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that you figure out is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

720
00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 1>how is it that I can say no in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiation and meaning,</v>

721
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.220
<v Speaker 1>which is an aggressive act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want something from me and I just</v>

722
00:50:31.221 --> 00:50:32.054
<v Speaker 1>say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then at minimum I'm putting up a wall </v>

723
00:50:35.301 --> 00:50:36.134
<v Speaker 1>that you don't get to cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're negotiating with someone </v>

724
00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:40.304
<v Speaker 1>and you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose and then people walk all over </v>

725
00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:45.074
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what's going to happen to your </v>

726
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:48.710
<v Speaker 1>aggression is it's going to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in resentment,</v>

727
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:49.990
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

728
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.780
<v Speaker 1>a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

729
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:55.210
<v Speaker 1>unproductive form of aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then according to Freud,</v>

730
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a very accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>

731
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:58.723
<v Speaker 1>That resentment is going to drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>leakages of aggressive behavior </v>

732
00:51:01.611 --> 00:51:04.880
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll come home from the negotiation</v>

733
00:51:04.881 --> 00:51:07.250
<v Speaker 1>where you didn't get the salary that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve,</v>

734
00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.093
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your husband or your wife will say some </v>

735
00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:15.330
<v Speaker 1>little niggling thing that's under most </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances wouldn't bother anyone.</v>

736
00:51:15.331 --> 00:51:17.360
<v Speaker 1>And poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a big fight,</v>

737
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:22.370
<v Speaker 1>which is not very helpful and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even know why it happens.</v>

738
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.690
<v Speaker 1>And that would be part of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously motivated.</v>

739
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.610
<v Speaker 1>And this sort of thing happens all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

740
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:29.623
<v Speaker 1>It seems to especially happen with </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like aggression because if you </v>

741
00:51:31.881 --> 00:51:34.730
<v Speaker 1>get picked on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:51:34.731 --> 00:51:38.720
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each time that happens,</v>

743
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:40.873
<v Speaker 1>the mechanisms will say they're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive aggressive aggression </v>

744
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.640
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms that reside in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>

745
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.833
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of noting that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking dominance hierarchy blows and </v>

746
00:51:52.341 --> 00:51:53.174
<v Speaker 1>being pushed down that structure where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unsafe cause you don't want to be </v>

747
00:51:56.271 --> 00:51:59.840
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that system is,</v>

748
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.273
<v Speaker 1>has a proclivity more and more to grab </v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior and your perception and </v>

749
00:52:05.571 --> 00:52:06.404
<v Speaker 1>react as it should because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be pushed down the dominance </v>

750
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:08.780
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

751
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:09.613
<v Speaker 1>And then if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if enough darts have been thrown at you </v>

752
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:13.604
<v Speaker 1>for that a pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then someone will push you over </v>

753
00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:17.150
<v Speaker 1>threshold and Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all hell break loose,</v>

754
00:52:17.151 --> 00:52:17.984
<v Speaker 1>but it's very unsophisticated his </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and it's likely to work at </v>

755
00:52:22.431 --> 00:52:26.570
<v Speaker 1>cross purposes to the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be achieved if those impulses</v>

756
00:52:26.571 --> 00:52:28.970
<v Speaker 1>were properly integrated into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

757
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:32.210
<v Speaker 1>So from the [inaudible] perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer would never be shy.</v>

758
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Don't be aggressive part of it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that choice.</v>

759
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:38.690
<v Speaker 1>The answer would be if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be aggressive,</v>

760
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 1>which you need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that protects you,</v>

761
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:41.563
<v Speaker 1>then be sophisticated about it and don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend that it isn't there and people </v>

762
00:52:45.501 --> 00:52:47.780
<v Speaker 1>do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of repression.</v>

763
00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.153
<v Speaker 1>Part of what Freud described as </v>
<v Speaker 1>repression can ease Maura simply be </v>

764
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:57.140
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized just as self deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell yourself,</v>

765
00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.033
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that sort of person and the </v>

766
00:52:59.901 --> 00:53:02.090
<v Speaker 1>truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes you are,</v>

767
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:03.043
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a deeper truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath that which is not only are </v>

768
00:53:05.961 --> 00:53:06.794
<v Speaker 1>you but you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that applies on the dimension of </v>

769
00:53:10.941 --> 00:53:13.370
<v Speaker 1>aggression and on the dimension of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality.</v>

770
00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Because another thing that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about is,</v>

771
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:19.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many marriages break down because of</v>

772
00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:20.384
<v Speaker 1>infidelity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the answer to that is a </v>

773
00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:28.901
<v Speaker 1>substantial proportion often because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage cannot tolerate even one act of</v>

774
00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 1>infidelity mean if it's hidden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>

775
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:32.664
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the marriage could still survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you know it's on very </v>

776
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.653
<v Speaker 1>unstable ground at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the act of infidelity is exposed </v>

777
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:41.903
<v Speaker 1>or admitted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the contractual relationship at </v>

778
00:53:45.421 --> 00:53:46.254
<v Speaker 1>that point becomes radically unclear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to maintain a </v>

779
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:51.900
<v Speaker 1>marriage relationship after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

780
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:53.100
<v Speaker 1>you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

781
00:53:53.101 --> 00:53:57.900
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you start such a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>from happening and a psychoanalytic act,</v>

782
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:00.540
<v Speaker 1>a psychoanalytic answer would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

783
00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:03.630
<v Speaker 1>don't try to be too good in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

784
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.290
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Friday's would mean by that is,</v>

785
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.333
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be the sort of 1950s </v>

786
00:54:11.311 --> 00:54:15.620
<v Speaker 1>couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of whom sleeps in a different bed.</v>

787
00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.233
<v Speaker 1>Because even though that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfill some restricted notions of </v>

788
00:54:22.771 --> 00:54:27.420
<v Speaker 1>propriety and purity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probable probability that it will</v>

789
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:31.003
<v Speaker 1>satiate the more instinctive sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>desires that necessarily manifest </v>

790
00:54:35.511 --> 00:54:36.344
<v Speaker 1>themselves and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also make up part of what makes </v>

791
00:54:39.561 --> 00:54:43.370
<v Speaker 1>life Dionysian and rich instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational adult.</v>

792
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.413
<v Speaker 1>Those things have to be integrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the marriage and that means that </v>

793
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.033
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is often a difficult thing </v>

794
00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:55.370
<v Speaker 1>for men to do because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is less true than it was,</v>

795
00:54:55.371 --> 00:54:56.330
<v Speaker 1>but I doubt it</v>

796
00:54:58.770 --> 00:54:59.603
<v Speaker 1>does a difference between the category </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and the category mistress and the </v>

797
00:55:03.211 --> 00:55:05.430
<v Speaker 1>wife's category is sort of the pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

798
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's like mother or maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like sister or maybe it's like,</v>

799
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.190
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the mistress category,</v>

800
00:55:11.191 --> 00:55:12.024
<v Speaker 1>which is more like stripper or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitute or or temptress or something </v>

801
00:55:16.081 --> 00:55:17.880
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

802
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:21.990
<v Speaker 1>if each category is completely separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the other,</v>

803
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.780
<v Speaker 1>then if you were in the merit married </v>
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

804
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:28.410
<v Speaker 1>the mistress category is going to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking pretty attractive.</v>

805
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.660
<v Speaker 1>And so the trick is to get those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated,</v>

806
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:31.643
<v Speaker 1>but that also means that the man and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship has to foster the </v>

807
00:55:34.561 --> 00:55:38.910
<v Speaker 1>development of the mistress and his wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>and often his moral propriety.</v>

808
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:39.744
<v Speaker 1>We'll stop that from happening or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>his jealousy because one of the things </v>

809
00:55:42.781 --> 00:55:44.250
<v Speaker 1>that you see happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

810
00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:45.093
<v Speaker 1>in in marriages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the wife starts to make yourself and </v>

811
00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:48.324
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this can also be reversed if the wife </v>

812
00:55:49.771 --> 00:55:51.900
<v Speaker 1>starts to make herself look more </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>

813
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:56.040
<v Speaker 1>perhaps to get in better physical shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dress better,</v>

814
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:57.203
<v Speaker 1>to look more attractive and public to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree that the husband is insecure </v>

815
00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:02.243
<v Speaker 1>and feeling inferior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll interfere with that because he's </v>

816
00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:05.940
<v Speaker 1>afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gets more attractive.</v>

817
00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Then she'll attract someone who will </v>
<v Speaker 1>take her away from him.</v>

818
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:10.043
<v Speaker 1>So he'll do everything he can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously ensure the cheese is </v>

819
00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:17.550
<v Speaker 1>oppressed and Downey as she can possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>be so that at least she doesn't run away</v>

820
00:56:17.551 --> 00:56:18.384
<v Speaker 1>from him screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a standard for the </v>

821
00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:22.863
<v Speaker 1>unentangled weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that's very characteristic of </v>

822
00:56:25.091 --> 00:56:25.924
<v Speaker 1>many close relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the same things often say </v>

823
00:56:28.541 --> 00:56:33.541
<v Speaker 1>between parents and children where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother or the father are afraid that the</v>

824
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:38.960
<v Speaker 1>child will surpass them in some way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave them and that's the Friday and eat</v>

825
00:56:38.961 --> 00:56:39.794
<v Speaker 1>apples situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If either parent is afraid that the </v>

826
00:56:41.771 --> 00:56:44.770
<v Speaker 1>child will leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the parents will do everything they</v>

827
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:45.604
<v Speaker 1>can to undermine every movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever towards the child's </v>

828
00:56:48.611 --> 00:56:53.611
<v Speaker 1>independence and keep them infantiles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the infant title highs child becomes</v>

829
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:55.624
<v Speaker 1>dependent but unbelievably resentful as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should because the parent is doing </v>

830
00:56:59.741 --> 00:57:00.574
<v Speaker 1>everything they can unconsciously to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that the best part of the child </v>

831
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:05.080
<v Speaker 1>is never allowed to develop.</v>

832
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's an unbelievably common </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurrence.</v>

833
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:08.943
<v Speaker 1>Freud believed that was characteristic </v>
<v Speaker 1>of most families and that was partly </v>

834
00:57:11.651 --> 00:57:12.484
<v Speaker 1>because of the long developmental period</v>
<v Speaker 1>that children need in order to become </v>

835
00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.530
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more complexity.</v>

836
00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:25.590
<v Speaker 1>It was because the dynamics between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father and the mother may be impaired in</v>

837
00:57:26.441 --> 00:57:31.300
<v Speaker 1>one fashion or another sexually or from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a perspective of communication or in any</v>

838
00:57:31.301 --> 00:57:33.670
<v Speaker 1>of the ways that people can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>mismatched.</v>

839
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:37.780
<v Speaker 1>And maybe as well the couple's isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat friendless.</v>

840
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:38.793
<v Speaker 1>And so there are many things that I need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be accruing to themselves in order </v>

841
00:57:42.971 --> 00:57:45.460
<v Speaker 1>for the mice to be full and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them.</v>

842
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:46.353
<v Speaker 1>And so then they turned to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>children for more attention than they </v>

843
00:57:48.821 --> 00:57:50.350
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

844
00:57:50.351 --> 00:57:53.680
<v Speaker 1>And encourage their children to pay more</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to them then they should.</v>

845
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And then from the Freudian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that the whole,</v>

846
00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:01.203
<v Speaker 1>I'm conscious dynamic and fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the household becomes </v>

847
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:10.950
<v Speaker 1>extremely pathologized so that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that what people are acting out so to</v>

848
00:58:14.101 --> 00:58:18.390
<v Speaker 1>speak is this weird intermingling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

849
00:58:18.391 --> 00:58:21.150
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>child and lover,</v>

850
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:24.840
<v Speaker 1>where none of the roles aren't clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and were,</v>

851
00:58:24.841 --> 00:58:27.120
<v Speaker 1>none of the roles are clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguished from one another.</v>

852
00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:28.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a mess,</v>

853
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:34.003
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a situation that's very much </v>

854
00:58:35.271 --> 00:58:36.104
<v Speaker 1>facilitated by deceit on the part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents because maybe the husband asks </v>

855
00:58:41.361 --> 00:58:42.530
<v Speaker 1>the wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

856
00:58:42.531 --> 00:58:44.540
<v Speaker 1>are you happy deer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>

857
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:46.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course everything's always going well</v>

858
00:58:46.461 --> 00:58:49.800
<v Speaker 1>in our house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What she means is I'd like to take out a</v>

859
00:58:49.801 --> 00:58:52.400
<v Speaker 1>knife and stab you 50 cartons of laundry</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sleep,</v>

860
00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.760
<v Speaker 1>but she doesn't regard that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate verbal statement.</v>

861
00:58:55.761 --> 00:58:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Even though it might be something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's fantasizing about deeply,</v>

862
00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for for hours a day,</v>

863
00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:04.640
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way that's going to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to light.</v>

864
00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:05.474
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

865
00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:06.313
<v Speaker 1>you can see these sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening if you pay attention to your </v>

866
00:59:09.051 --> 00:59:09.884
<v Speaker 1>fantasy life from a Freudian perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll see if you could catch </v>

867
00:59:13.041 --> 00:59:13.874
<v Speaker 1>flashes of fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're frustrated or </v>

868
00:59:16.191 --> 00:59:18.890
<v Speaker 1>disappointed or annoyed or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't gone your way,</v>

869
00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 1>you'll have little stories branch in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>

870
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.690
<v Speaker 1>And those are these underlying it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

871
00:59:24.691 --> 00:59:28.010
<v Speaker 1>since systems that are trying to inform </v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior,</v>

872
00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:28.844
<v Speaker 1>but they're kind of one sided and single</v>
<v Speaker 1>minded and fantasies that they pop up </v>

873
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:37.520
<v Speaker 1>can be pathologically aggressive or say </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologically sexual,</v>

874
00:59:37.521 --> 00:59:38.354
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're attempting to make a case for a </v>

875
00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 1>motive being that needs to be integrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>into your personality.</v>

876
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing that Freud's noted </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying,</v>

877
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 1>the less sexual you are as an integrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

878
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:58.360
<v Speaker 1>the more sexuality will manifest itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has pathologized in your fantasy.</v>

879
00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.253
<v Speaker 1>It's partly because in some sense it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to scream very loudly to get your </v>

880
01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:05.810
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also because</v>

881
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.770
<v Speaker 1>if you refuse to allow something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>

882
01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:15.970
<v Speaker 1>healthy pal path of development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just going to go away.</v>

883
01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>If you put a potato in the cellar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you put shine very dim light on it,</v>

884
01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:21.754
<v Speaker 1>all you get are these white spindly </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoots that are hideous and and you </v>

885
01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:28.540
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the polling.</v>

886
01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:29.523
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is trying to live and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing applies from the Freudian </v>

887
01:00:33.191 --> 01:00:37.210
<v Speaker 1>perspective to the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctual motivations that drive human</v>

888
01:00:37.211 --> 01:00:38.044
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they can be deeply </v>

889
01:00:40.121 --> 01:00:44.530
<v Speaker 1>pathologized to the degree that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not allowed to be properly expressed.</v>

890
01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.220
<v Speaker 1>And then you can get more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissociated from them so that it becomes</v>

891
01:00:48.221 --> 01:00:53.221
<v Speaker 1>an increasing war between family sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are developing more and more to the</v>

892
01:00:56.321 --> 01:00:57.154
<v Speaker 1>pathological side and the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is doing everything it can to </v>

893
01:01:01.181 --> 01:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>increasingly defend itself from those </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizations.</v>

894
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:06.363
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

895
01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>here's a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a list.</v>

896
01:01:22.711 --> 01:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>This is a good list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very good list to think about.</v>

897
01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:26.573
<v Speaker 1>Here are some of the voluntary</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions that people undertake in order </v>

898
01:01:33.781 --> 01:01:34.614
<v Speaker 1>to ensure that the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both as a repository of instinctual </v>

899
01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>motivation and as a repository of memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes as pathological as possible.</v>

900
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>And so one way of thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>froggy and unconscious,</v>

901
01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>apart from the the element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the instinct part,</v>

902
01:01:52.201 --> 01:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>this is more to do with the memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>element is,</v>

903
01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.313
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people engage in something that's </v>

904
01:01:57.391 --> 01:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they conscious of it?</v>

905
01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>And the Floridians would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

906
01:02:01.591 --> 01:02:02.424
<v Speaker 1>generally not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean they weren't </v>

907
01:02:04.561 --> 01:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>conscious of it when they first did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the decision,</v>

908
01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like the decision to lie is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

909
01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>You may forget that you did it and only </v>
<v Speaker 1>be</v>

910
01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>moving forward through the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>of having engaged in it,</v>

911
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that you've made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>habitual and that there are consequences</v>

912
01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>may be something you forget and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes unconscious.</v>

913
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't mean you didn't know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were doing when you first did it.</v>

914
01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.453
<v Speaker 1>And so here are some of the little nasty</v>
<v Speaker 1>tricks that people play on each other </v>

915
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>and on themselves in order to ensure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't accurately represent the</v>

916
01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>nature of their experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask yourself,</v>

917
01:02:42.511 --> 01:02:43.344
<v Speaker 1>what is accurate representation mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given that there's no way you can ever </v>

918
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:47.754
<v Speaker 1>have a coherent and complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of anything that ever </v>

919
01:02:50.071 --> 01:02:50.904
<v Speaker 1>happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one rule of thumb for that is </v>

920
01:02:53.431 --> 01:02:54.264
<v Speaker 1>that what you've accurately represented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's happened to you that </v>

921
01:02:57.511 --> 01:02:58.344
<v Speaker 1>was negative in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you represented it such that you're </v>

922
01:03:01.351 --> 01:03:02.184
<v Speaker 1>not going to do it again in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the purpose of memory in large </v>

923
01:03:05.161 --> 01:03:05.994
<v Speaker 1>part is to stop you from doing the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid things that you've already done </v>

924
01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:12.240
<v Speaker 1>again in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not purely representational,</v>

925
01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:12.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

926
01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.860
<v Speaker 1>It's adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're twisting and distorting</v>

927
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:18.023
<v Speaker 1>your memory so that they're more </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable to you from a conceptual </v>

928
01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:21.624
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not developing in this direction </v>

929
01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>that would allow you to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly adaptive,</v>

930
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:29.790
<v Speaker 1>well then you're engaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're likely engaging in one or more of</v>

931
01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:31.950
<v Speaker 1>these processes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>

932
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.473
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repression is that you just don't admit </v>

933
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:36.444
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think mostly what happens when people </v>

934
01:03:37.861 --> 01:03:40.680
<v Speaker 1>repress is not so much that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>actively repressed.</v>

935
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.693
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do something and they remember it </v>

936
01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:45.143
<v Speaker 1>and then they push it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that they do something and there </v>

937
01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:48.834
<v Speaker 1>are some consequences and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences are complex and maybe </v>

938
01:03:51.211 --> 01:03:52.044
<v Speaker 1>they're motivated and then they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think about it anymore because </v>

939
01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:59.760
<v Speaker 1>it's easy not to think about something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't think about it.</v>

940
01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.740
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>

941
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.350
<v Speaker 1>although this isn't a precisely Friday </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea,</v>

942
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.680
<v Speaker 1>the default position is repression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

943
01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:08.514
<v Speaker 1>because most of the things that you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>are complex and they require </v>

944
01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:12.570
<v Speaker 1>articulation and an ordered to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

945
01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.613
<v Speaker 1>You can just avoid engaging in that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the nasty little situation will </v>

946
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:18.683
<v Speaker 1>remain sort of emotionally vaillant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to pop up in your memory </v>

947
01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:24.750
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the sorts of things that maybe</v>

948
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.130
<v Speaker 1>you remember that happened more than 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago that still cause an emotional</v>

949
01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:29.964
<v Speaker 1>response when you bring them to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good clue that there's </v>

950
01:04:32.761 --> 01:04:35.490
<v Speaker 1>something there that you have not </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated.</v>

951
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's because you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

952
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.300
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it's just because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

953
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

954
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to make sense out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the occurrence.</v>

955
01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you were bullied law when you were</v>

956
01:04:44.971 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 1>13 it's still bothers you when you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

957
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but you still haven't been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out exactly why</v>

958
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:52.920
<v Speaker 1>denied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

959
01:04:52.921 --> 01:04:53.754
<v Speaker 1>that's just outright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're dealing with a </v>

960
01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:57.720
<v Speaker 1>teenager and they're lying and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you lying?</v>

961
01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.650
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

962
01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the end of that reaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>formation.</v>

963
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a sneaky when.</v>

964
01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:06.480
<v Speaker 1>So Freud would observe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

965
01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:07.314
<v Speaker 1>in sibling relationships where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one sibling is extremely irritated at </v>

966
01:05:10.981 --> 01:05:11.814
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way they cover that up to </v>

967
01:05:13.351 --> 01:05:16.920
<v Speaker 1>themselves and other people is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>overdoing it in the other direction.</v>

968
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:18.483
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a husband is having some serious </v>

969
01:05:22.271 --> 01:05:23.104
<v Speaker 1>second thoughts about his wife and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he does in order to stay unconscious of </v>

970
01:05:26.891 --> 01:05:27.724
<v Speaker 1>that particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of reality is act with excessive </v>

971
01:05:32.651 --> 01:05:33.484
<v Speaker 1>care towards or whenever they go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's always a false and it's </v>

972
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

973
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>if your antenna are up at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing,</v>

974
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:40.503
<v Speaker 1>actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's worse for me because I've </v>

975
01:05:44.111 --> 01:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>seen this so often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sensitive to it,</v>

976
01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:46.551
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read,</v>

977
01:05:46.551 --> 01:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>it turns my stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

978
01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>when you see this is saccharin falseness</v>
<v Speaker 1>with which people treat each other,</v>

979
01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something gone,</v>

980
01:05:53.921 --> 01:05:54.754
<v Speaker 1>awful brewing right underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface and neither of them will admit </v>

981
01:05:56.891 --> 01:05:57.691
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

982
01:05:57.691 --> 01:05:59.800
<v Speaker 1>a good fistfight would do them a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

983
01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:00.843
<v Speaker 1>but instead they'll just karcher each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other to death with politeness for two </v>

984
01:06:03.341 --> 01:06:04.270
<v Speaker 1>or three decades.</v>

985
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:07.660
<v Speaker 1>So displacement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laurie talked about that.</v>

986
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my boss yells at me,</v>

987
01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I yell at my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my husband yells at the baby,</v>

988
01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:12.553
<v Speaker 1>the baby bites the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of movement of the problem </v>

989
01:06:15.281 --> 01:06:16.540
<v Speaker 1>down the dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

990
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.020
<v Speaker 1>identification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

991
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.093
<v Speaker 1>you're bullied in school and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start bullying kids that are younger </v>

992
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:26.410
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rationalization.</v>

993
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good one.</v>

994
01:06:27.611 --> 01:06:29.770
<v Speaker 1>If your intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all those of you,</v>

995
01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:32.470
<v Speaker 1>you're all pretty intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be neurotic,</v>

996
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.590
<v Speaker 1>the best thing to do would be to turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>your intelligence to the,</v>

997
01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:36.993
<v Speaker 1>to the function of rationalization so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you do something that is </v>

998
01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.240
<v Speaker 1>clearly not in your best interest or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else's,</v>

999
01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.313
<v Speaker 1>then you want to meditate on how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate a sequence of complex </v>

1000
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.504
<v Speaker 1>explanations that make that pathological</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior look positively altruistic and </v>

1001
01:06:54.341 --> 01:06:56.170
<v Speaker 1>then stick to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1002
01:06:56.171 --> 01:06:57.004
<v Speaker 1>as hard as you can in every argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you ever have for the rest of your </v>

1003
01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:00.244
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1004
01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:04.600
<v Speaker 1>So that's a excellent use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

1005
01:07:04.601 --> 01:07:06.730
<v Speaker 1>intellectual ization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same sort of thing.</v>

1006
01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.880
<v Speaker 1>That's usually when you dress up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurosis with philosophy.</v>

1007
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:10.923
<v Speaker 1>And so you often see that in people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of addressing their own </v>

1008
01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:16.570
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologies,</v>

1009
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:18.580
<v Speaker 1>blame them on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1010
01:07:18.581 --> 01:07:22.930
<v Speaker 1>the pathological cultural conditions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to foment revolutions of one type or</v>

1011
01:07:22.931 --> 01:07:26.260
<v Speaker 1>another because it's pretty clear that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the problem.</v>

1012
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.660
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole society that has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1013
01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And if it would just reorganize itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>around them,</v>

1014
01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:32.403
<v Speaker 1>then everything would be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a good example of this and the </v>

1015
01:07:35.321 --> 01:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic monthly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several months ago where a woman who had</v>

1016
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:44.290
<v Speaker 1>despite her best efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense not be married by the time</v>

1017
01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:48.130
<v Speaker 1>she was in her forties blamed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1018
01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:48.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire structure of Western </v>

1019
01:07:49.781 --> 01:07:53.440
<v Speaker 1>civilization for the continued failure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of her dating attempts.</v>

1020
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:54.483
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1021
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:55.803
<v Speaker 1>that might be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that before you jumped </v>

1022
01:07:58.141 --> 01:08:00.910
<v Speaker 1>to that conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might give some consideration to the</v>

1023
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:05.911
<v Speaker 1>fact that perhaps your integrally </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in that failure sublimation.</v>

1024
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:07.593
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Freud regarded this as a real </v>

1025
01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:15.410
<v Speaker 1>driving force in culture per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the quote is,</v>

1026
01:08:15.411 --> 01:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll sculpt naked women.</v>

1027
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>So Freud believed that</v>

1028
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:27.420
<v Speaker 1>instinctual motivations like sexuality </v>
<v Speaker 1>that weren't finding their expression in</v>

1029
01:08:27.421 --> 01:08:32.421
<v Speaker 1>the logical behavioral conclusion could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the energy could be channeled,</v>

1030
01:08:32.581 --> 01:08:34.860
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other sorts of pursuits.</v>

1031
01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:35.970
<v Speaker 1>And the sublimation,</v>

1032
01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.353
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1033
01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.213
<v Speaker 1>explanation is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One from an evolutionarily evolutionary </v>

1034
01:08:40.831 --> 01:08:44.760
<v Speaker 1>psychology perspective because you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>these weird things happening not only in</v>

1035
01:08:44.761 --> 01:08:47.910
<v Speaker 1>human beings but also an animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this animal verb,</v>

1036
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:49.110
<v Speaker 1>colon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bower bird.</v>

1037
01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.150
<v Speaker 1>You could look them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bauer is b.</v>

1038
01:08:51.151 --> 01:08:52.020
<v Speaker 1>O.</v>
<v Speaker 1>W.</v>

1039
01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:52.021
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>
<v Speaker 1>R.</v>

1040
01:08:52.021 --> 01:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>They're really cool burns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the males make this,</v>

1041
01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.190
<v Speaker 1>they go on the ground and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweep the ground with their wigs.</v>

1042
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>And then they built this really </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>

1043
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:02.423
<v Speaker 1>we've thing that's nest like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they make little art pictures </v>

1044
01:09:06.451 --> 01:09:07.284
<v Speaker 1>in front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they take like red leaves and they </v>

1045
01:09:08.581 --> 01:09:09.414
<v Speaker 1>put them all in a pile and then they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>find some yellow leaves and they put </v>

1046
01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>them in a pile and maybe a few rocks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some seeds and some bottle caps.</v>

1047
01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.280
<v Speaker 1>And they make this really beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>display.</v>

1048
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of them in one area that</v>

1049
01:09:19.501 --> 01:09:20.334
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the females come along and </v>

1050
01:09:21.401 --> 01:09:22.234
<v Speaker 1>they'd look at the artistic display and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at the little bird and they </v>

1051
01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:26.694
<v Speaker 1>look at the artistic display and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're happy and move in or maybe they </v>

1052
01:09:29.251 --> 01:09:32.130
<v Speaker 1>hop off to find some other bower birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little artistic production.</v>

1053
01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.060
<v Speaker 1>And the really nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these are major league efforts,</v>

1054
01:09:36.061 --> 01:09:37.770
<v Speaker 1>especially given that birds make them.</v>

1055
01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:44.380
<v Speaker 1>If the bottom bird gets visited by three</v>
<v Speaker 1>or four females and uh,</v>

1056
01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:46.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole artistic thing isn't going </v>

1057
01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:48.384
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me erase the little thing they've </v>

1058
01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>done with their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their wings and they tear apart the</v>

1059
01:09:54.721 --> 01:09:55.554
<v Speaker 1>little thing they've woven and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all depressed and then they </v>

1060
01:09:57.361 --> 01:09:59.250
<v Speaker 1>started again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1061
01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.293
<v Speaker 1>and that's a good example of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex idea called sublimation because </v>

1062
01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 1>obviously the bird is utilizing its </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative capacity to fill a sexual,</v>

1063
01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:10.613
<v Speaker 1>to fulfill a sexual instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Fried would say the sexual instinct </v>

1064
01:10:13.351 --> 01:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>is being channeled into the creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

1065
01:10:16.411 --> 01:10:19.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually relatively hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a case against that.</v>

1066
01:10:19.591 --> 01:10:22.080
<v Speaker 1>If you're a Darwinian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know for example,</v>

1067
01:10:22.081 --> 01:10:22.914
<v Speaker 1>that one of the things that makes human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings attractive to one another is </v>

1068
01:10:25.951 --> 01:10:27.090
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1069
01:10:27.091 --> 01:10:29.490
<v Speaker 1>manifested say dress and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

1070
01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.440
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what the question is,</v>

1071
01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:35.730
<v Speaker 1>is sexuality driving that at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual level,</v>

1072
01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:36.564
<v Speaker 1>which would be afraid and interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it tangled up in an even more </v>

1073
01:10:39.571 --> 01:10:40.404
<v Speaker 1>deeply at a biological level?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the whole reason that people </v>

1074
01:10:42.961 --> 01:10:46.410
<v Speaker 1>are creative is so that we're attractive</v>
<v Speaker 1>to one another and so,</v>

1075
01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:49.590
<v Speaker 1>and that drives the species and it dries</v>
<v Speaker 1>rep production.</v>

1076
01:10:49.591 --> 01:10:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And so our creative endeavor is somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangled up deeply with our,</v>

1077
01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:59.360
<v Speaker 1>with our reproductive desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly not an unreasonable</v>

1078
01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:03.213
<v Speaker 1>proposition projection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're arguing with someone when you </v>

1079
01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:09.670
<v Speaker 1>do think you guys do this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making me mad.</v>

1080
01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like you think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really interesting statement.</v>

1081
01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1082
01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:16.890
<v Speaker 1>you know it's true in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1083
01:11:16.891 --> 01:11:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Cause now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're arguing with someone who's really</v>

1084
01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 1>annoying and clearly they're making you </v>
<v Speaker 1>map.</v>

1085
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:22.103
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason they're making you mad </v>

1086
01:11:24.631 --> 01:11:25.464
<v Speaker 1>just because you're accepting that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know the structure within which the </v>

1087
01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:29.184
<v Speaker 1>argument is occurring and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were able to elicit that sort of </v>

1088
01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:33.504
<v Speaker 1>response from you means that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of circumstance plays a </v>

1089
01:11:38.341 --> 01:11:41.460
<v Speaker 1>causal role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a complex form of projection.</v>

1090
01:11:41.461 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 1>A simpler form of projection is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1091
01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:46.410
<v Speaker 1>you just don't think about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not touchy.</v>

1092
01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:47.244
<v Speaker 1>The other person's annoying and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments are actually about settling </v>

1093
01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:53.070
<v Speaker 1>that you're touching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1094
01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:54.660
<v Speaker 1>you're annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1095
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 1>you're touchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1096
01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.730
<v Speaker 1>you're annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1097
01:11:56.731 --> 01:11:58.610
<v Speaker 1>how do you ever settle that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1098
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:02.910
<v Speaker 1>usually you start dishing out even </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger in salt,</v>

1099
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:05.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are you annoying,</v>

1100
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.500
<v Speaker 1>but you annoy lots of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just me know.</v>

1101
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.413
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny kind of projection because </v>

1102
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:14.843
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use it often isn't precisely clear </v>

1103
01:12:16.921 --> 01:12:19.410
<v Speaker 1>who started or who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact at fault.</v>

1104
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:20.423
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a comprehensive listing of </v>

1105
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Freudian Defense mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a bad one.</v>

1106
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Unconscious ideas are at the core of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological conflicts.</v>

1107
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do psychosomatic.</v>

1108
01:12:46.731 --> 01:12:49.100
<v Speaker 1>One sort of thing is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

1109
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:52.310
<v Speaker 1>So I had a client once who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a real fun time,</v>

1110
01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll change the story a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1111
01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:57.013
<v Speaker 1>she was at a job that she had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>training yet for a long period of time </v>

1112
01:13:00.471 --> 01:13:02.090
<v Speaker 1>and she thought she was doing pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1113
01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.133
<v Speaker 1>but they fired her and then they packed </v>
<v Speaker 1>her up and put her on her bicycle to go </v>

1114
01:13:06.801 --> 01:13:07.634
<v Speaker 1>home the same day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the way home she drove her </v>

1115
01:13:10.101 --> 01:13:13.610
<v Speaker 1>bicycle down a ravine and and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crashed into a tree.</v>

1116
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:16.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's real fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a one two punch.</v>

1117
01:13:16.071 --> 01:13:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

1118
01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:21.200
<v Speaker 1>your job disappears and then how's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>just barely not recovering from that.</v>

1119
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Then Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get hurt.</v>

1120
01:13:23.151 --> 01:13:25.520
<v Speaker 1>And she was quite hurt as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the accident.</v>

1121
01:13:25.521 --> 01:13:29.240
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had come to see me for,</v>

1122
01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.430
<v Speaker 1>was looked like post traumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>

1123
01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:34.293
<v Speaker 1>But there was a bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a bit of underlying thought </v>

1124
01:13:36.661 --> 01:13:38.610
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was sort of associated with it.</v>

1125
01:13:38.611 --> 01:13:39.444
<v Speaker 1>But to make a long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that she did when she </v>

1126
01:13:42.331 --> 01:13:44.310
<v Speaker 1>came to see me when she was always like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1127
01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:45.693
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found this very bothersome after a </v>

1128
01:13:48.561 --> 01:13:50.490
<v Speaker 1>while because of mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was mirroring.</v>

1129
01:13:50.491 --> 01:13:53.250
<v Speaker 1>So she'd come in here like this and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make me uncomfortable.</v>

1130
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:57.750
<v Speaker 1>And one day I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had mentioned this to her and she said</v>

1131
01:13:57.751 --> 01:13:58.584
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thought she had hurt her arm and </v>

1132
01:13:59.611 --> 01:14:03.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe she had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I started getting her to move her</v>

1133
01:14:03.031 --> 01:14:03.864
<v Speaker 1>arm little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she moved with like this and then </v>

1134
01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:08.700
<v Speaker 1>she'd move it like this and then she'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>move it like this and she was getting so</v>

1135
01:14:08.701 --> 01:14:09.870
<v Speaker 1>she could move it pretty well.</v>

1136
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.033
<v Speaker 1>And then the next time she came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was still like this and I got this </v>

1137
01:14:13.271 --> 01:14:15.490
<v Speaker 1>weird impulse and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1138
01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:17.560
<v Speaker 1>come over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just stand.</v>

1139
01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I've seen her for like years by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point and said,</v>

1140
01:14:19.511 --> 01:14:22.480
<v Speaker 1>just stand wide my desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she stood like this and I sort of</v>

1141
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.840
<v Speaker 1>pounded my fist down her spine and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>cried for like 45 minutes.</v>

1142
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.463
<v Speaker 1>So that was pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like light light and then </v>

1143
01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.310
<v Speaker 1>her shoulder was loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain she could move her arm more.</v>

1144
01:14:36.311 --> 01:14:38.410
<v Speaker 1>And so then I kind of investigated that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she said,</v>

1145
01:14:38.411 --> 01:14:41.200
<v Speaker 1>well she was afraid to move her arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she might damage it more.</v>

1146
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.273
<v Speaker 1>And so then I looked into that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>she told me a story about how one time </v>

1147
01:14:45.851 --> 01:14:46.684
<v Speaker 1>when she was five years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got accidentally into a wagon and </v>

1148
01:14:49.781 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 1>gone down a hill and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cracked up at the bottom.</v>

1149
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:53.733
<v Speaker 1>And then they put her in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then her parents weren't allowed to </v>

1150
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:58.660
<v Speaker 1>see her for like a month and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what hospitals used to do.</v>

1151
01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Cause they were sadistic and stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I left her with a permanent distrust</v>

1152
01:15:03.431 --> 01:15:04.264
<v Speaker 1>of institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was sort of associated with kind </v>

1153
01:15:06.881 --> 01:15:09.520
<v Speaker 1>of the paranoid edge of her post </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic stress disorder,</v>

1154
01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but also accounted for why she didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to move her arm because she thought</v>

1155
01:15:12.911 --> 01:15:13.744
<v Speaker 1>if she moved it then that might hurt her</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and then she'd end up in the </v>

1156
01:15:15.941 --> 01:15:16.774
<v Speaker 1>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a good example of how </v>

1157
01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.593
<v Speaker 1>unconscious memories and conflicts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the big conflict there for her </v>

1158
01:15:25.061 --> 01:15:27.520
<v Speaker 1>was she had a real problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>

1159
01:15:27.521 --> 01:15:29.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of that was politicized.</v>

1160
01:15:29.321 --> 01:15:31.270
<v Speaker 1>There was something wrong with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>

1161
01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:33.970
<v Speaker 1>which is true but irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most cases,</v>

1162
01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you still have to adapt to the </v>

1163
01:15:36.191 --> 01:15:36.820
<v Speaker 1>damn things.</v>

1164
01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:37.653
<v Speaker 1>But it had really hurt her adaptation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she couldn't trust the </v>

1165
01:15:40.621 --> 01:15:41.454
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if she ever got hurt </v>

1166
01:15:42.431 --> 01:15:43.264
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't move herself because she </v>

1167
01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:45.844
<v Speaker 1>was afraid she'd read damaged the body </v>
<v Speaker 1>part and then she did end up in an </v>

1168
01:15:47.771 --> 01:15:50.530
<v Speaker 1>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good example.</v>

1169
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible distress.</v>

1170
01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 1>See if I can come up with a good example</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

1171
01:15:58.330 --> 01:15:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a hallucination one.</v>

1172
01:15:59.921 --> 01:16:02.890
<v Speaker 1>This is a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a client one time who,</v>

1173
01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:05.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a schizophrenia.</v>

1174
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:07.390
<v Speaker 1>I met him then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not behavioral outpatient,</v>

1175
01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:10.310
<v Speaker 1>inpatient ward in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1176
01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.313
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing an Iq test with him and he </v>

1177
01:16:13.451 --> 01:16:15.700
<v Speaker 1>wasn't concentrating at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

1178
01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:19.480
<v Speaker 1>why are you concentrating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was looking all distracted and he</v>

1179
01:16:19.481 --> 01:16:20.314
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the war between the battle </v>

1180
01:16:22.031 --> 01:16:24.670
<v Speaker 1>between good and evil and heaven is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in my head,</v>

1181
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.970
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was the most interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for not concentrating.</v>

1182
01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:28.803
<v Speaker 1>I had ever heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent some time like getting to know </v>

1183
01:16:33.041 --> 01:16:33.874
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around with him for some hours </v>

1184
01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:38.830
<v Speaker 1>on the ward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even though he was paranoid,</v>

1185
01:16:38.831 --> 01:16:39.664
<v Speaker 1>he opened up to me after a while and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked him about how his illness had </v>

1186
01:16:43.571 --> 01:16:44.404
<v Speaker 1>developed and he had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the third son of a first </v>

1187
01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:50.530
<v Speaker 1>generation immigrant family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1188
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of ambition and the </v>

1189
01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:54.070
<v Speaker 1>family and his oldest brother was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor.</v>

1190
01:16:54.071 --> 01:16:57.010
<v Speaker 1>And then the second oldest was a lawyer </v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe the other way around.</v>

1191
01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And so he was taking a master's degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some behavioral science at Miguel and</v>

1192
01:17:02.471 --> 01:17:06.820
<v Speaker 1>he got behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he faked his research data and he</v>

1193
01:17:06.821 --> 01:17:09.010
<v Speaker 1>wrote up his thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many hands and at the end.</v>

1194
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:10.123
<v Speaker 1>And then that night he went home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to sleep and he woke up in the </v>

1195
01:17:13.041 --> 01:17:13.874
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night and the devil was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on his bed at the end and that </v>

1196
01:17:17.271 --> 01:17:19.430
<v Speaker 1>was the beginning of his schizophrenia </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

1197
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:24.530
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the hallucination </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of,</v>

1198
01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:28.083
<v Speaker 1>and I'm conscious moral conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well unconscious to some degree he knew </v>

1199
01:17:30.891 --> 01:17:31.724
<v Speaker 1>that he had done wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why he wasn't conscious of was exactly </v>

1200
01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:36.770
<v Speaker 1>how much damage that was going to do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1201
01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Now you know when you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1202
01:17:38.331 --> 01:17:39.164
<v Speaker 1>maybe he had a predisposition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosis before he faked his data and </v>

1203
01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.970
<v Speaker 1>that was interfering with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance and that's why he got behind</v>

1204
01:17:46.971 --> 01:17:47.451
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1205
01:17:47.451 --> 01:17:50.090
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things are usually complex.</v>

1206
01:17:50.091 --> 01:17:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Lee Closet looped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Tom,</v>

1207
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.793
<v Speaker 1>there was no doubting the phenomenology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he said that he couldn't </v>

1208
01:17:57.411 --> 01:18:02.120
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on the Iq test because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle between good and evil,</v>

1209
01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.010
<v Speaker 1>it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on in his head?</v>

1210
01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:04.933
<v Speaker 1>He mentioned whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he told me that he woke up and </v>

1211
01:18:09.321 --> 01:18:11.300
<v Speaker 1>saw the devil sitting at the foot of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed,</v>

1212
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:13.820
<v Speaker 1>like that was a hallucination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1213
01:18:13.821 --> 01:18:16.970
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that really doesn't explain it,</v>

1214
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:17.833
<v Speaker 1>which is white people in mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitals generally don't talk to </v>

1215
01:18:20.601 --> 01:18:23.770
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia because they'll tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that will curl your hair,</v>

1216
01:18:23.771 --> 01:18:26.520
<v Speaker 1>or he listened and they're very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to make sense of it.</v>

1217
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:27.643
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why Freud noted at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of this lecture in the little </v>

1218
01:18:32.511 --> 01:18:33.344
<v Speaker 1>recording that I played for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that his ideas were met with </v>

1219
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:36.403
<v Speaker 1>incomprehension and hostility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continued to be met in that matter to </v>

1220
01:18:40.821 --> 01:18:43.610
<v Speaker 1>this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you soon.</v>

1221
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:48.423
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
