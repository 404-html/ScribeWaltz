1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good morning.</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Good morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for coming in.</v>

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.183
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're developing this enormous power </v>

4
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>and reach you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the heavy burden for it?</v>

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>it's heavy and light at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's constant.</v>

8
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I generally don't know what I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>day to day until that day.</v>

9
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:19.614
<v Speaker 1>And I have people managing my schedule </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm busy enough so that I pretty </v>

10
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:23.964
<v Speaker 1>much attend to the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the responsibility of getting into </v>

11
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:30.220
<v Speaker 1>all these heads and you are influencing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people significantly,</v>

12
00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>aren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.303
<v Speaker 1>I guess I take solace in the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many thousands of people now have </v>

14
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:35.664
<v Speaker 1>written to me and also talk to me to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that things are better for them because </v>

15
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>they've been trying to do some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I suggest in my lectures.</v>

16
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And so it is a heavy responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

17
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.083
<v Speaker 1>when you have influence of that sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it lightens it when you also have </v>

18
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>evidence suggesting that it seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing people a lot of good,</v>

19
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>you're changing lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.890
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I been lost.</v>

21
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say there were six people in the</v>

22
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>audience last night I was talking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Melbourne.</v>

23
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>I would say there were six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there were more,</v>

24
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>but there were at least six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so half a dozen.</v>

25
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>And they were young men who told me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

26
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>That that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they said.</v>

27
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

28
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about that?</v>

29
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.573
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

30
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.503
<v Speaker 1>Breaks me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why haven't said it's a very positive </v>

31
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>thing you've done what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean that breaks you up?</v>

32
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.293
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.153
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sad that there's so many people in </v>

34
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of crisis,</v>

35
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't need</v>

36
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>that much encouragement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

37
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.043
<v Speaker 1>So it's sad that it only takes that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>encouragement to make that much </v>

38
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:46.764
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of lost people in the </v>

39
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:49.014
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a good thing to be able to help </v>

40
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's overwhelming.</v>

41
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>What can tell that you're very emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>

42
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's really something,</v>

43
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:00.234
<v Speaker 1>you know what table?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't thought much about what had </v>

44
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>happened last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

45
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.693
<v Speaker 1>I probably 500 people lined up after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk and most of them say the same </v>

46
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:11.740
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

47
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>about a quarter of them say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

48
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 1>you're putting into words things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>already knew.</v>

49
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I always knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know how to say.</v>

50
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:19.914
<v Speaker 1>that's what archetipal stories do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's what articulate </v>

52
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:22.921
<v Speaker 1>people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

53
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:23.754
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the other three quarters of </v>

54
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>them say some variant of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

55
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

56
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life has been turned around.</v>

57
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>They say I was addicted or I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking too much,</v>

58
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>or I wasn't moving ahead in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with my girlfriend,</v>

59
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't getting along with my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any direction in life.</v>

60
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I was nihilistic or hopeless or anxious </v>
<v Speaker 1>or any number of variants of those.</v>

61
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:46.014
<v Speaker 1>And I've been trying to put into </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice what you've been talking about </v>

62
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 1>in your youtube lectures and podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

63
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's really helped my turn my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

64
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

65
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you something.</v>

66
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.060
<v Speaker 1>You feel Fred John about that?</v>

67
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

68
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seem to be able to handle this.</v>

69
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>It's been going on a long time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

70
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.293
<v Speaker 1>it's been 18 months and I would say in </v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways now it's better than it was </v>

71
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>because at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when I got,</v>

72
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>when I put my hat in the political ring </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

73
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.073
<v Speaker 1>because I felt that the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians had overstepped their </v>

74
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

75
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my job was threatened and quite severely</v>

76
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I might lose my clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>license as well.</v>

77
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things were up in the air and a big way.</v>

78
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Those are a lot more gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was my refusal,</v>

79
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>my stated refusal to abide by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the requirement that,</v>

80
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>that I modify my language in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner that I felt was inappropriate.</v>

81
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.023
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt it was inappropriate of the </v>

82
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>government to demand that I modify my </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

83
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>The government has no right to intrude </v>
<v Speaker 1>on people's lives to that degree.</v>

84
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous when that happens.</v>

85
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

86
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I've been in one scandal after another </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Canada,</v>

87
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>like seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nonstop for 18 months.</v>

88
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 1>The last one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just two days ago,</v>

89
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I was at Queens University in Kingston </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a big demonstration,</v>

90
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>there was a very eerie occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They arrested a woman who was carrying a</v>

91
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.740
<v Speaker 1>garage for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.743
<v Speaker 1>and that was not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Queen's university thing was not </v>

93
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were in a hall,</v>

94
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of like a church that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hall.</v>

95
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:32.554
<v Speaker 1>It's what it looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was lined with stained glass windows </v>

96
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 20 of them.</v>

97
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>And there was a protester had climbed up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the window,</v>

98
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:40.444
<v Speaker 1>well of all 20 windows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably five or six feet off the </v>

99
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were seven feet high,</v>

100
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>these windows and they were pounding on </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and forcefully,</v>

101
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 1>forcefully enough in one case to break </v>
<v Speaker 1>the window.</v>

102
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>And so there was 900 of us inside and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

103
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>we were surrounded by this group that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were pounding on the windows and yelling</v>

104
00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 1>and pounding on the doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

105
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

106
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>you could see against the stained glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see these shouted,</v>

107
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>we forms pounding away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

108
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 1>it was very eerie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

109
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>And no one in that hall will ever forget</v>
<v Speaker 1>that experience.</v>

110
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Why would they trying to get in while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the garage?</v>

111
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Why the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like height.</v>

112
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 1>He's at height.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it was hate for sure.</v>

113
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>What are the hedge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they,</v>

114
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>because of who they imagine I might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's part of it.</v>

115
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

117
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to hate someone who's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>caricatured and so,</v>

118
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>but there's more to it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been very forceful,</v>

119
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>let's say in my criticisms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical left,</v>

120
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>not only in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the West in general,</v>

121
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.093
<v Speaker 1>not critical enough in my estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hold no stock whatsoever for the </v>

122
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.384
<v Speaker 1>radical leftists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely appalled that they are </v>

123
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.414
<v Speaker 1>the force they are in the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe that in many ways the </v>

124
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.684
<v Speaker 1>universities have done more harm in </v>
<v Speaker 1>society than good over the last 20 </v>

125
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:56.194
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say that you with a fair bit of </v>

126
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>regret because I've been obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with university since 1993.</v>

127
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.143
<v Speaker 3>It's a really easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sometimes enjoy dealing with the </v>

128
00:06:05.611 --> 00:06:08.160
<v Speaker 3>radical lift in universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're going to grow up,</v>

129
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.473
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get through this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I enjoy the challenge and the drama </v>

130
00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:13.500
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

131
00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:16.350
<v Speaker 3>it's a challenge of youth saying you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

132
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.593
<v Speaker 3>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know I'm right because I'm 20 and </v>

133
00:06:19.231 --> 00:06:20.064
<v Speaker 3>I know everything.</v>

134
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the students so much.</v>

135
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned about staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

136
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.823
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the staff and the administrators </v>

137
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the students.</v>

138
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

139
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been protested against,</v>

140
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 1>I watched the protesters and most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

141
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of them are young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people whose,</v>

142
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.780
<v Speaker 1>whose desire to have a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence in the world is channeled into</v>

143
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 1>this particular political expression at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>

144
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:44.414
<v Speaker 1>But so many of them are manipulated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the faculty members and there's no </v>

145
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 1>excuse for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they're doing is,</v>

146
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>is far more dangerous than it looks.</v>

147
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Why do young men need you?</v>

148
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

149
00:06:57.401 --> 00:06:58.234
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

150
00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.193
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's not just young men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that's an artifact of the fact </v>

151
00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:03.820
<v Speaker 1>that most of the people who watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

152
00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:05.320
<v Speaker 1>our young men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

153
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.430
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

154
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I won't evade the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

155
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.423
<v Speaker 1>because see to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maturation among men is voluntary </v>

156
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so voluntary for women.</v>

157
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.923
<v Speaker 1>They have to grow up fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot of things to do before </v>

158
00:07:18.731 --> 00:07:19.770
<v Speaker 1>they hit 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

159
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.450
<v Speaker 1>With men it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can take longer.</v>

160
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.760
<v Speaker 1>And they need a call to adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

161
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.660
<v Speaker 1>And they need to call to responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they need to be,</v>

162
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.553
<v Speaker 1>they need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be initiated into responsibility and </v>

163
00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:36.460
<v Speaker 1>to have a case made for its utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm saying,</v>

164
00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:37.294
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to be adult than to be a </v>

165
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:39.580
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>

166
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 1>It's better to be in control of your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>destiny.</v>

167
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.903
<v Speaker 1>There's a place for you in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world would be lesser if you don't </v>

168
00:07:45.761 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Speaker 1>take your place in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have a responsibility to bear,</v>

169
00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:50.194
<v Speaker 1>to sort out your education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to straighten out your life and to </v>

170
00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:54.040
<v Speaker 1>become who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grow the hell up,</v>

171
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.270
<v Speaker 1>grow up and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

172
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.850
<v Speaker 1>and for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that are positive for you,</v>

173
00:07:57.851 --> 00:07:59.890
<v Speaker 1>positive for your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive for everyone.</v>

174
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.743
<v Speaker 3>So he's buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this generation lost [inaudible] </v>

175
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.140
<v Speaker 3>desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

176
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 3>they're clinging to what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>and doing in a desperate,</v>

177
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm not criticizing what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>or doing but they need it.</v>

178
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 3>They need it desperately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

179
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that I think that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation needs a message that,</v>

180
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.860
<v Speaker 1>that that supports maturation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

181
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that we've done a bad job as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture of putting that message forward.</v>

182
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:32.871
<v Speaker 1>So to me since the mid 1960s our young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been fed a never ending diet</v>

183
00:08:34.141 --> 00:08:36.960
<v Speaker 1>of rights and impulsive freedoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

184
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.850
<v Speaker 1>And that leaves a hole because most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning that people,</v>

185
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.230
<v Speaker 1>people managing their lives and so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the meaning that you can offset</v>

186
00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:50.080
<v Speaker 1>against the tragedy of life that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from adopting responsibility and,</v>

187
00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:50.914
<v Speaker 1>and carrying a load.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like human beings in some sense are </v>

188
00:08:52.771 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>designed for a load and the heavier the </v>
<v Speaker 1>load better.</v>

189
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.693
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that gives you </v>

190
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.983
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this proclivity among psychologists to </v>

191
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>attempt to facilitate self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a word I don't care much for.</v>

192
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that self respect is a much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better term.</v>

193
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I think you develop self respect by </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying a responsibility.</v>

194
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

195
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.153
<v Speaker 3>I feel very lucky to have been born in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this linked to essentially a decent </v>

196
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:17.094
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

197
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.933
<v Speaker 3>does follow a lot of what happens in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States and I get to that in a </v>

198
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:20.754
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was talking to some welfare </v>

199
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 3>workers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>police,</v>

200
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:27.681
<v Speaker 3>salvation army yesterday signed to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think society is becoming an end,</v>

201
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:29.004
<v Speaker 3>particularly the younger the age group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which hawking is becoming more </v>

202
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more cynical,</v>

203
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 3>more angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You agree with that?</v>

204
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:36.384
<v Speaker 3>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

205
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the statistics bear that </v>

206
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>out because what we've seen overall over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last,</v>

207
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>especially the last 20 years is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable decline in violent crime.</v>

208
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I do think that there might be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>epidemic more of aimlessness and,</v>

209
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and depression and anxiety,</v>

210
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:53.964
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's partly because </v>

211
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 1>the case for growing up is not made </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

212
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:00.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

213
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 1>and because we're also so cynical about </v>
<v Speaker 1>our own societies,</v>

214
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:04.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Amsterdam month ago talking to </v>

215
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:07.494
<v Speaker 1>a group of well placed intellectuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are all friends of Theo van Gogh </v>

216
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:12.100
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was killed in,</v>

217
00:10:12.101 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Amsterdam about 15 years ago.</v>

218
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:18.660
<v Speaker 1>It was stabbed and there said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassment about the Dutch culture is</v>

219
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 1>rampant in their society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that just makes my jaw drop cause I go</v>

220
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 1>to Holland and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

221
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 1>this is such an amazing place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

222
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:29.100
<v Speaker 1>they scrape this country out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the ocean.</v>

223
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 1>They built dikes to hold back the waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

224
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.120
<v Speaker 1>it's free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

225
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.130
<v Speaker 1>it's liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

226
00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 1>it's compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's orderly,</v>

227
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're embarrassed by it because of its</v>

228
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.760
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal nature.</v>

229
00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well who are you comparing it to?</v>

230
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like what are we comparing our </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies to?</v>

231
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Where do you want to live it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

232
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 1>on the planet or in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,</v>

233
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 1>but in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not if you have any sense.</v>

234
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.013
<v Speaker 3>You've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've sort of been described as a </v>

235
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 3>warrior against political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that fit?</v>

236
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me about this.</v>

237
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:01.824
<v Speaker 3>And our national carrier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quantas got some attention earlier this </v>

238
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.853
<v Speaker 3>week and I was thinking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew you were coming in and that they </v>

239
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.950
<v Speaker 3>were taking advice from a diversity </v>
<v Speaker 3>group that that's a bad idea,</v>

240
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.383
<v Speaker 3>bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wanted to ban words like guys and </v>

241
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 3>chairman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>husband and wife,</v>

242
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.243
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>replaceable replace words like mankind </v>

243
00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 3>and chairman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your reaction to that?</v>

244
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that it would be better if </v>
<v Speaker 1>people tried to solve some real problems</v>

245
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.790
<v Speaker 1>instead of playing these idiot diversity</v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

246
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that everyone who plays identity</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

247
00:11:33.481 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 1>whether they play it on the right or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

248
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>is going to pay for it in ways they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly imagine.</v>

249
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a very counterproductive way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dividing up the world.</v>

250
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.373
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to come to a peaceful </v>

251
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:47.490
<v Speaker 1>solution in the identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

252
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Even the identity politics types </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

253
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.620
<v Speaker 1>they've run into this problem they call </v>
<v Speaker 1>intersectionality,</v>

254
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.741
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

255
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:54.574
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you classify people by race and by </v>

256
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

257
00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.370
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

258
00:11:59.371 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 1>and seek for equity along those </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>

259
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.221
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

260
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 1>what about the intersection between </v>
<v Speaker 1>those dimensions?</v>

261
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have enough,</v>

262
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

263
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic minorities in your,</v>

264
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>in your organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you match by population,</v>

265
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 1>which is a foolish way of doing it.</v>

266
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 1>But you do that and maybe you're matched</v>
<v Speaker 1>by sex,</v>

267
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 1>but then what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the intersection between race</v>

268
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:23.890
<v Speaker 1>and sex?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

269
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and then what about the intersection </v>
<v Speaker 1>between race,</v>

270
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.970
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity?</v>

271
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Then you could add social class to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you could add social proclivity.</v>

272
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.853
<v Speaker 1>Then you could add attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never ending way of dividing </v>

273
00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:39.190
<v Speaker 1>people up into groups and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>equalize across all those ways.</v>

274
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.053
<v Speaker 1>It's just technically not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think people need to a stand on </v>

275
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:46.540
<v Speaker 1>issues like this and when an airline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like quantas makes these decisions,</v>

276
00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 1>do they need to stand against it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they need to boy clothes,</v>

277
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.813
<v Speaker 1>I need to do that sort of thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they need to understand it at a </v>

278
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:53.434
<v Speaker 1>deeper level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we have to decide if we're </v>

279
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:55.624
<v Speaker 1>going to divide people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we think that dividing people up </v>

280
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:01.510
<v Speaker 1>primarily by the group identity is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good idea and it's not,</v>

281
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad idea.</v>

282
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.180
<v Speaker 1>It will lead to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

283
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 1>an enhancement of our tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivities.</v>

284
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.590
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that if you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an advocate of peace that you would push</v>

285
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 1>and advocate for our further division </v>
<v Speaker 1>into tribal entities.</v>

286
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not wise,</v>

287
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>is this transit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we move through this,</v>

288
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been not transient in the past.</v>

289
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 1>It's caused tremendous troubles in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

290
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.040
<v Speaker 1>This is another reason why I'm not a fan</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the radical leftists.</v>

291
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.490
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical left ideologies were,</v>

292
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 1>were murderous in their expression </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the 20th century.</v>

293
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.353
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country follows a lot of the US </v>

294
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.820
<v Speaker 1>trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and bad.</v>

295
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:44.780
<v Speaker 1>We're a little bit behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can be fashion.</v>

296
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we need to be alert to?</v>

297
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.220
<v Speaker 1>What do we need to be aware of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we need to avoid?</v>

298
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.433
<v Speaker 1>We need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to be alert to the benefits of </v>

299
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>the societies that we now inhabit.</v>

300
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.690
<v Speaker 1>We need to be grateful for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence and,</v>

301
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:07.390
<v Speaker 1>and note very carefully the unlikelihood</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their continued success.</v>

302
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:09.423
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how we managed it in </v>

303
00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:13.384
<v Speaker 1>the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have societies where the default </v>

304
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 1>assumption between human beings is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust.</v>

305
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.823
<v Speaker 1>I do not understand how we manage that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's so many ways that you </v>

306
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:24.610
<v Speaker 1>can be betrayed by someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you don't know them.</v>

307
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 1>How do you set up a society where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical interaction between strangers is</v>

308
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:30.310
<v Speaker 1>straight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

309
00:14:30.311 --> 00:14:32.050
<v Speaker 1>how many societies in the world are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

310
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Like 30 40 something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did that ever happen?</v>

311
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.263
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's an ongoing miracle and we </v>

312
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:39.394
<v Speaker 1>should do everything we can not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupt it because the alternative to </v>

313
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:45.130
<v Speaker 1>that generous trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that courageous trust,</v>

314
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 1>which is unbelievably productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is ruled by thug.</v>

315
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's the rule in most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

316
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.450
<v Speaker 1>So do you have optimism or not for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future?</v>

317
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I think we're in a time of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

318
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Things could go unbelievably well if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were careful.</v>

319
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.890
<v Speaker 1>There's so many good things going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world right now.</v>

320
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 1>They're almost miraculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

321
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the year 2000 and 2012 the level</v>

322
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:10.394
<v Speaker 1>of absolute poverty in the world was cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>by 50% that was the fastest rate of </v>

323
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:15.740
<v Speaker 1>improvement by a large margin in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

324
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 1>It was three years faster than the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic projections had suggested.</v>

325
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.073
<v Speaker 1>There's hundreds of thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>a week now being being pulled into the </v>

326
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:25.184
<v Speaker 1>electrical power grid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost everyone has access to almost </v>

327
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 1>infinite computational power and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational resources that go along with</v>

328
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:32.084
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're wiping out most transmissible </v>

329
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:34.664
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fastest growing economies in the </v>

330
00:15:36.141 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 1>world are in sub Saharan Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there are a lot of things.</v>

331
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 1>There's no starvation in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge middle class in China and</v>

332
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things are absolutely miraculous.</v>

333
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:46.543
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and God only knows what we could </v>

334
00:15:48.111 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Speaker 1>accomplish if we got our act together in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next 20 years.</v>

335
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

336
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.030
<v Speaker 1>the sky's the limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

337
00:15:53.031 --> 00:15:53.864
<v Speaker 1>but we're playing very foolish games in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the west and we could bring the house </v>

338
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:59.090
<v Speaker 1>down around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see.</v>

339
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with a burden.</v>

340
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.183
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks very much for the invitation and </v>

341
00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>for the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan B.</v>

342
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.821
<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules,</v>

343
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:10.010
<v Speaker 1>falafel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and added to chaos.</v>
