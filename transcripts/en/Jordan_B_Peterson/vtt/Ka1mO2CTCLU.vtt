1
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Tell her where everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>

2
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Where do we go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see all of you.</v>

3
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>first question,</v>

4
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.853
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I could catch you up on what's </v>

5
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>been happening first in case you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaguely interested,</v>

6
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>most of you probably know or some of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know anyways,</v>

7
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>about what happened at Wilfrid laurier </v>
<v Speaker 1>university this week or two weeks ago,</v>

8
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>a teaching assistant named Lindsay </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd was interrogated,</v>

9
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the typical suspects,</v>

10
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.323
<v Speaker 1>the kind of postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neo Marxist that I've been talking </v>

11
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holder into an inquisition and,</v>

12
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

13
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.493
<v Speaker 1>proceeded to rape her over the coals for</v>
<v Speaker 1>having the goal to show a video that </v>

14
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>featured me about a year ago on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian TV show called the agenda.</v>

15
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.603
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

16
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>they accused her of violating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal code essentially,</v>

17
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>and the Canadian human rights code,</v>

18
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.173
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

19
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.570
<v Speaker 1>under the provisions of Bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

20
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.533
<v Speaker 1>which was the bill I warned about last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year and accused her of transphobia and </v>

21
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:41.024
<v Speaker 1>making an unsafe environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they accused me of being </v>

22
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:44.114
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was really quite interesting </v>

23
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>because I've never been accused about </v>
<v Speaker 1>being Hitler.</v>

24
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 1>So I modified my kermit puppet here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.610
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

26
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 1>you can probably see that I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've done a response video which I'm</v>

27
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>going to launch pretty soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a Hitler,</v>

28
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 1>the frog and the spokes frog by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

29
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is what we've come to.</v>

30
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.463
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

31
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's answer some questions.</v>

32
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start with Pigeonhole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

33
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.603
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the site that allows people to vote </v>

34
00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:26.300
<v Speaker 1>on questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the top voted question is,</v>

35
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:27.134
<v Speaker 1>how do you identify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you justify a rejection of </v>

36
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:30.134
<v Speaker 1>identity arianism when a pillar of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neo marxists strategy is to </v>

37
00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:36.890
<v Speaker 1>demographically replaced the indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>people of Europe?</v>

38
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 1>London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's less than half ethnically English.</v>

39
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

40
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>So let's take that question apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

41
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.153
<v Speaker 1>it isn't self evident to me that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically a neo Marxist strategy to </v>

42
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>demographically replaced the indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>peoples of Europe.</v>

43
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:54.374
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the strategy </v>

44
00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:57.314
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if that's the outcome because you </v>

45
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>have to distinguish strategy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

46
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.153
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strategy and principle is to bring </v>

47
00:03:04.191 --> 00:03:07.440
<v Speaker 1>in immigrants to balance out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>declining birthrate.</v>

48
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.373
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying I agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that that's what the </v>

49
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:11.494
<v Speaker 1>strategy is a and then the next part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is predicated on the </v>

50
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:21.931
<v Speaker 1>assumption that identity Arianism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily the answer to the problem of</v>

51
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.043
<v Speaker 1>the problem that's being identified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is characterized as excess </v>

52
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.254
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>

53
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.723
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to figure out exactly what </v>

54
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:36.661
<v Speaker 1>identitarianism means because it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear if it means radical,</v>

55
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:38.854
<v Speaker 1>right wing ethnic nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's going to be </v>

56
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.084
<v Speaker 1>particularly constructive if it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a sensible discussion about what </v>

57
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>the appropriate limits might be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>

58
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.133
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to think about that over the long </v>

59
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>run and also to have a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about</v>

60
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which say Islam and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>West,</v>

61
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>the values of Islam and the West are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually commensurate.</v>

62
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Then that has to be obviously has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

63
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.580
<v Speaker 1>But I'm so I'm afraid that to answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that question,</v>

64
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:15.664
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to know more about exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 1>these terms were being were being </v>

65
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:19.714
<v Speaker 1>defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially with regards to </v>

66
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:22.610
<v Speaker 1>identitarianism because it's a vague </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

67
00:04:22.611 --> 00:04:23.444
<v Speaker 1>And so that's all I can do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lose my ability to think straight or </v>

68
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>intelligently in confrontational or </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfriendly social situations.</v>

69
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Any suggestions for adoptation or </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement?</v>

70
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple.</v>

71
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that when you get nervous in this</v>

72
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 1>kind of situation that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing,</v>

73
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>what often happens to people is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start paying attention to themselves.</v>

74
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:49.744
<v Speaker 1>They get self conscious so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say I got self conscious all of a </v>

75
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:54.244
<v Speaker 1>sudden during this q and a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen is that I'd start </v>

76
00:04:58.161 --> 00:04:58.994
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the questions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen and what I'm doing and I'd </v>

77
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:03.184
<v Speaker 1>start paying attention to how I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling and to the nervousness and then </v>

78
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:07.084
<v Speaker 1>I'd start to get aware that I was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>responding properly and that would make </v>

79
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:11.674
<v Speaker 1>me more nervous and then I would get </v>
<v Speaker 1>more aware of that and that can just </v>

80
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:15.784
<v Speaker 1>shut me down entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's happened to me now and then </v>

81
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:18.214
<v Speaker 1>in a lecture and sometimes almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened when I was talking to Sam </v>

82
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.633
<v Speaker 1>Harris the first time.</v>

83
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paused for a long time and then became</v>

84
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:26.194
<v Speaker 1>aware of the pause and then anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do in a situation like </v>

85
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>that is it's not so much that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop attending to yourself because if</v>

86
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:38.140
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should stop attending to myself,</v>

87
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>then you'll just think about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

88
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.493
<v Speaker 1>What you have to do instead is pay more </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the situation and to the </v>

89
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:48.004
<v Speaker 1>people that you're talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to increase the degree to </v>

90
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:51.634
<v Speaker 1>which you're at attending outwardly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll stop you from attending </v>

91
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>inwardly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

92
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>that's a very effective technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can practice that.</v>

93
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you get nervous,</v>

94
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>start paying more attention and that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll,</v>

95
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>that'll help you out a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

96
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.163
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good suggestion for social </v>

97
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>anxiety in general is that if you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>

98
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.933
<v Speaker 1>but not everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people have enough implicit </v>

99
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:22.934
<v Speaker 1>social skill because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably socialized when they were </v>

100
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>children so that they do know how to act</v>
<v Speaker 1>in social situations,</v>

101
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:31.064
<v Speaker 1>but they get anxious and then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>interferes with them implementing what </v>

102
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>they know.</v>

103
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.353
<v Speaker 1>Just like if you're a pianist and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get anxious and self conscious while </v>

104
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:39.704
<v Speaker 1>you're playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll forget what you know because </v>

105
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>while you've activated a different part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your brain,</v>

106
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.543
<v Speaker 1>if you can remember to pay attention and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can direct your attention outward </v>

107
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 1>and you attend hard enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what will happen and try to put the</v>

108
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>other person at ease and try to ask them</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

109
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.263
<v Speaker 1>Then that'll kick in the automatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're paying attention to what </v>

110
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>the person is doing into their facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressions and all of that.</v>

111
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>That will clue in the automatic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit</v>

112
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that you have and make things </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more smooth and,</v>

113
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety free.</v>

114
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So attention really attention really </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays a huge role in regulating anxiety.</v>

115
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lauren asks,</v>

116
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I would love to hear you do a lecture </v>
<v Speaker 1>series on raising children properly.</v>

117
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Is that something you would consider?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.343
<v Speaker 1>in my new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written a chapter on that called </v>

119
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 1>don't let your children do anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you dislike them.</v>

120
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.150
<v Speaker 1>And I've laid out a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

121
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I've laid out a philosophy of care and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline that's predicated partly on a</v>

122
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.014
<v Speaker 1>French philosophical legal notion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is do not multiply rules beyond </v>

123
00:07:59.151 --> 00:07:59.984
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a legal equivalent to </v>

124
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.473
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] razor and an English common </v>
<v Speaker 1>law principle is which is used minimal </v>

125
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>necessary force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the Union of those two,</v>

126
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 1>which is don't have too many rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but make sure that you properly enforced</v>

127
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:14.864
<v Speaker 1>the ones that you do have is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>start for how you might consider your </v>

128
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>attitude with regards to raising </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

129
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>The other thing you have to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>is exactly what's your aim.</v>

130
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.453
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the aims that people have had </v>

131
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>most recently pushed by clueless </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>

132
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:32.234
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you want children to have high </v>

133
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:34.334
<v Speaker 1>self esteem and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a large part trait </v>

134
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can be modified to some degree.</v>

135
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Jerome Kagan has done some very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting work on that.</v>

136
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.920
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

137
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.490
<v Speaker 1>the best thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

138
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.453
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best thing to orient yourself </v>

139
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:57.474
<v Speaker 1>towards with regards to children is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to make your child your </v>

140
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:06.270
<v Speaker 1>children or help your children to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>delightful in the eyes of others.</v>

141
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.950
<v Speaker 1>And so that means they have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably well socialized.</v>

142
00:09:09.951 --> 00:09:10.784
<v Speaker 1>And that really takes place between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ages of two and four because what you </v>

143
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:16.050
<v Speaker 1>want for your children is that when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out into public,</v>

144
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>when they're away from you or even with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you for that matter,</v>

145
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.820
<v Speaker 1>what you want for your children is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people to genuinely like them.</v>

146
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.103
<v Speaker 1>Because if they behave reasonably and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they attend properly to adults and they </v>

147
00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>know how to play with other children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then wherever they go,</v>

148
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be,</v>

149
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.323
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

150
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.490
<v Speaker 1>unless they encounter someone truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent,</v>

151
00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:39.980
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be welcomed with smiles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and open arms.</v>

152
00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:40.814
<v Speaker 1>And that's not going to be fake because </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every human being actually likes </v>

153
00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:49.571
<v Speaker 1>children if they're reasonably behaved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your job is to make your children</v>

154
00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:54.260
<v Speaker 1>highly socially desirable because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>opens up the world to them.</v>

155
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.350
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a lecture series,</v>

156
00:09:57.351 --> 00:10:01.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little lecture looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

157
00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:02.240
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John says,</v>

158
00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm deeply envious and resentful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>others happiness.</v>

159
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.130
<v Speaker 1>How do I turn this around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

160
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.330
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say you've started to turn it on</v>

161
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.343
<v Speaker 1>around already because you have at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to the conclusion that you're </v>

162
00:10:16.461 --> 00:10:18.860
<v Speaker 1>deeply envious and resentful of others </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

163
00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:21.080
<v Speaker 1>So you do have the damn problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed.</v>

164
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.820
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you might do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what you would like instead.</v>

165
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Like how would you like to feel about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

166
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're implying that being </v>

167
00:10:31.101 --> 00:10:34.010
<v Speaker 1>deeply envious and resentful isn't for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>

168
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.173
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume that you would rather be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleased about other people's successes </v>

169
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.340
<v Speaker 1>and not envious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

170
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you might think is,</v>

171
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.980
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you have to do some writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least some thinking.</v>

172
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:52.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe the alternative would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>

173
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.400
<v Speaker 1>be happy about other's success and </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

174
00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you should start by thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about why you might be happy about their</v>

175
00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:01.094
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like happiness is a zero sum </v>

176
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:03.171
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:11:03.171 --> 00:11:05.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an,</v>

178
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking your question seriously and I</v>

179
00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:08.624
<v Speaker 1>think that what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize is plenty of people and I </v>

180
00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:14.390
<v Speaker 1>think that you're being deeply honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noticing it,</v>

181
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.720
<v Speaker 1>happiness isn't a zero sum game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.690
<v Speaker 1>lots of people can be happy at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

183
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.853
<v Speaker 1>And do you really want to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world where other people are less happy </v>

184
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.720
<v Speaker 1>in what possible manner without be </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful and good for you in the medium to</v>

185
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:31.340
<v Speaker 1>longterm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might make you feel,</v>

186
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grudgingly,</v>

187
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.633
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

188
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.410
<v Speaker 1>satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:38.244
<v Speaker 1>in a dark way temporarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a very good long term </v>

190
00:11:40.681 --> 00:11:41.514
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say you got to think it </v>

191
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.993
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you would like to view </v>

193
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:47.334
<v Speaker 1>the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you think that would be best for </v>

194
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:49.254
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as if you were taking care of </v>

195
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:53.100
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

196
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 1>like you're someone who deserves to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken care of.</v>

197
00:11:55.361 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Think about how you'd like to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

198
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.623
<v Speaker 1>how he'd like to view the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways you can do that too </v>

199
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:02.344
<v Speaker 1>is to think about some people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>admire and try to figure out how they </v>

200
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:09.220
<v Speaker 1>look at the world or even ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:10.054
<v Speaker 1>because maybe then you can find out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is about your thought patterns that </v>

202
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 1>are driving you down this dark road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

203
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.983
<v Speaker 1>why are you now Francoise St Onge asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you hiding the amount you </v>

204
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:27.514
<v Speaker 1>receive from Patriot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I found it very motivating to see </v>

205
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:30.604
<v Speaker 1>the amount skyrocket and tell cloud to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be part of this as if you were an </v>

206
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:35.374
<v Speaker 1>artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now feel more like I'm buying a </v>

207
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 1>product and I find it less appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:39.484
<v Speaker 1>Well it's one of those things where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of damned if I do and damned if I </v>

209
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:42.724
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.940
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I probably got tired of the sort</v>

211
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:50.524
<v Speaker 1>of more left leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say radical left leaning press </v>

212
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:55.264
<v Speaker 1>people jumping up and down on me every </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance they got because people were </v>

213
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.270
<v Speaker 1>donating money for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for services that I particularly rent,</v>

214
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I render essentially for free.</v>

215
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

216
00:13:09.151 --> 00:13:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

217
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 1>there must have been 10 articles in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last week following the Lindsay shepherd</v>

218
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:18.030
<v Speaker 1>a incident pointing out that I'm somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>being manipulative and,</v>

219
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:19.653
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

220
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 1>evil in a capitalist sort of way for </v>
<v Speaker 1>daring to</v>

221
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.633
<v Speaker 1>allow people to donate money to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>support what I'm doing and it gets kind </v>

222
00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:33.540
<v Speaker 1>of tiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't know,</v>

223
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.433
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I also thought that maybe </v>

224
00:13:36.061 --> 00:13:37.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

225
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't exactly call it bragging,</v>

226
00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:42.420
<v Speaker 1>but because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

227
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.330
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about good enough.</v>

228
00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an appeal to privacy I suppose in</v>

229
00:13:50.151 --> 00:13:52.040
<v Speaker 1>part two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's the right thing.</v>

230
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I could do a poll on twitter and find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

231
00:13:54.591 --> 00:13:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I guess I did that first of other things</v>
<v Speaker 1>this week.</v>

232
00:13:57.381 --> 00:13:58.830
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

233
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the answer to that user in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

234
00:14:02.961 --> 00:14:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Says I love you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep it up.</v>

235
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good question and uh,</v>

236
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to keep it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually feeling quite a bit better.</v>

237
00:14:10.791 --> 00:14:11.624
<v Speaker 1>I was actually happy today and it's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>so rare for the last while that I could </v>

238
00:14:16.431 --> 00:14:18.830
<v Speaker 1>hardly even recognize what it felt like </v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

239
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.993
<v Speaker 1>but I'm definitely feeling better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting some energy in the morning </v>

240
00:14:23.151 --> 00:14:26.060
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really happy about that.</v>

241
00:14:26.061 --> 00:14:27.110
<v Speaker 1>So thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

242
00:14:27.111 --> 00:14:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

243
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Thoughts on the radical left and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>superficial view,</v>

244
00:14:33.451 --> 00:14:37.530
<v Speaker 1>belief and value on the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How has this influenced by their own raw</v>

245
00:14:37.531 --> 00:14:38.670
<v Speaker 1>emotions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inviting,</v>

246
00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:39.900
<v Speaker 1>questionable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immoral,</v>

247
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.420
<v Speaker 1>and dangerous actions despite good </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions?</v>

248
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.673
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really buy the whole good </v>

249
00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:45.900
<v Speaker 1>intentions thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

250
00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's really hard to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>good intentions.</v>

251
00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Like John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question are just answered.</v>

252
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:56.630
<v Speaker 1>John said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at myself honestly,</v>

254
00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm deeply envious and resentful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>others happiness.</v>

255
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.343
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to the Lindsay shepherd </v>

256
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:07.871
<v Speaker 1>recording at Wilfrid laurier university </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you listen to the professors and the</v>

257
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 1>administrators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's,</v>

258
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

259
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.673
<v Speaker 1>it's absurd to start with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that they have good </v>

260
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:16.754
<v Speaker 1>intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have good intentions </v>

261
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

262
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.141
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

263
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:25.430
<v Speaker 1>we could give the devil his due and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are people on the left end of</v>

264
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 1>the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

265
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.810
<v Speaker 1>like there are all parts of the spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>

266
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:29.703
<v Speaker 1>are trying to do good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but having good intentions and figuring </v>

267
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:34.064
<v Speaker 1>out how to do well in the world are our </v>
<v Speaker 1>good intentions are only the beginning </v>

268
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.643
<v Speaker 1>and people are always influenced by raw </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and fuzzy thinking and it's </v>

269
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 1>hard to think critically and it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to plan strategically and it's hard to,</v>

270
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 1>to intervene in the world in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't cause trouble,</v>

271
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:57.110
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why I recommend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that they start local.</v>

272
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:57.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even trust your own good </v>

273
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:02.174
<v Speaker 1>intentions to some degree because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to test out what you do when you </v>

274
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:06.194
<v Speaker 1>have good intentions and see if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually produces the result that's </v>

275
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:10.004
<v Speaker 1>intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't make the case to begin </v>

276
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:14.024
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the radical end of the </v>

277
00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:17.504
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's unbelievably motivated by </v>

278
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:20.960
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

279
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.980
<v Speaker 1>how does one save a marriage when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems that there is no longer attraction</v>

280
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.570
<v Speaker 1>both physically and intellectually?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are kids involved,</v>

281
00:16:31.571 --> 00:16:34.030
<v Speaker 1>which is the main reason for wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save the marriage.</v>

282
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

283
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.980
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a couple of things about that.</v>

284
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first thing I would say is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you haven't had any intimate </v>

285
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.040
<v Speaker 1>interaction with one another for quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time,</v>

286
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:53.490
<v Speaker 1>that can put both people into a stagnant</v>
<v Speaker 1>state where desire starts to slip away.</v>

287
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.900
<v Speaker 1>What what sex therapists recommend under</v>
<v Speaker 1>such conditions is to,</v>

288
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.700
<v Speaker 1>well essentially start in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start dating again so you could ask your</v>

289
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:07.150
<v Speaker 1>partner to go out to a movie or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and you know,</v>

290
00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:12.151
<v Speaker 1>maybe when you come home you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could neck for a little while,</v>

291
00:17:13.331 --> 00:17:14.164
<v Speaker 1>like teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a word no one uses </v>

292
00:17:16.391 --> 00:17:17.224
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kinda pull back and you got to </v>

293
00:17:19.181 --> 00:17:19.570
<v Speaker 1>agree.</v>

294
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Say not to engage in full sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity for a while,</v>

295
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:26.980
<v Speaker 1>but to tease each other and to play a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

296
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're not attracted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to act.</v>

297
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Acted out for awhile and hopefully you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get the motor running again.</v>

298
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:35.343
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I would say is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys might want to sit down and make a </v>

299
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.353
<v Speaker 1>joint plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what a marriage is like a </v>

300
00:17:44.351 --> 00:17:45.184
<v Speaker 1>story that two people are acting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and you have to have </v>

301
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:54.050
<v Speaker 1>shared goals and because you're both </v>
<v Speaker 1>rowing the same boat,</v>

302
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 1>let's say if you don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>destination in mind,</v>

303
00:17:57.691 --> 00:17:58.830
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

304
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're rowing in circles or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just standing still.</v>

305
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:08.430
<v Speaker 1>So I would say work hard to put some </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance back in the relationship,</v>

306
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say to each other,</v>

307
00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:10.653
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try this for six months and just </v>

308
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:12.594
<v Speaker 1>see how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have two dates a week for the </v>

309
00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 1>first month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We won't have any sex,</v>

310
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 1>but we'll play around and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:21.530
<v Speaker 1>we'll see how that goes and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

312
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.110
<v Speaker 1>but we'll try it out for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

313
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 1>for the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the whole six months.</v>

314
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.970
<v Speaker 1>There are reasons to save a marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

315
00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:30.804
<v Speaker 1>it's hard on kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Divorce is really hard on kids and it's </v>

316
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:35.710
<v Speaker 1>hard on the adults involved too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

317
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.010
<v Speaker 1>so I would say</v>

318
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.450
<v Speaker 1>you have to negotiate an agreement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

319
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:44.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could try the future authoring </v>

320
00:18:45.701 --> 00:18:46.660
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of you,</v>

321
00:18:46.661 --> 00:18:48.460
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would recommend for example,</v>

322
00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.280
<v Speaker 1>is that you each do the future authoring</v>
<v Speaker 1>program separately.</v>

323
00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:52.683
<v Speaker 1>So that's that self authoring dotcom </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you both have a life plan </v>

324
00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.313
<v Speaker 1>and then you could sit down and read </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's future authoring plans and </v>

325
00:19:00.221 --> 00:19:01.054
<v Speaker 1>see if you have some things in common </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then see if you can figure out how </v>

326
00:19:04.061 --> 00:19:08.710
<v Speaker 1>to support each other with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each of you obtaining what you want.</v>

327
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.113
<v Speaker 1>So Paul Maloney asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you edited out a disagreement with </v>

328
00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Camille Paglia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

329
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

330
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.570
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a piece edited out,</v>

331
00:19:19.571 --> 00:19:21.490
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't because there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreement,</v>

332
00:19:21.491 --> 00:19:24.580
<v Speaker 1>it was because there was some glitch in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the video or something like that.</v>

333
00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

334
00:19:27.311 --> 00:19:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't say this with absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty,</v>

335
00:19:29.171 --> 00:19:30.004
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so does my crew do everything we </v>

336
00:19:32.651 --> 00:19:33.484
<v Speaker 1>possibly can to leave the videos alone </v>
<v Speaker 1>except for getting rid of things that </v>

337
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.790
<v Speaker 1>would be of no interest to anyone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are mistakes.</v>

338
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:40.803
<v Speaker 1>So there was no disagreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you interested in coming to </v>

339
00:19:44.051 --> 00:19:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Australia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

340
00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I've been invited a couple of times but </v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't worked out yet.</v>

341
00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:52.420
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my book will be published in Australia I</v>

342
00:19:52.421 --> 00:19:55.710
<v Speaker 1>think sometime in January as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

343
00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:56.544
<v Speaker 1>I imagined that all becoming there at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point in order to talk about my </v>

344
00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:02.434
<v Speaker 1>book and so on.</v>

345
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.533
<v Speaker 1>Tray says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can a person go through the future </v>

346
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:08.724
<v Speaker 1>authoring process of imagining a future </v>
<v Speaker 1>for yourself as though you or someone </v>

347
00:20:11.371 --> 00:20:12.204
<v Speaker 1>you care about when you barely don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>care about yourself or even hate </v>

348
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:15.960
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

349
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.063
<v Speaker 1>well I would say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>go through the exercise anyways and act </v>

350
00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:27.360
<v Speaker 1>as like try to extend to yourself some </v>
<v Speaker 1>courtesy.</v>

351
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.523
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to act something out </v>

352
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:30.474
<v Speaker 1>before you can start to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say sit down and pretend </v>

353
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.480
<v Speaker 1>that you're your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.343
<v Speaker 1>trade the probability that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something so wrong with you that you </v>

355
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:47.650
<v Speaker 1>don't deserve any regard whatsoever is </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

356
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

357
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.560
<v Speaker 1>and I would say if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just can't get it together,</v>

358
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:54.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you were depressed and maybe you </v>

359
00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:59.520
<v Speaker 1>need to go talk to someone because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to be depressed.</v>

360
00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 1>You talked to a physician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.013
<v Speaker 1>there are treatments for depression if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you happen to be depressed and if you </v>

362
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:05.794
<v Speaker 1>actually hate yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's a possibility that that's </v>

363
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how old you are,</v>

364
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.673
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are effective treatments for that </v>

365
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:14.284
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might want to find out if there's </v>

366
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:18.790
<v Speaker 1>actually something wrong physically or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or psychophysiological.</v>

367
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.151
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

368
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:24.151
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have to trudge through</v>
<v Speaker 1>life absolutely miserable.</v>

369
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Their antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

370
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:30.250
<v Speaker 1>work really well for some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not for everyone but for some people.</v>

371
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.180
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

372
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Were the Nazis left wing?</v>

373
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

374
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.733
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the problem with any question that </v>

375
00:21:45.421 --> 00:21:49.260
<v Speaker 1>says is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>B is a equivalent to be,</v>

376
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.530
<v Speaker 1>is that it depends on how you define a </v>
<v Speaker 1>and B.</v>

377
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.363
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not trying to weasel out of the </v>

378
00:21:53.911 --> 00:21:54.570
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

379
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:58.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very serious about that.</v>

380
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.520
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis regarded themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>national socialists,</v>

381
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:03.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>

382
00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.020
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't free market capitalists,</v>

383
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:07.854
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they certainly weren't right wingers </v>

384
00:22:09.151 --> 00:22:11.910
<v Speaker 1>in the way that free market capitalists </v>
<v Speaker 1>are right wingers,</v>

385
00:22:11.911 --> 00:22:13.950
<v Speaker 1>even though they're probably more </v>
<v Speaker 1>centrist,</v>

386
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they differed from the international </v>

387
00:22:17.191 --> 00:22:18.024
<v Speaker 1>socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were the Marxists because they </v>

388
00:22:19.891 --> 00:22:23.850
<v Speaker 1>were much more concerned with national </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity and racial identity.</v>

389
00:22:23.851 --> 00:22:24.684
<v Speaker 1>And to the degree that you regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism and racial identity as </v>

390
00:22:28.471 --> 00:22:32.400
<v Speaker 1>primarily right wing views than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis would have been right wing.</v>

391
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.110
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they pulled from the worst of both</v>

392
00:22:37.111 --> 00:22:38.730
<v Speaker 1>extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

393
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:39.563
<v Speaker 1>But I do think it's reasonable to note </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there extreme nationalism and </v>

394
00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:44.124
<v Speaker 1>ethnocentrism and racial identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably has more in common with the </v>

395
00:22:47.341 --> 00:22:50.580
<v Speaker 1>radical right than it does with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical left,</v>

396
00:22:50.581 --> 00:22:55.581
<v Speaker 1>which tends to be utopian universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm one of the things I thought would</v>

397
00:22:57.151 --> 00:23:02.130
<v Speaker 1>be an interesting research project would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be to take like 100 Nazi policies and to</v>

398
00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:02.964
<v Speaker 1>turn them into a questionnaire and asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>people either how much they agree with </v>

399
00:23:07.201 --> 00:23:11.400
<v Speaker 1>them after I figured out whether they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were left to right wing to begin with or</v>

400
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.353
<v Speaker 1>whether they thought the policies were </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of the left or the right </v>

401
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.523
<v Speaker 1>because that could be studied </v>
<v Speaker 1>empirically and I don't think anyone's </v>

402
00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:20.370
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that would be a very interesting,</v>

403
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.233
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a very interesting </v>

404
00:23:22.561 --> 00:23:27.210
<v Speaker 1>research project is left for Helgason </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably Matt,</v>

405
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.073
<v Speaker 1>Matt massacred that name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says who has a higher Iq at really </v>

406
00:23:32.281 --> 00:23:34.770
<v Speaker 1>gifted mathematician or a really gifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>painter.</v>

407
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Very difficult to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

408
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:43.220
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that gifted math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they're both gifted,</v>

409
00:23:43.261 --> 00:23:44.094
<v Speaker 1>they both have high Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can be certain that it's very </v>

410
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:48.950
<v Speaker 1>difficult to do anything that's truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>gifted,</v>

411
00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:52.580
<v Speaker 1>say above the average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>above the norm without being,</v>

412
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 1>without having a very high Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a creative realm.</v>

413
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.193
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about these idiot savant who </v>

414
00:23:58.371 --> 00:24:03.371
<v Speaker 1>have like one area of extreme expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally in those cases it's not so</v>

415
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 1>much that they have one area of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise,</v>

416
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:07.154
<v Speaker 1>it's that they have one area of above </v>
<v Speaker 1>average expertise that really contrast </v>

417
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:11.954
<v Speaker 1>with the rest of their impairments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they rarely if ever make it into </v>

418
00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:15.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.633
<v Speaker 1>the very short list of true geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mathematicians are kind of an odd bunch </v>

420
00:24:21.531 --> 00:24:24.020
<v Speaker 1>though because you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They peek really,</v>

421
00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:24.854
<v Speaker 1>really early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going to be a </v>

422
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:26.534
<v Speaker 1>mathematician and truly gifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to show signs of that </v>

423
00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:33.410
<v Speaker 1>when you're like 17 to 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

424
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.243
<v Speaker 1>Whereas painters can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be creative through their entire </v>

425
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:42.230
<v Speaker 1>lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably on average,</v>

426
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:43.064
<v Speaker 1>I would guess this is a guest that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you took 100 really gifted </v>

427
00:24:46.341 --> 00:24:48.620
<v Speaker 1>mathematicians in 100 really gifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>painters,</v>

428
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:53.621
<v Speaker 1>that the mathematicians would have far </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher nonverbal Iq,</v>

429
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.000
<v Speaker 1>but the painter's might have higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal Iq.</v>

430
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So that also complicates things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See with Iq also,</v>

431
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:06.260
<v Speaker 1>you know there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this factor called the g factor,</v>

432
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:07.094
<v Speaker 1>which is the central element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and it seems to be </v>

433
00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:11.354
<v Speaker 1>associated with such things as head size</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brain size relative to body and </v>

434
00:25:15.111 --> 00:25:18.380
<v Speaker 1>neural conduction speed and simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction time,</v>

435
00:25:18.381 --> 00:25:21.800
<v Speaker 1>like really basic physiological markers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

436
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.383
<v Speaker 1>and it's a pretty tight single factors </v>
<v Speaker 1>say as opposed to the personality </v>

437
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.710
<v Speaker 1>dimension d domain where there's five </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite clear factors,</v>

438
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:36.130
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was earl hunts research </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicated that as people get smarter and</v>

439
00:25:36.561 --> 00:25:37.394
<v Speaker 1>smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the variability between the subsets of </v>

440
00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:41.324
<v Speaker 1>their intelligence starts to increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like there's a lot of </v>

441
00:25:43.761 --> 00:25:44.594
<v Speaker 1>ways to be really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's only one way to be not very </v>

442
00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:47.954
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another little tidbit of </v>

443
00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 1>information with regards to ICU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

444
00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:01.983
<v Speaker 1>hello doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a 23 year old male with paranoid </v>

445
00:26:04.121 --> 00:26:05.650
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

446
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.320
<v Speaker 1>I feel like controlling 95 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

447
00:26:08.321 --> 00:26:09.154
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say I think you mean that </v>

448
00:26:10.031 --> 00:26:13.810
<v Speaker 1>you're controlling 95 percent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to seek a partner,</v>

449
00:26:13.811 --> 00:26:18.100
<v Speaker 1>but I am afraid how to reveal it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any advice on how to approach it?</v>

450
00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven,</v>

451
00:26:19.931 --> 00:26:21.400
<v Speaker 1>that's a really hard question.</v>

452
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

453
00:26:25.111 --> 00:26:25.944
<v Speaker 1>you're not under any obligation when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>first meet someone to drown them in </v>

454
00:26:30.781 --> 00:26:34.830
<v Speaker 1>information about your identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say</v>

455
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.390
<v Speaker 1>the devil's in the details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

456
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:40.523
<v Speaker 1>if you have a relationship with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's progressing and you're being </v>

457
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:45.504
<v Speaker 1>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my suspicions are that it will come up </v>

458
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:49.020
<v Speaker 1>with its own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

459
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:49.854
<v Speaker 1>that you'll be able to tell in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation when the right way to </v>

460
00:26:53.401 --> 00:26:55.200
<v Speaker 1>introduce it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

461
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:55.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

462
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.753
<v Speaker 1>if you're asking me this because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been in a relationship for a long time </v>

463
00:26:59.131 --> 00:27:03.570
<v Speaker 1>and you haven't revealed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I don't know what to tell you about</v>

464
00:27:03.571 --> 00:27:04.404
<v Speaker 1>that because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because I wouldn't give someone </v>

465
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:08.580
<v Speaker 1>general advice about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

466
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.473
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

467
00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:13.683
<v Speaker 2>sorry</v>

468
00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.960
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

469
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:18.400
<v Speaker 1>we speaking to a client and I had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>real</v>

470
00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.780
<v Speaker 1>detailed information about their current</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

471
00:27:22.781 --> 00:27:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I would sit down and help them </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategize about that.</v>

472
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Ask about the person you're telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure out how long you've gone out with</v>

473
00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:29.614
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way that it might be </v>

474
00:27:31.061 --> 00:27:33.010
<v Speaker 1>revealed that you would be comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

475
00:27:33.011 --> 00:27:33.844
<v Speaker 1>I suspect probably what you should do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>find someone you trust to talk about it </v>

476
00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.140
<v Speaker 1>if you're already in a relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>

477
00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:45.160
<v Speaker 1>then assume that if going into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

478
00:27:45.161 --> 00:27:49.150
<v Speaker 1>your basic goal is honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll handle it appropriately when</v>

479
00:27:49.151 --> 00:27:51.370
<v Speaker 1>the situation comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

480
00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:00.763
<v Speaker 1>how would you address accusations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are creating another ideological </v>

481
00:28:03.861 --> 00:28:04.694
<v Speaker 1>group identity which is equal in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for destruction to post Modern </v>

482
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Neo Marxism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

483
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:10.933
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would address it the way I've been </v>

484
00:28:12.201 --> 00:28:13.034
<v Speaker 1>addressing it for the whole last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that I'm not trying to produce </v>

485
00:28:18.201 --> 00:28:19.034
<v Speaker 1>a group identity of any sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get people to act locally </v>

486
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:24.463
<v Speaker 1>in the confines of their own environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to sort things out that are under </v>

487
00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:30.140
<v Speaker 1>their direct control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

488
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.190
<v Speaker 1>it's an elaboration of one of the ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's in the New Testament,</v>

489
00:28:34.191 --> 00:28:35.024
<v Speaker 1>which is that you should take the log </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your own eye before you worry </v>

490
00:28:37.881 --> 00:28:39.860
<v Speaker 1>about the dust speck in your neighbor's </v>
<v Speaker 1>eye,</v>

491
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.920
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a really good general </v>
<v Speaker 1>maxim.</v>

492
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.760
<v Speaker 1>And so there's nothing about that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with group identity.</v>

493
00:28:46.761 --> 00:28:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Now people have tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

494
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:51.463
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attribute to me some identity with the </v>

495
00:28:55.851 --> 00:28:59.150
<v Speaker 1>right or the alt right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even the far right more recently,</v>

496
00:28:59.151 --> 00:28:59.984
<v Speaker 1>even Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what came up in at Wilfrid </v>

497
00:29:02.301 --> 00:29:03.134
<v Speaker 1>laurier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the reason for that is </v>

498
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.190
<v Speaker 1>twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

499
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.233
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're imagine that there is a </v>

500
00:29:12.041 --> 00:29:14.500
<v Speaker 1>radical left that's not very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>to imagine,</v>

501
00:29:14.501 --> 00:29:15.334
<v Speaker 1>and then imagine that everyone to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right of the radical left is our all in </v>

502
00:29:21.161 --> 00:29:21.994
<v Speaker 1>opposition to the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have a group and the group </v>

503
00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:25.534
<v Speaker 1>is all those in opposition to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical left and that'll include people </v>

504
00:29:29.471 --> 00:29:32.770
<v Speaker 1>on the radical right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then when you look at that entire</v>

505
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:33.604
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say a thousand people or 1500 </v>

506
00:29:35.621 --> 00:29:36.454
<v Speaker 1>people come in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a talk that I give on free speech that </v>

507
00:29:38.411 --> 00:29:40.960
<v Speaker 1>happened on November 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

508
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.913
<v Speaker 1>there's 1500 people in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 15 of them are going to be </v>

509
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.440
<v Speaker 1>completely out of their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably more like 30,</v>

510
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:50.200
<v Speaker 1>but at least 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just base rate.</v>

511
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 1>And so to demonstrate that the group was</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow pathological,</v>

512
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:55.204
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to show that the base rate of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology was higher in the group than </v>

513
00:29:57.701 --> 00:29:59.590
<v Speaker 1>it would be in a randomly selected </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

514
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.573
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen no evidence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also even if there are a number of </v>

515
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:05.044
<v Speaker 1>people say on the far right in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>group that doesn't indicate at all that </v>

516
00:30:08.651 --> 00:30:09.484
<v Speaker 1>that's characteristic of the group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's very hard to distinguish that </v>

517
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:13.144
<v Speaker 1>because what tends to happen is that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group is defined by the most egregious </v>

518
00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:20.350
<v Speaker 1>behavior of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its most extreme members.</v>

519
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.573
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other way that I did address the </v>

520
00:30:24.221 --> 00:30:26.920
<v Speaker 1>accusation is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have done this as well,</v>

521
00:30:26.921 --> 00:30:29.470
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's what really protected </v>
<v Speaker 1>me this whole year,</v>

522
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:32.350
<v Speaker 1>is that I have all these youtube videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

523
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>600 hours of them.</v>

524
00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:40.141
<v Speaker 1>And the message is pretty stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more the newer manifestation is,</v>

525
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fairly focused critique of the </v>

526
00:30:46.661 --> 00:30:48.910
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is entirely justified.</v>

527
00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:49.744
<v Speaker 1>But everything around that is focused on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual and the role of the </v>

528
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:56.980
<v Speaker 1>individual and the responsibility of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

529
00:30:56.981 --> 00:31:01.360
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't believe that that is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological group identity,</v>

530
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 1>so that's how I would address it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

531
00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.430
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see what else we've got here.</v>

532
00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.950
<v Speaker 1>What is the evolutionary reason for </v>
<v Speaker 1>having consciousness?</v>

533
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that was toby who asked that</v>

534
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.600
<v Speaker 1>God only knows</v>

535
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:42.230
<v Speaker 1>that's been a problem that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been hammering on for a long time.</v>

536
00:31:42.231 --> 00:31:44.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the so called Zombie problem that</v>

537
00:31:44.511 --> 00:31:47.900
<v Speaker 1>David Chalmers is as described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something like,</v>

538
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:49.543
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that other people aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly like you except acting in a </v>

539
00:31:53.481 --> 00:31:56.130
<v Speaker 1>completely determined manner and devoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness.</v>

540
00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.380
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

541
00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason is for consciousness.</v>

542
00:32:00.891 --> 00:32:01.724
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can speculate like what consciousness </v>

543
00:32:03.801 --> 00:32:05.420
<v Speaker 1>seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

544
00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.010
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mechanism of repair.</v>

545
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.270
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the things that you do are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

546
00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're driving,</v>

547
00:32:15.621 --> 00:32:18.120
<v Speaker 1>if you're an expert driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

548
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.073
<v Speaker 1>you're using your eyes to watch the road</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your eyes are moving your hands and </v>

549
00:32:22.611 --> 00:32:23.444
<v Speaker 1>your arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not really thinking about </v>

550
00:32:26.331 --> 00:32:27.164
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not attending to it consciously </v>

551
00:32:28.431 --> 00:32:29.264
<v Speaker 1>because you've built circuitry already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized circuitry that handles all </v>

552
00:32:32.511 --> 00:32:33.410
<v Speaker 1>those tasks.</v>

553
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens when you're driving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you make a mistake.</v>

554
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.923
<v Speaker 1>Well then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You consciously attend to the mistake </v>

555
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.133
<v Speaker 1>and you attempt to revise the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the automatic structure that produced </v>

556
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:48.740
<v Speaker 1>the error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's imagine this.</v>

557
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:49.574
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're playing the piano and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're playing a very complicated a </v>

558
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:53.863
<v Speaker 1>sequence and you stumble over part of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're zooming along and you stumble </v>

559
00:32:57.981 --> 00:33:00.010
<v Speaker 1>over part of it and then you attend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

560
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:00.863
<v Speaker 1>You'd go back and you slow down and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>move your fingers slowly and you try to </v>

561
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:09.650
<v Speaker 1>reprogram those little automatic units </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have handled that part of that.</v>

562
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.693
<v Speaker 1>You repair them and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reprogram them and you get faster </v>

563
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:15.650
<v Speaker 1>and faster out of it as they automatize </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go.</v>

564
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:19.700
<v Speaker 1>So consciousness seems to be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that watches what you do,</v>

565
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:23.090
<v Speaker 1>automatically checks for errors and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>repairs it.</v>

566
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 1>And so that's its function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask why a repair mechanism</v>

567
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 1>like that would have to be associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with awareness announced that is,</v>

568
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do I not know,</v>

569
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone knows if I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculating and which I've done,</v>

570
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:39.883
<v Speaker 1>I think consciousness actually plays an </v>
<v Speaker 1>integral role in being itself because </v>

571
00:33:43.491 --> 00:33:44.324
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced that there would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>any being of any recognizable sort </v>

572
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.153
<v Speaker 1>without a conscious observer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think consciousness is actually </v>

573
00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:56.750
<v Speaker 1>like a center point of the cosmos in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

574
00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.180
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's because of ideas like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

575
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.043
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grand archetypal idea of the soul </v>

576
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:06.080
<v Speaker 1>has emerged and I think it's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

577
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.150
<v Speaker 1>but how to precisely integrate that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary theory.</v>

578
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:12.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from the description that already </v>

579
00:34:15.711 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 1>provided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

580
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

581
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.970
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else have we got here?</v>

582
00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.673
<v Speaker 1>Would you consider a more official </v>
<v Speaker 1>consultancy role with Andrew Scheer's </v>

583
00:34:29.711 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Conservative Party?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

584
00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.420
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to say what I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider.</v>

585
00:34:34.421 --> 00:34:35.254
<v Speaker 1>It isn't obvious to me that Andrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scheer would particularly like to have </v>

586
00:34:39.431 --> 00:34:40.264
<v Speaker 1>me as no official consultant time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of what might you describe a </v>

587
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.940
<v Speaker 1>controversial?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

588
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the word right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

589
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:49.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny though,</v>

590
00:34:49.301 --> 00:34:51.670
<v Speaker 1>because I was making this new video </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

591
00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:55.120
<v Speaker 1>which I alluded to earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using good old.</v>

592
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.290
<v Speaker 1>What's this character here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

593
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Hitler though Hitler the spokes frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

594
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back and looked at my comments on</v>

595
00:35:06.811 --> 00:35:08.970
<v Speaker 1>bill [inaudible] last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

596
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.863
<v Speaker 1>which were the comments that originally </v>
<v Speaker 1>got me in hot water and had me accused </v>

597
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:15.570
<v Speaker 1>of all the things I've been accused of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Transphobia,</v>

598
00:35:15.571 --> 00:35:17.100
<v Speaker 1>bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>

599
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>

600
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fascism being on the far right.</v>

601
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to top it all off,</v>

602
00:35:24.991 --> 00:35:25.824
<v Speaker 1>Hitler himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I realized </v>

603
00:35:28.471 --> 00:35:29.304
<v Speaker 1>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was really calm during that </v>

604
00:35:31.321 --> 00:35:32.970
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't have really.</v>

605
00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have offered a more mild </v>
<v Speaker 1>mannered criticism of bill [inaudible].</v>

606
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty funny because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

607
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.423
<v Speaker 1>I'm this scandal that engulfed Wilford </v>
<v Speaker 1>laurier this week is the worst scandal </v>

608
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.650
<v Speaker 1>that I remember involving university in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

609
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.320
<v Speaker 1>in my memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to the 19 seventies.</v>

610
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.813
<v Speaker 1>And what happened at Laurie was exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I predicted would happen except it </v>

611
00:35:57.991 --> 00:35:58.824
<v Speaker 1>was actually worse because they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>accuse Lindsay of breaking the law </v>

612
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:06.390
<v Speaker 1>spill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see 16 specifically,</v>

613
00:36:06.391 --> 00:36:08.730
<v Speaker 1>and have contravening the Ontario Human </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rights Code,</v>

614
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:09.720
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

615
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.430
<v Speaker 1>for all I know she might've done.</v>

616
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.773
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at this situation where a Ta </v>

617
00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:17.634
<v Speaker 1>showing a video of someone discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns in candidate can now be termed </v>

618
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.490
<v Speaker 1>a hate crime and illegal provincially </v>
<v Speaker 1>and federally.</v>

619
00:36:26.491 --> 00:36:29.670
<v Speaker 1>And like all the usual suspects have </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out of their</v>

620
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Speaker 1>caves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

621
00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Brenda Cossman,</v>

622
00:36:34.871 --> 00:36:36.600
<v Speaker 1>the lawyer I debated last year and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

623
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:40.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a real stretch to assume that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Shepherd did was,</v>

624
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.453
<v Speaker 1>was sufficiently reprehensible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually constitute a violation of the </v>

625
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guidelines,</v>

626
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.693
<v Speaker 1>policies hits a stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess we're supposed to feel good </v>

627
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:55.110
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

628
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably a little bit too hot right </v>

629
00:36:59.131 --> 00:37:02.700
<v Speaker 1>now to serve in any official consultant </v>
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>

630
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:03.833
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that I wouldn't be </v>

631
00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 1>happy to speak to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

632
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.340
<v Speaker 1>political figures who might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in speaking with me because,</v>

633
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I generally speak to people who asked me</v>

634
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 1>to speak to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

635
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:20.843
<v Speaker 1>as reprehensible as that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently moved up and was promoted and </v>

636
00:37:26.191 --> 00:37:28.710
<v Speaker 1>not liking it because I have to adjust </v>
<v Speaker 1>massively.</v>

637
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.693
<v Speaker 1>Is there a difference between liking </v>
<v Speaker 1>your job and the lack of discipline to </v>

638
00:37:31.861 --> 00:37:33.240
<v Speaker 1>perform a change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there,</v>

639
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 1>are they connected?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

640
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:36.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're definitely connected.</v>

641
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

642
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a real radical change,</v>

643
00:37:43.201 --> 00:37:44.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes people,</v>

644
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.863
<v Speaker 1>unless they're very young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes people about a year to adjust </v>

645
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.410
<v Speaker 1>to a really radical change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to move to a new city,</v>

646
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to adjust to being married.</v>

647
00:37:54.841 --> 00:37:59.250
<v Speaker 1>That can take longer than a year to </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust to having a new baby to,</v>

648
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:03.510
<v Speaker 1>to getting over a relatively serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss,</v>

649
00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:06.450
<v Speaker 1>like a death in the family a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

650
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:10.320
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing you might ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is,</v>

651
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.170
<v Speaker 1>are there things that are good about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>promotion?</v>

652
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.153
<v Speaker 1>The second is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have the capacity to do the job </v>

653
00:38:18.091 --> 00:38:19.290
<v Speaker 1>or to learn how to do it?</v>

654
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.123
<v Speaker 1>You could talk to someone about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the third thing is have you </v>

655
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:23.994
<v Speaker 1>given yourself enough time to adjust </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things I often </v>

656
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:27.594
<v Speaker 1>recommend to people when they've made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical change like going leaving home </v>

657
00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:31.224
<v Speaker 1>and going to university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is don't pay any attention to how you </v>

658
00:38:33.211 --> 00:38:37.750
<v Speaker 1>feel for a year because everything is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much up in the air that you can't really</v>

659
00:38:37.751 --> 00:38:38.584
<v Speaker 1>trust your own judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to give yourself time to </v>

660
00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:45.580
<v Speaker 1>adapt and you can't expect that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen overnight.</v>

661
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not.</v>

662
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:47.704
<v Speaker 1>And to put that expectation on yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases the probability that you're </v>

663
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:52.630
<v Speaker 1>going to feel bad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

664
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

665
00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Atomic Carlos says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my Iq is north of one slash 30.</v>

666
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Yet I questioned my own intelligence all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

667
00:39:03.401 --> 00:39:04.234
<v Speaker 1>I feel big cognitive dissonance between </v>
<v Speaker 1>what people expect of me and what I </v>

668
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:10.210
<v Speaker 1>considered myself capable to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

669
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos would,</v>

670
00:39:11.861 --> 00:39:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend there is that if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't done it,</v>

671
00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:15.784
<v Speaker 1>just go do the personality test and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand myself.com because what </v>

672
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:19.774
<v Speaker 1>you're describing sounds very much like </v>
<v Speaker 1>high levels of negative emotionality or </v>

673
00:39:24.371 --> 00:39:28.690
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and you might want to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out if that's the case because if you're</v>

674
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:29.583
<v Speaker 1>much higher than average in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be questioning </v>

675
00:39:32.891 --> 00:39:36.730
<v Speaker 1>yourself all the time and you might want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out if that's actually a trait</v>

676
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.013
<v Speaker 1>and if it is a trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then that gives you an explanation </v>

677
00:39:40.091 --> 00:39:40.924
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might also note that your </v>

678
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:47.500
<v Speaker 1>levels of negative emotion are not well </v>
<v Speaker 1>matched to your likely skill.</v>

679
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't necessarily help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to cope with it,</v>

680
00:39:51.341 --> 00:39:52.174
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes identifying the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's useful and there's another </v>

681
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:55.954
<v Speaker 1>possibility too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that your mood is dysregulated and </v>

682
00:39:57.881 --> 00:40:00.700
<v Speaker 1>that you're depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing to consider.</v>

683
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

684
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.130
<v Speaker 1>if you do find that you have high levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>of neuroticism but you're not depressed,</v>

685
00:40:07.131 --> 00:40:10.690
<v Speaker 1>then one of the things you might do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>write down all the reasons,</v>

686
00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:12.340
<v Speaker 1>like really think them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

687
00:40:12.341 --> 00:40:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really get serious about this,</v>

688
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:15.693
<v Speaker 1>write down all the reasons why you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>give yourself more credit for </v>

689
00:40:18.701 --> 00:40:19.534
<v Speaker 1>intelligence than you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of that could be like a really </v>

690
00:40:22.961 --> 00:40:23.794
<v Speaker 1>deep reconsideration of successes you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>had in the past with complex </v>

691
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:28.383
<v Speaker 1>intellectual issues because imagine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are serving as your own defense </v>

692
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 1>attorney against a very critical part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>

693
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can help a lot.</v>

694
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 1>That can help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marlene hibbs says,</v>

695
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:42.010
<v Speaker 1>my little girl loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

696
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.630
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

697
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I guess you can say hi to her for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that she has a great little life.</v>

698
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:54.443
<v Speaker 1>So give her a pat on the head and tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>him that cognizant of the modern art </v>

699
00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:02.080
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

700
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.520
<v Speaker 1>it isn't easy to figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to answer that question.</v>

701
00:41:07.521 --> 00:41:08.500
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

702
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:12.063
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been thinking also about art </v>
<v Speaker 1>for quite a long time because I've been </v>

703
00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:18.000
<v Speaker 1>so engaged in all this political and </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical materials.</v>

704
00:41:18.001 --> 00:41:19.570
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but music,</v>

705
00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:20.404
<v Speaker 1>as far as music goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the last recordings of </v>

706
00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:27.481
<v Speaker 1>Johnny cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else springs to mind?</v>

707
00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:35.070
<v Speaker 1>I like a very large variety of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different genres of music as well,</v>

708
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:39.830
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to leave it at that.</v>

709
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:40.664
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

710
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Richard Boyle says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

711
00:41:46.211 --> 00:41:47.044
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does the score of 91 for compassion </v>

712
00:41:49.781 --> 00:41:53.080
<v Speaker 1>and one for politeness equals a score of</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 for agreeableness?</v>

713
00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:54.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's because 91 in one aren't </v>

714
00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:57.723
<v Speaker 1>ordinary numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their percentiles and you can't just </v>

715
00:41:59.861 --> 00:42:02.470
<v Speaker 1>average percentiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work that way.</v>

716
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.430
<v Speaker 1>What it says is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

717
00:42:06.431 --> 00:42:07.264
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can generate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a description on the fly because </v>

718
00:42:09.731 --> 00:42:10.564
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I'm particularly </v>

719
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.113
<v Speaker 1>mathematically gifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I know that the answer I just </v>

720
00:42:14.831 --> 00:42:17.200
<v Speaker 1>gave you is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

721
00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:21.910
<v Speaker 1>There's one in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a one in 10 chance that a person</v>

722
00:42:21.911 --> 00:42:22.744
<v Speaker 1>would be that compassionate and a one in</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent chance that a person would </v>

723
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.700
<v Speaker 1>be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

724
00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:30.580
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

725
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't generate it on the fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the answer.</v>

726
00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:36.820
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to point to the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

727
00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you'd look up,</v>

728
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

729
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.710
<v Speaker 1>how to transform percentiles into CSI </v>
<v Speaker 1>scores.</v>

730
00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:47.320
<v Speaker 1>They were called CSI scores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can,</v>

731
00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:48.490
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

732
00:42:48.491 --> 00:42:51.190
<v Speaker 1>that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You convert the percentiles in disease,</v>

733
00:42:51.191 --> 00:42:53.590
<v Speaker 1>scores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you some disease scores,</v>

734
00:42:53.591 --> 00:42:55.600
<v Speaker 1>and then you reconvert them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentiles,</v>

735
00:42:55.601 --> 00:42:56.434
<v Speaker 1>and so if you take the z score for not </v>
<v Speaker 1>for compassion 91 and the z score for </v>

736
00:43:00.581 --> 00:43:02.800
<v Speaker 1>politeness one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>add them,</v>

737
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.200
<v Speaker 1>divide them into and reconvert them to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile,</v>

738
00:43:05.201 --> 00:43:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you'll get 35.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's weird,</v>

739
00:43:06.911 --> 00:43:08.140
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it,</v>

740
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:11.560
<v Speaker 1>that's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it's done.</v>

741
00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:13.653
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

742
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:21.040
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opioid crisis.</v>

743
00:43:21.171 --> 00:43:26.171
<v Speaker 1>This is army hat or hateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opioid crisis in my community in the</v>

744
00:43:26.751 --> 00:43:27.584
<v Speaker 1>midwest of America greatly bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about becoming a </v>

745
00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:32.204
<v Speaker 1>police officer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The culture has been very favorable </v>

746
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.473
<v Speaker 1>towards cops lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe maybe majoring in law in Grad </v>

747
00:43:38.391 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 1>school instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advice,</v>

748
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:42.050
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

749
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

750
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.120
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be a police officer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be very emotionally stable,</v>

751
00:43:49.121 --> 00:43:51.970
<v Speaker 1>so low in neuroticism and very high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

752
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:54.910
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be a lawyer,</v>

753
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you better be very bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

754
00:43:58.061 --> 00:44:01.960
<v Speaker 1>you need to be extremely bright verbally</v>
<v Speaker 1>in particular.</v>

755
00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.153
<v Speaker 1>You need to be extremely conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to be emotionally stable and </v>

756
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.840
<v Speaker 1>you need to be fairly disagreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

757
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:08.703
<v Speaker 1>that's what characterizes lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're high in openness and </v>

758
00:44:12.101 --> 00:44:13.270
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

759
00:44:13.271 --> 00:44:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I would say neither nor law is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation for you.</v>

760
00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:23.250
<v Speaker 1>So I wouldn't worry about the culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>not being too favorable towards cops.</v>

761
00:44:24.731 --> 00:44:27.130
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's really any worse than</v>

762
00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:27.964
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not as bad as it was in </v>

763
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:33.150
<v Speaker 1>the sixties and I don't that it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily continue.</v>

764
00:44:33.151 --> 00:44:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should let that stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because you know,</v>

765
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:37.943
<v Speaker 1>the police have their own brotherhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd find your community within </v>

766
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:41.490
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

767
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:43.613
<v Speaker 1>you what I would say you should think </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about what you want then how other </v>

768
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:50.210
<v Speaker 1>people view the occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's irrelevant,</v>

769
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.990
<v Speaker 1>but you should think about what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

770
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.823
<v Speaker 1>And I think if see if you can figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the life of a policeman would </v>

771
00:44:56.941 --> 00:44:59.010
<v Speaker 1>actually interest you or the life of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyer.</v>

772
00:44:59.011 --> 00:45:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Like lots of people go into law and </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like it.</v>

773
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:01.943
<v Speaker 1>You have to be argumentative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to really be literate because </v>

774
00:45:05.641 --> 00:45:08.670
<v Speaker 1>there's so much reading and writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to write,</v>

775
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.710
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to lay out clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments,</v>

776
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:11.783
<v Speaker 1>you have to be really orderly and detail</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented because there's so many things </v>

777
00:45:15.031 --> 00:45:16.690
<v Speaker 1>to keep track of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

778
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:18.263
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to make sure you got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right temperament for that so you could </v>

779
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:24.870
<v Speaker 1>try the big five personality scale at </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand myself.</v>

780
00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

781
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.530
<v Speaker 1>the good lawyers are high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

782
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:32.580
<v Speaker 1>low in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty disagreeable,</v>

783
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.833
<v Speaker 1>and then extroversion helps to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree because it makes you better in </v>

784
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 1>the court and it also makes you better </v>
<v Speaker 1>at generating sales leads,</v>

785
00:45:40.921 --> 00:45:42.930
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing your business,</v>

786
00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:44.850
<v Speaker 1>which is super important if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyer,</v>

787
00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:47.340
<v Speaker 1>like lots of people are competent </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers,</v>

788
00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:48.174
<v Speaker 1>but only a small set of competent </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers are also good at generating new </v>

789
00:45:53.011 --> 00:45:55.410
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you extremely valuable.</v>

790
00:45:55.411 --> 00:45:59.070
<v Speaker 1>So if you've got a salesmen aspect to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you as well as those other traits,</v>

791
00:45:59.071 --> 00:45:59.904
<v Speaker 1>which makes you a pretty rare person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know you could be a bang up </v>

792
00:46:01.831 --> 00:46:03.090
<v Speaker 1>lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

793
00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.070
<v Speaker 1>link with a light saber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

794
00:46:10.071 --> 00:46:11.180
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Canadian,</v>

795
00:46:11.181 --> 00:46:12.014
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to say thanks candidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>short on heroes these days and I'm glad </v>

796
00:46:14.991 --> 00:46:17.060
<v Speaker 1>to see you filled that role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks again bud.</v>

797
00:46:17.061 --> 00:46:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well thanks a lot man.</v>

798
00:46:18.531 --> 00:46:20.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think of myself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>

799
00:46:20.541 --> 00:46:21.374
<v Speaker 1>I think of myself as someone who's on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively small raft perched on a </v>

800
00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:27.074
<v Speaker 1>relatively large wave paddling like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mad dog and trying not to be submerged </v>

801
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.130
<v Speaker 1>so and so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

802
00:46:34.131 --> 00:46:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I haven't drawn yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hooray for that.</v>

803
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

804
00:46:39.081 --> 00:46:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you a little bit of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>book if you don't mind,</v>

805
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.560
<v Speaker 1>somewhere near the end of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

806
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:46.100
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably go for about two hours.</v>

807
00:46:46.101 --> 00:46:46.934
<v Speaker 1>So we got about another hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I figured I'd read something to you </v>

808
00:46:49.101 --> 00:46:51.710
<v Speaker 1>for about 15 minutes and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in that,</v>

809
00:46:51.711 --> 00:46:54.530
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just say so in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments section,</v>

810
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.393
<v Speaker 1>that would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I could see what people think of </v>

811
00:46:56.961 --> 00:46:57.794
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>

812
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see here.</v>

813
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.173
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's taken me just a little while to </v>

814
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.470
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone says,</v>

815
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

816
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:11.801
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

817
00:47:11.801 --> 00:47:12.634
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for that.</v>

818
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:14.123
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

819
00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:16.923
<v Speaker 1>Hi Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are feelings and why do we have </v>

820
00:47:18.851 --> 00:47:20.620
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

821
00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:25.270
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

822
00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:27.250
<v Speaker 1>let's say you were walking down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway.</v>

823
00:47:27.251 --> 00:47:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I actually saw this happen one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll you this story.</v>

824
00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:34.570
<v Speaker 1>So I was walking along the cliffs near,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was San Diego La,</v>

825
00:47:34.571 --> 00:47:38.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably,</v>

826
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was San Diego.</v>

827
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:42.123
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was walking along there with some </v>

828
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:47.200
<v Speaker 1>friends and a and a brother of a friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mine who was quite a tall guy.</v>

829
00:47:47.201 --> 00:47:49.360
<v Speaker 1>He's about six foot five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

830
00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:51.820
<v Speaker 1>And he was walking along the path on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>edge of the cliff,</v>

831
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:56.850
<v Speaker 1>kind of sandy and with with scrub pine </v>
<v Speaker 1>around overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</v>

832
00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And it was march I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was warm but not too warm.</v>

833
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.130
<v Speaker 1>We were walking along and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden,</v>

834
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.250
<v Speaker 1>his little girl who I think was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five,</v>

835
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:08.973
<v Speaker 1>she was walking in front of him and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of me and I guess we were going </v>

836
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:12.634
<v Speaker 1>round a little bit of a corner and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden she jumped right up on his </v>

837
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:18.340
<v Speaker 1>shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'd never seen a child do that.</v>

838
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.510
<v Speaker 1>It was like watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

839
00:48:19.511 --> 00:48:20.344
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a cat sleep and you and you and you </v>

840
00:48:22.271 --> 00:48:27.271
<v Speaker 1>go out and it'll jump up and puff out </v>
<v Speaker 1>its hair and can jump straight up.</v>

841
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what this kid did and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a rattlesnake at the side of the,</v>

842
00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 1>of the path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it was cold,</v>

843
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.520
<v Speaker 1>which was probably good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

844
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh</v>

845
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't read.</v>

846
00:48:41.951 --> 00:48:44.650
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a great book on fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll come to me.</v>

847
00:48:44.651 --> 00:48:45.484
<v Speaker 1>It'll come to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a book that I should have on my </v>

848
00:48:46.391 --> 00:48:51.391
<v Speaker 1>booklist actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he showed that there are circuits in</v>

849
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:53.134
<v Speaker 1>your brain there reflects circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this had been demonstrated to some </v>

850
00:48:56.261 --> 00:49:00.580
<v Speaker 1>degree much earlier that map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that a snake is a pattern.</v>

851
00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:01.414
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine that there's a pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your retina that constitutes the </v>

852
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:04.984
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then imagine that that can be </v>

853
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:10.300
<v Speaker 1>transformed into another pattern which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a muscular output pattern.</v>

854
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.870
<v Speaker 1>And that muscular output pattern is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>jump you in the air,</v>

855
00:49:13.871 --> 00:49:14.704
<v Speaker 1>so your eyes make your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your make your muscles move in a </v>

856
00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:24.130
<v Speaker 1>particular way that happens before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the snake and before you're afraid.</v>

857
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.233
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are not many neural connections </v>

858
00:49:28.061 --> 00:49:30.850
<v Speaker 1>between snake detection and leaping in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

859
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:36.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's because if you waited to feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear and waited to see the snake,</v>

860
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:39.070
<v Speaker 1>that would take between a quarter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>half a second,</v>

861
00:49:39.071 --> 00:49:39.904
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the snake would have already bitten </v>

862
00:49:42.041 --> 00:49:42.874
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unless you had those really short </v>

863
00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:44.914
<v Speaker 1>neuropathways that have been conserved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the evolutionary process since like </v>

864
00:49:48.911 --> 00:49:49.744
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything super fast and simple would be </v>

865
00:49:52.751 --> 00:49:55.390
<v Speaker 1>able to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

866
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.750
<v Speaker 1>so let's say that you do encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>something unexpected.</v>

867
00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Well first you have these bodily </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflexes that are really fast.</v>

868
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.140
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

869
00:50:05.141 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 1>is that you feel an emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you're frozen,</v>

870
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:08.704
<v Speaker 1>so if you hear a real girl behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll freeze and then you'll feel fear </v>

871
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:16.090
<v Speaker 1>and that'll keep you frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the fear is,</v>

872
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:16.924
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an indication of that physiological </v>

873
00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:19.864
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then only after that will you start </v>

874
00:50:22.241 --> 00:50:23.074
<v Speaker 1>to think and strategize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need reactions at multiple </v>

875
00:50:27.351 --> 00:50:30.950
<v Speaker 1>levels of temporal resolution in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep you safe in the world.</v>

876
00:50:30.951 --> 00:50:33.500
<v Speaker 1>And the fast reactions are muscular and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflexive.</v>

877
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 1>And then the next ones generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

878
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.390
<v Speaker 1>are something like emotions and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>low resolution,</v>

879
00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:39.410
<v Speaker 1>but quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

880
00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:43.310
<v Speaker 1>like if you're afraid it means there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that may be dangerous.</v>

881
00:50:43.311 --> 00:50:45.990
<v Speaker 1>It's vague and it's not until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>explore it,</v>

882
00:50:45.991 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 1>that you know exactly what the danger </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

883
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 1>But the fear is a good enough initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

884
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:55.190
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about feelings as </v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctual categories,</v>

885
00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.290
<v Speaker 1>things to love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to eat,</v>

886
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:58.243
<v Speaker 1>things to run away from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to run towards their low </v>

887
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:01.844
<v Speaker 1>resolution categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how animals categories the </v>

888
00:51:04.581 --> 00:51:05.414
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use emotion and motivation to </v>

889
00:51:06.411 --> 00:51:07.244
<v Speaker 1>categorize the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to keep ourselves properly </v>

890
00:51:10.581 --> 00:51:14.210
<v Speaker 1>oriented in the world and to react </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly and so that we can stay alive.</v>

891
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:15.463
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

892
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see here.</v>

893
00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:25.050
<v Speaker 1>What else have we got?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recently?</v>

894
00:51:25.141 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I took a job working at a camp with at </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk boys were.</v>

895
00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Well there I will live at work as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>counselor and a house with the kids.</v>

896
00:51:31.861 --> 00:51:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Any advice for working with young people</v>
<v Speaker 1>with behavioral issues?</v>

897
00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

898
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.660
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what the behavioral issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

899
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.110
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what our risk means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

900
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:46.003
<v Speaker 1>so I can't be too specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I can tell you is that almost </v>

901
00:51:50.391 --> 00:51:52.340
<v Speaker 1>nothing beats listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

902
00:51:52.341 --> 00:51:55.730
<v Speaker 1>like take a kid for a walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them talk,</v>

903
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.500
<v Speaker 1>like listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask them questions,</v>

904
00:51:57.501 --> 00:51:58.334
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most disturbed people and maybe </v>

905
00:52:01.311 --> 00:52:06.311
<v Speaker 1>even most people don't actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone they can talk to and they need to</v>

906
00:52:06.471 --> 00:52:11.120
<v Speaker 1>talk first of all to find out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone actually cares enough to listen.</v>

907
00:52:11.121 --> 00:52:11.954
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like a validation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that they exist and second so that </v>

908
00:52:15.351 --> 00:52:19.280
<v Speaker 1>they can sort out their own thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as a beginning counselor,</v>

909
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.210
<v Speaker 1>the best thing you can do is listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to give advice really,</v>

910
00:52:23.211 --> 00:52:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what you want,</v>

911
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 1>you can ask questions that might lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone in an advisable direction.</v>

912
00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:29.174
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with giving advice is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are much more likely to </v>

913
00:52:32.661 --> 00:52:33.494
<v Speaker 1>remember something and to implement it </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they've thought it up in their own </v>

914
00:52:36.411 --> 00:52:38.660
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that actually produces a kind of</v>

915
00:52:38.661 --> 00:52:39.494
<v Speaker 1>neurological transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea has to be engendered from </v>

916
00:52:42.261 --> 00:52:44.420
<v Speaker 1>within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the prime dicta of,</v>

917
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:46.640
<v Speaker 1>of psychoanalytic theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

918
00:52:46.641 --> 00:52:49.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

919
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:50.750
<v Speaker 1>With,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to.</v>

920
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:53.210
<v Speaker 1>So Brendan Crystal says trippy snakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and retinas.</v>

921
00:52:53.211 --> 00:52:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really specific.</v>

922
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So this woman named um,</v>

923
00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably can't remember her name.</v>

924
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Me It either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

925
00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.240
<v Speaker 1>she wrote a book about trees and </v>
<v Speaker 1>serpents.</v>

926
00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a ucla professor.</v>

927
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fruit,</v>

928
00:53:08.201 --> 00:53:10.090
<v Speaker 1>the tree and the serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called.</v>

929
00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:11.283
<v Speaker 1>She showed quite clearly that not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>do our retinas say directly detects </v>

930
00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:15.424
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do a better job in the bottom </v>

931
00:53:16.811 --> 00:53:17.644
<v Speaker 1>half of the retina and that we're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at detecting the camouflage </v>

932
00:53:22.001 --> 00:53:23.860
<v Speaker 1>patterns that are characteristic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>

933
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Snakes have these like patterns which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very,</v>

934
00:53:26.401 --> 00:53:30.270
<v Speaker 1>very rare and we have specialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuitry for detecting those.</v>

935
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:35.271
<v Speaker 1>And there is recent research conducted </v>
<v Speaker 1>that showed that children six months old</v>

936
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:38.160
<v Speaker 1>who had never been exposed to anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>even resembling a snake,</v>

937
00:53:38.161 --> 00:53:42.210
<v Speaker 1>had an automatic response to snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it actually seems to be innate,</v>

938
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.010
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

939
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 1>not just easily learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really quite interesting.</v>

940
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:53.360
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

941
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.570
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to the pigeon hole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

942
00:54:03.571 --> 00:54:06.780
<v Speaker 1>How do you clean your room when your </v>
<v Speaker 1>spouse doesn't share that goal?</v>

943
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.233
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

944
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another one of those questions.</v>

945
00:54:14.161 --> 00:54:16.710
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to answer because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the details,</v>

946
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:18.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you clean your room?</v>

947
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.860
<v Speaker 1>What goals does your spouse have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>

948
00:54:22.861 --> 00:54:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there some commonality?</v>

949
00:54:25.921 --> 00:54:28.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be maybe you're exposed as much</v>

950
00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:28.884
<v Speaker 1>more disorderly than you or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious or irritated at you for </v>

951
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.830
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

952
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:34.973
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you could do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to lead by example and see how that </v>

953
00:54:40.021 --> 00:54:40.854
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you may have to argue and fight it </v>

954
00:54:42.631 --> 00:54:43.371
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

955
00:54:43.371 --> 00:54:45.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>break it down into sub tasks and,</v>

956
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:51.180
<v Speaker 1>and see if you can distribute the tasks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and negotiate.</v>

957
00:54:51.181 --> 00:54:55.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And without further information,</v>

958
00:54:55.771 --> 00:54:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't say much more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

959
00:54:57.331 --> 00:54:58.164
<v Speaker 1>you can say why you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you think the goal we're and goal </v>

960
00:55:00.811 --> 00:55:01.644
<v Speaker 1>was and that you'd like some help and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something you could offer </v>

961
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:04.584
<v Speaker 1>in return.</v>

962
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:05.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't negotiate at all with your </v>

963
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:08.064
<v Speaker 1>spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have a much broader problem </v>

964
00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:10.014
<v Speaker 1>than how do you clean your room when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were supposed doesn't share that goal </v>

965
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:16.410
<v Speaker 1>because the real problem would be how do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn to negotiate with your spouse?</v>

966
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.660
<v Speaker 1>I could talk about that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

967
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:22.530
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to negotiate with someone is</v>

968
00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:27.210
<v Speaker 1>be able to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is to have something to</v>

969
00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:31.260
<v Speaker 1>offer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third thing is to find out what they</v>

970
00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:33.910
<v Speaker 1>want and to know what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

971
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:37.200
<v Speaker 1>because often people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with people that love them,</v>

972
00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:37.681
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

973
00:55:37.681 --> 00:55:39.840
<v Speaker 1>if you really knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really love me,</v>

974
00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:41.520
<v Speaker 1>then you'd know what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

975
00:55:41.521 --> 00:55:42.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just wrong.</v>

976
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:43.703
<v Speaker 1>The person that you are in love with or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that living with isn't any smarter than </v>

977
00:55:46.651 --> 00:55:47.250
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

978
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:48.083
<v Speaker 1>And so you pretty much always have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people straight out what you want </v>

979
00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:51.803
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to let them be really </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid about giving it to you for quite </v>

980
00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:55.020
<v Speaker 1>a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

981
00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:55.853
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes I've recommended to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients that they take their wife or </v>

982
00:55:59.941 --> 00:56:00.774
<v Speaker 1>husband out on a date and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all skeptical about that and </v>

983
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.380
<v Speaker 1>cynical about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

984
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.473
<v Speaker 1>then they go on a date and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible time and they come back and </v>

985
00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:08.910
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

986
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I told you that was a stupid idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tell them,</v>

987
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:12.743
<v Speaker 1>that's it then a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna do anything romantic </v>

988
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 1>with your spouse for the next 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your plan.</v>

989
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:18.444
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan is that it's like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have to go out to a movie after </v>

990
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:25.960
<v Speaker 1>you haven't been good to each other for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like five years.</v>

991
00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:29.050
<v Speaker 1>You might have to go out to movie 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>times movie and dinner,</v>

992
00:56:29.051 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 1>say before it starts to become fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

993
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's hard to do that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

994
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:35.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

995
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.750
<v Speaker 1>People think those things are easy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

996
00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:41.200
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>

997
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.270
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn to negotiate with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>spouse.</v>

998
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:47.373
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very difficult thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm figuring out what you want is a </v>

999
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:54.010
<v Speaker 1>good way to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1000
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.233
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1001
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.280
<v Speaker 1>What advice would you give the parent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an only child?</v>

1002
00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make sure that the child,</v>

1003
00:57:07.441 --> 00:57:11.160
<v Speaker 1>your child has lots of time for free </v>
<v Speaker 1>play with other kids.</v>

1004
00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:14.790
<v Speaker 1>And by free play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean play with no electronic gadgets,</v>

1005
00:57:14.791 --> 00:57:19.791
<v Speaker 1>not sitting in front of the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids have to be able to learn how to</v>

1006
00:57:20.431 --> 00:57:25.200
<v Speaker 1>amuse themselves and to especially to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in pretend play,</v>

1007
00:57:25.201 --> 00:57:26.034
<v Speaker 1>say if they're between three and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 11 damn near that time with </v>

1008
00:57:30.931 --> 00:57:31.764
<v Speaker 1>other kids is extremely important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids don't get enough time for free </v>

1009
00:57:34.891 --> 00:57:35.724
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would say is get them </v>

1010
00:57:37.051 --> 00:57:37.884
<v Speaker 1>around other kids as much as you can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not under situations where the parents </v>

1011
00:57:42.691 --> 00:57:43.524
<v Speaker 1>are going to just sit them in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV or something like that to amuse </v>

1012
00:57:45.781 --> 00:57:46.614
<v Speaker 1>them so they don't make too much noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's anything wrong </v>

1013
00:57:49.321 --> 00:57:50.970
<v Speaker 1>with seeing them and letting them watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie,</v>

1014
00:57:50.971 --> 00:57:53.370
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1015
00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:57.630
<v Speaker 1>But there is something wrong with not </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving the kids enough time to engage in</v>

1016
00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.120
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a catastrophe.</v>

1017
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:05.330
<v Speaker 1>So how has the GRANDPA and going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going pretty well.</v>

1018
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.450
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a lot of fun to have a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby around again.</v>

1019
00:58:09.451 --> 00:58:14.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think like most man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhat nonplussed,</v>

1020
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.340
<v Speaker 1>let's say by infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1021
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.980
<v Speaker 1>it's easier for me to deal with kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>after they were about,</v>

1022
00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.073
<v Speaker 1>once they get mobile la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I can sort of throw them around a </v>

1023
00:58:24.241 --> 00:58:27.510
<v Speaker 1>bit more than I know what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them once I can play with them,</v>

1024
00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's really fun to watch my daughter</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a mother.</v>

1025
00:58:31.711 --> 00:58:32.544
<v Speaker 1>She's really good at it and it's good to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have another young thing in the family </v>

1026
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:40.140
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because babies are very,</v>

1027
00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:43.200
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of like fire you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but watch them and</v>

1028
00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:49.290
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great and she seems healthy and um,</v>

1029
00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:55.090
<v Speaker 1>she's cute as can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course babies are sneaky that way,</v>

1030
00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1031
00:58:57.041 --> 00:59:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1032
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I constantly cannot verbalize my </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts written and focal regardless of</v>

1033
00:59:06.341 --> 00:59:07.174
<v Speaker 1>topic and my level of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tips for verbalizing thoughts to get </v>

1034
00:59:10.121 --> 00:59:13.420
<v Speaker 1>them into writing and therefore speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1035
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:17.590
<v Speaker 1>what I would say lauren is do this like </v>
<v Speaker 1>read something,</v>

1036
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.833
<v Speaker 1>put a decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to summarize it in writing and talk </v>

1037
00:59:24.051 --> 00:59:24.884
<v Speaker 1>while you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then write down what you say and </v>

1038
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:28.940
<v Speaker 1>don't edit while you're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1039
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:31.760
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're trying to write,</v>

1040
00:59:31.761 --> 00:59:34.780
<v Speaker 1>as they try to write a good sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1041
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:35.713
<v Speaker 1>they not only tried to write a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they try to write a good sentence </v>

1042
00:59:37.971 --> 00:59:40.730
<v Speaker 1>and you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to write a sentence that's hard</v>

1043
00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:42.920
<v Speaker 1>enough and then you have to edit it.</v>

1044
00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:47.920
<v Speaker 1>So allow yourself to write badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious about this,</v>

1045
00:59:48.021 --> 00:59:49.430
<v Speaker 1>like write a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

1046
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:54.350
<v Speaker 1>bad first draft and then edit it if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of 70 percent of it.</v>

1047
00:59:54.351 --> 00:59:56.570
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what should happen.</v>

1048
00:59:56.571 --> 00:59:58.760
<v Speaker 1>So like if you want to write a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>word essay,</v>

1049
00:59:59.000 --> 00:59:59.833
<v Speaker 1>you should start by writing a really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 word essay and then you should get </v>

1050
01:00:03.921 --> 01:00:06.680
<v Speaker 1>rid of the worst 50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that iteratively.</v>

1051
01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I have a document online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1052
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.210
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to my website,</v>

1053
01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm under courses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's psychology for 30 is the course.</v>

1054
01:00:15.801 --> 01:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I should make this more public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but under a cycle psychology for 30.</v>

1055
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a template for writing and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you went looked at that template,</v>

1056
01:00:24.381 --> 01:00:26.740
<v Speaker 1>it tells you it answers your question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1057
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.793
<v Speaker 1>I produced this little guidebook for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for writing that will help and if you </v>

1058
01:00:32.721 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 1>write enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll learn to speak.</v>

1059
01:00:36.201 --> 01:00:37.034
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I would say too is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be anxiety that's do you might </v>

1060
01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:41.504
<v Speaker 1>think about joining a club like </v>
<v Speaker 1>toastmasters or maybe if you're a </v>

1061
01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>university student to public speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1062
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.553
<v Speaker 1>something where you'd get in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and then when you're in front of </v>

1063
01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't talk to the group,</v>

1064
01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>talked to the individuals within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>group and let yourself be bad at it.</v>

1065
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:57.463
<v Speaker 1>You'll get better as you practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your plan if Youtube deletes </v>

1066
01:01:02.031 --> 01:01:02.864
<v Speaker 1>your account?</v>

1067
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:06.163
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause as much trouble as I possibly </v>

1068
01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1069
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have it.</v>

1070
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I do have most of my videos on Vimeo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I haven't had,</v>

1071
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:18.943
<v Speaker 1>I did try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I set up an automated service to </v>

1072
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>duplicate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never checked to see if it worked,</v>

1073
01:01:23.991 --> 01:01:27.260
<v Speaker 1>which is probably stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been so overwhelmed with,</v>

1074
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.490
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1075
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>with this surreal position that I found </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself in that I haven't been able to be</v>

1076
01:01:39.861 --> 01:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently diligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1077
01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:43.123
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1078
01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>how to be less afraid of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a better suggestion.</v>

1079
01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>You should be more afraid of not living </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

1080
01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can be less afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of death.</v>

1081
01:01:56.061 --> 01:01:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that here's a hypothesis,</v>

1082
01:01:59.871 --> 01:02:03.470
<v Speaker 1>and this is a socratic hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write about this in my book too,</v>

1083
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.960
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1084
01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you live your life thoroughly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly,</v>

1085
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:10.483
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take use of the advantage is make </v>

1086
01:02:12.051 --> 01:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>use of the advantages that are put in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you.</v>

1087
01:02:14.061 --> 01:02:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Make use of your talents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say Yes to things.</v>

1088
01:02:16.791 --> 01:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Tell the truth like stand and get out </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1089
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming that you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1090
01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>because some people are very ill and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hurt.</v>

1091
01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:26.853
<v Speaker 1>But assuming you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the only way to combat fear of </v>

1092
01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:31.434
<v Speaker 1>death is to live fully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that might actually </v>

1093
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1094
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:35.963
<v Speaker 1>I kind of wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this with my father </v>

1095
01:02:37.801 --> 01:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was getting pretty old.</v>

1096
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've asked him if,</v>

1097
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.453
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he could be transformed back into an </v>

1098
01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>18 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing what he knows now,</v>

1099
01:02:45.721 --> 01:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>would he do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was ambivalent about that,</v>

1100
01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say no,</v>

1101
01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:50.334
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about this idea that if </v>

1102
01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>you lived your life fully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1103
01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe that would be good enough because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1104
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:00.963
<v Speaker 1>I loved having kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't feel that I would have kids </v>

1105
01:03:05.881 --> 01:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1106
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.200
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense I've already done </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1107
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.633
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe there's a set number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventures that you have to go on in </v>

1108
01:03:16.411 --> 01:03:18.570
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you have to be married,</v>

1109
01:03:18.571 --> 01:03:20.250
<v Speaker 1>you have to have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a career,</v>

1110
01:03:20.251 --> 01:03:21.084
<v Speaker 1>you have to have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have something useful to do </v>

1111
01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:27.510
<v Speaker 1>with your time outside of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all things that are covered in</v>

1112
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:29.100
<v Speaker 1>the future authoring program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1113
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:31.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you do all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1114
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.450
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've had your life.</v>

1115
01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:34.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's enough.</v>

1116
01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1117
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:38.810
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1118
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.650
<v Speaker 1>if I could extend my life radically,</v>

1119
01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:47.190
<v Speaker 1>then I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not so sure about that.</v>

1120
01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Now that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 55,</v>

1121
01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:49.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting older.</v>

1122
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have a suspicion that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might come to an end,</v>

1123
01:03:56.581 --> 01:03:58.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like.</v>

1124
01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that to be sued,</v>

1125
01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:06.350
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you exhaust yourself in your life,</v>

1126
01:04:06.351 --> 01:04:07.184
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can so that there's nothing </v>

1127
01:04:08.181 --> 01:04:13.181
<v Speaker 1>left of view really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good goal anyways.</v>

1128
01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.690
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1129
01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to this other</v>

1130
01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:21.323
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an interview for medicine coming </v>

1131
01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:27.180
<v Speaker 1>up very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's structured in the I format and it's</v>

1132
01:04:27.181 --> 01:04:28.014
<v Speaker 1>intensely competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any tips on how to stand out from the </v>

1133
01:04:30.421 --> 01:04:35.310
<v Speaker 1>rest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1134
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:36.980
<v Speaker 1>the only thing I can say is that</v>

1135
01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:39.773
<v Speaker 1>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is really pay attention to the </v>

1136
01:04:42.181 --> 01:04:43.200
<v Speaker 1>interviewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1137
01:04:43.201 --> 01:04:44.034
<v Speaker 1>Super attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't glare at them like you're </v>

1138
01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:46.973
<v Speaker 1>aggressively paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like make sure you're focused on </v>

1139
01:04:49.951 --> 01:04:50.784
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing I would say is </v>

1140
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:56.370
<v Speaker 1>say what you really think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tell the truth.</v>

1141
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:58.770
<v Speaker 1>It'll make you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1142
01:04:58.771 --> 01:05:00.360
<v Speaker 1>if you tell the truth and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

1143
01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's not the school for you.</v>

1144
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:06.590
<v Speaker 1>That's something to really think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1145
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.030
<v Speaker 1>and if it doesn't work anywhere and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth,</v>

1146
01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:09.864
<v Speaker 1>maybe medicine isn't for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know that might be a terrible </v>

1147
01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:12.444
<v Speaker 1>shock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume that you are genuinely </v>

1148
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>properly motivated to study medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then tell them what you think.</v>

1149
01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>You know so many people when they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into an interview,</v>

1150
01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.320
<v Speaker 1>try and they do this when they write </v>
<v Speaker 1>essays too,</v>

1151
01:05:26.321 --> 01:05:29.650
<v Speaker 1>is try to tell the interviewers what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they want to hear it,</v>

1152
01:05:29.651 --> 01:05:30.484
<v Speaker 1>but you can bloody well be sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually everybody who's being </v>

1153
01:05:32.321 --> 01:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>interviewed is going to do that.</v>

1154
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.553
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that's very advisable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't manifest yourself </v>

1155
01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>the way you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's no way that the path that's</v>

1156
01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>proper for you can reveal itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds sort of mystical,</v>

1157
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how to put it any </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1158
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.033
<v Speaker 1>The best way to stand out in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview always assuming you're </v>

1159
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>competent and that you've done the </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation,</v>

1160
01:05:56.621 --> 01:06:01.060
<v Speaker 1>you know and that you're not living a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lie is to actually say what you think.</v>

1161
01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.613
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully what will happen is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be other people on the panel </v>

1162
01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:07.290
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1163
01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:08.123
<v Speaker 1>that are looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are of the same type and that would </v>

1164
01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:14.560
<v Speaker 1>characterize a good position for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good place to be.</v>

1165
01:06:14.561 --> 01:06:15.394
<v Speaker 1>If there are people like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll know what you're doing and that </v>

1166
01:06:17.981 --> 01:06:21.070
<v Speaker 1>will that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll think you know that person,</v>

1167
01:06:21.071 --> 01:06:23.440
<v Speaker 1>you know they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be good.</v>

1168
01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.150
<v Speaker 1>There are straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're honest,</v>

1169
01:06:25.151 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tough.</v>

1170
01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.630
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can say what they think.</v>

1171
01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And if there aren't people like that on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the panel,</v>

1172
01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:33.430
<v Speaker 1>then I would say you probably don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go there anyways.</v>

1173
01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:36.520
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would do.</v>

1174
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Be True to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1175
01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:39.993
<v Speaker 1>but that also assumes that you've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>your homework and that you're prepared </v>

1176
01:06:43.241 --> 01:06:44.074
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're useless jackass and </v>

1177
01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:48.640
<v Speaker 1>you're yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that is going to work.</v>

1178
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:52.330
<v Speaker 1>So good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with your interview.</v>

1179
01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.673
<v Speaker 1>But I always think that like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing too is don't treat the </v>

1180
01:06:57.011 --> 01:06:59.680
<v Speaker 1>interviewers as enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1181
01:06:59.681 --> 01:07:00.514
<v Speaker 1>if that's hard because if you're kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>petrified about the potential outcome </v>

1182
01:07:04.181 --> 01:07:05.014
<v Speaker 1>and you feel intense judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're likely to go in there and </v>

1183
01:07:08.051 --> 01:07:12.430
<v Speaker 1>kind of afraid and nervous and and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even resentful.</v>

1184
01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:13.264
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1185
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.250
<v Speaker 1>you've already done enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get interviewed.</v>

1186
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:23.340
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense the interviewers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping that you'll be great already.</v>

1187
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:24.963
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be the odd cynic in there </v>

1188
01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:26.584
<v Speaker 1>who's trying to figure out a reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you an x and and check you off the </v>

1189
01:07:29.711 --> 01:07:32.830
<v Speaker 1>list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the people sitting there,</v>

1190
01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:33.664
<v Speaker 1>if they have a clue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be looking for good </v>

1191
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:37.870
<v Speaker 1>candidates and they're going to assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're.</v>

1192
01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.860
<v Speaker 1>You've hit threshold and so it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're not on your side.</v>

1193
01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a good thing to keep in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind too.</v>

1194
01:07:43.781 --> 01:07:47.230
<v Speaker 1>You're not going in there to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to face a panel of enemies,</v>

1195
01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:51.880
<v Speaker 1>you're going in there to face a panel of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of people that you're likely to</v>

1196
01:07:51.881 --> 01:07:52.714
<v Speaker 1>be in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing that's really </v>

1197
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:56.860
<v Speaker 1>useful to keep in mind with interviews </v>
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>

1198
01:07:56.861 --> 01:07:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I would say so.</v>

1199
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of my friends seeing the wonders of</v>

1200
01:08:03.451 --> 01:08:04.284
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to tell them diversity isn't a </v>

1201
01:08:06.151 --> 01:08:06.984
<v Speaker 1>moral good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I ended up looking like some </v>

1202
01:08:09.181 --> 01:08:11.520
<v Speaker 1>terrible racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't diversity a moral good?</v>

1203
01:08:11.610 --> 01:08:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity is a moral good,</v>

1204
01:08:13.411 --> 01:08:14.244
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diversity by race doesn't produce </v>

1205
01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:18.520
<v Speaker 1>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1206
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>that's called racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That idea or diversity of gender doesn't</v>

1207
01:08:22.791 --> 01:08:25.370
<v Speaker 1>produce diversity unless that's how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>define diversity.</v>

1208
01:08:25.371 --> 01:08:26.204
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you get diversity partly </v>

1209
01:08:29.901 --> 01:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good way of looking at it.</v>

1210
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:39.200
<v Speaker 1>There is more diversity within groups of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people then between,</v>

1211
01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>so like men and women differ to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree in their personalities,</v>

1212
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.513
<v Speaker 1>but there's far more difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>men within the male group and women </v>

1213
01:08:47.361 --> 01:08:48.194
<v Speaker 1>within the male group than there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the average or typical male and </v>

1214
01:08:51.021 --> 01:08:53.630
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a stupid wait.</v>

1215
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:54.523
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume that what you want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization is pursuing your complex </v>

1216
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:03.620
<v Speaker 1>goal and you want a variety of skills </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be suited to that goal.</v>

1217
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Then you want there to be enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity of ability within the group so</v>

1218
01:09:08.781 --> 01:09:12.500
<v Speaker 1>that the goal can be achieved in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient and,</v>

1219
01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:15.560
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inexpensive manner,</v>

1220
01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what do you want?</v>

1221
01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Inefficient and expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously not.</v>

1222
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:23.203
<v Speaker 1>So there's a presumption that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity by using identity politics </v>

1223
01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:29.084
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's absolutely no evidence for </v>

1224
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:31.454
<v Speaker 1>that whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why diversity defined by race </v>

1225
01:09:37.161 --> 01:09:41.120
<v Speaker 1>or ethnicity or gender is not only not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral good,</v>

1226
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.983
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a moral evil because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispenses with the whole idea of the </v>

1227
01:09:45.921 --> 01:09:48.500
<v Speaker 1>individual dispenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of competence.</v>

1228
01:09:48.501 --> 01:09:49.334
<v Speaker 1>It just replaces it with the assumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you randomly select from the </v>

1229
01:09:52.761 --> 01:09:53.594
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's how you would get real </v>

1230
01:09:55.341 --> 01:09:56.174
<v Speaker 1>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you randomly select from the population </v>

1231
01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.310
<v Speaker 1>that that gives you the best qualified </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people.</v>

1232
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.293
<v Speaker 1>Well that's just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't do that to select the </v>

1233
01:10:04.581 --> 01:10:05.414
<v Speaker 1>plumber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the stupidest possible way of </v>

1234
01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:10.310
<v Speaker 1>selecting for anything randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1235
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.330
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between selecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>randomly and selecting accidentally.</v>

1236
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:19.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's moral diversity defined properly</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a moral good.</v>

1237
01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Diversity based on identity politics.</v>

1238
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Categories is a positive evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1239
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:26.683
<v Speaker 1>true to our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our prime minister's great example of </v>

1240
01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:30.650
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so back,</v>

1241
01:10:30.651 --> 01:10:31.484
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he announced that half of his cabinet </v>

1242
01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:35.624
<v Speaker 1>was going to be women because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>2015 or some like muddle headed virtue </v>

1243
01:10:39.891 --> 01:10:43.880
<v Speaker 1>signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signaling excuse for not thinking.</v>

1244
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I think only 20 percent or 25 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elected mps were female.</v>

1245
01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:52.880
<v Speaker 1>So the proper balance on average would </v>
<v Speaker 1>it be 25 percent female,</v>

1246
01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:53.714
<v Speaker 1>75 percent male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he should've done was figured out </v>

1247
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:57.763
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what qualities would make for a </v>

1248
01:10:59.661 --> 01:11:00.494
<v Speaker 1>competent cabinet minister because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually quite important to have </v>

1249
01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:03.884
<v Speaker 1>competent cabinet ministers and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>selected from among his people for </v>

1250
01:11:08.121 --> 01:11:08.954
<v Speaker 1>nothing other than competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could virtue signal and then he </v>

1251
01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 1>set up the most important board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1252
01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:18.480
<v Speaker 1>of the entire comp country on a random </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

1253
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how pathetic.</v>

1254
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.970
<v Speaker 1>He should've been pilloried by Canadians</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

1255
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:25.103
<v Speaker 1>But we're so clued out and also in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that you described is like if </v>

1256
01:11:29.611 --> 01:11:30.151
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1257
01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:33.060
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of Trudeau's cabinet </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have been women.</v>

1258
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:34.111
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1259
01:11:34.111 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 1>you're a misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1260
01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:38.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only 25 percent of the elected officials</v>

1261
01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:40.110
<v Speaker 1>were women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

1262
01:11:40.111 --> 01:11:40.944
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be better if 50 percent of the </v>

1263
01:11:42.211 --> 01:11:44.730
<v Speaker 1>were elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe it would be better,</v>

1264
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.940
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't.</v>

1265
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't fix it at the top end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was appalling.</v>

1266
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:52.913
<v Speaker 1>So it's a hard argument to make because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know that there's more </v>

1267
01:11:57.721 --> 01:12:01.140
<v Speaker 1>difference within groups then between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in order to be able to come up with</v>

1268
01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.030
<v Speaker 1>a credible argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1269
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:06.690
<v Speaker 1>and then so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1270
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:08.813
<v Speaker 1>How does one distinguish a statement </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from oneself rather than from </v>

1271
01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:12.390
<v Speaker 1>ideology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1272
01:12:12.391 --> 01:12:13.224
<v Speaker 1>I got a good hint about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're saying something that almost </v>

1273
01:12:17.131 --> 01:12:21.930
<v Speaker 1>anyone else could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's likely to be either cliched or</v>

1274
01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 1>ideological.</v>

1275
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Where as if you're speaking from </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

1276
01:12:26.011 --> 01:12:29.850
<v Speaker 1>then in some sense you're the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who could be saying that,</v>

1277
01:12:29.851 --> 01:12:33.480
<v Speaker 1>and so what that means in some senses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've taken ideas,</v>

1278
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:35.370
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in theological,</v>

1279
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.473
<v Speaker 1>and you've made them personal so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're speaking from a position that </v>

1280
01:12:40.681 --> 01:12:41.514
<v Speaker 1>only you can speak from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then then you have something </v>

1281
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:47.460
<v Speaker 1>original to offer in Solzhenitsyn's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago.</v>

1282
01:12:47.461 --> 01:12:48.294
<v Speaker 1>He talked about the like radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>communists who were thrown into the </v>

1283
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Gulag and they used to play comrade with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1284
01:12:53.821 --> 01:12:56.700
<v Speaker 1>It was a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they would do is bait them into</v>

1285
01:12:56.701 --> 01:13:01.050
<v Speaker 1>making continual propagandistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>communists statements.</v>

1286
01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:04.380
<v Speaker 1>It was an attempt to try to educate them</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of their possession,</v>

1287
01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:05.843
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can predict what someone is </v>

1288
01:13:08.071 --> 01:13:11.310
<v Speaker 1>going to say on the basis of their set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of beliefs,</v>

1289
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:14.640
<v Speaker 1>then they're not speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ideology is speaking.</v>

1290
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.100
<v Speaker 1>And if the ideology is speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even have to listen to them.</v>

1291
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:20.610
<v Speaker 1>You could just read about the ideology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make up your own mind now.</v>

1292
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the,</v>

1293
01:13:22.201 --> 01:13:23.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

1294
01:13:23.641 --> 01:13:24.474
<v Speaker 1>That's the objective view of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The subject of view is that statements </v>

1295
01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:31.920
<v Speaker 1>come from yourself that come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1296
01:13:31.921 --> 01:13:32.754
<v Speaker 1>I think first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightened you to some degree because </v>

1297
01:13:34.111 --> 01:13:37.740
<v Speaker 1>you actually open yourself up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world by saying something genuine,</v>

1298
01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:39.083
<v Speaker 1>but they also make you stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make you feel stronger put because </v>

1299
01:13:43.531 --> 01:13:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I think you're confronting your </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability properly,</v>

1300
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if I tell you something that I </v>

1301
01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:51.570
<v Speaker 1>really don't believe and you criticize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like who cares?</v>

1302
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't really believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it anyways,</v>

1303
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:57.300
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I have an ideology that's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mask or a persona,</v>

1304
01:13:57.301 --> 01:13:58.134
<v Speaker 1>which is generally the case personas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a youngin concept that means mask and </v>

1305
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.310
<v Speaker 1>it's often the thing that people confuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their real identity.</v>

1306
01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:06.503
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have a persona and someone </v>

1307
01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:08.400
<v Speaker 1>criticizes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1308
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:10.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't got to the real meat,</v>

1309
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:11.423
<v Speaker 1>but if I say something that I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe deeply believe and then it gets </v>

1310
01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>criticized like I've really put myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the line,</v>

1311
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.260
<v Speaker 1>and so people don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of frightening,</v>

1312
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:21.123
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still the way to genuine strength </v>

1313
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:24.543
<v Speaker 1>because you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also not just strength but also </v>

1314
01:14:27.251 --> 01:14:28.084
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to manifest yourself in the </v>

1315
01:14:29.741 --> 01:14:30.574
<v Speaker 1>world because you're a unique thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people bite need what's unique about </v>

1316
01:14:36.611 --> 01:14:38.440
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else might really need that.</v>

1317
01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:39.274
<v Speaker 1>I believe that you don't because each </v>
<v Speaker 1>person has something that's unique to </v>

1318
01:14:42.701 --> 01:14:43.534
<v Speaker 1>them to bring into being and if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>hide that they hide their light under a </v>

1319
01:14:47.891 --> 01:14:48.724
<v Speaker 1>Bushel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone is poorer for it and you </v>

1320
01:14:51.341 --> 01:14:54.130
<v Speaker 1>do that in part as social units and says</v>
<v Speaker 1>by turning in,</v>

1321
01:14:54.131 --> 01:14:57.910
<v Speaker 1>you're turning over your God given sole </v>
<v Speaker 1>to human dogma.</v>

1322
01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very bad idea.</v>

1323
01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:05.320
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see what else we've got here.</v>

1324
01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:08.320
<v Speaker 1>What time is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two 21.</v>

1325
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daddy read for us.</v>

1326
01:15:16.621 --> 01:15:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem man.</v>

1327
01:15:17.821 --> 01:15:18.654
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it.</v>

1328
01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:36.243
<v Speaker 1>David Maxwell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I scored the zero percentile for </v>

1329
01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:40.720
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and the 84th for </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

1330
01:15:40.721 --> 01:15:42.130
<v Speaker 1>How do I improve these scores?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1331
01:15:42.131 --> 01:15:42.964
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing David you might want </v>

1332
01:15:44.171 --> 01:15:47.230
<v Speaker 1>to think about is like if all of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>scores were low,</v>

1333
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:50.410
<v Speaker 1>then there's some possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being too hard on yourself.</v>

1334
01:15:50.411 --> 01:15:51.244
<v Speaker 1>And what I would recommend Danny's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a couple of friends to fill out the </v>

1335
01:15:54.821 --> 01:15:59.620
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to describe you and then see if,</v>

1336
01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:01.170
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's any agreement,</v>

1337
01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:02.023
<v Speaker 1>see if they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are easier on you than you are </v>

1338
01:16:03.611 --> 01:16:05.020
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1339
01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.740
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume that you are rather low</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conscientiousness.</v>

1340
01:16:08.741 --> 01:16:09.850
<v Speaker 1>The next question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1341
01:16:09.851 --> 01:16:10.684
<v Speaker 1>how young are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because younger people tend to be </v>

1342
01:16:12.221 --> 01:16:14.650
<v Speaker 1>lowered conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're like 16,</v>

1343
01:16:14.651 --> 01:16:17.410
<v Speaker 1>well that's low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not catastrophic.</v>

1344
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:20.680
<v Speaker 1>If you're 40 and you're not depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and zero is,</v>

1345
01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:21.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's low</v>

1346
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:24.123
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

1347
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.650
<v Speaker 1>If you are that low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

1348
01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:29.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I would recommend is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1349
01:16:29.741 --> 01:16:30.574
<v Speaker 1>make a plan and be learn how to use a </v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule a calendar and do it badly to </v>

1350
01:16:34.871 --> 01:16:36.460
<v Speaker 1>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like electronic calendar,</v>

1351
01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:37.294
<v Speaker 1>like Google calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best thing I know of to </v>

1352
01:16:39.131 --> 01:16:42.850
<v Speaker 1>improve conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a plan so that you've got something</v>

1353
01:16:42.851 --> 01:16:47.851
<v Speaker 1>to aim at and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a scheduler and maybe you have to,</v>

1354
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to someone to help keep you on </v>

1355
01:16:51.371 --> 01:16:52.204
<v Speaker 1>track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the other question would be do you </v>

1356
01:16:54.251 --> 01:16:56.710
<v Speaker 1>have other personality traits that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really high,</v>

1357
01:16:56.711 --> 01:16:57.544
<v Speaker 1>like openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're really high in </v>

1358
01:16:58.781 --> 01:16:59.614
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it might be that you're more </v>

1359
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:06.070
<v Speaker 1>inclined towards being motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous interest and in the artistic</v>

1360
01:17:06.071 --> 01:17:08.170
<v Speaker 1>direction and if you're really high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

1361
01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:10.310
<v Speaker 1>then you could be motivated by being </v>
<v Speaker 1>around people.</v>

1362
01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:14.870
<v Speaker 1>So it also may be that in order to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious about something,</v>

1363
01:17:14.871 --> 01:17:15.704
<v Speaker 1>you have to pick a domain that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>suited to like socializing or artistic </v>

1364
01:17:19.281 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 1>endeavor and try to work on being </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious in those domains.</v>

1365
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:26.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1366
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:31.123
<v Speaker 1>James Montgomery says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you be confident and courageous </v>

1367
01:17:33.771 --> 01:17:36.560
<v Speaker 1>if your father was emotionally absent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and narcissistic?</v>

1368
01:17:36.561 --> 01:17:37.394
<v Speaker 1>I'm 21 and very creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother is a people pleaser who isn't </v>

1369
01:17:39.651 --> 01:17:43.030
<v Speaker 1>confident in herself and uses me as </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional support.</v>

1370
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.473
<v Speaker 1>Help.</v>

1371
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:56.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1372
01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you're confident about some things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said you were very creative.</v>

1373
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:06.980
<v Speaker 1>So you're confident enough to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know</v>

1374
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't see the problem with questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

1375
01:18:17.681 --> 01:18:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not criticizing your question by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1376
01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:24.361
<v Speaker 1>is that you're linking your lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence and courage to the absence of</v>

1377
01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:25.324
<v Speaker 1>your father and his narcissism and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>associating it with your mother being a </v>

1378
01:18:28.841 --> 01:18:30.490
<v Speaker 1>people pleaser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1379
01:18:30.491 --> 01:18:32.680
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may be something to that.</v>

1380
01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:36.800
<v Speaker 1>It could be James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could,</v>

1381
01:18:37.210 --> 01:18:42.100
<v Speaker 1>could stand to talk to somebody you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile on a regular basis and see if</v>

1382
01:18:42.190 --> 01:18:46.270
<v Speaker 1>they can help you sort this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You obviously seem to think that this is</v>

1383
01:18:46.271 --> 01:18:49.030
<v Speaker 1>a problem with you moving forward in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

1384
01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:51.850
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to talk to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

1385
01:18:51.851 --> 01:18:55.090
<v Speaker 1>then I would say the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a plan.</v>

1386
01:18:55.150 --> 01:18:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always refer to that,</v>

1387
01:18:56.441 --> 01:18:57.274
<v Speaker 1>but it's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a plan and then you need to </v>

1388
01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:01.083
<v Speaker 1>break the plan down into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into small steps that are somewhat </v>

1389
01:19:04.151 --> 01:19:08.560
<v Speaker 1>challenging that you have a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of nonetheless obtaining.</v>

1390
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say by observing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself move forward properly that your</v>

1391
01:19:13.901 --> 01:19:16.120
<v Speaker 1>confidence will increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're only 21,</v>

1392
01:19:16.150 --> 01:19:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're not that old.</v>

1393
01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:19.810
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1394
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:21.333
<v Speaker 1>that's the best I can do without having </v>
<v Speaker 1>more information about the specifics of </v>

1395
01:19:24.971 --> 01:19:25.840
<v Speaker 1>your situation.</v>

1396
01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Can't increase your Iq in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant way.</v>

1397
01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Eat healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the right thing.</v>

1398
01:19:56.231 --> 01:19:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Best potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1399
01:19:57.161 --> 01:20:00.520
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you could do if not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase it,</v>

1400
01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:05.350
<v Speaker 1>is at least to maintain it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that because your Iq tends to decline</v>

1401
01:20:05.351 --> 01:20:07.090
<v Speaker 1>as you age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite depressing.</v>

1402
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:09.030
<v Speaker 1>You read the relevant literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1403
01:20:09.031 --> 01:20:09.864
<v Speaker 1>your crystallized Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an indication of your </v>

1404
01:20:11.881 --> 01:20:14.440
<v Speaker 1>accumulated knowledge doesn't decline </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1405
01:20:14.441 --> 01:20:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it even increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1406
01:20:16.081 --> 01:20:17.730
<v Speaker 1>unless you get dementia or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1407
01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:20.640
<v Speaker 1>But your fluid Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more like the program or of the</v>

1408
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:21.474
<v Speaker 1>brain declines a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best way to deal with that is to </v>

1409
01:20:24.181 --> 01:20:29.181
<v Speaker 1>exercise both aerobic and weight lifting</v>
<v Speaker 1>can really stave off cognitive decline.</v>

1410
01:20:31.441 --> 01:20:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's because your brain is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

1411
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.153
<v Speaker 1>It's very demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a very demanding set of </v>

1412
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.473
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if your cardiovascular system is </v>

1413
01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:45.270
<v Speaker 1>in good shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your brain is healthier.</v>

1414
01:20:45.271 --> 01:20:47.250
<v Speaker 1>And since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

1415
01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:48.084
<v Speaker 1>your Iq depends on your brain than </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a healthy brain is really a good </v>

1416
01:20:51.091 --> 01:20:52.470
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1417
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Newton says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often don't do very well,</v>

1418
01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:13.813
<v Speaker 1>don't very well and doubt my ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up for myself and discussions and </v>

1419
01:21:16.461 --> 01:21:18.380
<v Speaker 1>aggressive situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

1420
01:21:18.381 --> 01:21:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Do I know when I've incorporated my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow?</v>

1421
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry,</v>

1422
01:21:31.381 --> 01:21:33.120
<v Speaker 1>that practice makes perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1423
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:37.980
<v Speaker 1>one thing you could do is start keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>track of situations like that.</v>

1424
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:38.833
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you you walk away thinking that </v>

1425
01:21:41.671 --> 01:21:42.504
<v Speaker 1>you should have said something and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would say write down the </v>

1426
01:21:45.421 --> 01:21:46.254
<v Speaker 1>situation and then think through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>write down what you think you should </v>

1427
01:21:50.401 --> 01:21:51.234
<v Speaker 1>have done and that because that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help you be sharper on the draw and </v>

1428
01:21:55.021 --> 01:21:59.430
<v Speaker 1>more ready when and then so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So write down the situation,</v>

1429
01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:01.620
<v Speaker 1>write down what you think you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have done.</v>

1430
01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Then sit and imagine the situation as </v>
<v Speaker 1>vividly as you can,</v>

1431
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:06.893
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the pictures in your head and </v>

1432
01:22:08.071 --> 01:22:08.904
<v Speaker 1>imagine yourself doing that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to get the psychophysiological </v>

1433
01:22:12.631 --> 01:22:13.464
<v Speaker 1>response is up as well so that you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as realistic as possible and that </v>

1434
01:22:16.861 --> 01:22:20.280
<v Speaker 1>will actually help you practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Edna Foa,</v>

1435
01:22:20.281 --> 01:22:22.080
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a very good clinical psychologist,</v>

1436
01:22:22.081 --> 01:22:25.830
<v Speaker 1>has demonstrated quite clearly that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>treating post traumatic stress disorder,</v>

1437
01:22:25.831 --> 01:22:26.664
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get people to sit and imagined </v>

1438
01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:30.503
<v Speaker 1>being back in this stressful situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to do that voluntarily and </v>

1439
01:22:33.061 --> 01:22:33.894
<v Speaker 1>after at least 18 months after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma had that she did </v>

1440
01:22:37.141 --> 01:22:37.974
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiological recording of heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate and skin conductance and that kind </v>

1441
01:22:40.651 --> 01:22:41.250
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

1442
01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:42.083
<v Speaker 1>She showed that the people who showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest levels of stress reactivity </v>

1443
01:22:46.201 --> 01:22:49.380
<v Speaker 1>to the reimagining were the ones who got</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

1444
01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:52.200
<v Speaker 1>fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stayed better longest.</v>

1445
01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:56.520
<v Speaker 1>So you have a situation that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't mastered,</v>

1446
01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.350
<v Speaker 1>define the situation repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Define your proper action repeatedly.</v>

1447
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Practice implementing that in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>

1448
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 1>and then start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that in your real life.</v>

1449
01:23:06.341 --> 01:23:07.800
<v Speaker 1>And that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll,</v>

1450
01:23:07.801 --> 01:23:10.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you write down what you should've</v>

1451
01:23:10.181 --> 01:23:12.010
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll find out what you really want and</v>

1452
01:23:12.011 --> 01:23:13.600
<v Speaker 1>what you really think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1453
01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:15.890
<v Speaker 1>that'll be your shadow talking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1454
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:17.103
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the part of your brain that </v>

1455
01:23:19.901 --> 01:23:20.734
<v Speaker 1>wishes it would have done something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different is the shadow associated with </v>

1456
01:23:24.551 --> 01:23:25.384
<v Speaker 1>the aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's integration would strengthen your </v>

1457
01:23:27.821 --> 01:23:28.990
<v Speaker 1>character?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1458
01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.630
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking about it.</v>

1459
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:36.900
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt says,</v>

1460
01:23:39.170 --> 01:23:39.741
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an.</v>

1461
01:23:39.741 --> 01:23:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1462
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.713
<v Speaker 1>Matt says I need to ask you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you please release your new book as </v>

1463
01:23:44.331 --> 01:23:49.331
<v Speaker 1>an audiobook as well in your own voice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1464
01:23:49.701 --> 01:23:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to record it on Monday.</v>

1465
01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:52.933
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of surprised that people want </v>

1466
01:23:55.071 --> 01:23:58.790
<v Speaker 1>me to record it in my own voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of scratchy at the moment,</v>

1467
01:23:59.690 --> 01:24:00.523
<v Speaker 1>but I'm looking forward to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been practicing reading it with my </v>

1468
01:24:02.811 --> 01:24:05.060
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts her to sleep at night.</v>

1469
01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully that's not because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

1470
01:24:07.131 --> 01:24:10.690
<v Speaker 1>She does get quite tired at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>

1471
01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Let's see here.</v>

1472
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Would you ever consider having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue with legitimate Muslim scholar?</v>

1473
01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1474
01:24:20.481 --> 01:24:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And I know a number of them and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping that I'll get to that.</v>

1475
01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big thing to take on,</v>

1476
01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to deal with this </v>

1477
01:24:28.871 --> 01:24:29.704
<v Speaker 1>biblical lecture series and with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well all the other things that I'm </v>

1478
01:24:32.111 --> 01:24:35.440
<v Speaker 1>involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including starting to lay the groundwork</v>

1479
01:24:35.441 --> 01:24:37.510
<v Speaker 1>for this online university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is which,</v>

1480
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.373
<v Speaker 1>and I've started looking for an office </v>
<v Speaker 1>where a team could work on that and </v>

1481
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:42.833
<v Speaker 1>we've sketched out some of the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna use competitive writing </v>

1482
01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:49.960
<v Speaker 1>exercises to help teach people to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think would really be fun.</v>

1483
01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:52.110
<v Speaker 1>So one idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1484
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:54.303
<v Speaker 1>so imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember this is just the outline of </v>

1485
01:24:56.381 --> 01:24:57.214
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine we present you with a paragraph </v>

1486
01:24:58.451 --> 01:24:59.284
<v Speaker 1>that someone else wrote and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the opportunity to do a better job </v>

1487
01:25:02.711 --> 01:25:06.130
<v Speaker 1>of writing it and then people get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to vote on who's is better.</v>

1488
01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:07.323
<v Speaker 1>You could see that the paragraphs could </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete and that you could get a </v>

1489
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.860
<v Speaker 1>academic points based on the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your writing.</v>

1490
01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

1491
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all to say,</v>

1492
01:25:16.631 --> 01:25:17.464
<v Speaker 1>especially also with this book coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>out is that I'm going to be very </v>

1493
01:25:19.661 --> 01:25:20.494
<v Speaker 1>occupied and I want to start a dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>with legitimate Muslim scholars because </v>

1494
01:25:29.471 --> 01:25:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I would also like to learn more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

1495
01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.930
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully that'll happen in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1496
01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:37.870
<v Speaker 1>in the relatively near future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1497
01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Jake says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been incredibly inspired by you.</v>

1498
01:25:57.411 --> 01:26:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Love what you do and would like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened people in a similar manner,</v>

1499
01:26:00.710 --> 01:26:05.480
<v Speaker 1>be careful what you wish for it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is appropriate to aim to have as much as</v>

1500
01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.470
<v Speaker 1>an impact as you or more so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1501
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the idea formulated wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense.</v>

1502
01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1503
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:22.390
<v Speaker 1>it's good to have people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>admire,</v>

1504
01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:27.420
<v Speaker 1>let's say who can serve as models and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not claiming that I'm necessarily in</v>

1505
01:26:29.591 --> 01:26:31.720
<v Speaker 1>that category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's good to have people like that.</v>

1506
01:26:31.721 --> 01:26:35.110
<v Speaker 1>But what you want to figure out to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

1507
01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:39.280
<v Speaker 1>to do is how to manifest the ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the confines of your own life,</v>

1508
01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.233
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're a particular sort of </v>

1509
01:26:41.141 --> 01:26:45.550
<v Speaker 1>person and so the way that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live your life best,</v>

1510
01:26:45.551 --> 01:26:50.551
<v Speaker 1>it's very unlikely that it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated in any important way with the</v>

1511
01:26:50.681 --> 01:26:51.514
<v Speaker 1>way that I've chosen to live my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless we have very similar </v>

1512
01:26:53.831 --> 01:26:55.300
<v Speaker 1>temperaments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is possible,</v>

1513
01:26:55.301 --> 01:26:57.430
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively unlikely</v>

1514
01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:01.000
<v Speaker 1>because the odds against that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1515
01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:02.180
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily high.</v>

1516
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:07.950
<v Speaker 1>The odds of any two people having the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same temperament are very,</v>

1517
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:13.230
<v Speaker 1>are very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you can do is aim to,</v>

1518
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:14.933
<v Speaker 1>to Orient yourself towards high good </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can conceive up to discipline </v>

1519
01:27:18.481 --> 01:27:20.430
<v Speaker 1>yourself to tell the truth and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1520
01:27:20.431 --> 01:27:23.250
<v Speaker 1>And then what I would say is that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life unfolds,</v>

1521
01:27:23.251 --> 01:27:25.950
<v Speaker 1>you'll have the amount of influence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have.</v>

1522
01:27:26.190 --> 01:27:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1523
01:27:28.351 --> 01:27:32.970
<v Speaker 1>some people live pretty local lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my life for example,</v>

1524
01:27:32.971 --> 01:27:33.804
<v Speaker 1>is much more public than my wife's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that her </v>

1525
01:27:38.041 --> 01:27:40.350
<v Speaker 1>contribution is somehow lesser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1526
01:27:40.351 --> 01:27:42.540
<v Speaker 1>she's been unbelievably good with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

1527
01:27:42.541 --> 01:27:43.374
<v Speaker 1>My daughter was very ill and my wife was</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily good with her and was a </v>

1528
01:27:46.771 --> 01:27:51.210
<v Speaker 1>great mother and has been a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>help to me as a very honest person and a</v>

1529
01:27:51.211 --> 01:27:54.450
<v Speaker 1>wise person and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all has an impact.</v>

1530
01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:55.283
<v Speaker 1>It's just not as obvious because while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids really love her and now she's </v>

1531
01:27:57.961 --> 01:27:58.794
<v Speaker 1>got grandkids and God only knows what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of that is going to be </v>

1532
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:05.240
<v Speaker 1>across successive generations and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1533
01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:09.980
<v Speaker 1>she isn't interested in public life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a journalist too vast to interviewer</v>

1534
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:12.240
<v Speaker 1>like quite recently about what the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year has been.</v>

1535
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Liking her preferences to not do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine.</v>

1536
01:28:17.851 --> 01:28:18.684
<v Speaker 1>Like she has her own destiny and her own</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of being in the world and there's </v>

1537
01:28:22.410 --> 01:28:26.130
<v Speaker 1>nothing to say that it's lesser in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of the word at all.</v>

1538
01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:30.300
<v Speaker 1>So should artists wastes their time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>art school?</v>

1539
01:28:30.301 --> 01:28:32.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't waste your time ever.</v>

1540
01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:33.773
<v Speaker 1>I think your question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it necessarily a waste of time to go </v>

1541
01:28:37.621 --> 01:28:38.454
<v Speaker 1>to art school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say it depends very much on </v>

1542
01:28:41.221 --> 01:28:44.580
<v Speaker 1>the art school and are on what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're there.</v>

1543
01:28:44.970 --> 01:28:45.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to art school and you really </v>

1544
01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:53.400
<v Speaker 1>work at it like mad and you devote </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to it and you're in the library</v>

1545
01:28:53.401 --> 01:28:54.234
<v Speaker 1>and you're studying the great masters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're crafting your technique and </v>

1546
01:28:57.301 --> 01:28:59.340
<v Speaker 1>you're at a school where that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

1547
01:28:59.370 --> 01:29:00.203
<v Speaker 1>then you can educate and going to art </v>
<v Speaker 1>school can give you an identity that </v>

1548
01:29:04.711 --> 01:29:05.544
<v Speaker 1>allows you to investigate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility free from undue social </v>

1549
01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:11.244
<v Speaker 1>pressure for some period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really the case with an arts </v>

1550
01:29:14.101 --> 01:29:18.810
<v Speaker 1>degree or something like that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can take advantage of it,</v>

1551
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.453
<v Speaker 1>if you're disciplined enough and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can find a school that isn't completely </v>

1552
01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.593
<v Speaker 1>appallingly postmodern and and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice oriented instead of oriented </v>

1553
01:29:29.581 --> 01:29:32.460
<v Speaker 1>towards art and I don't think it has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a waste of time,</v>

1554
01:29:32.461 --> 01:29:35.370
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a high probability </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it will.</v>

1555
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious.</v>

1556
01:29:41.191 --> 01:29:42.024
<v Speaker 1>Respectful question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you have a problem with Lindsay </v>

1557
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd being criticized for being non </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical but you criticized faith Goldie</v>

1558
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:49.980
<v Speaker 1>for being non critical?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1559
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.903
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really listened carefully to faith's </v>

1560
01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:01.460
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interview that was conducted I think</v>

1561
01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:02.303
<v Speaker 1>with the daily stormer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really listened to it and I sat down </v>

1562
01:30:04.171 --> 01:30:08.530
<v Speaker 1>and listened to it with my son whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment I respect a lot and</v>

1563
01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.593
<v Speaker 1>the thing that differentiates the two is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that faith is a journalist and my sense </v>

1564
01:30:16.011 --> 01:30:16.844
<v Speaker 1>was that</v>

1565
01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.680
<v Speaker 1>in this situation that she found </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself,</v>

1566
01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.353
<v Speaker 1>it was incumbent on her as a journalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask at least one or two probing </v>

1567
01:30:28.991 --> 01:30:29.824
<v Speaker 1>questions given the nature of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that know nature and the fact that she </v>

1568
01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:38.020
<v Speaker 1>knew the nature of the people that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking to and I don't feel that she</v>

1569
01:30:38.021 --> 01:30:38.854
<v Speaker 1>did it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was obviously not alone in my </v>

1570
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:42.663
<v Speaker 1>assessment of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So her employer who was very favorably </v>

1571
01:30:45.101 --> 01:30:48.490
<v Speaker 1>predisposed towards her also let her go </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of that.</v>

1572
01:30:48.491 --> 01:30:53.491
<v Speaker 1>And so I know that and I've been accused</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being hypocritical as a consequence.</v>

1573
01:30:53.951 --> 01:30:54.784
<v Speaker 1>And I should also say that the decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>to restructure the panel wasn't mine </v>

1574
01:30:58.361 --> 01:30:59.194
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was actually while it was divided up </v>

1575
01:31:02.561 --> 01:31:05.170
<v Speaker 1>amongst the panel members essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1576
01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:10.850
<v Speaker 1>that's what we decided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we decided and you know,</v>

1577
01:31:10.970 --> 01:31:11.803
<v Speaker 1>faith herself had offered to bow out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the panel because she knew that her </v>

1578
01:31:15.831 --> 01:31:20.831
<v Speaker 1>presence would be controversial in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might not be productive.</v>

1579
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:25.580
<v Speaker 1>So whereas Lindsey was just a student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1580
01:31:25.581 --> 01:31:26.414
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was doing what she was supposed </v>

1581
01:31:27.891 --> 01:31:31.490
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not trying to denigrate faith as</v>

1582
01:31:31.491 --> 01:31:34.580
<v Speaker 1>a journalist in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some general sense,</v>

1583
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:36.830
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1584
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Charlottesville was very touchy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

1585
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:41.263
<v Speaker 1>and it required an unbelievably deft </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand to go into that sort of rats nest </v>

1586
01:31:46.761 --> 01:31:47.594
<v Speaker 1>and come out unscathed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should think Kudos for her to </v>

1587
01:31:52.641 --> 01:31:54.800
<v Speaker 1>her for having the courage to even </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt it.</v>

1588
01:31:55.190 --> 01:31:56.023
<v Speaker 1>But there's a difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to distinguish </v>

1589
01:32:01.051 --> 01:32:04.470
<v Speaker 1>between brave and foolhardy and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they say?</v>

1590
01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

1591
01:32:08.650 --> 01:32:10.210
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought about it a lot.</v>

1592
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I listened to it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We made the decision we made.</v>

1593
01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1594
01:32:15.431 --> 01:32:16.264
<v Speaker 1>it was right in some omniscient sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that the situation </v>

1595
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:20.733
<v Speaker 1>that Lindsay shepherd found herself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>is sufficiently comparable to that of </v>

1596
01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:27.400
<v Speaker 1>faith to make the question,</v>

1597
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:32.230
<v Speaker 1>to make the comparison fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid.</v>

1598
01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So Ethan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond,</v>

1599
01:32:34.001 --> 01:32:34.990
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a liberal.</v>

1600
01:32:34.991 --> 01:32:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Ethan.</v>

1601
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1602
01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I've considered myself a liberal for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>

1603
01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.860
<v Speaker 1>So a welcome.</v>

1604
01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:48.043
<v Speaker 1>Do you think I publicly disassociate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself enough with my neo Nazi </v>

1605
01:32:51.411 --> 01:32:52.244
<v Speaker 1>followers that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that use your work as justification for </v>

1606
01:32:55.491 --> 01:32:57.410
<v Speaker 1>violence and propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1607
01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of question is that?</v>

1608
01:32:59.930 --> 01:33:00.930
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1609
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:01.843
<v Speaker 1>you're making the unwarranted assumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I definitely have neo Nazi </v>

1610
01:33:05.691 --> 01:33:08.090
<v Speaker 1>followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followers,</v>

1611
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:09.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they use my work as a </v>

1612
01:33:11.331 --> 01:33:14.840
<v Speaker 1>justification and that they're engaged </v>
<v Speaker 1>in violence and propaganda.</v>

1613
01:33:14.841 --> 01:33:17.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like how about a specific example </v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1614
01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:20.510
<v Speaker 1>or how about 10 specific examples?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1615
01:33:20.511 --> 01:33:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I already pointed out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that.</v>

1616
01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.300
<v Speaker 1>So 30 million people have watched my </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

1617
01:33:25.301 --> 01:33:28.550
<v Speaker 1>so let's add 500,000 of them are youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers.</v>

1618
01:33:28.551 --> 01:33:33.110
<v Speaker 1>So let's say I have 500,000 followers </v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the sake of argument.</v>

1619
01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.393
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a thousand of them are going to be </v>

1620
01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.970
<v Speaker 1>completely out of their minds because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one in 500.</v>

1621
01:33:41.210 --> 01:33:42.890
<v Speaker 1>So what does that proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1622
01:33:42.891 --> 01:33:43.724
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to demonstrate that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher rate than average of pathology </v>

1623
01:33:48.081 --> 01:33:52.340
<v Speaker 1>among the people who claim in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner to be my followers.</v>

1624
01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:56.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do that because as I said,</v>

1625
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:58.723
<v Speaker 1>everyone who's to the right of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical left is a group and in that </v>

1626
01:34:02.211 --> 01:34:04.250
<v Speaker 1>group that was going to be people on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>far right.</v>

1627
01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.113
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean everyone in the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>of non radical leftists is a radical </v>

1628
01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:10.910
<v Speaker 1>right winger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

1629
01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:14.150
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1630
01:34:14.151 --> 01:34:14.984
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1631
01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's a loaded question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's loaded in a bunch of ways.</v>

1632
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you publicly dissociate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself enough?</v>

1633
01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:25.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a loaded question because the </v>

1634
01:34:27.741 --> 01:34:31.130
<v Speaker 1>implication is that I don't publicly </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissociate myself enough.</v>

1635
01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:31.993
<v Speaker 1>Then the next implication is that I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>more neo Nazi followers than a random </v>

1636
01:34:36.801 --> 01:34:39.530
<v Speaker 1>person with 500,000 followers would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

1637
01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:44.330
<v Speaker 1>And then the next like loaded bit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they use my work as justification.</v>

1638
01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see that happen because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't see it,</v>

1639
01:34:46.641 --> 01:34:47.474
<v Speaker 1>how it can possibly be used as </v>
<v Speaker 1>justification and that they use it as a </v>

1640
01:34:50.421 --> 01:34:53.150
<v Speaker 1>justification for both propaganda and </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

1641
01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:54.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1642
01:34:55.710 --> 01:35:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1643
01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:05.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if this is the case,</v>

1644
01:35:05.321 --> 01:35:06.154
<v Speaker 1>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that you wrote that </v>

1645
01:35:07.841 --> 01:35:11.160
<v Speaker 1>question because you were favorably </v>
<v Speaker 1>disposed towards me and you know,</v>

1646
01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:14.710
<v Speaker 1>wanted to give me an opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>address that question and you know,</v>

1647
01:35:14.711 --> 01:35:15.544
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is definitely the kind of </v>

1648
01:35:18.551 --> 01:35:19.384
<v Speaker 1>question that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of journalists who have been </v>

1649
01:35:21.371 --> 01:35:23.350
<v Speaker 1>coming after me have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1650
01:35:23.351 --> 01:35:25.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you stopped beating your wife yet?</v>

1651
01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.553
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to answer a question </v>

1652
01:35:27.371 --> 01:35:28.990
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You losing their way.</v>

1653
01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:32.200
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1654
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Well I think what I'm going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to run out of energy here,</v>

1655
01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:46.000
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to read some of this.</v>

1656
01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1657
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:51.060
<v Speaker 1>What the hell addressed the Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>

1658
01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:54.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a thing to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's Jack Linter,</v>

1659
01:35:54.090 --> 01:35:54.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really that's a hell of a thing </v>

1660
01:35:55.981 --> 01:35:58.110
<v Speaker 1>to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say something about it,</v>

1661
01:35:58.710 --> 01:36:00.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've thought about this a lot.</v>

1662
01:36:00.661 --> 01:36:03.960
<v Speaker 1>So there is evidence that Ashkenazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews,</v>

1663
01:36:03.961 --> 01:36:05.880
<v Speaker 1>so those are the Jews of European </v>
<v Speaker 1>heritage,</v>

1664
01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:09.570
<v Speaker 1>have iqs that are about 15 points higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the population average.</v>

1665
01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:10.433
<v Speaker 1>So that's a lot 15 points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the average difference </v>

1666
01:36:12.511 --> 01:36:15.690
<v Speaker 1>between the typical high school student </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the typical state college student.</v>

1667
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:18.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that means is,</v>

1668
01:36:18.841 --> 01:36:19.674
<v Speaker 1>so imagine there's two distributions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they overlap and that the Jewish </v>

1669
01:36:22.411 --> 01:36:23.560
<v Speaker 1>one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1670
01:36:24.210 --> 01:36:25.043
<v Speaker 1>is the mean is 1:15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whole distribution is shifted to </v>

1671
01:36:29.641 --> 01:36:32.130
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that means is if you go up into the</v>

1672
01:36:32.131 --> 01:36:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Higher Iq strata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:30,</v>

1673
01:36:34.381 --> 01:36:35.214
<v Speaker 1>1:45 way the hell up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Jewish people are overwhelmingly </v>

1674
01:36:38.611 --> 01:36:41.400
<v Speaker 1>overrepresented at the high end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ICU distribution.</v>

1675
01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:42.593
<v Speaker 1>Now the price they paid for that is some</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased propensity for neurological </v>

1676
01:36:45.811 --> 01:36:49.530
<v Speaker 1>diseases that seems to be associated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense with that heightened Iq.</v>

1677
01:36:49.890 --> 01:36:50.641
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1678
01:36:50.641 --> 01:36:53.300
<v Speaker 1>the science on this isn't settled but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

1679
01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:54.233
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonably solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all given the standards of such </v>

1680
01:36:59.071 --> 01:36:59.910
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1681
01:36:59.911 --> 01:37:00.744
<v Speaker 1>so Jews are going to be over represented</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the high end of cognitively complex </v>

1682
01:37:05.431 --> 01:37:07.470
<v Speaker 1>disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I would say,</v>

1683
01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:08.783
<v Speaker 1>and that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're way over represented among </v>

1684
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:14.760
<v Speaker 1>outstanding scientists and among Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prize winners and and so forth.</v>

1685
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people look and they think,</v>

1686
01:37:17.431 --> 01:37:18.264
<v Speaker 1>well why are there a disproportionate </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of Jewish people in positions of </v>

1687
01:37:21.691 --> 01:37:22.381
<v Speaker 1>authority?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

1688
01:37:22.381 --> 01:37:24.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be a conspiracy.</v>

1689
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:27.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be systemic in some sense.</v>

1690
01:37:27.151 --> 01:37:27.984
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1691
01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:32.280
<v Speaker 1>it can be simply accounted for by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively large ICU differential.</v>

1692
01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Now the next criticism would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1693
01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.650
<v Speaker 1>don't the Jews tend to lean left?</v>

1694
01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Well first you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1695
01:37:39.570 --> 01:37:40.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given what happened in Nazi Germany to </v>

1696
01:37:43.111 --> 01:37:45.690
<v Speaker 1>the degree that that was right wing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we discussed earlier,</v>

1697
01:37:45.691 --> 01:37:47.640
<v Speaker 1>that's the nationalism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnocentrism.</v>

1698
01:37:47.641 --> 01:37:50.610
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly surprising that they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1699
01:37:50.611 --> 01:37:54.300
<v Speaker 1>in this historical period of time tend </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move towards the left.</v>

1700
01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:58.650
<v Speaker 1>But more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq is associated with trait,</v>

1701
01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:02.340
<v Speaker 1>openness and trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Openness is a strong predictor predictor</v>

1702
01:38:02.341 --> 01:38:04.830
<v Speaker 1>of political liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1703
01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's the strongest predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political liberalism.</v>

1704
01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1705
01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:13.140
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I have to say about that.</v>

1706
01:38:13.141 --> 01:38:14.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing I would say is,</v>

1707
01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's a population of </v>

1708
01:38:18.461 --> 01:38:22.080
<v Speaker 1>sub population of people who are much </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than average,</v>

1709
01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:23.580
<v Speaker 1>not on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1710
01:38:23.670 --> 01:38:27.210
<v Speaker 1>On average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get that straight on average</v>

1711
01:38:27.211 --> 01:38:28.044
<v Speaker 1>is actually of great benefit to the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us because why do you want fewer </v>

1712
01:38:31.111 --> 01:38:31.980
<v Speaker 1>geniuses?</v>

1713
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Fewer people with Iq of 145 or 160.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's and you know,</v>

1714
01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:41.430
<v Speaker 1>and it's no conspiracy that puts people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are smarter,</v>

1715
01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:42.443
<v Speaker 1>higher up in competence hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I accused the best predictor of </v>

1716
01:38:45.241 --> 01:38:48.330
<v Speaker 1>movement up in a complex con competence </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

1717
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:51.270
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've addressed the Jewish question.</v>

1718
01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:52.253
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a confusion between </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity and and ICU as far as I'm </v>

1719
01:38:56.641 --> 01:38:57.474
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll probably get like painted six </v>

1720
01:38:59.701 --> 01:39:01.530
<v Speaker 1>different shades of black for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

1721
01:39:01.531 --> 01:39:03.750
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about a long time.</v>

1722
01:39:03.751 --> 01:39:06.330
<v Speaker 1>It's the best that I can manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1723
01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read this.</v>

1724
01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what huckleberry says,</v>

1725
01:39:11.761 --> 01:39:13.950
<v Speaker 1>should I start with past author three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I am 40,</v>

1726
01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:15.233
<v Speaker 1>I feel that I have so many unsolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues from my past that prevents me </v>

1727
01:39:17.731 --> 01:39:21.570
<v Speaker 1>from accomplishing my potential from </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishing my potential.</v>

1728
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Mostly fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1729
01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:24.073
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that you wrote that indicates </v>

1730
01:39:25.561 --> 01:39:29.220
<v Speaker 1>very clearly that you should do the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring first because you already know</v>

1731
01:39:29.221 --> 01:39:30.054
<v Speaker 1>that you have unpleasant incidences or </v>
<v Speaker 1>incidents in your past that are </v>

1732
01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:36.360
<v Speaker 1>impairing your function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1733
01:39:37.290 --> 01:39:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm gonna read.</v>

1734
01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read this.</v>

1735
01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you can see that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustration there.</v>

1736
01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:45.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hold it up so that I can </v>

1737
01:39:47.611 --> 01:39:48.444
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>

1738
01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:52.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a lag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if it's in focus.</v>

1739
01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.390
<v Speaker 1>So give me about 10 seconds.</v>

1740
01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:02.433
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1741
01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is chapter four rule for.</v>

1742
01:40:12.191 --> 01:40:16.540
<v Speaker 1>So the book has 12 rules in the book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>called 12 rules for life</v>

1743
01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:23.010
<v Speaker 1>and it's published by penguin random </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and it'll be out January 23rd.</v>

1744
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:27.450
<v Speaker 1>And so this is a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is chapter rule six.</v>

1745
01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:28.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1746
01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:37.610
<v Speaker 1>there's 12 rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pence,</v>

1747
01:40:37.611 --> 01:40:38.444
<v Speaker 1>the title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were taken from a subset of 42 </v>

1748
01:40:41.511 --> 01:40:42.344
<v Speaker 1>rules that I wrote for a quora article </v>
<v Speaker 1>called what are the most important </v>

1749
01:40:45.321 --> 01:40:47.390
<v Speaker 1>things that everyone should know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1750
01:40:47.391 --> 01:40:50.960
<v Speaker 1>A very popular cora</v>
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>

1751
01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:52.633
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the illustration was done by Ethan van </v>

1752
01:40:54.041 --> 01:40:54.874
<v Speaker 1>skiver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a comic book artist and a good </v>

1753
01:40:58.421 --> 01:41:00.280
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can look up his work if you want.</v>

1754
01:41:00.281 --> 01:41:02.900
<v Speaker 1>It's v a n,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s,</v>

1755
01:41:02.901 --> 01:41:03.734
<v Speaker 1>C I v e r Ethan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This chapter is about the motivation </v>

1756
01:41:08.531 --> 01:41:11.830
<v Speaker 1>behind the actions of people like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>call them by and killers.</v>

1757
01:41:11.831 --> 01:41:12.664
<v Speaker 1>And the illustration is of a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very criminally oriented individual </v>

1758
01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:21.190
<v Speaker 1>called named Carl Pans Ram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look him up,</v>

1759
01:41:21.191 --> 01:41:26.191
<v Speaker 1>p a n Zed r a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>m who was a very resentful,</v>

1760
01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.910
<v Speaker 1>vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent,</v>

1761
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:29.343
<v Speaker 1>destructive and intelligent person </v>
<v Speaker 1>because those things can all go </v>

1762
01:41:32.801 --> 01:41:33.634
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rule six is called set your house in </v>

1763
01:41:37.301 --> 01:41:40.930
<v Speaker 1>perfect order before you criticize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1764
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:45.600
<v Speaker 1>And the chapters all have little sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter.</v>

1765
01:41:45.601 --> 01:41:48.560
<v Speaker 1>So the title of this chapter is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious problem.</v>

1766
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:53.743
<v Speaker 1>It does not seem reasonable to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>the young man who shot 20 children and </v>

1767
01:41:57.681 --> 01:42:01.070
<v Speaker 1>six staff members at Sandy Hook </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elementary School in Newton,</v>

1768
01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut in 2012 as a religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1769
01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:06.973
<v Speaker 1>This is equally true for the Colorado </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater gunman and the columbine high </v>

1770
01:42:10.101 --> 01:42:10.934
<v Speaker 1>school killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these murderous individuals had a </v>

1771
01:42:13.311 --> 01:42:16.400
<v Speaker 1>problem with reality that existed at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious depth.</v>

1772
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:19.910
<v Speaker 1>As one of the members of the columbine </v>
<v Speaker 1>duo wrote,</v>

1773
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:24.770
<v Speaker 1>the human race isn't worth fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>only worth killing.</v>

1774
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:25.723
<v Speaker 1>Give the earth back to the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They deserve it infinitely more than we </v>

1775
01:42:29.241 --> 01:42:32.180
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing means anything anymore.</v>

1776
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:36.980
<v Speaker 1>People who viewed people who think such </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1777
01:42:36.981 --> 01:42:37.814
<v Speaker 1>view being itself is inequitable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>harsh to the point of corruption and </v>

1778
01:42:41.811 --> 01:42:44.360
<v Speaker 1>human being in particular as </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemptible.</v>

1779
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:45.703
<v Speaker 1>They appoint themselves supreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjudicators of reality and find it </v>

1780
01:42:49.551 --> 01:42:52.580
<v Speaker 1>wanting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the ultimate critics.</v>

1781
01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:57.650
<v Speaker 1>The deeply cynical writer continues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you recall your history,</v>

1782
01:42:57.651 --> 01:42:58.484
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis came up with a quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>final solution and quote to the Jewish </v>

1783
01:43:02.001 --> 01:43:03.950
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill them all.</v>

1784
01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in case you haven't figured it out,</v>

1785
01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I say kill mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one should survive.</v>

1786
01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:13.603
<v Speaker 1>For such individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of experiences insufficient </v>

1787
01:43:15.741 --> 01:43:17.990
<v Speaker 1>and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to hell with everything.</v>

1788
01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:22.150
<v Speaker 1>What is happening when someone comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking in this manner,</v>

1789
01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:26.590
<v Speaker 1>a great German play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foust a tragedy written by your hand.</v>

1790
01:43:26.591 --> 01:43:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Wolfgang von Gurta addresses that issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plays main character,</v>

1791
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:32.343
<v Speaker 1>a scholar named Heinrich Faust trades </v>
<v Speaker 1>his immortal soul to the devil </v>

1792
01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In return,</v>

1793
01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:43.111
<v Speaker 1>he receives whatever he desires while </v>
<v Speaker 1>still alive on earth and this play,</v>

1794
01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles is the eternal adversary </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>

1795
01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.513
<v Speaker 1>He has a central defining credo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the spirit who negates and rightly </v>

1796
01:43:55.431 --> 01:43:59.810
<v Speaker 1>so for all that comes to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves to perish wretchedly.</v>

1797
01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:03.030
<v Speaker 1>We're better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing would begin.</v>

1798
01:44:04.150 --> 01:44:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Does everything that you term sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction and evil represent.</v>

1799
01:44:11.190 --> 01:44:12.510
<v Speaker 1>That's my proper element.</v>

1800
01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The considered this hateful sentiment,</v>

1801
01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:17.823
<v Speaker 1>so important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so key to the central element of </v>

1802
01:44:21.061 --> 01:44:23.610
<v Speaker 1>vengeful human destructiveness that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>add.</v>

1803
01:44:23.611 --> 01:44:24.444
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles repeated a second time </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase somewhat differently in part two </v>

1804
01:44:28.201 --> 01:44:33.201
<v Speaker 1>of the play written many years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think often in the memphis to and</v>

1805
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:35.540
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they sell them,</v>

1806
01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:39.780
<v Speaker 1>act upon their thoughts as brutally as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mass murderers of school,</v>

1807
01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:40.793
<v Speaker 1>college and theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever we experienced injustice real </v>

1808
01:44:45.021 --> 01:44:45.854
<v Speaker 1>or imagined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever we encountered tragedy or fall </v>

1809
01:44:48.261 --> 01:44:49.094
<v Speaker 1>prey to the machinations of others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever we experienced the horror and </v>

1810
01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:55.370
<v Speaker 1>pain of our own apparently arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations,</v>

1811
01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:56.443
<v Speaker 1>the temptation to question being and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then to curse it rises Fowley from the </v>

1812
01:45:00.891 --> 01:45:01.724
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why must innocent people suffer so </v>

1813
01:45:04.371 --> 01:45:08.180
<v Speaker 1>terribly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of bloody horrible places this</v>

1814
01:45:08.181 --> 01:45:09.014
<v Speaker 1>anyways?</v>

1815
01:45:10.810 --> 01:45:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Life is in truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>

1816
01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is destined for pain and slated</v>
<v Speaker 1>for destruction.</v>

1817
01:45:17.050 --> 01:45:17.883
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes suffering is clearly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>result of personal faults such as </v>

1818
01:45:20.621 --> 01:45:23.560
<v Speaker 1>willful blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor decision making or malevolence.</v>

1819
01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:27.460
<v Speaker 1>In such cases when it appears to be self</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflicted,</v>

1820
01:45:27.730 --> 01:45:31.450
<v Speaker 1>it may even seem just people get what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they deserve.</v>

1821
01:45:31.451 --> 01:45:34.720
<v Speaker 1>You might contend that's cold comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1822
01:45:34.721 --> 01:45:38.440
<v Speaker 1>even when true sometimes if those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

1823
01:45:38.441 --> 01:45:39.274
<v Speaker 1>change their behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then their lives would unfold less </v>

1824
01:45:41.861 --> 01:45:44.680
<v Speaker 1>tragically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human control is limited.</v>

1825
01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Susceptibility to despair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>

1826
01:45:47.321 --> 01:45:52.150
<v Speaker 1>aging and death is universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the final analysis,</v>

1827
01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:55.240
<v Speaker 1>we do not appear to be the architects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own fragility.</v>

1828
01:45:56.410 --> 01:45:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Whose fault is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>

1829
01:46:00.210 --> 01:46:05.210
<v Speaker 1>People who are very will ill or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have a sick child,</v>

1830
01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:09.390
<v Speaker 1>will inevitably find themselves asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>this question whether they are religious</v>

1831
01:46:09.391 --> 01:46:10.224
<v Speaker 1>believers are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same is true of someone who finds </v>

1832
01:46:12.601 --> 01:46:13.434
<v Speaker 1>his shirt sleeve caught in the gears of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant bureaucracy who is suffering </v>

1833
01:46:17.251 --> 01:46:21.210
<v Speaker 1>through a tax audit or fighting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interminable lawsuit or divorce,</v>

1834
01:46:22.170 --> 01:46:23.003
<v Speaker 1>and it's not only the obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering who are tormented by the need </v>

1835
01:46:25.711 --> 01:46:29.700
<v Speaker 1>to blame someone or something for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerable state of their being</v>

1836
01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:35.200
<v Speaker 1>at the very height of his fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence and creative power.</v>

1837
01:46:35.201 --> 01:46:37.480
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the towering Leo.</v>

1838
01:46:37.481 --> 01:46:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Tolstoy began to question the value of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human existence.</v>

1839
01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:42.910
<v Speaker 1>He reasoned in this way.</v>

1840
01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.633
<v Speaker 1>My position was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I could find nothing in the </v>

1841
01:46:47.981 --> 01:46:50.550
<v Speaker 1>way of rational knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denial of life,</v>

1842
01:46:50.730 --> 01:46:55.050
<v Speaker 1>and in faith I could find nothing except</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did not have reason and this was even</v>

1843
01:46:55.051 --> 01:46:59.610
<v Speaker 1>more impossible than it denial of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to rational knowledge.</v>

1844
01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It followed that life is evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People know it.</v>

1845
01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:05.970
<v Speaker 1>They do not have to live yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have lived and they do live.</v>

1846
01:47:06.330 --> 01:47:07.163
<v Speaker 1>Just as I myself have lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I had known for a long time </v>

1847
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:15.560
<v Speaker 1>that life is meaningless and evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>tracy might told story,</v>

1848
01:47:15.591 --> 01:47:19.040
<v Speaker 1>could only identify for means of </v>
<v Speaker 1>escaping from such thoughts.</v>

1849
01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.460
<v Speaker 1>One was retreating into child like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance of the problem.</v>

1850
01:47:22.630 --> 01:47:23.463
<v Speaker 1>Another was pursuing mindless pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third was continuing to drag out a </v>

1851
01:47:28.431 --> 01:47:32.840
<v Speaker 1>life that is evil and meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing beforehand that nothing can come</v>

1852
01:47:32.841 --> 01:47:33.674
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He identified that particular form of </v>

1853
01:47:36.651 --> 01:47:37.484
<v Speaker 1>escape with weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people in this category know that </v>

1854
01:47:41.061 --> 01:47:44.180
<v Speaker 1>death is better than life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do not have the strength to act</v>

1855
01:47:44.181 --> 01:47:47.840
<v Speaker 1>rationally and quickly put it into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>delusion by killing themselves.</v>

1856
01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:50.753
<v Speaker 1>Only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fourth and final mode of escape </v>

1857
01:47:51.901 --> 01:47:54.900
<v Speaker 1>involved open quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and energy.</v>

1858
01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:56.093
<v Speaker 1>It consists of destroying life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once one has realized that life is evil </v>

1859
01:47:59.761 --> 01:48:01.440
<v Speaker 1>and meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close quote,</v>

1860
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:04.380
<v Speaker 1>tall story relentlessly followed his </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>

1861
01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:09.300
<v Speaker 1>only unusually strong and logically </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent.</v>

1862
01:48:09.301 --> 01:48:13.020
<v Speaker 1>People act in this manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having realized all the stupidity of the</v>

1863
01:48:13.021 --> 01:48:13.854
<v Speaker 1>joke that is being played on us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing that the blessings of the dead </v>

1864
01:48:16.321 --> 01:48:20.040
<v Speaker 1>are greater than those of the living and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is better not to exist.</v>

1865
01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.860
<v Speaker 1>They act and put it into this stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

1866
01:48:23.490 --> 01:48:26.220
<v Speaker 1>They use any means of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A rope around the neck,</v>

1867
01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:28.200
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a knife in the heart.</v>

1868
01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:33.680
<v Speaker 1>A train</v>
<v Speaker 1>toy story wasn't pessimistic enough.</v>

1869
01:48:34.230 --> 01:48:38.700
<v Speaker 1>The stupidity of the joke being played </v>
<v Speaker 1>in us does not merely motivate suicide.</v>

1870
01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Good motivates murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mass murder often followed by suicide.</v>

1871
01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a far more effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential protest by June of 2016.</v>

1872
01:48:49.921 --> 01:48:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable as it may seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there had been 1000.</v>

1873
01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:54.293
<v Speaker 1>Mass killings defined is far more people</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot into a single incident excluding </v>

1874
01:48:58.081 --> 01:48:58.914
<v Speaker 1>the shooter in the US and 1,260 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one such event on five of every </v>

1875
01:49:04.891 --> 01:49:07.050
<v Speaker 1>six days for more than three years.</v>

1876
01:49:08.690 --> 01:49:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand.</v>

1877
01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:16.430
<v Speaker 1>How can we still pretend that tall story</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood more than a century ago.</v>

1878
01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:17.983
<v Speaker 1>The ancient authors of the Biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of Cain and Abel understood as </v>

1879
01:49:20.421 --> 01:49:22.340
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than 20 centuries ago,</v>

1880
01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:24.253
<v Speaker 1>they described murder as the first act </v>
<v Speaker 1>of post identic history and not just </v>

1881
01:49:28.191 --> 01:49:31.790
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fratricidal murder and murder.</v>

1882
01:49:31.791 --> 01:49:32.624
<v Speaker 1>Not only if someone innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if someone ideal and good and </v>

1883
01:49:36.501 --> 01:49:39.680
<v Speaker 1>murdered unconsciously despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creator of the universe.</v>

1884
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Today's killers tell us the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their own words,</v>

1885
01:49:44.570 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>who would dare say that this is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worm at the core of the apple,</v>

1886
01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:49.593
<v Speaker 1>but we will not listen because the truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>cuts too close to the bone even for a </v>

1887
01:49:54.071 --> 01:49:54.904
<v Speaker 1>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as profound as that of the celebrated </v>

1888
01:49:56.501 --> 01:49:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Russian author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no way out.</v>

1889
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:00.213
<v Speaker 1>How can the rest of us manage when </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of tolstoy stature admits defeat </v>

1890
01:50:04.690 --> 01:50:05.523
<v Speaker 1>for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit his guns from himself and would </v>

1891
01:50:07.781 --> 01:50:11.680
<v Speaker 1>not walk with a rope in his hand in case</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hanged himself.</v>

1892
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.410
<v Speaker 1>How can a person who is awake avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage at the world?</v>

1893
01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:27.080
<v Speaker 1>The next sub chapters called vengeance </v>
<v Speaker 1>or transformation well,</v>

1894
01:50:27.081 --> 01:50:27.914
<v Speaker 1>and the rest of the trap chapter </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to answer the questions that I </v>

1895
01:50:31.131 --> 01:50:31.964
<v Speaker 1>posed in that beginning and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've managed it at least in some small </v>

1896
01:50:35.691 --> 01:50:36.524
<v Speaker 1>way anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a bit from one chapter of this </v>

1897
01:50:40.671 --> 01:50:42.230
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life,</v>

1898
01:50:42.231 --> 01:50:46.130
<v Speaker 1>an antidote to chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes out January 23rd.</v>

1899
01:50:46.610 --> 01:50:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It's available for preorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who might be interested</v>

1900
01:50:49.731 --> 01:50:54.731
<v Speaker 1>on Amazon.com and Amazon.ca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's quite heavily discounted at the</v>

1901
01:50:55.371 --> 01:50:56.204
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 50 percent off on the </v>

1902
01:50:57.351 --> 01:51:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Canadian site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 percent off on the American site.</v>

1903
01:51:00.750 --> 01:51:01.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll put a link in the </v>

1904
01:51:03.321 --> 01:51:04.790
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1905
01:51:05.690 --> 01:51:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I hope that the book is helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1906
01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:15.283
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1907
01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.153
<v Speaker 1>I put a lot of work into it and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's advanced my thinking quite a bit </v>

1908
01:51:20.150 --> 01:51:20.983
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1909
01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:23.553
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's readable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've a lot of people have looked at it </v>

1910
01:51:25.991 --> 01:51:26.824
<v Speaker 1>now and I've had good editors and so on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that I tried to make it as </v>

1911
01:51:29.891 --> 01:51:30.724
<v Speaker 1>accessible as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it deals with ideas that are </v>

1912
01:51:32.771 --> 01:51:34.970
<v Speaker 1>pretty sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1913
01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.473
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping I got the balance between </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity and sophistication and ease </v>

1914
01:51:42.371 --> 01:51:43.330
<v Speaker 1>of access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1915
01:51:43.331 --> 01:51:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly hope so.</v>

1916
01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.440
<v Speaker 1>And I hope it's kind of poetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1917
01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:48.303
<v Speaker 1>because I tried to make each sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>scan properly and have a rhythm and all </v>

1918
01:51:51.401 --> 01:51:52.840
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1919
01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:57.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife has made thanksgiving,</v>

1920
01:51:57.790 --> 01:52:01.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not Canadian thanksgiving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American thanksgiving,</v>

1921
01:52:01.151 --> 01:52:01.984
<v Speaker 1>but we celebrate both of them because my</v>
<v Speaker 1>son is American and we lived in the </v>

1922
01:52:05.621 --> 01:52:06.454
<v Speaker 1>states for quite a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to go and see my grandkids </v>

1923
01:52:09.611 --> 01:52:13.360
<v Speaker 1>and my son and my daughter and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people that are around me.</v>

1924
01:52:13.361 --> 01:52:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1925
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:21.160
<v Speaker 1>thanks for listening guys and for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>

1926
01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I hope you get your acts together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix up the world a</v>

1927
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:30.460
<v Speaker 1>till next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>

1928
01:52:30.461 --> 01:52:31.294
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
