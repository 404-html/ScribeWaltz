1
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.493
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the waking up podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Sam Harris.</v>

3
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well today back by popular demand,</v>

4
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.243
<v Speaker 2>I have Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan is a clinical psychologist and </v>

5
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 2>professor at the University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He formerly taught at Harvard University</v>

6
00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:41.521
<v Speaker 2>and he is published articles on drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse and alcoholism and aggression,</v>

7
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 2>but he has made a special focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny and a of late,</v>

8
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:48.194
<v Speaker 2>he has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been fighting a pitched battle </v>

9
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.114
<v Speaker 2>against political correctness up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada and he's attracted a lot of </v>

10
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 2>support and criticism on that front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said last time around,</v>

11
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.203
<v Speaker 2>he is far and away the most requested </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests I've ever had and we did a </v>

12
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:05.204
<v Speaker 2>podcast about four or so episodes back </v>
<v Speaker 2>entitled what is true podcast number 62 </v>

13
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.923
<v Speaker 2>and that to the disappointment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was a fairly brutal slog </v>

14
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 2>through differing conceptions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>epistemology.</v>

15
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 2>You've ever the phrase bogged down </v>
<v Speaker 2>applied to a podcast.</v>

16
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I it applied there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people enjoyed it,</v>

17
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 2>but most of you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.100
<v Speaker 2>But as I say in the conversation today </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Jordan,</v>

19
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I did a poll online and 30,000 of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>responded and 81% wanted us to try again</v>

20
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 2>because there was much more to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and as it turns out there was,</v>

21
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 2>we had a much better conversation this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time around.</v>

22
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 2>It was very collegial and if you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to say about it,</v>

23
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.373
<v Speaker 2>feel free to reach out to Jordan and me </v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter or make noise wherever you </v>

24
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I bring you Jordan Peterson.</v>

25
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 2>I am back here with Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>

26
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 2>thanks for coming back on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My pleasure.</v>

27
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's just take a moment to bring people</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to speed.</v>

28
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 2>While we can assume many of heard our </v>
<v Speaker 2>previous effort at this all won't have.</v>

29
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.430
<v Speaker 2>So we did a podcast a little over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month ago.</v>

30
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 2>It was podcasts 62 I believe on my list </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it went fairly haywire.</v>

31
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.703
<v Speaker 2>We intended to speak about many things </v>
<v Speaker 2>but got bogged down on the question of </v>

32
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 2>what it means to say that a proposition </v>
<v Speaker 2>is true.</v>

33
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 2>And I considered this actually a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting problem in philosophy,</v>

34
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:37.860
<v Speaker 2>but it seemed to me that we got stuck at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a point that wasn't very interesting and</v>

35
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:38.694
<v Speaker 2>many of our listeners felt the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the time I didn't let the </v>

36
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:43.544
<v Speaker 2>conversation proceed to other topics </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I felt that it would just be </v>

37
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.963
<v Speaker 2>pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew you wanted to talk about things </v>

38
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:48.974
<v Speaker 2>like the validity of religious faith and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he jungian archetypes and many other </v>

39
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.423
<v Speaker 2>controversial things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I felt if we couldn't agree on what </v>

40
00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 2>separates fact from fantasy,</v>

41
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 3>we would just be doomed to talk past one</v>
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

42
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.593
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still possible we are doomed to </v>

43
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 3>talk past one another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we ran a,</v>

44
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.583
<v Speaker 3>a twitter poll after our first podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and despite all the complaints I </v>

45
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 3>received about our conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>81% of people wanted us to make a second</v>

46
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:20.044
<v Speaker 3>attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 30,000 people answered that </v>

47
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.534
<v Speaker 3>pole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a considerable number of </v>

48
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided we should give our people what</v>

49
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.603
<v Speaker 3>most of them claim to want and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just see how it goes because I </v>

50
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 3>don't want us to fight the same battle </v>
<v Speaker 3>all over again.</v>

51
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:35.284
<v Speaker 3>I think listeners who are curious about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how that last conversation went can </v>

52
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:43.801
<v Speaker 3>listen to it and I'm sure the topic of </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth and falsity will come up.</v>

53
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:44.734
<v Speaker 3>But if it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the best thing to do is kind of </v>

54
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 3>flag it on the fly and move on.</v>

55
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.183
<v Speaker 3>And I think this will be an exercise in </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing just how much can profitably be </v>

56
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:55.174
<v Speaker 3>said across differing epistemologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would that warning about the various </v>

57
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 3>road hazards?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

58
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:03.110
<v Speaker 3>I think we should just see where we wind</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and I,</v>

59
00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:03.944
<v Speaker 3>I think it could be someplace </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting because you and I appeared </v>

60
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 3>share many of the same concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we both find the question of how</v>

61
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 3>to live in this world to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>important one.</v>

62
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.653
<v Speaker 3>And I think we're equally concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>about some of the very well subscribed </v>

63
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 3>answers to that question that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously wrong.</v>

64
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.560
<v Speaker 3>And so I think we should just do our </v>
<v Speaker 3>best to,</v>

65
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 3>to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And see where it goes.</v>

66
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope so too.</v>

67
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 3>That seems right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

68
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.520
<v Speaker 3>you place a tremendous emphasis on moral</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessity of the spoken truth and that's</v>

69
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 3>certainly something that I'm in accord </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

70
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.203
<v Speaker 3>And you're also concerned with ethics in</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the alleviation of </v>

71
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:45.724
<v Speaker 3>suffering from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I've been able to understand </v>

72
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 3>from what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I've read of your writings and</v>

73
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.640
<v Speaker 3>your also very much concerned with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between scientific fact and</v>

74
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:57.514
<v Speaker 3>value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we do share this intense concern </v>

75
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:01.744
<v Speaker 3>about the same domain and I think for </v>
<v Speaker 3>many of the same reasons and I think </v>

76
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.943
<v Speaker 3>that you're an outstanding exponent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your particular position and that makes </v>

77
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 3>you an excellent person to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things with.</v>

78
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.673
<v Speaker 3>I was actually going to start with a bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an apology because I listened to our </v>

79
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 3>talk twice trying to figure out where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>went off the rails.</v>

80
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 3>It actually went okay for the first hour</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we got bogged down in the truth</v>

81
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:29.590
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think I made a couple of strategic</v>

82
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 3>errors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I hope not to repeat.</v>

83
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.650
<v Speaker 3>The first one was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

84
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.583
<v Speaker 3>I started the conversation by more or </v>
<v Speaker 3>less accusing you of being </v>

85
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 3>insufficiently Darwinian and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>designed to be,</v>

86
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.413
<v Speaker 3>I thought playful and provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I listened to our conversation </v>

87
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:47.914
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that that wasn't very wise </v>

88
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:49.924
<v Speaker 3>strategic move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one mistake I made in the </v>

89
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:52.804
<v Speaker 3>second mistake I made was that I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>just read a number of things that you </v>

90
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.483
<v Speaker 3>had written and I told you a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you thought instead of letting you </v>

91
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 3>say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was doing that partly,</v>

92
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.653
<v Speaker 3>well partly because there is an argument</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be had here and I suppose partly </v>

93
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:10.904
<v Speaker 3>because I was nervous but also partly to</v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrate that I had actually </v>

94
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.133
<v Speaker 3>familiarized myself with what you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>read and I want to do indicate or what </v>

95
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 3>you had written and I wanted to indicate</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you that I was taking it seriously.</v>

96
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.293
<v Speaker 3>But I'm going to try to not be the least</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit provocative in that manner during </v>

97
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:28.034
<v Speaker 3>this conversation because I really do </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that we have something important </v>

98
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:31.604
<v Speaker 3>to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's why so many </v>

99
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 3>people actually want to listen to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>

100
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully we get bogged down just in the</v>

101
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 3>interest of completing that bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>housekeeping.</v>

102
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the first was an error at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

103
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:45.974
<v Speaker 3>I mean to say that I'm being </v>
<v Speaker 3>insufficiently Darwinian is provocative </v>

104
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 3>and I don't take it in the least bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally.</v>

105
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 3>We just didn't find a path through that </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular thesis that we could Converge</v>

106
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.513
<v Speaker 3>On.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as the second point telling me </v>

107
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 3>what I think in advance of our actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting that topic.</v>

108
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:04.574
<v Speaker 3>I think that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the almost certainly a mistake </v>

109
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 3>with me or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or anyone.</v>

110
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 3>And that's fine that you did that </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmortem and I,</v>

111
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:12.630
<v Speaker 3>and I agree with that bit.</v>

112
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.053
<v Speaker 3>So let's just start with a clean slate </v>
<v Speaker 3>here and I think kind of a natural </v>

113
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:20.510
<v Speaker 3>starting point would be to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

114
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I've heard a few of the things you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>said on this topic,</v>

115
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:27.560
<v Speaker 3>but I'll just let you invent yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 3>new however it strikes you.</v>

116
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.070
<v Speaker 3>What is the relationship in your view </v>
<v Speaker 3>between science and religion?</v>

117
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.963
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that religious systems are </v>

118
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:38.354
<v Speaker 3>descriptions of how people ought to act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the way that I think </v>

119
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 3>that those rows in a cause I </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary manner.</v>

120
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.480
<v Speaker 3>And so imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine the,</v>

121
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.750
<v Speaker 3>the dominance hierarchy structure of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzee troop or a wolf pack.</v>

122
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll,</v>

123
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:00.044
<v Speaker 3>we'll use the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wolf idea first and then switch if </v>

124
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:03.970
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to the chimpanzee idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

125
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.323
<v Speaker 3>So as a consequence of the behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 3>actions and interactions among social </v>

126
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:13.660
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could think of something as a,</v>

127
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.283
<v Speaker 3>something that might be described as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>procedural covenant arising and that </v>

128
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 3>would be the animals knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of the dominance hierarchy,</v>

129
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:25.364
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of ill named.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we'll use that for now so that </v>

130
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a hierarchy of,</v>

131
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.203
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of rank and every animal in the social </v>

132
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 3>community understands that hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rank.</v>

133
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 3>That's essentially the culture of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

134
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.983
<v Speaker 3>of the troop or the or the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's an implicit recognition of </v>

135
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:50.570
<v Speaker 3>the value of each individual within </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

136
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 3>that troop or pack such that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

137
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 3>two wolves</v>

138
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.173
<v Speaker 4>square off in a dominance dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course they puff themselves up to </v>

139
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 4>make to make themselves look large and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they growl at each other and they engage</v>

140
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:06.414
<v Speaker 4>in throws,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just threatening displays and generally </v>

141
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:13.941
<v Speaker 4>speaking the wolf that ha that has the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lowest threshold for anxiety.</v>

142
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:19.491
<v Speaker 4>Activation will capitulate first </v>
<v Speaker 4>generally without much more than the the</v>

143
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.970
<v Speaker 4>pose of a fight and rollover and expose </v>
<v Speaker 4>his neck and then the dominant wolf will</v>

144
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.650
<v Speaker 4>not deign to tear it out basically and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could think of the wolves acting out</v>

145
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.523
<v Speaker 4>what you would describe propositionally </v>
<v Speaker 4>as respect for each individual's value </v>

146
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 4>and then in the chimp troops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>friends to walls.</v>

147
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:47.634
<v Speaker 4>Research has indicated for example that </v>
<v Speaker 4>if the dominant Turkey is only based on </v>

148
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:53.394
<v Speaker 4>brute force and that chimp out the top </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's generally male is there because </v>

149
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 4>he's a barbarian dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

150
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.020
<v Speaker 4>Then he's very likely to be taken out by</v>
<v Speaker 4>two male chimps,</v>

151
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.663
<v Speaker 4>three quarters his power who are much </v>
<v Speaker 4>better at social bonding and who made a </v>

152
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:14.544
<v Speaker 4>very tight compact between one another </v>
<v Speaker 4>and and so that the chimp troop that's </v>

153
00:10:19.561 --> 00:10:22.380
<v Speaker 4>based on a tyranny is unstable.</v>

154
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 4>What de Waal indicated was that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chimp tropes that tend to be more stable</v>

155
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:27.654
<v Speaker 4>are run by dominant males who actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>are very good at social bonding and </v>

156
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:32.184
<v Speaker 4>reciprocity and who pay a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to the females and infants in </v>

157
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:36.624
<v Speaker 4>the troop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the dominants isn't power so much as </v>

158
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.500
<v Speaker 4>as it might as you might think of as </v>
<v Speaker 4>good politics.</v>

159
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.710
<v Speaker 4>And so if there's an emergent ethic </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

160
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.813
<v Speaker 4>and I truly believe it's emergent ethic </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's very similar to what piaget </v>

161
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.420
<v Speaker 4>described as emerging among children </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they play games,</v>

162
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 4>that not only specifies the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the social contract,</v>

163
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.033
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also is structured as if the </v>

164
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 4>individuals within the social contract </v>
<v Speaker 4>have some implicit value.</v>

165
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.993
<v Speaker 4>So imagine that as human beings diverged</v>
<v Speaker 4>away from their chimpanzee progenitors </v>

166
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:16.261
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

167
00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:18.450
<v Speaker 4>the common ancestor we have with </v>
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzees,</v>

168
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.140
<v Speaker 4>we already started to act out this </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethic.</v>

169
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.490
<v Speaker 4>It was coded in our procedures to speak </v>
<v Speaker 4>technically because we have a procedural</v>

170
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:29.850
<v Speaker 4>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then as we develop cortically,</v>

171
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 4>we watch each other and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and ourselves very,</v>

172
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:36.480
<v Speaker 4>very intently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And once we develop language,</v>

173
00:11:36.481 --> 00:11:37.314
<v Speaker 4>we were able to start encapsulating that</v>
<v Speaker 4>procedural ethic first in stories and </v>

174
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.243
<v Speaker 4>that story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those stories were partly about what a </v>

175
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 4>very well structured procedural ethic </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be and how it might go wrong,</v>

176
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.883
<v Speaker 4>but also about how an individual within </v>
<v Speaker 4>that procedural ethic should be treated </v>

177
00:11:57.521 --> 00:12:01.840
<v Speaker 4>and should act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the storytelling,</v>

178
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.453
<v Speaker 4>which was the mapping of that procedure </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the birthplace of the image and </v>

179
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:12.970
<v Speaker 4>story basis of religious ideation as far</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I can tell.</v>

180
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.433
<v Speaker 4>So that's the basic thesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like Piaget's notion that children </v>

181
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 4>when they first come together to learn a</v>
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>

182
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 4>if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're young enough,</v>

183
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 4>they can play the game when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

184
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 4>but if you take them out of the game and</v>
<v Speaker 4>ask them individually about the rules,</v>

185
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.140
<v Speaker 4>they give widely disparate accounts so </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got the procedure in place,</v>

186
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 4>but they haven't got the episodic </v>
<v Speaker 4>representation.</v>

187
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 4>Technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only in,</v>

188
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.823
<v Speaker 4>it's only once they become more </v>
<v Speaker 4>linguistically sophisticated that they </v>

189
00:12:45.491 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 4>can actually come up with a coherent </v>
<v Speaker 4>representation of the rules.</v>

190
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 4>And then it's only later when they start</v>
<v Speaker 4>to construe themselves,</v>

191
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.790
<v Speaker 4>not merely as followers of the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also as originators of the rules.</v>

192
00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 4>And that's akin to the recognition of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

193
00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 4>constructive individuality in </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship to the state.</v>

194
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 4>And so I see these things as very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

195
00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:12.421
<v Speaker 4>very deeply biologically predicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's the concept of an archetype come</v>

196
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:14.800
<v Speaker 4>into this picture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

197
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:15.820
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine this,</v>

198
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tell me what you think about this.</v>

199
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.500
<v Speaker 4>So you know how if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a,</v>

200
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.670
<v Speaker 4>can I tell you just a two minutes story?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

201
00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:25.504
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one time I was at the hockey rink </v>

202
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:29.530
<v Speaker 4>with my son and he was playing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was young,</v>

203
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:30.364
<v Speaker 4>he was about 12,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were playing his championship </v>

204
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:34.420
<v Speaker 4>game in this little league that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>had.</v>

205
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.770
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

206
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:36.603
<v Speaker 4>my son was pretty good hockey player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was a kid on the team who was </v>

207
00:13:38.691 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 4>better than him who was kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>star,</v>

208
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.213
<v Speaker 4>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

209
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.410
<v Speaker 4>he was a diva,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

210
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Speaker 4>and even though he would score goals and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that,</v>

211
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:48.634
<v Speaker 4>he wouldn't pass and he wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't facilitating the development </v>

212
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 4>of any of the other team members.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so anyways,</v>

213
00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:57.670
<v Speaker 4>we watched this game and it was very </v>
<v Speaker 4>close.</v>

214
00:13:57.671 --> 00:14:01.360
<v Speaker 4>It was a very exciting game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the final few minutes of the last</v>

215
00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:02.194
<v Speaker 4>period,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other team scored and my son's team </v>

216
00:14:06.071 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 4>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stars team lost.</v>

217
00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:12.070
<v Speaker 4>And so then the kids went off the ice </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>

218
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.083
<v Speaker 4>and the diva kid smashed his hockey </v>
<v Speaker 4>stick on the cement and started to </v>

219
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:19.600
<v Speaker 4>complain bitterly about how unfair the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game is.</v>

220
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:20.434
<v Speaker 4>And then his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his idiot father came running up to him </v>

221
00:14:22.751 --> 00:14:26.080
<v Speaker 4>and told him how unfair the raffing had </v>
<v Speaker 4>be and how,</v>

222
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 4>and how it was stolen from them and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic all of that was.</v>

223
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 4>And I thought it was one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>highness displays of poor parenting that</v>

224
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:35.230
<v Speaker 4>I'd ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

225
00:14:35.231 --> 00:14:36.510
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

226
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.413
<v Speaker 4>there's a moral of that story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So his kid was very good at playing </v>

227
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:41.614
<v Speaker 4>hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he wasn't very good at being a good </v>

228
00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 4>player.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

229
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you always tell your kids,</v>

230
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.850
<v Speaker 4>doesn't matter whether you win or lose </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

231
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.863
<v Speaker 4>it matters how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course you don't know what that </v>

232
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:56.300
<v Speaker 4>means and neither does the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's often a mystery to the kid what</v>

233
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:58.550
<v Speaker 4>that means because obviously you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to win.</v>

234
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.230
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but imagine it this way.</v>

235
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:06.190
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the goal of human life isn't to win</v>

236
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.273
<v Speaker 4>the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The goal of human life in some sense is </v>

237
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:11.924
<v Speaker 4>to win the set of all possible games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in order to win the set of all </v>

238
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:17.144
<v Speaker 4>possible games,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't need to win any particular </v>

239
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

240
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 4>You have to play in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ensures that you will be invited to play</v>

241
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:30.191
<v Speaker 4>more and more games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you tell your children to be</v>

242
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:35.000
<v Speaker 4>good sports to play properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you mean is play to win,</v>

243
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:35.834
<v Speaker 4>but play to win in such a way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people on your team are happy to play </v>

244
00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:40.574
<v Speaker 4>with you and people on the other teams </v>
<v Speaker 4>are happy to play with you and so that </v>

245
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:46.580
<v Speaker 4>you keep getting invite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting invited to games.</v>

246
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.710
<v Speaker 4>Now if you think of each game as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

247
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>small hierarchy of value or dominance,</v>

248
00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.080
<v Speaker 4>then obviously the appropriate thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>to move up the hierarchy.</v>

249
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 4>But that's what animals do is they move </v>
<v Speaker 4>up to in their specific hierarchy.</v>

250
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.760
<v Speaker 4>But because human beings are capable of </v>
<v Speaker 4>abstraction,</v>

251
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.043
<v Speaker 4>we've been able to conceptualize the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy as such rather than any </v>

252
00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:14.384
<v Speaker 4>specific one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then also to characterize a mode of </v>

253
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:18.164
<v Speaker 4>being that is most likely to move you up</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchy no matter what that </v>

254
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy is.</v>

255
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.300
<v Speaker 4>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the archetype of the hero.</v>

256
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.180
<v Speaker 4>The hero is the person who's most likely</v>
<v Speaker 4>to move up any given dominance hierarchy</v>

257
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 4>at any time in any place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the hero is also,</v>

258
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 4>and then so that the nature of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>archetipal hero first was acted out.</v>

259
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:42.980
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was laid out in procedure and then it</v>

260
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:46.100
<v Speaker 4>was acted out and then it was described.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's also,</v>

261
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 4>it's multidimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not only he who plays to be invited</v>

262
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:51.704
<v Speaker 4>to play again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also he who goes out into the great </v>

263
00:16:56.181 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 4>unknown to face chaos and the dangers </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

264
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:01.334
<v Speaker 4>but to gather what's valuable as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence and to bring it back to the </v>

265
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the,</v>

266
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 4>that's the basis of the Dragon Myth </v>
<v Speaker 4>archetype,</v>

267
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:12.980
<v Speaker 4>which is of course plays out in art and </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature throat.</v>

268
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:16.130
<v Speaker 4>While throughout recorded history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the oldest story we have,</v>

269
00:17:16.131 --> 00:17:19.100
<v Speaker 4>which is the Enuma elish from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mesopotamia,</v>

270
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.963
<v Speaker 4>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a story about Marduk who's the culture </v>

271
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:23.234
<v Speaker 4>hero and also the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the highest God in the Mesopotamian </v>

272
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Pantheon.</v>

273
00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:28.243
<v Speaker 4>He confronts the Dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cuts her into pieces and makes the </v>

274
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>

275
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 4>one of his names was nam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the name unfortunately,</v>

276
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.224
<v Speaker 4>but it meant he who creates ingenious </v>
<v Speaker 4>things as a consequence of the combat </v>

277
00:17:43.641 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 4>was tie a Matt who's the dragon of </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos.</v>

278
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.664
<v Speaker 4>So he cuts off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he counts up to the unknown into pieces </v>

279
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.650
<v Speaker 4>and makes ingenious things out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a perfect description of,</v>

280
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.323
<v Speaker 4>of the human archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the fact that we are hyper </v>

281
00:17:58.751 --> 00:18:03.390
<v Speaker 4>exploratory and that we use our capacity</v>
<v Speaker 4>to explore the dangerous unknown,</v>

282
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:04.224
<v Speaker 4>to gather the treasure that lies there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then to distribute it to the </v>

283
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:08.770
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

284
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.123
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of the evolution of that </v>

285
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:12.331
<v Speaker 4>archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam,</v>

286
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 4>think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

287
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could tell me what you,</v>

288
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.140
<v Speaker 4>what you think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we know that roughly speaking,</v>

289
00:18:21.141 --> 00:18:25.790
<v Speaker 4>that human females mate across and up </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchies,</v>

290
00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.960
<v Speaker 4>whereas chimpanzee females are </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonselective majors,</v>

291
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.093
<v Speaker 4>the dominant chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>males will chase away the subordinate </v>

292
00:18:33.251 --> 00:18:35.560
<v Speaker 4>chimps from that female's in estrus.</v>

293
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.520
<v Speaker 4>And so they're more likely to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>offspring.</v>

294
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.400
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The females will mate with anyone,</v>

295
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:42.523
<v Speaker 4>whereas human females are very selective</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they have hidden ovulation and they </v>

296
00:18:45.441 --> 00:18:47.830
<v Speaker 4>mate across and up dominance </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies.</v>

297
00:18:47.831 --> 00:18:52.831
<v Speaker 4>So imagine the woman once the man who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>most capable of rising up the set of all</v>

298
00:18:54.101 --> 00:18:54.934
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is she outsources that </v>

299
00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:03.520
<v Speaker 4>problem to the computational capacity of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the male hierarchy.</v>

300
00:19:03.521 --> 00:19:06.400
<v Speaker 4>And she let's the man fight it out among</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

301
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.150
<v Speaker 4>compete and cooperate to determine who </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best man is.</v>

302
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.390
<v Speaker 4>He's provided with the majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting opportunities.</v>

303
00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.573
<v Speaker 4>And so that's how the extended religious</v>
<v Speaker 4>phenotype manifests itself in </v>

304
00:19:20.711 --> 00:19:24.280
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was something that you and Richard</v>

305
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.960
<v Speaker 4>Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're wondering about the last time that</v>

306
00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:28.240
<v Speaker 4>you talked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's not psychopathy,</v>

307
00:19:28.241 --> 00:19:30.480
<v Speaker 4>which was in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

308
00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:33.030
<v Speaker 4>you were thinking about the charismatic </v>
<v Speaker 4>liar,</v>

309
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 4>but really what's being selected for is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

310
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.243
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the consciousness because that's the </v>

311
00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:39.864
<v Speaker 4>right way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's best able to rise across the set </v>

312
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:47.760
<v Speaker 4>of all dominance hierarchies and females</v>
<v Speaker 4>are selecting very hard for that,</v>

313
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:48.594
<v Speaker 4>which is at least in part why we've had </v>
<v Speaker 4>this tremendously expanded cortical </v>

314
00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:52.724
<v Speaker 4>capacity.</v>

315
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.233
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me see if I can wade into this </v>

316
00:19:55.621 --> 00:20:00.621
<v Speaker 2>picture and find places of agreement and</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreement for clarity sake.</v>

317
00:20:02.381 --> 00:20:03.214
<v Speaker 2>I think it's useful to distinguish </v>
<v Speaker 2>between two different intellectual </v>

318
00:20:06.531 --> 00:20:11.531
<v Speaker 2>projects here with respect to values and</v>
<v Speaker 2>morality and the question of just how to</v>

319
00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:13.584
<v Speaker 2>live in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is aren't at least nominal </v>

320
00:20:14.911 --> 00:20:17.310
<v Speaker 2>starting point first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the,</v>

321
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.230
<v Speaker 2>the description of how we got here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

322
00:20:20.231 --> 00:20:21.064
<v Speaker 2>And this captures all of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and much of what you just </v>

323
00:20:26.231 --> 00:20:27.820
<v Speaker 2>began to say about</v>

324
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.440
<v Speaker 2>selection pressures with respect to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies and you know,</v>

325
00:20:32.441 --> 00:20:37.441
<v Speaker 2>the kind of heroic male mate female apes</v>
<v Speaker 2>will find attractive and all that.</v>

326
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:39.923
<v Speaker 2>Then you can add religion to that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps an extended phenotype or the </v>

327
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.023
<v Speaker 2>possibility of group selection pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are more religious tribes have a way </v>

328
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 2>of organizing themselves in a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>durable way than,</v>

329
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:54.130
<v Speaker 2>than less religious tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And therefore we have,</v>

330
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:55.383
<v Speaker 2>there's something Ian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our evolutionary history that has </v>

331
00:20:57.281 --> 00:20:58.114
<v Speaker 2>selected for religiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say an overarching story that unites </v>

332
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:06.691
<v Speaker 2>non-kin in a way that is more energizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>than some other story.</v>

333
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.403
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really have much of a dog in </v>

334
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 2>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some of that as plausible.</v>

335
00:21:14.771 --> 00:21:15.604
<v Speaker 2>Some of it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think group selection though you </v>

336
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 2>haven't mentioned it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is working to some degree in the,</v>

337
00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:24.100
<v Speaker 2>in the background of this way of talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about religion in evolutionary terms.</v>

338
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.933
<v Speaker 2>And at the moment I happen to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that group selection is </v>

339
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.590
<v Speaker 2>implausible and based on some bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>analogies.</v>

340
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.060
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not,</v>

341
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.103
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't strike me as important for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this conversation or for really for </v>

342
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:38.974
<v Speaker 2>anything that I've written about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between morality and </v>

343
00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:42.394
<v Speaker 2>science or facts and values because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>view this problem of describing how we </v>

344
00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:46.924
<v Speaker 2>got here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it that apes like ourselves have </v>

345
00:21:49.991 --> 00:21:54.340
<v Speaker 2>the moral attitudes and concerns that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>

346
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.473
<v Speaker 2>That's a distinct project which was </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite separate from the question of </v>

347
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:00.843
<v Speaker 2>deciding how we should live now given </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we are and given the opportunities </v>

348
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:05.464
<v Speaker 2>available to us and given the way in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which are continually flying the perch </v>

349
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:11.403
<v Speaker 2>that has been prepared for us by </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution with our technology and with </v>

350
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:20.131
<v Speaker 2>our institutions and with our new moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>norms that have absolutely nothing to do</v>

351
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 2>with ancient selection pressures.</v>

352
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.450
<v Speaker 2>And this is even true in a religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

353
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:28.840
<v Speaker 2>So you have in many religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps even most,</v>

354
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:29.913
<v Speaker 2>you have certain ideals that could never</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been selected for because they are </v>

355
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.560
<v Speaker 2>the antithesis of anything that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer an adaptive advantage.</v>

356
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Celibacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

357
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.860
<v Speaker 2>anyone who was committed to celibacy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our ancient past by definition,</v>

358
00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:45.694
<v Speaker 2>didn't breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could say that they might've helped </v>

359
00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:49.114
<v Speaker 2>their kin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still celibacy is not an ideal that </v>

360
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.133
<v Speaker 2>you can make much Darwinian sense of and</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet you can have the most committed </v>

361
00:22:56.861 --> 00:23:01.480
<v Speaker 2>adherence of any faith tending toward a </v>
<v Speaker 2>life of celibacy.</v>

362
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:02.463
<v Speaker 2>At the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promiscuity is taboo in most religious </v>

363
00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:06.184
<v Speaker 2>traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not taking a position that </v>

364
00:23:07.331 --> 00:23:08.164
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing or a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that this is where </v>

365
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:14.140
<v Speaker 2>evolution is no longer relevant to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion of how people should live and</v>

366
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:18.910
<v Speaker 2>as I think I said in in a blog response </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some of the things you said after our</v>

367
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:19.744
<v Speaker 2>first podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want it to just take a jeans I </v>

368
00:23:22.511 --> 00:23:27.310
<v Speaker 2>view of how human beings should live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially how men should live.</v>

369
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:28.263
<v Speaker 2>Well then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would conclude that given current </v>

370
00:23:30.941 --> 00:23:31.774
<v Speaker 2>opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every man should be passionately </v>

371
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:35.614
<v Speaker 2>committed to doing more or less nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>but donate his sperm to a sperm bank </v>

372
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>because then he would could father </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly tens of thousands of</v>

373
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.070
<v Speaker 3>offspring for whom he would have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>financial or emotional responsibility.</v>

374
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.223
<v Speaker 3>From a Darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that should be every guy's deepest </v>

375
00:23:55.111 --> 00:23:55.944
<v Speaker 3>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should just get up in the morning </v>

376
00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.880
<v Speaker 3>with just a commitment to that project </v>
<v Speaker 3>unlike any other,</v>

377
00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:01.803
<v Speaker 3>they could be discovered in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have motives and norms and </v>

378
00:24:06.281 --> 00:24:11.281
<v Speaker 3>concerns that don't narrowly track a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gene level analysis of what we should be</v>

379
00:24:12.441 --> 00:24:14.480
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just put that out there.</v>

380
00:24:14.481 --> 00:24:15.314
<v Speaker 3>I think the more interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation is not to talk about how </v>

381
00:24:19.701 --> 00:24:22.550
<v Speaker 3>apes like ourselves could have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

382
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.503
<v Speaker 3>but to talk about what we should do </v>
<v Speaker 3>given the way the world is now and what </v>

383
00:24:27.191 --> 00:24:29.710
<v Speaker 3>we seem to know about it through </v>
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>

384
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Speaker 5>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>

385
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.480
<v Speaker 5>I just want to make a couple of comments</v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

386
00:24:34.481 --> 00:24:35.314
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hypotheses that I'm proposing is </v>

387
00:24:37.801 --> 00:24:39.850
<v Speaker 5>certainly not dependent on groups </v>
<v Speaker 5>election,</v>

388
00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.160
<v Speaker 5>so we can leave that one aside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As far as I'm,</v>

389
00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:44.283
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the jury's out on the ultimate </v>

390
00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:47.434
<v Speaker 5>validity of the idea of group selection,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not interested in going down </v>

391
00:24:50.231 --> 00:24:52.850
<v Speaker 5>that rabbit hole because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter to me one way or another.</v>

392
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:55.860
<v Speaker 5>It really how that's resolved with </v>
<v Speaker 5>regards to</v>

393
00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:01.350
<v Speaker 3>the potential validity of evolutionarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>derived motivations to the present day,</v>

394
00:25:01.511 --> 00:25:03.340
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's more complicated.</v>

395
00:25:03.341 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

396
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.870
<v Speaker 5>the first thing I would say is that</v>

397
00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:11.230
<v Speaker 3>I believe there has been a central march</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward with this set of very productive</v>

398
00:25:11.231 --> 00:25:14.550
<v Speaker 3>ideas as human beings have evolved their</v>
<v Speaker 3>morality,</v>

399
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.740
<v Speaker 3>but those have spun off </v>
<v Speaker 3>counterproductive,</v>

400
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.540
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary dead ends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everything doesn't,</v>

401
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.280
<v Speaker 3>it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

402
00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:23.114
<v Speaker 3>that celibacy is one of those with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to the donation to sperm bank </v>

403
00:25:27.941 --> 00:25:28.774
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's essentially the mosquito </v>

404
00:25:30.601 --> 00:25:32.590
<v Speaker 3>away of propagation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

405
00:25:32.591 --> 00:25:34.910
<v Speaker 3>And that's it's our versus k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the,</v>

406
00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.250
<v Speaker 3>is that the correct terminology?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember it correctly.</v>

407
00:25:38.251 --> 00:25:41.280
<v Speaker 3>But there's two fundamentally different </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategies,</v>

408
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.600
<v Speaker 3>extreme strategies for propagating </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in the world.</v>

409
00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:46.930
<v Speaker 3>And one is to disseminate</v>

410
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.530
<v Speaker 5>yourself as widely as possible</v>

411
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.050
<v Speaker 3>and let the offspring live or die as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they may,</v>

412
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 3>which would be the sperm bank approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the other one,</v>

413
00:25:56.181 --> 00:26:00.680
<v Speaker 3>which is high investment in children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is maybe take it to its extreme in</v>

414
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:01.514
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're tilt to them a lot more </v>

415
00:26:03.241 --> 00:26:04.074
<v Speaker 3>towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you can't really imagine a human </v>

416
00:26:06.961 --> 00:26:07.794
<v Speaker 3>being being motivated to take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mosquito approach because that's really </v>

417
00:26:10.531 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 3>not built into us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

418
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.630
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't to say that he sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>morality,</v>

419
00:26:15.631 --> 00:26:16.464
<v Speaker 3>that's part and parcel of our being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which seems to 10 relatively strongly </v>

420
00:26:19.981 --> 00:26:24.270
<v Speaker 3>towards monogamy for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as marriage is a human universal,</v>

421
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.570
<v Speaker 3>although there are variations of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

422
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.753
<v Speaker 3>We're still very much tilted towards the</v>
<v Speaker 3>high investment in single offspring </v>

423
00:26:32.051 --> 00:26:34.290
<v Speaker 3>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let me just clarify one point I,</v>

424
00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:35.124
<v Speaker 3>I certainly am not saying that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>see the thumbprint of evolution in more </v>

425
00:26:40.101 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 3>or less everything we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you obviously can and as you point out,</v>

426
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 2>are sexual morality and our commitment </v>
<v Speaker 2>to monogamy,</v>

427
00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:50.350
<v Speaker 2>all of that is amenable to being </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpreted in evolutionary terms.</v>

428
00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.670
<v Speaker 2>No doubt those stories are valid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting to understand.</v>

429
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:59.090
<v Speaker 2>My point is is that we are in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process of repudiating and struggling to</v>

430
00:26:59.781 --> 00:27:00.614
<v Speaker 2>outgrow most of what evolution has </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared us to want and care about and </v>

431
00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:08.510
<v Speaker 2>fear tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>xenophobia,</v>

432
00:27:08.511 --> 00:27:09.800
<v Speaker 2>and the list is long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we want,</v>

433
00:27:09.801 --> 00:27:13.840
<v Speaker 2>we want to get out of our tribal </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence program and all the rest.</v>

434
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.113
<v Speaker 4>Dress that because you see most of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary psychologists that I've </v>

435
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:20.004
<v Speaker 4>encountered have what I consider the </v>
<v Speaker 4>misbegotten notion that our primary </v>

436
00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.550
<v Speaker 4>period of evolutionary determination was</v>
<v Speaker 4>on me,</v>

437
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.830
<v Speaker 4>African Veldt and my viewpoint I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>say spans broader time spans than that.</v>

438
00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.173
<v Speaker 4>So I'm starting from the presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the most permanent things are the </v>

439
00:27:42.461 --> 00:27:45.160
<v Speaker 4>most real which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a reasonable,</v>

440
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.213
<v Speaker 4>a reasonable starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a reason for saying that because </v>

441
00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:49.834
<v Speaker 4>what I've enabled to understand by </v>
<v Speaker 4>delving deeply into the grammatical </v>

442
00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:58.180
<v Speaker 4>structure underneath mythology is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

443
00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.133
<v Speaker 4>the religious landscape actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>describes that which is most permanent </v>

444
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.430
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] what shape human </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary history.</v>

445
00:28:06.431 --> 00:28:07.264
<v Speaker 4>And I mean way back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean 350 million years back before </v>

446
00:28:10.391 --> 00:28:11.950
<v Speaker 4>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before flowers,</v>

447
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.213
<v Speaker 4>back when we shared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we shared a common ancestor with </v>

448
00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:17.664
<v Speaker 4>crustaceans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the most permanent </v>

449
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.293
<v Speaker 4>features of the biological landscape is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the existence of the dominance </v>

450
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy.</v>

451
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.573
<v Speaker 4>And that's roughly portrayed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious mythology as culture or </v>

452
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 4>explored territory or the known.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

453
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:35.203
<v Speaker 4>it's usually given me the character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a logical representation of the great </v>

454
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:39.384
<v Speaker 4>father.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a positive one and a </v>

455
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:41.364
<v Speaker 4>negative one as the dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 4>can support you in your development or </v>

456
00:28:45.031 --> 00:28:45.864
<v Speaker 4>crushed you completely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the dominance hierarchy is one major </v>

457
00:28:48.651 --> 00:28:52.090
<v Speaker 4>selection mechanism and it's known </v>
<v Speaker 4>territory there.</v>

458
00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:54.200
<v Speaker 4>There's another major selection </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanism,</v>

459
00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:55.034
<v Speaker 4>which is roughly speaking mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's that which exists outside of </v>

460
00:28:59.691 --> 00:29:00.524
<v Speaker 4>explored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's generally being kept </v>

461
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.193
<v Speaker 4>conceptualized as feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think the reason for that is </v>

462
00:29:07.251 --> 00:29:09.890
<v Speaker 4>because the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the unknown,</v>

463
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.400
<v Speaker 4>cognitively speaking or territorial </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking,</v>

464
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.453
<v Speaker 4>that gives rise to new forms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also more importantly that </v>

465
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.673
<v Speaker 4>female human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the feminine plays a very vicious </v>

466
00:29:22.831 --> 00:29:25.210
<v Speaker 4>role in the selection process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

467
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.123
<v Speaker 4>you may know and probably do that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have twice as many female ancestors as </v>

468
00:29:30.611 --> 00:29:31.640
<v Speaker 4>male ancestors.</v>

469
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.473
<v Speaker 4>So as far as human beings are concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the feminine is a bottleneck through </v>

470
00:29:36.961 --> 00:29:39.590
<v Speaker 4>which genes must pass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>

471
00:29:39.591 --> 00:29:42.670
<v Speaker 4>And it's a very narrow and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and choosy marble next.</v>

472
00:29:42.671 --> 00:29:45.720
<v Speaker 4>So it has a positive element and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative element.</v>

473
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:47.063
<v Speaker 4>So roughly it's the same thing Sam </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's represented in the Dow is dnd </v>

474
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.603
<v Speaker 4>Yang Symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that Yin Yang symbol basically </v>

475
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:55.823
<v Speaker 4>is predicated on the idea that being is </v>
<v Speaker 4>partly the known or the interpretive </v>

476
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:03.100
<v Speaker 4>structure that's brought to bear on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

477
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:06.040
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the White Paisley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a serpent to actually,</v>

478
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.550
<v Speaker 4>and the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the Black Paisley or a serpent,</v>

479
00:30:09.551 --> 00:30:13.360
<v Speaker 4>and the two are interchangeable and out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them arises meaning.</v>

480
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.633
<v Speaker 4>So the idea behind the Taoist symbol is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you should have one foot in what </v>

481
00:30:17.581 --> 00:30:21.170
<v Speaker 4>you know and one foot in you in what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know.</v>

482
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.580
<v Speaker 4>And that's the place where information </v>
<v Speaker 4>flow is maximized.</v>

483
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.733
<v Speaker 4>And that's the same thing as occupying </v>
<v Speaker 4>the position of the hero who confronts </v>

484
00:30:28.921 --> 00:30:31.050
<v Speaker 4>the unknown and generates new </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

485
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:32.523
<v Speaker 4>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those evolutionary realities remain </v>

486
00:30:35.491 --> 00:30:40.120
<v Speaker 4>absolutely unchanged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that every place you go,</v>

487
00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.700
<v Speaker 4>there's something you know and an </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretive framework that you bring to</v>

488
00:30:43.701 --> 00:30:44.534
<v Speaker 4>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a cultural element and </v>

489
00:30:45.591 --> 00:30:46.424
<v Speaker 4>everywhere you go or are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something that transcends that </v>

490
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.930
<v Speaker 4>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to deal with.</v>

491
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.940
<v Speaker 4>And everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're there.</v>

492
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.863
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the three basic archetypical </v>

493
00:30:58.571 --> 00:30:59.404
<v Speaker 4>characters of mythology or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual positive and negative </v>

494
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.960
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>positive and negative and nature,</v>

495
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.333
<v Speaker 4>positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We haven't outgrown that in the least w </v>

496
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.500
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly the same problem it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>always been.</v>

497
00:31:12.501 --> 00:31:13.334
<v Speaker 4>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly the same set of problems </v>

498
00:31:15.931 --> 00:31:16.764
<v Speaker 4>that always will be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's partly why these archetypal </v>

499
00:31:18.901 --> 00:31:19.734
<v Speaker 4>stories can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot be transcended and they cannot </v>

500
00:31:24.471 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

501
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.651
<v Speaker 4>ignore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ignored.</v>

502
00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 4>They pop up off of their own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

503
00:31:29.561 --> 00:31:31.270
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One question.</v>

504
00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.460
<v Speaker 4>Pardon?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How</v>

505
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:36.560
<v Speaker 2>is any of that religious though I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how,</v>

506
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking of the individual versus the </v>

507
00:31:40.641 --> 00:31:45.200
<v Speaker 2>cosmos gives us a kind of narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

508
00:31:45.201 --> 00:31:46.034
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your protagonist and you have </v>

509
00:31:47.451 --> 00:31:52.400
<v Speaker 2>all of the things that can happen to him</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not and all of the things that he can</v>

510
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:53.263
<v Speaker 2>want or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very easy to conceive of any </v>

511
00:31:57.351 --> 00:31:58.184
<v Speaker 2>human life or the life of a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization in terms of stories like </v>

512
00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:02.764
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how does this bring religion into </v>

513
00:32:04.541 --> 00:32:05.374
<v Speaker 2>the picture?</v>

514
00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.670
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I'm okay.</v>

515
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:08.003
<v Speaker 4>Approach that from two perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first perspective I presume is one </v>

516
00:32:12.141 --> 00:32:17.141
<v Speaker 4>that you might find interesting given </v>
<v Speaker 4>your your interest in spirituality.</v>

517
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.720
<v Speaker 4>So it's certainly capable for people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience deeply a sense of meaning.</v>

518
00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.950
<v Speaker 4>Don't chick sent a highly talked about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as flow,</v>

519
00:32:27.951 --> 00:32:30.380
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a rather trivial way of</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with it,</v>

520
00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:32.990
<v Speaker 4>but at least it's one that people can </v>
<v Speaker 4>directly understand.</v>

521
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.453
<v Speaker 4>But I would say you can understand when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing something meaningful </v>

522
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:38.563
<v Speaker 4>because you're deeply engaged it and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>also have a sense in some sense of </v>

523
00:32:41.861 --> 00:32:44.320
<v Speaker 4>standing outside of time cause you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

524
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.253
<v Speaker 4>There's times flow and it also feels </v>
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile and that the sacrifices that </v>

525
00:32:50.061 --> 00:32:53.000
<v Speaker 4>you have made to enable yourself to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

526
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:53.834
<v Speaker 4>we're justified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I would say because the ultimate </v>

527
00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:02.410
<v Speaker 4>domains of reality are in fact chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 4>order or known and unknown,</v>

528
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.510
<v Speaker 4>that when you straddle those two </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly and maximize information flow,</v>

529
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.930
<v Speaker 4>you feel a deep sense of intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning.</v>

530
00:33:10.931 --> 00:33:11.764
<v Speaker 4>And that's the output of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of your consciousness telling </v>

531
00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:16.694
<v Speaker 4>you that you're in the right place at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right time with regards to </v>

532
00:33:19.861 --> 00:33:24.030
<v Speaker 4>furthering your capacity to thrive and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and move forward.</v>

533
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.153
<v Speaker 2>The question you're a Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you grant that there are </v>

534
00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.003
<v Speaker 2>pathological experiences of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that is actually based on a </v>

535
00:33:34.591 --> 00:33:37.590
<v Speaker 2>misconception or or divorced from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

536
00:33:37.591 --> 00:33:38.424
<v Speaker 2>which can be no less intoxicating to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's finding something </v>

537
00:33:41.521 --> 00:33:42.270
<v Speaker 2>meaningful.</v>

538
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.380
<v Speaker 4>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a great question.</v>

539
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:45.663
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really disturbed me when I was first </v>

540
00:33:48.101 --> 00:33:52.620
<v Speaker 4>working out these ideas was exactly that</v>
<v Speaker 4>question because like I've read an awful</v>

541
00:33:52.621 --> 00:33:55.230
<v Speaker 4>lot about extraordinarily pathological </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

542
00:33:55.231 --> 00:33:56.064
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>serial killers and people who were </v>

543
00:33:57.361 --> 00:34:02.220
<v Speaker 4>malevolent right to their core.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's exactly the question I asked.</v>

544
00:34:02.221 --> 00:34:04.440
<v Speaker 4>Because you know with serial killers for</v>
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>

545
00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:09.370
<v Speaker 4>especially the sexual Predator types,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they seem to have to live on the edge of</v>

546
00:34:09.371 --> 00:34:12.460
<v Speaker 4>their pathology in order to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be rewarded by it.</v>

547
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:13.923
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to keep extending their </v>

548
00:34:15.881 --> 00:34:19.060
<v Speaker 4>pathology into the unknown to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting that rush.</v>

549
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:20.463
<v Speaker 4>And then of course there's the situation</v>
<v Speaker 4>with schizophrenia where the underlying </v>

550
00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:27.730
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms that produce the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning actually go astray.</v>

551
00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.700
<v Speaker 4>That's especially the case say with </v>
<v Speaker 4>paranoid schizophrenia.</v>

552
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:31.953
<v Speaker 4>But you see that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's partly why I think I developed a </v>

553
00:34:35.721 --> 00:34:36.554
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint that's similar to yours with </v>
<v Speaker 4>regards to the necessity of stating the </v>

554
00:34:41.371 --> 00:34:46.371
<v Speaker 4>truth or at least attempting very hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>not to say what you believe to be false.</v>

555
00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.330
<v Speaker 4>Because as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least under most circumstances,</v>

556
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.360
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That meaning orienting system,</v>

557
00:34:55.361 --> 00:34:58.330
<v Speaker 4>which is actually the extended orienting</v>
<v Speaker 4>reflex,</v>

558
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.720
<v Speaker 4>technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>neuropsychologically speaking,</v>

559
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.183
<v Speaker 4>I think that you pathologize the </v>
<v Speaker 4>underlying mechanisms if you speak </v>

560
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.680
<v Speaker 4>deceitfully because you build,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you build pathological micro machines,</v>

561
00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:15.960
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the architecture of your physiology</v>

562
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:20.540
<v Speaker 4>and then your underlying the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems,</v>

563
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.850
<v Speaker 4>much more fundamental say limbic systems</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the sake of,</v>

564
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.810
<v Speaker 4>for lack of a better term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they start producing pathological output</v>

565
00:35:28.811 --> 00:35:31.360
<v Speaker 4>and take you down extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous roads.</v>

566
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:36.510
<v Speaker 4>So if you're going to let your intrinsic</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of meaning serve as a guide life,</v>

567
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.003
<v Speaker 4>then you have to ally yourself with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>commitment to speak the truth or at </v>

568
00:35:44.181 --> 00:35:45.014
<v Speaker 4>least not to engage in deceit because </v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise you will do exactly what you </v>

569
00:35:48.731 --> 00:35:52.490
<v Speaker 4>said and pathologize yourself and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

570
00:35:52.491 --> 00:35:54.650
<v Speaker 4>and then all hell will break loose in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>

571
00:35:54.651 --> 00:35:55.790
<v Speaker 4>And in the life of others,</v>

572
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.970
<v Speaker 2>rigorously honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still mistaken,</v>

573
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:00.391
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

574
00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:01.224
<v Speaker 2>you could have a belief system or b </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised in a culture that has a belief </v>

575
00:36:05.181 --> 00:36:10.181
<v Speaker 2>system that is completely illogical or </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of touch with reality.</v>

576
00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.213
<v Speaker 2>You could not know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dishonesty doesn't have to be local </v>

577
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:18.640
<v Speaker 2>to your own brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just be confused.</v>

578
00:36:18.641 --> 00:36:19.474
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

579
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.513
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is partly why I was more </v>

580
00:36:22.381 --> 00:36:23.214
<v Speaker 4>insistent than I should have been in our</v>
<v Speaker 4>last discussion about a particular idea </v>

581
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:28.020
<v Speaker 4>about truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

582
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.153
<v Speaker 4>because I would say there's the truth </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's associated with being in </v>

583
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:34.434
<v Speaker 4>possession of a set of accurate facts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a more enacted truth or </v>

584
00:36:39.561 --> 00:36:40.394
<v Speaker 4>embodied truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the consistent attempt to go </v>

585
00:36:42.921 --> 00:36:46.270
<v Speaker 4>beyond what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that would be the,</v>

586
00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.070
<v Speaker 4>the necessity of living in humility or </v>
<v Speaker 4>in ignorance.</v>

587
00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.393
<v Speaker 4>And so that what you're doing when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're discussing with someone or when </v>

588
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:55.734
<v Speaker 4>you're acting in the world is not so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much attempting to prove that what you </v>

589
00:36:59.071 --> 00:37:02.500
<v Speaker 4>already know is completely right and </v>
<v Speaker 4>correct,</v>

590
00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:03.843
<v Speaker 4>but attempting to understand very </v>
<v Speaker 4>carefully where you're in error and </v>

591
00:37:07.831 --> 00:37:10.110
<v Speaker 4>learning everything you can to correct </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

592
00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:15.810
<v Speaker 4>And you see that ideas also deeply </v>
<v Speaker 4>rooted in in religious mythology.</v>

593
00:37:17.151 --> 00:37:20.120
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the the finger of Horus,</v>

594
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:24.400
<v Speaker 4>who's the Egyptian Aye and who's also a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fall camp.</v>

595
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:25.603
<v Speaker 4>Horace is an I and a fall can because </v>
<v Speaker 4>falcons can see better than any other </v>

596
00:37:28.761 --> 00:37:30.320
<v Speaker 4>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including human beings,</v>

597
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:31.243
<v Speaker 4>even though we can see very well and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's an eye because the eye with the </v>

598
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:35.724
<v Speaker 4>open irs signifies paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Horace who's a messianic figure in </v>

599
00:37:41.281 --> 00:37:42.114
<v Speaker 4>some sense for the ancient Egyptians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had his eyes open to the corruption of </v>

600
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:49.190
<v Speaker 4>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was symbolized by a day.</v>

601
00:37:49.191 --> 00:37:53.030
<v Speaker 4>And he named Seth set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who later became Satan in,</v>

602
00:37:53.031 --> 00:37:55.360
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the developmental pathway of this set</v>

603
00:37:55.361 --> 00:37:56.194
<v Speaker 4>of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Horace who lived in truth so to </v>

604
00:37:59.151 --> 00:37:59.984
<v Speaker 4>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was able to keep his eyes open and </v>

605
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:06.170
<v Speaker 4>understand the corrupt nature of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>society and his uncle,</v>

606
00:38:06.171 --> 00:38:09.170
<v Speaker 4>his uncle was seth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to put that right again,</v>

607
00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:10.413
<v Speaker 4>and so there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the idea that lived truth can </v>

608
00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:18.741
<v Speaker 4>rescue you from pathological untruth and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that might be more or factual.</v>

609
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.180
<v Speaker 4>If you're a scientist operating in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>truthful manner,</v>

610
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.410
<v Speaker 4>you update Archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Archaic,</v>

611
00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.920
<v Speaker 4>empirical representations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a,</v>

612
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.530
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>More culture hero type of person,</v>

613
00:38:32.531 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 4>then what you're doing is updating </v>
<v Speaker 4>archaic and blind</v>

614
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 2>representations of the proper moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway forward,</v>

615
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:42.880
<v Speaker 2>which can never be encapsulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely in a set of rules.</v>

616
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's partly why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's partly why,</v>

617
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in in,</v>

618
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:49.303
<v Speaker 2>in the line of Christian thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moses couldn't reach the promised land </v>

619
00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:55.390
<v Speaker 2>because his morality was bounded by </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

620
00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:56.523
<v Speaker 2>And it's not possible to reach the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper motive being by only acting out </v>

621
00:39:01.061 --> 00:39:05.680
<v Speaker 2>rules because rules the same rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't applicable in every situation.</v>

622
00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could tell you the Christian story in </v>

623
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 2>a way that you might find interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and about 10 minutes if,</v>

624
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:14.223
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you would like me to do that and </v>

625
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.773
<v Speaker 2>let's hold off on Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get there because I know </v>

626
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.323
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system of thinking you find most </v>

627
00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:24.730
<v Speaker 2>interesting in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would like to talk about that.</v>

628
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:25.683
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My issue is that it seems to me that </v>

629
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.940
<v Speaker 2>this kind of language game of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

630
00:39:31.941 --> 00:39:32.774
<v Speaker 2>talking about ancient stories and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way in which they seem to cash out some </v>

631
00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:38.884
<v Speaker 2>of the pre-scientific intuitions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral norms of any group of people as </v>

632
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:48.460
<v Speaker 2>though there's a validity to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture when you talk that way that I,</v>

633
00:39:48.461 --> 00:39:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I just see that that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconstrained by anything.</v>

634
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.260
<v Speaker 2>I think you can do that with anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with any system of beliefs.</v>

635
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:57.094
<v Speaker 2>You can find the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which from my point of view are living </v>

636
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:00.814
<v Speaker 2>in some form of radical error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that virtually </v>

637
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.190
<v Speaker 2>everything they think is true almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly isn't.</v>

638
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:07.623
<v Speaker 2>And the way they're treating one another</v>
<v Speaker 2>is terrible on the basis of those </v>

639
00:40:11.531 --> 00:40:14.770
<v Speaker 2>misconceptions and they're never going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get anywhere worth going.</v>

640
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a modern example of that is something</v>

641
00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:21.820
<v Speaker 2>like isis or the Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some ancient examples or you</v>

642
00:40:21.821 --> 00:40:22.654
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>older examples that are in some cases </v>

643
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:28.210
<v Speaker 2>even easier to understand because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no affinity for them.</v>

644
00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:30.520
<v Speaker 2>So do you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dobo people,</v>

645
00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.220
<v Speaker 2>the anthropologist Ruth Benedict wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>about them?</v>

646
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about them for a few pages in my</v>

647
00:40:35.951 --> 00:40:37.000
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moral landscape.</v>

648
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:37.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write about them in your book </v>

649
00:40:38.651 --> 00:40:39.790
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

650
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 2>So for listeners who didn't read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book or can't remember,</v>

651
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.823
<v Speaker 2>I mean the dove to get my vote for </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the most tragically confused </v>

652
00:40:48.161 --> 00:40:48.994
<v Speaker 2>people who have ever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is just kind of a hot house </v>

653
00:40:51.281 --> 00:40:52.114
<v Speaker 2>version of radical confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you wouldn't believe it would be </v>

654
00:40:54.941 --> 00:40:55.774
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the fact that some </v>

655
00:40:57.101 --> 00:40:58.450
<v Speaker 2>anthropologists wrote about it.</v>

656
00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.793
<v Speaker 2>But so this was a culture that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely obsessed with malicious </v>

657
00:41:04.151 --> 00:41:04.984
<v Speaker 2>sorcery and their primary interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every person's primary interest was to </v>

658
00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:08.614
<v Speaker 2>cast spells on other members of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe in an attempt to sicken or kill </v>

659
00:41:13.751 --> 00:41:14.584
<v Speaker 2>them in the hopes of magically stealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>their possessions and especially their </v>

660
00:41:18.341 --> 00:41:20.800
<v Speaker 2>crops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a continuous,</v>

661
00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 2>magical war of all against all in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

662
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.053
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they believed that magic had to be </v>

663
00:41:27.371 --> 00:41:28.204
<v Speaker 2>consciously applied to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They literally thought that gravity had </v>

664
00:41:31.241 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 2>to be supplemented by magic so that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't cast the right spells,</v>

665
00:41:34.341 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 2>your vegetables would just rise out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground and disappear.</v>

666
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.633
<v Speaker 2>And they thought every interaction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort and every outcome for people </v>

667
00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:44.714
<v Speaker 2>with zero sum so that if one man </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeeded in growing more vegetables </v>

668
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:49.690
<v Speaker 2>than his neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his success,</v>

669
00:41:49.691 --> 00:41:54.691
<v Speaker 2>his surplus of vegetables must have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>stolen from one of his neighbors through</v>

670
00:41:55.121 --> 00:41:55.954
<v Speaker 2>sorcery.</v>

671
00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Even the farmer who got lucky in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

672
00:41:58.301 --> 00:42:02.330
<v Speaker 2>w with a surplus would have believed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he succeeded for this reason,</v>

673
00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 2>that he actually magically stole his </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbor's crop.</v>

674
00:42:04.581 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 2>So to have a good harvest was a crime by</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's estimation.</v>

675
00:42:08.721 --> 00:42:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Even the person who it was a lucky </v>
<v Speaker 2>harvester.</v>

676
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that you could play </v>
<v Speaker 2>this same game with the dope boo.</v>

677
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.313
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could talk about archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could talk about whatever stories </v>

678
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:24.600
<v Speaker 2>ancient or otherwise that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>using to justify this,</v>

679
00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:25.643
<v Speaker 2>this view of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could find some evolutionary way of </v>

680
00:42:29.031 --> 00:42:29.864
<v Speaker 2>kind of threading the needle of how what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were doing was a response to the </v>

681
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 2>the ancient imperative of dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>

682
00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.333
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could give some sympathetic </v>

683
00:42:37.241 --> 00:42:42.241
<v Speaker 2>construal of the whole enterprise in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of myth and archetype and meaning.</v>

684
00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:44.873
<v Speaker 2>But clearly this was like a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange basin of attraction that you'd </v>

685
00:42:49.361 --> 00:42:53.800
<v Speaker 2>be very lucky never to have found as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe or as a culture.</v>

686
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.690
<v Speaker 2>And we're very lucky not to be stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some similar place there.</v>

687
00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.540
<v Speaker 2>There's another detail here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is especially horrible because the</v>

688
00:43:01.541 --> 00:43:06.541
<v Speaker 2>dove who felt that magic became more </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful the closer you were to somebody</v>

689
00:43:06.911 --> 00:43:09.900
<v Speaker 2>so that the people who are closest to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in life,</v>

690
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:11.143
<v Speaker 2>their spouses or their children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the people who are most likely to </v>

691
00:43:14.031 --> 00:43:16.480
<v Speaker 2>destroy them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would there be magical powers?</v>

692
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.730
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's actually true,</v>

693
00:43:17.731 --> 00:43:18.564
<v Speaker 5>Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

694
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:20.721
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>

695
00:43:20.721 --> 00:43:21.131
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

696
00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:24.030
<v Speaker 2>you could connect it to some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>story that makes sense.</v>

697
00:43:24.031 --> 00:43:26.730
<v Speaker 2>So you could go to Greek mythology and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Shakespeare and,</v>

698
00:43:26.731 --> 00:43:27.564
<v Speaker 2>and spin a yarn about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But clearly this underlying belief in </v>

699
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:35.810
<v Speaker 2>magic was one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost certainly not true,</v>

700
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.673
<v Speaker 2>but to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was creating a truly toxic moral </v>

701
00:43:39.981 --> 00:43:42.240
<v Speaker 2>environment for these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

702
00:43:42.241 --> 00:43:43.074
<v Speaker 2>I just put that out there as an example </v>
<v Speaker 2>of something that one would never want </v>

703
00:43:45.941 --> 00:43:46.774
<v Speaker 2>to spend a lot of time trying to justify</v>
<v Speaker 2>this worldview by reference to stories </v>

704
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:54.440
<v Speaker 2>ancient or otherwise.</v>

705
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:55.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

706
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.393
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's actually a technical </v>
<v Speaker 5>solution to the problem that you're </v>

707
00:43:58.821 --> 00:44:00.420
<v Speaker 5>posing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

708
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.433
<v Speaker 5>part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem is how do you know if what </v>

709
00:44:04.601 --> 00:44:09.110
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at is a genuine thing or </v>
<v Speaker 5>an artifact of your imagination.</v>

710
00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.910
<v Speaker 5>And you know that Paul Meehl and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and his,</v>

711
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.173
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

712
00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.173
<v Speaker 5>has colleague crunk back basically </v>
<v Speaker 5>addressed that back in the 1950s with a </v>

713
00:44:19.211 --> 00:44:20.044
<v Speaker 5>very solid piece of methodological work </v>
<v Speaker 5>that every psychologist either does or </v>

714
00:44:25.271 --> 00:44:26.104
<v Speaker 5>should know about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were the inventors of the multi </v>

715
00:44:27.741 --> 00:44:31.350
<v Speaker 5>multitrack multi-method construct </v>
<v Speaker 5>validation process,</v>

716
00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 5>which is a</v>

717
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.160
<v Speaker 4>pretty awful jumble of words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But basically it means something like in</v>

718
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 4>order to specify whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 4>something exists.</v>

719
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:45.351
<v Speaker 4>You have use multiple methods to detect </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and that their reports should co-vary</v>

720
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.540
<v Speaker 4>positively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so of course,</v>

721
00:44:48.541 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 4>we do exactly that with our five senses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

722
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:55.020
<v Speaker 4>just because you can see something </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean it's there.</v>

723
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 4>But if you can see it and hear it well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a little bit more certain.</v>

724
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:05.030
<v Speaker 4>When I wrote my book maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was very acutely aware of that.</v>

725
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:06.804
<v Speaker 4>And it's certainly a criticism that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>been leveled against people like Carl </v>

726
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.940
<v Speaker 4>Young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly,</v>

727
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:12.963
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tragically enough by the postmodernists </v>

728
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:15.743
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who don't believe in any sort of </v>

729
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:21.180
<v Speaker 4>overarching narrative and who have their</v>
<v Speaker 4>own form of Dogan like pathology,</v>

730
00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>distributed well widely among them.</v>

731
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:25.643
<v Speaker 4>So what I did was refused to take a </v>
<v Speaker 4>presupposition as acceptable unless I </v>

732
00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:37.020
<v Speaker 4>could find its manifestation at at least</v>
<v Speaker 4>four levels of evidence simultaneously.</v>

733
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.240
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

734
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.133
<v Speaker 4>in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I start out with a neuropsychological </v>

735
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:47.631
<v Speaker 4>account on account of the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuropsychological processes that enable</v>

736
00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:52.260
<v Speaker 4>us to make sense out of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>primarily relying on the work done early</v>

737
00:45:52.261 --> 00:45:54.690
<v Speaker 4>work done by the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuropsychologists,</v>

738
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.170
<v Speaker 4>Luria and soak aloft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Vinod Cordova who did a lot of early</v>

739
00:45:58.171 --> 00:46:00.600
<v Speaker 4>work on the orienting reflects in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hippocampus.</v>

740
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:01.853
<v Speaker 4>That was then sort of combined with </v>
<v Speaker 4>modern cybernetic theory by Jeffrey </v>

741
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:07.260
<v Speaker 4>Gray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was hands Isaac student.</v>

742
00:46:07.261 --> 00:46:12.000
<v Speaker 4>And Jeffrey Gray's work has had </v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendous impact over the last,</v>

743
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:15.420
<v Speaker 4>especially over the last 10 years in in </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology in general.</v>

744
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.940
<v Speaker 4>He wrote his book in 1982 but it was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

745
00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 4>very difficult book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it had,</v>

746
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.670
<v Speaker 4>it must have had between 1500 and 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 4>references.</v>

747
00:46:23.671 --> 00:46:24.504
<v Speaker 4>And Jeffrey Gray was exactly the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>person who would have read every single </v>

748
00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:28.524
<v Speaker 4>one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he outlined on cybernetic </v>

749
00:46:31.171 --> 00:46:32.004
<v Speaker 4>information processing model of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuropsychological function that </v>

750
00:46:35.311 --> 00:46:40.311
<v Speaker 4>actually lays extraordinarily nicely on </v>
<v Speaker 4>top of the architectural world that I,</v>

751
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:42.570
<v Speaker 4>that I've been working on outlining.</v>

752
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:43.403
<v Speaker 4>And I also wanted to ensure that it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>in keeping with the kind of </v>

753
00:46:46.801 --> 00:46:51.690
<v Speaker 4>observational animal studies that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Jane Goodall and Frans de Waal do.</v>

754
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:53.243
<v Speaker 4>Ethology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to make sure that it was in </v>

755
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:55.434
<v Speaker 4>keeping with the ecological data as well</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the broader literature on </v>

756
00:47:00.301 --> 00:47:01.134
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary psychology and biology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when I say that there's these </v>

757
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:08.760
<v Speaker 4>patterns that exist that you can extract</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of out of mythology,</v>

758
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.983
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that knowing full well that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can find concordance for the </v>

759
00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:14.844
<v Speaker 4>processes described by those archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories in at least four different </v>

760
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:20.010
<v Speaker 4>scientific disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>simile,</v>

761
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 4>tanium and according to chronback and </v>
<v Speaker 4>meals methodology.</v>

762
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:29.140
<v Speaker 4>That's the most effective possible way </v>
<v Speaker 4>of validating a construct when,</v>

763
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.333
<v Speaker 4>when it might be susceptible that to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of contamination by imagination </v>

764
00:47:34.791 --> 00:47:35.990
<v Speaker 4>that you're referring to.</v>

765
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to make of that claim </v>
<v Speaker 2>generically,</v>

766
00:47:39.091 --> 00:47:39.924
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should talk about your view </v>

767
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:45.990
<v Speaker 2>of Christianity at some point soon to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see if we can talk about specifics,</v>

768
00:47:45.991 --> 00:47:49.070
<v Speaker 2>but I just want to take a generic </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting point,</v>

769
00:47:49.071 --> 00:47:51.770
<v Speaker 2>which for me is more accessible and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think more illuminating.</v>

770
00:47:51.771 --> 00:47:52.604
<v Speaker 2>It certainly describes the divide </v>
<v Speaker 2>between science and religion that </v>

771
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:58.003
<v Speaker 2>resonates with me and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 2>connects nicely to the way you were </v>

772
00:48:00.551 --> 00:48:04.820
<v Speaker 2>describing kind of our primal </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstance of being an individual or a</v>

773
00:48:04.821 --> 00:48:05.654
<v Speaker 2>tribe standing in the face of mute and </v>
<v Speaker 2>often hostile nature and trying to </v>

774
00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:14.210
<v Speaker 2>figure out what's going on and how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live within it.</v>

775
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I think that really is the primal </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstance.</v>

776
00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.560
<v Speaker 2>This is why I think of religion as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

777
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.573
<v Speaker 2>as a kind of failed science as a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>first attempt to tell a story about </v>

778
00:48:24.221 --> 00:48:24.940
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

779
00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:29.940
<v Speaker 2>That gives us some power over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a bad attempt because we didn't</v>

780
00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:31.003
<v Speaker 2>develop any kind of methodology at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point to differentiate fact from </v>

781
00:48:34.791 --> 00:48:36.360
<v Speaker 2>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take the case.</v>

782
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Every parent will be familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing helplessly over your sick child</v>

783
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.670
<v Speaker 2>wondering what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say your child throws up and has a</v>

784
00:48:45.671 --> 00:48:48.820
<v Speaker 2>fever and you don't know what's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him or her.</v>

785
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:53.560
<v Speaker 2>And this is obviously one of the more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more ancient moments for any person.</v>

786
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:54.641
<v Speaker 2>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

787
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 2>obvious evolutionary reasons why we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be concerned about this.</v>

788
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:01.950
<v Speaker 2>And so this is quite Darwinian to care </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening to your,</v>

789
00:49:01.951 --> 00:49:06.740
<v Speaker 2>your infant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But today this primitive uncertainty and</v>

790
00:49:06.741 --> 00:49:07.574
<v Speaker 2>helplessness and fear is bracketed by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic understanding of the processes in </v>

791
00:49:12.591 --> 00:49:13.424
<v Speaker 2>the world that can affect a human body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's obviously enough to worry </v>

792
00:49:16.741 --> 00:49:19.320
<v Speaker 2>about there to drive almost any parent </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

793
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:24.370
<v Speaker 2>But one thing that is no longer on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>menu is the evil eye.</v>

794
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.100
<v Speaker 2>When your child gets sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no part of your mind,</v>

795
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:32.730
<v Speaker 2>if you're saying is now devoted to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question of whether or not you should go</v>

796
00:49:32.731 --> 00:49:33.564
<v Speaker 2>burn your neighbor as a witch because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she might've tasked a malicious glance </v>

797
00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.000
<v Speaker 2>at your child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

798
00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.150
<v Speaker 2>But as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was not always so,</v>

799
00:49:42.151 --> 00:49:43.530
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Africa,</v>

800
00:49:43.531 --> 00:49:46.500
<v Speaker 2>people are still murdering their </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbors for the crime of witchcraft.</v>

801
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:50.500
<v Speaker 2>So the problem from my point of view is </v>
<v Speaker 2>twofold.</v>

802
00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:51.443
<v Speaker 2>One is that we know that there's a path </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward to rule out things like </v>

803
00:49:56.081 --> 00:49:56.914
<v Speaker 2>witchcraft and the evil eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that this path is science and </v>

804
00:49:59.231 --> 00:50:00.430
<v Speaker 2>rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally.</v>

805
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:02.883
<v Speaker 2>The other problem is that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>still play this game by resort to </v>

806
00:50:07.201 --> 00:50:08.034
<v Speaker 2>ancient stories and finding some </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection between those stories and </v>

807
00:50:11.251 --> 00:50:12.084
<v Speaker 2>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could play a game of dignifying a </v>

808
00:50:14.831 --> 00:50:16.270
<v Speaker 2>belief in magic.</v>

809
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.111
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

810
00:50:17.111 --> 00:50:22.111
<v Speaker 2>the evil eye specifically along union </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines or archetype aligns or something.</v>

811
00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.800
<v Speaker 2>You could be sympathetic with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

812
00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:27.043
<v Speaker 2>But my point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be the point of that mean </v>

813
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:30.103
<v Speaker 2>given the obvious harms that we no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer need commit based on disavowing </v>

814
00:50:34.321 --> 00:50:35.154
<v Speaker 2>this ancient ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would one spend any time at all </v>

815
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.780
<v Speaker 2>trying to make sense of admittedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient concern about sympathetic magic,</v>

816
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sympathetic magic is dangerous bullshit.</v>

817
00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:52.460
<v Speaker 2>That's basically all I think we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about it now.</v>

818
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:57.320
<v Speaker 2>And yet you could spend a lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be reading not only young,</v>

819
00:50:57.321 --> 00:50:58.154
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sketchy or people like Alistair Crowley </v>

820
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.080
<v Speaker 2>and lfs Levy and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

821
00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.710
<v Speaker 2>the history of hermeticism and you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>open it and you know,</v>

822
00:51:05.711 --> 00:51:08.860
<v Speaker 2>manly palmer halls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secret teachings of all ages and,</v>

823
00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:12.950
<v Speaker 2>and just get deep into that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tradition of Western magic,</v>

824
00:51:12.951 --> 00:51:13.784
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me to be almost by </v>

825
00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:18.660
<v Speaker 2>definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a colossal waste of time and actually,</v>

826
00:51:18.661 --> 00:51:21.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary to preserve anything that we</v>

827
00:51:21.591 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 2>care about at this moment in history.</v>

828
00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.151
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

829
00:51:24.151 --> 00:51:27.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that we have to have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument about the,</v>

830
00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:29.610
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

831
00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:33.990
<v Speaker 4>the utility of moving forward on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific front.</v>

832
00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:37.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean I consider myself a scientist and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

833
00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:41.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel that it's necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 4>justify to the audience that's likely to</v>

834
00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:44.780
<v Speaker 4>be listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the utility of the scientific approach.</v>

835
00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:48.810
<v Speaker 4>I would say that that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>

836
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.673
<v Speaker 4>there's great purpose in looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>these ancient stories in the same way </v>

837
00:51:52.831 --> 00:51:56.820
<v Speaker 4>Sam as there's great purpose and utility</v>
<v Speaker 4>in reading fiction.</v>

838
00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:58.321
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

839
00:51:58.321 --> 00:52:00.780
<v Speaker 4>and I don't mean that in a derogatory </v>
<v Speaker 4>manner.</v>

840
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:05.760
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I thought about </v>
<v Speaker 4>after our last discussion because I went</v>

841
00:52:05.761 --> 00:52:09.060
<v Speaker 4>and did some investigation into </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitions of truth,</v>

842
00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:12.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some serious investigation so that I was</v>

843
00:52:12.241 --> 00:52:14.040
<v Speaker 4>more prepared the next time that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked.</v>

844
00:52:14.041 --> 00:52:16.260
<v Speaker 4>But one of the questions that I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 4>to ask you,</v>

845
00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:19.970
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given your emphasis on the,</v>

846
00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:20.804
<v Speaker 4>on truth as embedded in fact and also </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability of moral truth to reveal </v>

847
00:52:24.771 --> 00:52:25.604
<v Speaker 4>itself from a set of facts is here's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sentence for you and perhaps you can </v>

848
00:52:29.411 --> 00:52:30.244
<v Speaker 4>tell me what you make of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is great truth revealed in </v>

849
00:52:34.101 --> 00:52:36.710
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tolstoy and Shakespeare.</v>

850
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:41.790
<v Speaker 4>Do you agree with that or disagree </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's no fact in any of that.</v>

851
00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:45.500
<v Speaker 4>And there are certainly no scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>data now.</v>

852
00:52:45.501 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that those great works of Literature,</v>

853
00:52:48.411 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 4>which are I would say more or less </v>
<v Speaker 4>universally regarded as valuable,</v>

854
00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 4>do they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would you,</v>

855
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.630
<v Speaker 4>this is where we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why we got stuck on the issue of truth.</v>

856
00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:59.380
<v Speaker 4>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that those stories,</v>

857
00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:01.860
<v Speaker 4>there's more truth than Dostoyevsky's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fiction.</v>

858
00:53:01.861 --> 00:53:04.080
<v Speaker 4>Then there is in a single person's life.</v>

859
00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'd go quite that far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

860
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I will totally agree with you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of truth in fiction.</v>

861
00:53:11.681 --> 00:53:12.514
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's at all why we got </v>
<v Speaker 2>bogged down in our previous discussion </v>

862
00:53:15.641 --> 00:53:16.474
<v Speaker 2>about truth.</v>

863
00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.100
<v Speaker 4>How would you characterize that truth </v>
<v Speaker 4>though?</v>

864
00:53:19.101 --> 00:53:23.150
<v Speaker 4>Because it's certainly not factual by by</v>
<v Speaker 4>any stretch of the imagination.</v>

865
00:53:23.151 --> 00:53:24.910
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's some sort of,</v>

866
00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:26.533
<v Speaker 2>let me stretch our imaginations there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a wide variety of facts </v>

867
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:35.850
<v Speaker 2>that are at the very least illustrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>in fiction.</v>

868
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.713
<v Speaker 2>The reason why fiction is compelling to </v>
<v Speaker 2>us is that it does map on credibly to </v>

869
00:53:41.621 --> 00:53:42.454
<v Speaker 2>our experience of the world or what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can imagined to be valid human </v>

870
00:53:46.701 --> 00:53:47.534
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

871
00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.453
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

872
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:49.493
<v Speaker 2>If it were radically strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say if it all seemed </v>

873
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:57.130
<v Speaker 2>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the definition of an unsuccessful</v>

874
00:53:57.131 --> 00:53:57.964
<v Speaker 2>work of fiction in so far as certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of fiction push those boundaries </v>

875
00:54:01.911 --> 00:54:05.640
<v Speaker 2>and certain kinds of magical realism or </v>
<v Speaker 2>science fiction,</v>

876
00:54:05.641 --> 00:54:06.474
<v Speaker 2>which begins to seem basically like </v>
<v Speaker 2>tennis without the net where there's </v>

877
00:54:09.231 --> 00:54:10.064
<v Speaker 2>just no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no rules that make it </v>

878
00:54:11.821 --> 00:54:13.380
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sweet spot,</v>

879
00:54:13.381 --> 00:54:18.381
<v Speaker 2>at least in in my mind for fiction is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that has enough verisimilitude</v>

880
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:24.990
<v Speaker 2>to be credible and yet it's a heightened</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

881
00:54:24.991 --> 00:54:25.824
<v Speaker 2>which makes it much more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then just finding out what happened to </v>

882
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:31.400
<v Speaker 2>an ordinary person on an ordinary day.</v>

883
00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:32.271
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

884
00:54:32.271 --> 00:54:33.200
<v Speaker 4>so with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

885
00:54:33.201 --> 00:54:36.200
<v Speaker 4>let's take that idea of heightened </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality because I could make,</v>

886
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:37.913
<v Speaker 4>imagine that this is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that I took Dostoevsky and </v>

887
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:43.343
<v Speaker 4>tolstoy and Shakespeare for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll do for the time being and I </v>

888
00:54:46.771 --> 00:54:47.604
<v Speaker 4>distilled out what made them great </v>
<v Speaker 4>fiction and I extracted a work of Metta </v>

889
00:54:52.051 --> 00:54:56.420
<v Speaker 4>fiction from them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be archetipal he religious.</v>

890
00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.570
<v Speaker 2>The thing about religion for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

891
00:54:59.571 --> 00:55:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I know there are people who would </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispute this.</v>

892
00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:04.170
<v Speaker 2>I just don't find this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These claims,</v>

893
00:55:04.171 --> 00:55:07.440
<v Speaker 2>credible religion becomes religion for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

894
00:55:07.441 --> 00:55:10.100
<v Speaker 2>When you begin to assert</v>

895
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.800
<v Speaker 2>that certain things are true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically other worldly things,</v>

896
00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:20.340
<v Speaker 2>the survival of the conscious mind after</v>
<v Speaker 2>death or the real existence of invisible</v>

897
00:55:22.851 --> 00:55:23.684
<v Speaker 2>agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can propitiate or fail to </v>

898
00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:27.350
<v Speaker 2>propitiate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

899
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.740
<v Speaker 2>who have their eye on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

900
00:55:29.741 --> 00:55:33.470
<v Speaker 2>They care how you live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They care whether you masturbate a care,</v>

901
00:55:33.471 --> 00:55:34.304
<v Speaker 2>whether you pray to them and in what </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms you do and if you get any of that </v>

902
00:55:37.391 --> 00:55:39.680
<v Speaker 2>stuff wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will suffer for it.</v>

903
00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.633
<v Speaker 2>You are in relationship to these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some people who who have </v>

904
00:55:44.031 --> 00:55:49.031
<v Speaker 2>relaxed their standards of commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two revealed religions so much that they</v>

905
00:55:49.941 --> 00:55:50.774
<v Speaker 2>don't really answer to that description,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most religious people most of the </v>

906
00:55:53.721 --> 00:55:56.180
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly most Christians and Muslims,</v>

907
00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.080
<v Speaker 2>I believe otherworldly and supernatural </v>
<v Speaker 2>and superstitious things,</v>

908
00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:04.400
<v Speaker 2>which are I would argue indirect </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradiction,</v>

909
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:06.250
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reasonable things.</v>

910
00:56:06.251 --> 00:56:08.440
<v Speaker 2>They might believe about how the cosmos </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

911
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:09.811
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

912
00:56:09.811 --> 00:56:13.570
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to take a specific example </v>
<v Speaker 4>from what you said and address it.</v>

913
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:17.060
<v Speaker 4>You were talking about the propitiation </v>
<v Speaker 4>of supernatural beings.</v>

914
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't mind,</v>

915
00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:22.283
<v Speaker 4>tell you the story of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Abel in a way that you probably </v>

916
00:56:25.361 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 4>haven't heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's only a paragraph long.</v>

917
00:56:27.911 --> 00:56:31.660
<v Speaker 4>This story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want to set it up first.</v>

918
00:56:31.661 --> 00:56:32.494
<v Speaker 4>So Kate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enable our types from a classical </v>

919
00:56:35.681 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 4>religious interpretation standpoint and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there that you might think about them as</v>

920
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:44.050
<v Speaker 4>foreshadowing the emergence of the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Christ and Satan.</v>

921
00:56:44.051 --> 00:56:47.400
<v Speaker 4>So they're the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're the idea of the hostile brothers</v>

922
00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:51.010
<v Speaker 4>and that idea pops up in fiction all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

923
00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:51.521
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

924
00:56:51.521 --> 00:56:53.200
<v Speaker 4>it's a constant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an archetype.</v>

925
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:55.600
<v Speaker 4>It's man against his soul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

926
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.220
<v Speaker 4>or man against his darker nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

927
00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.373
<v Speaker 4>that that's the basic plot idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now Cain and Abel in Genesis are </v>

928
00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:04.864
<v Speaker 4>actually the first to actual human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings because God or Adam and eve are </v>

929
00:57:09.761 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 4>made by God.</v>

930
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:14.020
<v Speaker 4>So somehow they're not exactly human </v>
<v Speaker 4>play along with me for a minute,</v>

931
00:57:14.021 --> 00:57:17.860
<v Speaker 4>I know this isn't literally true sound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not trying to claim that it is,</v>

932
00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:18.933
<v Speaker 4>but cain and enabled are the first two </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings that are born into the </v>

933
00:57:22.901 --> 00:57:27.040
<v Speaker 4>world instead of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And cain is a,</v>

934
00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:28.203
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an agriculturalist and Abel is a </v>

935
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:31.443
<v Speaker 4>shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course that shepherds the </v>

936
00:57:33.751 --> 00:57:34.584
<v Speaker 4>meckel's much later in through </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity and also in the story of </v>

937
00:57:37.181 --> 00:57:38.014
<v Speaker 4>King David,</v>
<v Speaker 4>partly because if you are going to be a </v>

938
00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:40.990
<v Speaker 4>shepherd back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

939
00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:45.991
<v Speaker 4>you are one tough dude because you had </v>
<v Speaker 4>slingshots and sticks and their reliance</v>

940
00:57:46.061 --> 00:57:47.890
<v Speaker 4>after your sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

941
00:57:47.891 --> 00:57:51.430
<v Speaker 4>you weren't little boy blue in pastoral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Victorian England,</v>

942
00:57:51.431 --> 00:57:55.000
<v Speaker 4>you are one tough character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to be a shepherd was no joke.</v>

943
00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.313
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cain and Abel are making their way </v>

944
00:57:59.321 --> 00:58:02.080
<v Speaker 4>through life and Cain is having a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>rough time.</v>

945
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.230
<v Speaker 4>Things aren't going his way at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas able,</v>

946
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:08.020
<v Speaker 4>everything goes his way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the women love him,</v>

947
00:58:08.021 --> 00:58:09.490
<v Speaker 4>his flocks increased.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

948
00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:10.383
<v Speaker 4>he's successful in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also intimate that not only is he </v>

949
00:58:13.481 --> 00:58:14.314
<v Speaker 4>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everyone likes him and understands </v>

950
00:58:16.001 --> 00:58:16.834
<v Speaker 4>why he's successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas Cain is kind of bitter and </v>

951
00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:24.490
<v Speaker 4>nothing he ever does works out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they both make sacrifices to God.</v>

952
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.590
<v Speaker 4>And I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam,</v>

953
00:58:26.591 --> 00:58:30.480
<v Speaker 4>when I started to understand what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>discovery of sacrifice meant,</v>

954
00:58:30.481 --> 00:58:35.481
<v Speaker 4>it just about blew me out of my room </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I realized that in the discovery</v>

955
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:37.810
<v Speaker 4>of sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the acting,</v>

956
00:58:37.811 --> 00:58:38.644
<v Speaker 4>out of sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had information pertaining to the </v>

957
00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:46.800
<v Speaker 4>earliest human discovery that you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>let something of value go in the present</v>

958
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:52.450
<v Speaker 4>and reap a reward in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a staggering realization.</v>

959
00:58:52.451 --> 00:58:54.370
<v Speaker 4>It's actually the discover of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>future,</v>

960
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:55.503
<v Speaker 4>discovery of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now people had to act these things out </v>

961
00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.313
<v Speaker 4>and then represent them in stories </v>
<v Speaker 4>before they could understand them </v>

962
00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:02.560
<v Speaker 4>psychologically.</v>

963
00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:03.843
<v Speaker 4>So cain and Abel make sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is that to keep Yahuah </v>

964
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.900
<v Speaker 4>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the patriarchal spirit happy,</v>

965
00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.320
<v Speaker 4>you have to sacrifice something of true </v>
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>

966
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:20.250
<v Speaker 4>It has to be a real genuine sacrifice or</v>
<v Speaker 4>you or you won't reap the future rewards</v>

967
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:21.573
<v Speaker 4>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone knows what that means to </v>

968
00:59:23.091 --> 00:59:23.924
<v Speaker 4>them because I asked my students all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time what their parents sacrificed to </v>

969
00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:28.814
<v Speaker 4>send them to university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they all understand that perfectly </v>

970
00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:32.084
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's happened is their parents </v>

971
00:59:33.381 --> 00:59:34.214
<v Speaker 4>have made a bargain with the present,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that they will forego certain </v>

972
00:59:37.161 --> 00:59:42.020
<v Speaker 4>kinds of gratification so that they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>even their children can reap a reward.</v>

973
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.110
<v Speaker 4>They're making a bargain with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of reality.</v>

974
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:46.453
<v Speaker 4>Now that was personified or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anthropomorphize depending on on which </v>

975
00:59:49.491 --> 00:59:50.324
<v Speaker 4>terminology wanna use early when people </v>
<v Speaker 4>were still starting starting to work </v>

976
00:59:53.961 --> 00:59:54.794
<v Speaker 4>these things out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that didn't destroy the essential </v>

977
00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:57.560
<v Speaker 4>validity of the idea.</v>

978
00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:02.920
<v Speaker 4>Now the story goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abel sacrifices were valid.</v>

979
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:06.080
<v Speaker 4>The story implies that although it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit ambivalent,</v>

980
01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:06.914
<v Speaker 4>you never know if Cain is doing a bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>job of sacrificing or if y'all was just </v>

981
01:00:10.371 --> 01:00:12.200
<v Speaker 4>being a son of a bitch and torturing </v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

982
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:13.363
<v Speaker 4>which of course is a classic problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>existentially because you don't know in </v>

983
01:00:17.241 --> 01:00:18.074
<v Speaker 4>your life when you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's because you'd be doing things </v>

984
01:00:20.301 --> 01:00:24.380
<v Speaker 4>wrong and not making the correct </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifices so to speak,</v>

985
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 4>or that fate is just treating you </v>
<v Speaker 4>harshly and unjustly.</v>

986
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:33.970
<v Speaker 4>But the story into mates that cane is </v>
<v Speaker 4>making errors in his sacrifices,</v>

987
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:34.963
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things don't go well for Cain and Abel </v>

988
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:42.440
<v Speaker 4>continues to to flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Kane is very unhappy with this.</v>

989
01:00:42.441 --> 01:00:45.860
<v Speaker 4>And one day he decides to have it out </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the creator of being,</v>

990
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:49.400
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a pretty ballsy thing to do,</v>

991
01:00:49.401 --> 01:00:52.770
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he goes and has a chat with God,</v>

992
01:00:52.771 --> 01:00:53.604
<v Speaker 4>and I've got this description of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation from looking at multiple </v>

993
01:00:57.831 --> 01:00:59.600
<v Speaker 4>translations of the original text.</v>

994
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.360
<v Speaker 4>And he basically confronts cio and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

995
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:03.583
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of stupid university have you </v>

996
01:01:04.851 --> 01:01:06.510
<v Speaker 4>put together here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

997
01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.980
<v Speaker 4>this being that you've created this </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally flawed.</v>

998
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.233
<v Speaker 4>I'm out there breaking myself and half </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to make everything work and </v>

999
01:01:14.811 --> 01:01:15.644
<v Speaker 4>nothing ever works out for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's that damnable who he </v>

1000
01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:19.874
<v Speaker 4>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he already has to lift a finger and you </v>

1001
01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:21.974
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>women flocked to him and his camels </v>

1002
01:01:23.301 --> 01:01:24.380
<v Speaker 4>increase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1003
01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:25.560
<v Speaker 4>it's unjust.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1004
01:01:25.561 --> 01:01:30.020
<v Speaker 4>it's unjust and inappropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you should be called to task for it.</v>

1005
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:34.760
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the eternal story of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people complaining about the fundamental</v>

1006
01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:38.600
<v Speaker 4>tragedy and evil of being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's pretty good argument.</v>

1007
01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:43.100
<v Speaker 4>So God says to kick k and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1008
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:45.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a pretty good argument,</v>

1009
01:01:45.141 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 4>but here's how I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like a man who's inside the house</v>

1010
01:01:49.761 --> 01:01:54.761
<v Speaker 4>and at the door of the house there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>this predatory cap that sexually aroused</v>

1011
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:56.930
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sin.</v>

1012
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 4>It's missing the mark because that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what sin means.</v>

1013
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:04.550
<v Speaker 4>It means to miss the Bullseye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have invited it into your house,</v>

1014
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.413
<v Speaker 4>this corruption and sin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've invited it into your house </v>

1015
01:02:07.551 --> 01:02:11.450
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily so that it can have its way </v>
<v Speaker 4>with you sexually.</v>

1016
01:02:11.451 --> 01:02:12.680
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you've,</v>

1017
01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:13.723
<v Speaker 4>you've intertwined yourself with it </v>
<v Speaker 4>creatively and brought something </v>

1018
01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:18.170
<v Speaker 4>horrible forth</v>

1019
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 4>and you're suffering there,</v>

1020
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.023
<v Speaker 3>therefore can be laid at your feet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no reason to call me on the </v>

1021
01:02:25.471 --> 01:02:28.530
<v Speaker 3>structure of my creation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so of course,</v>

1022
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.513
<v Speaker 3>that's the last thing that cain wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear because he doesn't want to </v>

1023
01:02:32.161 --> 01:02:35.280
<v Speaker 3>understand that he's at fault for making</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrong sacrifices.</v>

1024
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:36.383
<v Speaker 3>So he trots on out of there and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story says that his countenance falls </v>

1025
01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:43.830
<v Speaker 3>and that he's raw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say almost nothing at all.</v>

1026
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:45.083
<v Speaker 3>And he decides that he's going to serve </v>
<v Speaker 3>God a good one and wander off and </v>

1027
01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:51.180
<v Speaker 3>destroy his ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God's ideal,</v>

1028
01:02:51.181 --> 01:02:52.800
<v Speaker 3>but also canes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all no ideal.</v>

1029
01:02:52.801 --> 01:02:56.340
<v Speaker 3>So we kills his brother and leaves him </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

1030
01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:00.450
<v Speaker 3>And that's the story of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's worth Sam.</v>

1031
01:03:00.451 --> 01:03:01.284
<v Speaker 3>Because what happens after that is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cane gives rise to descendants and in </v>

1032
01:03:06.661 --> 01:03:09.360
<v Speaker 3>his first or so generation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>descendants,</v>

1033
01:03:09.361 --> 01:03:13.050
<v Speaker 3>if you bother or annoy them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kill seven of you,</v>

1034
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:14.363
<v Speaker 3>not one.</v>

1035
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:17.310
<v Speaker 3>And if you bother his descendants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>descendants,</v>

1036
01:03:17.311 --> 01:03:20.100
<v Speaker 3>they kill 49 of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not seven.</v>

1037
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:21.323
<v Speaker 3>And then his ultimate descendant or one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of his ultimate descendants is tubal </v>

1038
01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:27.360
<v Speaker 3>cane and tubal cane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1039
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.470
<v Speaker 3>historically speaking or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or traditionally speaking,</v>

1040
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:34.800
<v Speaker 3>is the first person who makes weapons of</v>
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>

1041
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.233
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea there is that the deceit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and jealousy and resentment of the </v>

1042
01:03:40.411 --> 01:03:44.370
<v Speaker 3>individual propagates through society </v>
<v Speaker 3>until war emerges.</v>

1043
01:03:44.371 --> 01:03:45.204
<v Speaker 3>And then the next story is the flood to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reactions to this Jordan one is that </v>

1044
01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:51.653
<v Speaker 3>obviously you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some stories are interesting and are </v>

1045
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:59.550
<v Speaker 3>written for a reason and those reasons </v>
<v Speaker 3>are interesting and I've already granted</v>

1046
01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:00.384
<v Speaker 3>you that in fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it can be a lot of truth in </v>

1047
01:04:02.491 --> 01:04:03.930
<v Speaker 3>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of human truth,</v>

1048
01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:04.883
<v Speaker 3>which is distilled there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of his virtues is that when you </v>

1049
01:04:08.341 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 3>read somebody like Dostoyevsky or </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolstoy or Shakespeare,</v>

1050
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.170
<v Speaker 3>you can run an emulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people's lived experience.</v>

1051
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:18.270
<v Speaker 3>You can essentially live other lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

1052
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:23.360
<v Speaker 3>that you would never live personally and</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn the lessons of those lives,</v>

1053
01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:27.900
<v Speaker 3>though you're never going to murder some</v>
<v Speaker 3>old woman in her flat.</v>

1054
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.320
<v Speaker 3>You can watch roscommon the cough do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and experience a plausible psychological</v>

1055
01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:37.103
<v Speaker 3>arc that follows from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not discounting the value of </v>

1056
01:04:40.351 --> 01:04:41.041
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all,</v>

1057
01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:41.874
<v Speaker 3>but it seems to me that what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is overlooking in your discussion </v>

1058
01:04:46.831 --> 01:04:51.390
<v Speaker 3>of Cain and Abel and the the archetype </v>
<v Speaker 3>of propitiating a god,</v>

1059
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.100
<v Speaker 3>you're overlooking the obvious ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth and its consequences here.</v>

1060
01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:56.934
<v Speaker 3>And then telling a story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fairly unconstrained by any </v>

1061
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:02.394
<v Speaker 3>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The obvious ground truth for me is </v>

1062
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:05.603
<v Speaker 3>people thought they were in relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a deity who could become angry and </v>

1063
01:05:10.231 --> 01:05:11.064
<v Speaker 3>who had to be propitiated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this led to some very direct and </v>

1064
01:05:16.591 --> 01:05:17.950
<v Speaker 3>appalling consequences</v>

1065
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.540
<v Speaker 2>for millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most extreme beans,</v>

1066
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 2>human sacrifice from which we graduated </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1067
01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Animal sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in the Judeochristian tradition</v>

1068
01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.433
<v Speaker 2>and human sacrifice was real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's virtually a cultural universal </v>

1069
01:05:31.771 --> 01:05:34.320
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's some archetypal story you can</v>

1070
01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:35.154
<v Speaker 2>tell about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was perhaps the most barbarous </v>

1071
01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:42.080
<v Speaker 2>symptom of human ignorance about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weather,</v>

1072
01:05:42.081 --> 01:05:42.914
<v Speaker 2>about disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about good and bad luck about </v>

1073
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:47.910
<v Speaker 2>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about everything that we have ever given</v>

1074
01:05:47.911 --> 01:05:48.744
<v Speaker 2>rise to and we are quite happy to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>outgrown it and when whenever we find a </v>

1075
01:05:52.431 --> 01:05:57.200
<v Speaker 2>culture that is practicing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like human sacrifice based on it,</v>

1076
01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:00.230
<v Speaker 2>a notion of propitiating invisible </v>
<v Speaker 2>deities,</v>

1077
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.313
<v Speaker 2>we see these people as dangerously </v>
<v Speaker 2>confused and that and any child born </v>

1078
01:06:05.081 --> 01:06:10.070
<v Speaker 2>into the company of of such adults is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlucky one who has to be rescued now.</v>

1079
01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:10.933
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the year is 2017 as you were </v>

1080
01:06:13.171 --> 01:06:14.004
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reminded of something I wrote in </v>

1081
01:06:15.321 --> 01:06:16.154
<v Speaker 2>the end of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first book and an end note that was </v>

1082
01:06:18.461 --> 01:06:19.294
<v Speaker 2>kind of pitch to the Joseph Campbell use</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mythology of which you are showing </v>

1083
01:06:25.171 --> 01:06:27.570
<v Speaker 2>some affinity even though his name </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't come up.</v>

1084
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.680
<v Speaker 2>And I just want to read this to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is,</v>

1085
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:30.933
<v Speaker 2>I believe this counterpoint to this way </v>
<v Speaker 2>of talking about mythology and stories </v>

1086
01:06:34.631 --> 01:06:37.920
<v Speaker 2>and archetypes is still valid place is </v>
<v Speaker 2>still what I think.</v>

1087
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:39.703
<v Speaker 2>I went into a bookstore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked into the cookbook section of a </v>

1088
01:06:42.301 --> 01:06:45.370
<v Speaker 2>barnes and noble and with my eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>closed,</v>

1089
01:06:45.371 --> 01:06:49.400
<v Speaker 2>just ran my hand down the shelf and </v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbed a book,</v>

1090
01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:50.523
<v Speaker 2>opened it at random and looked at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first recipe I saw and the book turned </v>

1091
01:06:53.921 --> 01:06:54.754
<v Speaker 2>out to be a book called a taste of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii new cooking from the crossroads </v>

1092
01:06:58.291 --> 01:07:01.650
<v Speaker 2>of the Pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here is what I wrote in this end note</v>

1093
01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:02.484
<v Speaker 2>in the end of faith and they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I discovered an as yet uncelebrated </v>

1094
01:07:05.391 --> 01:07:08.900
<v Speaker 2>mystical treatise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While it appears to be a recipe for walk</v>

1095
01:07:08.901 --> 01:07:12.230
<v Speaker 2>seared fish and shrimp cakes with Ogo </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomato relish,</v>

1096
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.473
<v Speaker 2>we need only study as list of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingredients to know that we are in the </v>

1097
01:07:15.221 --> 01:07:17.770
<v Speaker 2>presence of an unrivaled spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

1098
01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Then I list the ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1099
01:07:19.681 --> 01:07:23.750
<v Speaker 2>So there's one snapper fillet cubed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three teaspoons of chopped scallions,</v>

1100
01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 2>salt and freshly ground pepper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long list of ingredients.</v>

1101
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.380
<v Speaker 2>And then I go through with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

1102
01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:31.240
<v Speaker 2>a mystical interpretation of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>recipe.</v>

1103
01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll just give you a few sentences to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give you a sense of,</v>

1104
01:07:33.781 --> 01:07:34.390
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

1105
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:37.680
<v Speaker 4>sounds like you're getting dangerously </v>
<v Speaker 4>close to paranoid schizophrenia</v>

1106
01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.053
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is obviously crazy cause I </v>

1107
01:07:40.961 --> 01:07:41.794
<v Speaker 2>know how I did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is as valid sounding or so I </v>

1108
01:07:45.101 --> 01:07:48.960
<v Speaker 2>would argue as most of what is produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this genre.</v>

1109
01:07:48.961 --> 01:07:52.900
<v Speaker 2>So when I say the snapper fillet of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course is the individual himself,</v>

1110
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:55.360
<v Speaker 2>you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wash in the sea of existence.</v>

1111
01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.473
<v Speaker 2>And here we find it cubed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that our situation must </v>

1112
01:07:59.021 --> 01:08:01.390
<v Speaker 2>be remedied in all three dimensions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

1113
01:08:01.391 --> 01:08:02.224
<v Speaker 2>mind and spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A have three teaspoons of chopped </v>

1114
01:08:04.441 --> 01:08:05.274
<v Speaker 2>scallions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This further partakes of the cubic </v>

1115
01:08:06.841 --> 01:08:07.674
<v Speaker 2>symmetry suggesting that that which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>need add to each level of our being by </v>

1116
01:08:11.031 --> 01:08:14.110
<v Speaker 2>way of antidote comes likewise in equal </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportions.</v>

1117
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:16.230
<v Speaker 2>The import of the is clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The body,</v>

1118
01:08:16.231 --> 01:08:18.840
<v Speaker 2>mind and spirit need to be tended with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same care,</v>

1119
01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.153
<v Speaker 2>salt and freshly ground black pepper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well here we have the perennial </v>

1120
01:08:23.041 --> 01:08:23.874
<v Speaker 2>invocation of opposites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white and black aspects of our </v>

1121
01:08:26.371 --> 01:08:27.160
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

1122
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Both good and evil must be understood if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would fulfill the recipe of spiritual</v>

1123
01:08:30.911 --> 01:08:31.744
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing after all can be excluded from </v>

1124
01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:35.700
<v Speaker 2>the human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be a tantric text.</v>

1125
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:39.480
<v Speaker 2>What has more salt and pepper come to us</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the form of grains,</v>

1126
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:40.343
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that the good and bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualities are born at the tiniest </v>

1127
01:08:42.811 --> 01:08:46.150
<v Speaker 2>actions and that's we're not in good or </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil in general,</v>

1128
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.083
<v Speaker 2>but only by virtue of innumerable </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments which color the stream of our </v>

1129
01:08:49.551 --> 01:08:50.384
<v Speaker 2>beans by force of reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's a dash of Cayenne pepper </v>

1130
01:08:53.521 --> 01:08:55.740
<v Speaker 2>clearly of being of such robust color </v>
<v Speaker 2>and flavor.</v>

1131
01:08:55.741 --> 01:08:58.790
<v Speaker 2>It's signifies the spiritual influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an enlightened add Dept.</v>

1132
01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I go on and on and this is all bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's meant to be bullshit.</v>

1133
01:09:03.441 --> 01:09:03.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1134
01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:04.814
<v Speaker 2>this is a random text that I'm giving a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high falutin spiritual interpretation </v>

1135
01:09:10.081 --> 01:09:10.914
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is you can do this with </v>

1136
01:09:12.721 --> 01:09:17.721
<v Speaker 2>anything and religions have been doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this for millennia with specific books,</v>

1137
01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.370
<v Speaker 2>which even by the merits of fiction for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most part I'm,</v>

1138
01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.610
<v Speaker 2>there's some exceptions here.</v>

1139
01:09:24.610 --> 01:09:25.443
<v Speaker 2>I'll grant you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some bits of the Bible stand </v>

1140
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.430
<v Speaker 2>comparison with the rest of world </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>

1141
01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:31.610
<v Speaker 2>but much of it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1142
01:09:31.611 --> 01:09:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Most of these books are profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 2>mediocre.</v>

1143
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.840
<v Speaker 2>The Koran is as mediocre a book as I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen on any subject.</v>

1144
01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Our grant that may be the Arabic is </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

1145
01:09:42.671 --> 01:09:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't read Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the content of the book isn't,</v>

1146
01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:49.620
<v Speaker 2>and this is true of most religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing and the,</v>

1147
01:09:49.621 --> 01:09:54.621
<v Speaker 2>the fact that most people most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time have found profound meaning in much</v>

1148
01:09:55.651 --> 01:09:58.540
<v Speaker 2>of this work is not proof otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1149
01:09:58.541 --> 01:10:00.660
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you found me a culture that was doing</v>

1150
01:10:00.661 --> 01:10:03.250
<v Speaker 2>what I just did too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recipe in a cookbook,</v>

1151
01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.830
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they had gone generation </v>
<v Speaker 2>after generation and namor heard of that</v>

1152
01:10:07.831 --> 01:10:11.940
<v Speaker 2>interpretation wouldn't prove anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem I'm having here.</v>

1153
01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:12.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's good.</v>

1154
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:16.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean what you wrote is very funny too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1155
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:18.440
<v Speaker 4>it's very much reminiscent of new age </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

1156
01:10:18.441 --> 01:10:19.274
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>

1157
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.780
<v Speaker 2>What's the problem with new age thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in your view?</v>

1158
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.943
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's constrained and </v>

1159
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:25.770
<v Speaker 4>exactly in the manner that you said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1160
01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.110
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned that what I've been trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>

1161
01:10:28.111 --> 01:10:30.100
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>working my way through the Merck,</v>

1162
01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.320
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1163
01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:33.180
<v Speaker 4>if you're analyzing scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature,</v>

1164
01:10:33.181 --> 01:10:38.110
<v Speaker 4>you have to separate the wheat from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaff and like 95% of it is chaff unless</v>

1165
01:10:38.111 --> 01:10:41.560
<v Speaker 4>it's social psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in which case 99% of it is chat,</v>

1166
01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:44.410
<v Speaker 4>but it's chat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of it.</v>

1167
01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.273
<v Speaker 4>You have to be discriminating and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation in the scientific </v>

1168
01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:51.300
<v Speaker 4>literature just as another and in other </v>
<v Speaker 4>literary domains.</v>

1169
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:52.703
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly the case that we aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>as good at distinguishing what </v>

1170
01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:56.684
<v Speaker 4>constitutes quality in the fictional </v>
<v Speaker 4>domain from what constitutes outright </v>

1171
01:11:00.121 --> 01:11:02.610
<v Speaker 4>falls to a den and delusion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

1172
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:03.853
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any d I used the example of paranoid </v>

1173
01:11:05.411 --> 01:11:08.620
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia very specifically there </v>
<v Speaker 4>because paranoid</v>

1174
01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:09.963
<v Speaker 4>who tend to be among the more </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent people who are cursed with </v>

1175
01:11:12.251 --> 01:11:13.084
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia take a set of axioms and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then weave a compelling story that's </v>

1176
01:11:17.191 --> 01:11:20.550
<v Speaker 4>logically coherent if you grant the </v>
<v Speaker 4>validity of the axioms.</v>

1177
01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:21.923
<v Speaker 4>And so the kind of merch that you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>describing it and I think that that </v>

1178
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:30.381
<v Speaker 4>characterizes in particular new age </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking is is an ever present danger.</v>

1179
01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.880
<v Speaker 4>Not so much of religious thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

1180
01:11:32.881 --> 01:11:33.714
<v Speaker 4>Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1181
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.660
<v Speaker 4>it's an ever present danger of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>imaginativeness.</v>

1182
01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.913
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can produce representations of the </v>

1183
01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:43.500
<v Speaker 4>world that grip onto the world in many </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways,</v>

1184
01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:44.543
<v Speaker 4>but then we have to subject them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>intense criticism and that's why for </v>

1185
01:11:48.691 --> 01:11:49.524
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we both share a belief that the last </v>

1186
01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:52.674
<v Speaker 4>thing we want to do in our society has </v>
<v Speaker 4>put any restrictions whatsoever on the </v>

1187
01:11:55.681 --> 01:11:56.514
<v Speaker 4>human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a right to criticize religious </v>

1188
01:11:58.951 --> 01:11:59.784
<v Speaker 4>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's an absolute catastrophe </v>

1189
01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.293
<v Speaker 4>and I'm certainly not claiming for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>second that every possible religious </v>

1190
01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:08.400
<v Speaker 4>interpretation is correct.</v>

1191
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:09.583
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's clearly no more than every </v>

1192
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.473
<v Speaker 4>possible work of fiction is of quality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the quality issue really is a </v>

1193
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:19.350
<v Speaker 4>stickler because it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as we,</v>

1194
01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:21.630
<v Speaker 4>as we've already discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1195
01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.673
<v Speaker 4>it's sufficiently evident that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>such a thing as great literature to be </v>

1196
01:12:27.331 --> 01:12:28.164
<v Speaker 4>somewhat self evident that there's truth</v>
<v Speaker 4>embedded in that even though we don't </v>

1197
01:12:32.131 --> 01:12:34.710
<v Speaker 4>precisely know how to define it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1198
01:12:34.711 --> 01:12:38.010
<v Speaker 4>now the postmodernists would take an </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposing view to that.</v>

1199
01:12:38.011 --> 01:12:38.821
<v Speaker 4>They would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1200
01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:40.680
<v Speaker 4>there's no truth in literature </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever.</v>

1201
01:12:40.681 --> 01:12:43.280
<v Speaker 4>It's all a matter of interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is an,</v>

1202
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.273
<v Speaker 4>it can in some sense to the objection </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're raising and that's all I </v>

1203
01:12:47.881 --> 01:12:50.430
<v Speaker 4>have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a profound objection,</v>

1204
01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:52.523
<v Speaker 4>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that it throws the baby out </v>

1205
01:12:54.481 --> 01:12:56.430
<v Speaker 4>with the bath water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1206
01:12:56.431 --> 01:13:00.900
<v Speaker 4>so what I've been trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 4>discriminate my way through the,</v>

1207
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.823
<v Speaker 4>the wealth of past wisdom that has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>bequeathed to us and to find patterns </v>

1208
01:13:06.421 --> 01:13:10.050
<v Speaker 4>and then to verify them using other </v>
<v Speaker 4>techniques.</v>

1209
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.840
<v Speaker 4>Now some of the techniques are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1210
01:13:12.841 --> 01:13:13.674
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can also debate what constitutes an </v>

1211
01:13:15.181 --> 01:13:18.270
<v Speaker 4>acceptable methodological technique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But one of,</v>

1212
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.313
<v Speaker 4>there are existential techniques as well</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think you rely on them to some </v>

1213
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:25.470
<v Speaker 4>degree when you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessity of speaking the truth.</v>

1214
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:30.710
<v Speaker 4>Because I would say I've put what I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned from the analysis I've conducted</v>

1215
01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:35.400
<v Speaker 4>into action in my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my own life,</v>

1216
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:36.423
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has changed dramatically as a </v>

1217
01:13:37.441 --> 01:13:38.274
<v Speaker 4>consequence and only for the better in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the life of my family about which I </v>

1218
01:13:41.641 --> 01:13:42.474
<v Speaker 4>could say the same thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching that I've done to my students </v>

1219
01:13:45.661 --> 01:13:46.494
<v Speaker 4>and I've been regarded for 30 years as </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching courses at good universities </v>

1220
01:13:51.451 --> 01:13:52.284
<v Speaker 4>that have been regarded by a vast </v>
<v Speaker 4>majority of the students is absolutely </v>

1221
01:13:54.781 --> 01:13:59.460
<v Speaker 4>life transforming and so and there is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>massive hunger.</v>

1222
01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:00.613
<v Speaker 4>It's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost insatiable for more </v>

1223
01:14:04.201 --> 01:14:07.410
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated understanding of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>archetypal stories.</v>

1224
01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:08.190
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1225
01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:10.650
<v Speaker 4>you talked about human sacrifice and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would say,</v>

1226
01:14:10.651 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 4>well obviously</v>

1227
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.280
<v Speaker 3>that was a catastrophic and barbaric </v>
<v Speaker 3>epoch in human developmental history and</v>

1228
01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.013
<v Speaker 3>who would want to go back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say what we've done to that </v>

1229
01:14:23.471 --> 01:14:24.304
<v Speaker 3>is not so much invalidated as supplanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a psychological understanding in </v>

1230
01:14:29.921 --> 01:14:30.754
<v Speaker 3>that we can sacrifice what we hold dear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's holding us back and move forward </v>

1231
01:14:34.511 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 3>into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>

1232
01:14:35.861 --> 01:14:39.610
<v Speaker 3>or you could say on an even and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>more super ordinance sense,</v>

1233
01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:40.683
<v Speaker 3>it's reasonable for a person to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice themselves to what they hold </v>

1234
01:14:43.901 --> 01:14:44.734
<v Speaker 3>as the highest value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's an idea that's built </v>

1235
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:50.650
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily deeply into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>substructure of Christianity.</v>

1236
01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.400
<v Speaker 3>And it's very much what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

1237
01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:58.960
<v Speaker 3>when you tell people that they should </v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoned,</v>

1238
01:14:58.961 --> 01:14:59.794
<v Speaker 3>let's say they're impulsive desires and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their instrumental longings and do </v>

1239
01:15:02.621 --> 01:15:06.390
<v Speaker 3>nothing but tell the truth in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>from my perspective,</v>

1240
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.233
<v Speaker 3>what you're telling them is to give up </v>
<v Speaker 3>their selfish individual being and </v>

1241
01:15:11.711 --> 01:15:13.750
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice themselves to the truth.</v>

1242
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:15.423
<v Speaker 3>To me that like I truly believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the central message of </v>

1243
01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:18.694
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the central message of the </v>

1244
01:15:19.901 --> 01:15:20.734
<v Speaker 3>Prophetic tradition in Judaism as well </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the people who spoke truth to </v>

1245
01:15:24.611 --> 01:15:29.050
<v Speaker 3>power in the old testament were </v>
<v Speaker 3>generally very unpopular for doing so.</v>

1246
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:35.070
<v Speaker 3>So I know it's a problem separating the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wheat from the chaff and I think you did</v>

1247
01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 3>a great job of satirizing that in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in what you wrote,</v>

1248
01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:39.843
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't help us solve the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem of the fact that there is value </v>

1249
01:15:43.871 --> 01:15:46.210
<v Speaker 3>in great fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't view that as a problem.</v>

1250
01:15:46.211 --> 01:15:48.850
<v Speaker 3>I think it's obvious that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's value in it,</v>

1251
01:15:48.851 --> 01:15:49.684
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the value of telling you </v>
<v Speaker 3>how the cosmos works or what is likely </v>

1252
01:15:56.561 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 3>to happen in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1253
01:15:58.211 --> 01:15:59.044
<v Speaker 3>It's a different kind of value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a surrogate for a scientific </v>

1254
01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:05.170
<v Speaker 3>theory about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1255
01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.000
<v Speaker 3>Apps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what religion does with it.</v>

1256
01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I would say that that's fine.</v>

1257
01:16:10.001 --> 01:16:13.600
<v Speaker 3>I've got no disagreement with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is thing about the fundamentalists</v>

1258
01:16:13.601 --> 01:16:14.434
<v Speaker 3>say the Christian fundamentalists who </v>
<v Speaker 3>insist upon a literal understanding of </v>

1259
01:16:18.761 --> 01:16:19.594
<v Speaker 3>the biblical stories is that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what literal means and actually </v>

1260
01:16:23.321 --> 01:16:24.154
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're better scientists in some sense </v>

1261
01:16:25.841 --> 01:16:26.674
<v Speaker 3>then the scientists themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the scientist would never say </v>

1262
01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:32.140
<v Speaker 3>that the stories in genesis are </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific,</v>

1263
01:16:32.141 --> 01:16:32.974
<v Speaker 3>but the fundamentalists implicitly </v>
<v Speaker 3>assuming that only scientific fact can </v>

1264
01:16:37.871 --> 01:16:38.704
<v Speaker 3>be true attempt constantly to force </v>
<v Speaker 3>these stories into a scientific </v>

1265
01:16:42.281 --> 01:16:45.940
<v Speaker 3>framework where they do not belong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1266
01:16:45.941 --> 01:16:46.774
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the because the stories are believed to </v>

1267
01:16:48.911 --> 01:16:49.744
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking specifically about the </v>

1268
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Judeo Christian tradition because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're believed to be revealed truth,</v>

1269
01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:58.053
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are not stories written by </v>

1270
01:16:59.261 --> 01:17:03.040
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the word of God in some form.</v>

1271
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.083
<v Speaker 3>These are not held to be stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are held to be records of things </v>

1272
01:17:07.721 --> 01:17:08.830
<v Speaker 3>that have actually happened.</v>

1273
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:09.663
<v Speaker 3>So their history books on one level and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they talk about what will happen </v>

1274
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.190
<v Speaker 3>when they're obviously given to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prophesy,</v>

1275
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:17.323
<v Speaker 3>they are an indication of what will </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen if you believe God is talking to </v>

1276
01:17:20.811 --> 01:17:21.250
<v Speaker 3>you and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1277
01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:22.083
<v Speaker 3>and that's where the whole thing becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>so pathological from an intellectual </v>

1278
01:17:26.511 --> 01:17:28.190
<v Speaker 3>point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

1279
01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:31.330
<v Speaker 3>This is partly why I've spent so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>time studying nature.</v>

1280
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:32.383
<v Speaker 3>I mean in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the late 1900 and each of basically </v>

1281
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:35.803
<v Speaker 3>diagnosed Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that it had produced a </v>

1282
01:17:38.751 --> 01:17:43.751
<v Speaker 3>tremendous longing for the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was then used against the dogmatic</v>

1283
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:46.640
<v Speaker 3>elements of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is destroyed.</v>

1284
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.400
<v Speaker 3>But some of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say some of it is,</v>

1285
01:17:49.401 --> 01:17:53.780
<v Speaker 3>is intense philosophical confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a kind of,</v>

1286
01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.003
<v Speaker 3>let's call it wisdom in fiction if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to call it truth because you </v>

1287
01:17:58.701 --> 01:18:01.790
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously calling it truth brings up the</v>

1288
01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:03.170
<v Speaker 3>fact issue.</v>

1289
01:18:03.650 --> 01:18:08.150
<v Speaker 3>Let's call it wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wisdom is clearly there,</v>

1290
01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.073
<v Speaker 3>but to consider it as a representation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the factual world is not only a </v>

1291
01:18:12.141 --> 01:18:16.220
<v Speaker 3>mistake but also a dangerous mistake and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a self defeating mistake.</v>

1292
01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:17.381
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1293
01:18:17.381 --> 01:18:18.214
<v Speaker 3>it's partly why the fundamentalists who </v>
<v Speaker 3>insist upon the equivalents of the </v>

1294
01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:27.440
<v Speaker 3>stories in Genesis and scientific theory</v>
<v Speaker 3>do their own creed,</v>

1295
01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:28.274
<v Speaker 3>a tremendous disservice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there they're bound to lose because </v>

1296
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.690
<v Speaker 3>the Bible as science is weak and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sciences,</v>

1297
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:39.700
<v Speaker 3>science is strong and so there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no hope there for people who are</v>

1298
01:18:40.011 --> 01:18:43.460
<v Speaker 3>trying to push fundamentalist Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories as literally true.</v>

1299
01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.450
<v Speaker 3>So we can agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm trying to do,</v>

1300
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:50.840
<v Speaker 3>while I would say what I'm trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with mythological languages,</v>

1301
01:18:50.841 --> 01:18:54.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to raise my father out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>belly of the beast,</v>

1302
01:18:54.141 --> 01:18:54.974
<v Speaker 3>out of the belly of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It in the depths of the ocean because </v>

1303
01:18:57.741 --> 01:19:00.800
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's living truth in our traditions.</v>

1304
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:06.080
<v Speaker 3>Obscured is that is by human ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 3>and inability to conceive.</v>

1305
01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Even that doesn't mean that it can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>left behind.</v>

1306
01:19:09.201 --> 01:19:12.140
<v Speaker 3>It can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be brought forward and updated</v>

1307
01:19:12.141 --> 01:19:15.200
<v Speaker 3>and give a new site,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way is exactly what happens</v>

1308
01:19:15.201 --> 01:19:20.201
<v Speaker 3>in the Egyptian stories because horace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I have attention goes down into the</v>

1309
01:19:20.271 --> 01:19:23.210
<v Speaker 3>underworld and rescues the god of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition.</v>

1310
01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:24.373
<v Speaker 3>Oh Cyrus and gives him sight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what I'm trying to </v>

1311
01:19:27.591 --> 01:19:30.140
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think I've been successful at it.</v>

1312
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:31.663
<v Speaker 3>And so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the interpretation problem is a major </v>

1313
01:19:34.401 --> 01:19:35.234
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's something that would be </v>

1314
01:19:35.691 --> 01:19:38.030
<v Speaker 3>devil's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely everything.</v>

1315
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:40.760
<v Speaker 3>The other issue here though is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1316
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.060
<v Speaker 3>this is another thing that puts religion</v>
<v Speaker 3>in general,</v>

1317
01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:50.080
<v Speaker 3>an uneasy relationship with science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a radical provincialism entailed</v>

1318
01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:52.970
<v Speaker 3>in endorsing any specific religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for instance,</v>

1319
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
<v Speaker 3>if Christianity is right in any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then all other religions are wrong.</v>

1320
01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:01.800
<v Speaker 3>When you look at what Christianity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tail.</v>

1321
01:20:01.801 --> 01:20:05.450
<v Speaker 3>So at a minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it suggests that Jesus was the Messiah,</v>

1322
01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:07.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Jews are wrong.</v>

1323
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Jesus was divine and resurrected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Muslims are wrong.</v>

1324
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:15.180
<v Speaker 3>There's only one God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Hindus are wrong,</v>

1325
01:20:15.181 --> 01:20:16.014
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even if you want to relax the </v>

1326
01:20:16.951 --> 01:20:17.784
<v Speaker 3>literalism there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still sending some fairly sharp </v>

1327
01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 3>elbows toward the other religions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>

1328
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:24.840
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is again,</v>

1329
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:25.703
<v Speaker 3>I think to give the devil his dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is exactly the point that </v>

1330
01:20:29.371 --> 01:20:32.040
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists like Derrida have put </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1331
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:34.830
<v Speaker 3>have put forward and very powerfully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1332
01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:36.600
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

1333
01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:39.690
<v Speaker 3>if you accept a value system as </v>
<v Speaker 3>paramount,</v>

1334
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.633
<v Speaker 3>then you invalidate all other value </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems and you exclude everyone who </v>

1335
01:20:45.001 --> 01:20:48.900
<v Speaker 3>isn't succeeding in depth value system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And their answer is,</v>

1336
01:20:48.901 --> 01:20:49.734
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just dissolve all the value </v>

1337
01:20:51.301 --> 01:20:54.060
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a completely insane answered</v>

1338
01:20:54.061 --> 01:20:54.894
<v Speaker 3>because you can't even focus on an </v>
<v Speaker 3>object in the absence of a value system </v>

1339
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.000
<v Speaker 3>technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're always focusing on things</v>

1340
01:21:03.001 --> 01:21:03.834
<v Speaker 3>of value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1341
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:09.350
<v Speaker 3>And so the fact that the conflict that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you described is an emergent consequence</v>

1342
01:21:09.811 --> 01:21:14.280
<v Speaker 3>of value systems is a terrible problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we don't know how to solve it.</v>

1343
01:21:14.281 --> 01:21:15.114
<v Speaker 3>Although I think the solution </v>
<v Speaker 3>paradoxically enough is actually </v>

1344
01:21:18.721 --> 01:21:19.554
<v Speaker 3>embedded to some degree in Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is because </v>

1345
01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Christianity makes the group's </v>
<v Speaker 3>subordinate to the individual.</v>

1346
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.863
<v Speaker 3>And it also hypothesizes that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest moral virtue that a person </v>

1347
01:21:32.941 --> 01:21:37.941
<v Speaker 3>should uphold is that of the truth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth speaks chaos into order in the</v>

1348
01:21:38.851 --> 01:21:43.851
<v Speaker 3>most beneficial possible way and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the fundamental ethical duty.</v>

1349
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:49.790
<v Speaker 3>But why make this a matter of allegiance</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Christianity?</v>

1350
01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:54.210
<v Speaker 3>Why not just take what is useful in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition?</v>

1351
01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:56.490
<v Speaker 3>You just mentioned Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1352
01:21:56.491 --> 01:21:57.324
<v Speaker 3>So you found some of his work useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no tradition of allegiance to </v>

1353
01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Nietzsche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

1354
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:04.933
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to worry about whether or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not you are sufficiently Nietzschean in </v>

1355
01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:10.980
<v Speaker 3>order to use his wisdom.</v>

1356
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:14.550
<v Speaker 3>You just take from him and so far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's useful,</v>

1357
01:22:14.551 --> 01:22:16.890
<v Speaker 3>why not do the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity?</v>

1358
01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:17.724
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why waste any time wondering whether or </v>

1359
01:22:20.281 --> 01:22:24.390
<v Speaker 3>not you are a Christian or telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you are or not?</v>

1360
01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.433
<v Speaker 3>Why not get out of the religion business</v>
<v Speaker 3>and use everything that is useful in </v>

1361
01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:31.044
<v Speaker 3>human culture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>However it comes to you in a way that's </v>

1362
01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:36.070
<v Speaker 3>nondenominational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1363
01:22:36.071 --> 01:22:38.970
<v Speaker 3>we thought could be achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be absolutely wonderful.</v>

1364
01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:39.804
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say the first problem with that </v>

1365
01:22:41.611 --> 01:22:42.444
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the historical problem with that is </v>

1366
01:22:44.311 --> 01:22:48.600
<v Speaker 3>that the kind of truth that have emerged</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of this lengthy,</v>

1367
01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.110
<v Speaker 3>mythological process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this lengthy,</v>

1368
01:22:52.111 --> 01:22:54.240
<v Speaker 3>imaginative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological process,</v>

1369
01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:58.530
<v Speaker 3>we're first encapsulated inside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories and the images.</v>

1370
01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.393
<v Speaker 3>They weren't articulated philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 3>or psychological truth out of the kind </v>

1371
01:23:03.841 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 3>that we're speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1372
01:23:06.221 --> 01:23:07.054
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think about this like the </v>

1373
01:23:07.901 --> 01:23:10.180
<v Speaker 3>relationship between Dostoyevsky and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicha.</v>

1374
01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:15.930
<v Speaker 3>So Dostoyevsky and nature were very </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar in many ways philosophically,</v>

1375
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:19.720
<v Speaker 3>but Dostoyevsky wasn't a philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a storyteller.</v>

1376
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Implicit in his stories was Nietzschean </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy.</v>

1377
01:23:23.171 --> 01:23:26.260
<v Speaker 3>Even though paradoxically enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dostoyevsky was a Christian.</v>

1378
01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:31.300
<v Speaker 3>The storyteller's get there before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophers and you know,</v>

1379
01:23:31.301 --> 01:23:33.880
<v Speaker 3>you're saying now that the philosophers </v>
<v Speaker 3>have got there,</v>

1380
01:23:33.881 --> 01:23:38.881
<v Speaker 3>maybe we don't have to pledge allegiance</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a canonical version of the story.</v>

1381
01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:41.440
<v Speaker 3>And that could be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1382
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:42.633
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partly nature criticized Christianity </v>

1383
01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:47.043
<v Speaker 3>for all the reasons that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticized Christianity or any other </v>

1384
01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:50.590
<v Speaker 3>creed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Devin,</v>

1385
01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:51.424
<v Speaker 3>a devastating manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although he was also extraordinarily </v>

1386
01:23:53.501 --> 01:23:57.220
<v Speaker 3>grateful to Christianity because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>believed it had disciplined the European</v>

1387
01:23:57.221 --> 01:24:01.300
<v Speaker 3>mind and that that period of discipline </v>
<v Speaker 3>was necessary.</v>

1388
01:24:01.301 --> 01:24:04.900
<v Speaker 3>A period where everything was </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpreted under the rubric of a single</v>

1389
01:24:04.901 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 3>interpretation because that taught </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentration.</v>

1390
01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:09.700
<v Speaker 3>But nature said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1391
01:24:09.701 --> 01:24:14.230
<v Speaker 3>now we're beyond that and we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to become gods of our own accord in</v>

1392
01:24:14.231 --> 01:24:16.480
<v Speaker 3>order to withstand the consequences.</v>

1393
01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:17.763
<v Speaker 3>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that turned out to be very problematic </v>

1394
01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:21.123
<v Speaker 3>for reasons that to also prophesied </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he said that the West would </v>

1395
01:24:23.891 --> 01:24:28.300
<v Speaker 3>degenerate both into nihilism and into </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism,</v>

1396
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:32.350
<v Speaker 3>and that millions of people would die as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a consequence of the death of God.</v>

1397
01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.940
<v Speaker 3>And that's Dostoyevsky prophesied </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same thing in the devils.</v>

1398
01:24:36.941 --> 01:24:41.941
<v Speaker 3>And it's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't believe that we can get past</v>

1399
01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:43.533
<v Speaker 3>the Scylla and Charybdis of nihilism and</v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism without going back to </v>

1400
01:24:47.711 --> 01:24:48.544
<v Speaker 3>the past to find what it has to offer us</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring it forward in an articulated </v>

1401
01:24:53.111 --> 01:24:54.220
<v Speaker 3>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

1402
01:24:54.221 --> 01:24:55.054
<v Speaker 3>that's precisely why I think the </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion that I'm having with you is </v>

1403
01:24:57.491 --> 01:24:59.890
<v Speaker 3>important because I think that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing,</v>

1404
01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:00.993
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are two ways of going back to </v>

1405
01:25:02.951 --> 01:25:05.140
<v Speaker 3>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You exemplify both of them.</v>

1406
01:25:05.141 --> 01:25:09.570
<v Speaker 3>You are going back talking about people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like nature,</v>

1407
01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1408
01:25:10.210 --> 01:25:15.210
<v Speaker 3>And you can throw the rest of philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and world literature into that Bin,</v>

1409
01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:21.150
<v Speaker 3>but then it sounds like you are also </v>
<v Speaker 3>tempted to go back in what appears to be</v>

1410
01:25:21.731 --> 01:25:25.630
<v Speaker 3>a different category of effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the religious one,</v>

1411
01:25:25.631 --> 01:25:28.360
<v Speaker 3>which is at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're holding to one side,</v>

1412
01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:29.553
<v Speaker 3>certain arguably fiction writers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophers as being something other </v>

1413
01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:36.393
<v Speaker 3>than fiction writers and philosophers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and treating certain texts as something </v>

1414
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:43.420
<v Speaker 3>other than mere products of the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

1415
01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.820
<v Speaker 3>And you have a lot of company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1416
01:25:45.821 --> 01:25:47.710
<v Speaker 3>This is what every religious person </v>
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>

1417
01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:52.740
<v Speaker 3>but why not treat Jesus the same way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would treat socrates?</v>

1418
01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

1419
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.233
<v Speaker 3>that's a good start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that socrates and Jesus had an </v>

1420
01:25:57.311 --> 01:25:58.144
<v Speaker 3>awful lot in common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing about socrates is that </v>

1421
01:26:00.341 --> 01:26:01.174
<v Speaker 3>he's primarily a historical figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas Christ may have been a </v>

1422
01:26:04.521 --> 01:26:05.354
<v Speaker 3>historical figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the simplest assumption is </v>

1423
01:26:07.671 --> 01:26:11.120
<v Speaker 3>that someone of that description </v>
<v Speaker 3>existed,</v>

1424
01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:12.613
<v Speaker 3>but he's also a mythological character </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the mythologies unbelievably deep </v>

1425
01:26:17.031 --> 01:26:17.864
<v Speaker 3>and what it is in some sense is it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the human imagination is attempt to </v>

1426
01:26:22.191 --> 01:26:25.220
<v Speaker 3>construct a representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect man.</v>

1427
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:29.510
<v Speaker 3>And so Christ is the perfect map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1428
01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:30.261
<v Speaker 3>you may say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1429
01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:31.094
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say that Jesus was the perfect </v>

1430
01:26:35.091 --> 01:26:37.370
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say that.</v>

1431
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that Christ is the perfect man,</v>

1432
01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:44.600
<v Speaker 3>that it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm speaking at the mythological</v>

1433
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:45.434
<v Speaker 3>level is that whatever human beings can </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine as perfect in terms of the </v>

1434
01:26:52.161 --> 01:26:54.770
<v Speaker 3>manner in which an individual could </v>
<v Speaker 3>conduct himself,</v>

1435
01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:56.233
<v Speaker 3>acts would Christ represents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not claiming for a moment that that </v>

1436
01:26:59.421 --> 01:27:03.260
<v Speaker 3>manifested itself in history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a different claim and we can talk</v>

1437
01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:04.094
<v Speaker 3>about that claim to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would say it didn't even manifest </v>

1438
01:27:06.861 --> 01:27:07.694
<v Speaker 3>itself in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to write a story about </v>

1439
01:27:11.181 --> 01:27:14.450
<v Speaker 3>the perfect man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fiction of the perfect man,</v>

1440
01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:18.080
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't write it the way the New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Testament is written.</v>

1441
01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:23.230
<v Speaker 3>And you would get Jesus to do things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he didn't do and not do things that</v>

1442
01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:24.374
<v Speaker 3>he did do.</v>

1443
01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.810
<v Speaker 3>And he would say things that he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>

1444
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.600
<v Speaker 3>He can get a lot more perfect than what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see.</v>

1445
01:27:29.601 --> 01:27:31.220
<v Speaker 3>And in Matthew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mark,</v>

1446
01:27:31.221 --> 01:27:32.054
<v Speaker 3>Luke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and John.</v>

1447
01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:33.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let,</v>

1448
01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:35.720
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you why briefly,</v>

1449
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:38.330
<v Speaker 3>why that story's architect will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>

1450
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:40.131
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1451
01:27:40.131 --> 01:27:40.964
<v Speaker 3>so here's the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because as has been agreed upon by </v>

1452
01:27:44.451 --> 01:27:45.284
<v Speaker 3>the sages of the ages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say the fundamental reality of </v>

1453
01:27:48.351 --> 01:27:50.960
<v Speaker 3>life is suffering and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and finitude.</v>

1454
01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:56.320
<v Speaker 3>And you can layer on top of that from an</v>
<v Speaker 3>existential perspective,</v>

1455
01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.960
<v Speaker 3>malevolence and injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the law of human beings.</v>

1456
01:28:02.481 --> 01:28:05.960
<v Speaker 3>And so here's an archetypal story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most perfect,</v>

1457
01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:11.740
<v Speaker 3>innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sinless person possible is betrayed by</v>

1458
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:16.790
<v Speaker 3>his friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his countrymen,</v>

1459
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:19.303
<v Speaker 3>and the foreigners simultaneously for no</v>
<v Speaker 3>crime whatsoever in the most torturous </v>

1460
01:28:25.521 --> 01:28:26.354
<v Speaker 3>possible way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also abandoned by the creator of </v>

1461
01:28:29.931 --> 01:28:34.190
<v Speaker 3>being himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he accepts that all voluntarily.</v>

1462
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:36.133
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason it's an archetypal story is </v>

1463
01:28:37.461 --> 01:28:40.900
<v Speaker 3>because you can't get beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see it,</v>

1464
01:28:40.901 --> 01:28:44.330
<v Speaker 3>it hits a limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the limit of tragedy.</v>

1465
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:49.250
<v Speaker 3>And so that's where the perfection lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the issue is,</v>

1466
01:28:49.251 --> 01:28:50.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

1467
01:28:50.571 --> 01:28:51.404
<v Speaker 3>And here's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can go incrementally here because I </v>

1468
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:57.500
<v Speaker 3>don't even buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the limit of tragedy.</v>

1469
01:28:57.501 --> 01:28:58.041
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1470
01:28:58.041 --> 01:29:01.160
<v Speaker 3>the thing is anchored to a belief in</v>

1471
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.333
<v Speaker 2>human sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what is so weird about </v>

1472
01:29:04.681 --> 01:29:05.514
<v Speaker 2>Christianity from my point of view is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is not a religion that </v>

1473
01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:11.750
<v Speaker 2>disavows human sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a religion.</v>

1474
01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:16.210
<v Speaker 2>It claims that human sacrifice is real </v>
<v Speaker 2>and important,</v>

1475
01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:20.170
<v Speaker 2>but there was only one that was in fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary and effective,</v>

1476
01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.060
<v Speaker 2>and that is the sacrifice of Jesus.</v>

1477
01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:23.133
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the Protestant and the Catholic </v>

1478
01:29:24.251 --> 01:29:25.084
<v Speaker 5>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not so clear with the Orthodox </v>

1479
01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:28.083
<v Speaker 5>Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't really,</v>

1480
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.153
<v Speaker 5>they by the aversion of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's more and stress is more each </v>

1481
01:29:32.861 --> 01:29:36.070
<v Speaker 5>individual's moral obligation to do the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same thing.</v>

1482
01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief to dispute that,</v>

1483
01:29:39.131 --> 01:29:39.964
<v Speaker 2>but most western Christians have </v>
<v Speaker 2>unacknowledged at the core of their </v>

1484
01:29:43.741 --> 01:29:44.574
<v Speaker 2>belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this assertion of the validity of human </v>

1485
01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:49.110
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1486
01:29:49.111 --> 01:29:50.430
<v Speaker 2>which is insanity.</v>

1487
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:52.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did the sat.</v>

1488
01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:55.560
<v Speaker 5>If you think about sacrifice in the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we talked about it</v>

1489
01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.140
<v Speaker 2>early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way it's thought about.</v>

1490
01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Even in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had to die for our sins,</v>

1491
01:30:03.321 --> 01:30:04.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the scapegoat.</v>

1492
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:07.490
<v Speaker 2>He is the only effective scape goat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a hero.</v>

1493
01:30:07.491 --> 01:30:11.130
<v Speaker 2>He's perfect in your terms because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>took this on voluntarily.</v>

1494
01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.500
<v Speaker 2>We need to go back to what you were just</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

1495
01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:16.240
<v Speaker 2>This is not the ultimate tragedy because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did take it on voluntarily.</v>

1496
01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:20.500
<v Speaker 2>It's more tragic if someone really get </v>
<v Speaker 2>screwed by the cosmos.</v>

1497
01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're right about that.</v>

1498
01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:23.770
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the part,</v>

1499
01:30:23.771 --> 01:30:24.604
<v Speaker 5>the fact that he took on voluntarily is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually the part of this story that </v>

1500
01:30:28.561 --> 01:30:31.440
<v Speaker 5>involves the transcendence of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>tragedy.</v>

1501
01:30:31.870 --> 01:30:32.691
<v Speaker 5>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1502
01:30:32.691 --> 01:30:35.470
<v Speaker 5>the story there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is a very old story,</v>

1503
01:30:35.471 --> 01:30:40.240
<v Speaker 5>it's far older than Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The story is that the best way to,</v>

1504
01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.593
<v Speaker 5>to transcend the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bitterness of life is to accept it </v>

1505
01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.540
<v Speaker 5>completely.</v>

1506
01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1507
01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:50.420
<v Speaker 5>Including including betrayal at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands of your friends,</v>

1508
01:30:50.421 --> 01:30:53.030
<v Speaker 5>including betrayal at the hands of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>countrymen and,</v>

1509
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:57.970
<v Speaker 5>and the foreigners to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to allow that to be acceptable,</v>

1510
01:30:57.971 --> 01:30:58.804
<v Speaker 5>to take it on voluntarily and not to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>bitter about it like cain cause you get </v>

1511
01:31:02.981 --> 01:31:04.420
<v Speaker 5>murderous when you're bitter.</v>

1512
01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:05.483
<v Speaker 2>So I can go with you there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now if that is what you find </v>

1513
01:31:08.181 --> 01:31:12.420
<v Speaker 2>compelling in this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could just offer for your examination.</v>

1514
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another story,</v>

1515
01:31:14.721 --> 01:31:15.554
<v Speaker 2>another tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in its details is basically </v>

1516
01:31:18.751 --> 01:31:22.080
<v Speaker 2>irreconcilable with Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also well subscribed.</v>

1517
01:31:22.090 --> 01:31:24.270
<v Speaker 2>It's the Buddha and Buddhism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1518
01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:26.760
<v Speaker 2>The Buddha is another example of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect man.</v>

1519
01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:28.143
<v Speaker 2>He does give you a similar rationale to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the one you just gave for radical </v>

1520
01:31:32.751 --> 01:31:37.751
<v Speaker 2>acceptance of the vicissitudes of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet he's far more articulate.</v>

1521
01:31:39.221 --> 01:31:40.054
<v Speaker 2>I'm here now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about the historical </v>

1522
01:31:40.811 --> 01:31:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Buddha who predated Jesus by five </v>
<v Speaker 2>centuries,</v>

1523
01:31:44.431 --> 01:31:49.431
<v Speaker 2>but who seems to have said much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is psychologically perspicacious.</v>

1524
01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:54.230
<v Speaker 2>And he talks exactly on that point about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of acceptance,</v>

1525
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:57.040
<v Speaker 2>what psychologically is accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do,</v>

1526
01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.233
<v Speaker 2>except your experience to moment and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>barriers to doing that and the way in </v>

1527
01:32:02.821 --> 01:32:04.110
<v Speaker 2>which you should structure your life.</v>

1528
01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.350
<v Speaker 2>So as to be able to do that more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more moment by moment.</v>

1529
01:32:07.351 --> 01:32:12.351
<v Speaker 2>And he presented a methodology of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation that is even today,</v>

1530
01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:15.440
<v Speaker 2>almost perfectly designed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to talk about the oldest</v>

1531
01:32:15.441 --> 01:32:17.300
<v Speaker 2>tradition of Buddhism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Teravata,</v>

1532
01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:22.770
<v Speaker 2>it's almost perfectly designed for </v>
<v Speaker 2>export into a secular context.</v>

1533
01:32:23.011 --> 01:32:23.844
<v Speaker 2>So you can take whole sections of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pali Canon and if you just filter out </v>

1534
01:32:28.201 --> 01:32:29.034
<v Speaker 2>some of the needless repetition and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the phrasiology that treats the </v>

1535
01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Buddha like the perfect world conquering</v>
<v Speaker 2>hero who Buddhists believe him to be and</v>

1536
01:32:36.861 --> 01:32:37.694
<v Speaker 2>you just look at what is being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost a perfectly secular recipe </v>

1537
01:32:41.811 --> 01:32:42.644
<v Speaker 2>for training your mind in essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 2>course of growth toward the kind of </v>

1538
01:32:47.231 --> 01:32:49.400
<v Speaker 2>acceptance you are talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1539
01:32:49.401 --> 01:32:50.234
<v Speaker 2>I'm not urging you to be a Buddhist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying this is an example that </v>

1540
01:32:53.611 --> 01:32:58.611
<v Speaker 2>is non Christian that does much of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are claiming Christianity</v>

1541
01:32:59.290 --> 01:32:59.690
<v Speaker 5>perhaps</v>

1542
01:32:59.690 --> 01:33:00.523
<v Speaker 2>uniquely does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It invites a non mythological </v>

1543
01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:04.380
<v Speaker 2>relationship to it.</v>

1544
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:05.583
<v Speaker 5>Well only if you strip the methodology </v>
<v Speaker 5>away from it and I think actually that </v>

1545
01:33:09.531 --> 01:33:10.364
<v Speaker 5>you make a mistake with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A person makes a mistake with Buddhism </v>

1546
01:33:13.101 --> 01:33:14.310
<v Speaker 5>if they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see,</v>

1547
01:33:14.311 --> 01:33:15.144
<v Speaker 5>because there's also a longing for </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious experience that's part of the </v>

1548
01:33:17.971 --> 01:33:18.804
<v Speaker 5>human soul and for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why people smoke marijuana and </v>

1549
01:33:22.261 --> 01:33:23.940
<v Speaker 5>why they take psychedelic drugs</v>

1550
01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:25.660
<v Speaker 2>and why they meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1551
01:33:25.661 --> 01:33:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I argue in my book,</v>

1552
01:33:28.001 --> 01:33:28.834
<v Speaker 2>Waking Up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have the most esoteric </v>

1553
01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:31.504
<v Speaker 2>experiences are classically interpreted </v>
<v Speaker 2>as religious or mystical or spiritual </v>

1554
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:38.083
<v Speaker 2>without believing anything on </v>
<v Speaker 2>insufficient evidence and certainly </v>

1555
01:33:40.521 --> 01:33:44.790
<v Speaker 2>without structuring your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your interpretation of these experiences</v>

1556
01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.793
<v Speaker 2>along classically a religious dogmatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines or even Joseph Cam bellion </v>

1557
01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:51.083
<v Speaker 2>mythological lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can essentially be a scientist of </v>

1558
01:33:53.731 --> 01:33:56.500
<v Speaker 2>introspection and you can use drugs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1559
01:33:56.501 --> 01:33:57.334
<v Speaker 2>You can use new technology to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can use ancient techniques of </v>

1560
01:34:00.001 --> 01:34:00.834
<v Speaker 2>meditation to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could even do something which is </v>

1561
01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:09.260
<v Speaker 2>seems to partake of delusional thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To do that and just notice the outcome.</v>

1562
01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are practices like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tibetan Buddhism,</v>

1563
01:34:12.471 --> 01:34:16.700
<v Speaker 2>there's something called Deity practice </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you imagine yourself to be a deity</v>

1564
01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:21.820
<v Speaker 2>or a Bodhisattva and the practice of </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagining yourself to be that is not the</v>

1565
01:34:22.091 --> 01:34:25.450
<v Speaker 2>same thing as becoming delusional and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking you are that</v>

1566
01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:29.550
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly the same thing as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mystical imitation of Christ.</v>

1567
01:34:29.551 --> 01:34:30.990
<v Speaker 5>It's exactly the same idea.</v>

1568
01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.620
<v Speaker 2>So you could do that with Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do it with Batman.</v>

1569
01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:34.633
<v Speaker 2>You could say to someone who's shy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't like to go to parties </v>

1570
01:34:36.981 --> 01:34:37.814
<v Speaker 2>because they just don't like each </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsequent encounter with a stranger </v>

1571
01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:41.774
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they have to overcome their </v>

1572
01:34:42.891 --> 01:34:43.724
<v Speaker 2>shyness and their inability to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>small talk and all the rest of shyness </v>

1573
01:34:46.321 --> 01:34:49.560
<v Speaker 2>is a psychological problem that </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually everyone has to some degree or</v>

1574
01:34:49.561 --> 01:34:53.710
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps one way to overcome it is to</v>

1575
01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:58.711
<v Speaker 2>walk into a party just trying on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that you are Batman,</v>

1576
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you're Bruce Wayne,</v>

1577
01:35:02.261 --> 01:35:03.094
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you have this all of these secret </v>

1578
01:35:03.971 --> 01:35:08.971
<v Speaker 2>abilities or your Jason Bourne or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful character who</v>

1579
01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:10.810
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly it</v>

1580
01:35:10.890 --> 01:35:13.560
<v Speaker 2>is capable of great things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know as a total fiction.</v>

1581
01:35:13.561 --> 01:35:16.080
<v Speaker 2>So now does that have any psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence?</v>

1582
01:35:16.081 --> 01:35:17.580
<v Speaker 2>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1583
01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:18.723
<v Speaker 2>I think there's no question can have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological consequences and can be </v>

1584
01:35:21.761 --> 01:35:22.594
<v Speaker 2>useful to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crucial thing there is that you can </v>

1585
01:35:25.071 --> 01:35:28.540
<v Speaker 2>play with those kind of Schema without </v>
<v Speaker 2>diluting yourself.</v>

1586
01:35:28.570 --> 01:35:29.403
<v Speaker 2>Like if at any point in that adventure </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone tapped you on the shoulder and </v>

1587
01:35:33.811 --> 01:35:36.300
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you really think you are Batman?</v>

1588
01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:38.030
<v Speaker 2>You would say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1589
01:35:38.031 --> 01:35:41.660
<v Speaker 2>the problem is when you meet the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>really thinks he's Batman,</v>

1590
01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:46.020
<v Speaker 2>that's where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cross over into dangerously divisive</v>

1591
01:35:46.021 --> 01:35:49.560
<v Speaker 2>and unsupported ideas about the nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>of reality and religion.</v>

1592
01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.190
<v Speaker 2>It's really the only game in town when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to dignify those ideas,</v>

1593
01:35:54.191 --> 01:35:57.640
<v Speaker 2>generation after generation and protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>them from criticism.</v>

1594
01:35:57.641 --> 01:36:01.700
<v Speaker 2>That's why the scientific attitude of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking honestly about facts,</v>

1595
01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:06.430
<v Speaker 2>heaps smashing into religion uniquely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't smash into fiction,</v>

1596
01:36:06.710 --> 01:36:10.090
<v Speaker 2>doesn't smash into Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It smashes into Jesus,</v>

1597
01:36:10.091 --> 01:36:10.924
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of what most people are doing </v>

1598
01:36:12.011 --> 01:36:12.844
<v Speaker 2>with Jesus.</v>

1599
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.580
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1600
01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:14.660
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so right,</v>

1601
01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:17.710
<v Speaker 5>no arguments there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me,</v>

1602
01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:18.660
<v Speaker 5>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1603
01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.520
<v Speaker 5>all for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1604
01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.440
<v Speaker 5>an elaboration of your idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's say no kid wants to be Batman.</v>

1605
01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:26.513
<v Speaker 5>While that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's why he's reading the </v>

1606
01:36:27.571 --> 01:36:32.040
<v Speaker 5>comics and that's why he's going to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>billion dollar marvel movies that are DC</v>

1607
01:36:32.041 --> 01:36:35.130
<v Speaker 5>movies that portray these superheroes </v>
<v Speaker 5>out on the screen.</v>

1608
01:36:35.131 --> 01:36:40.131
<v Speaker 5>It's because the kid is acting them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagination is trying on an ideal.</v>

1609
01:36:41.210 --> 01:36:42.050
<v Speaker 5>So let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1610
01:36:42.051 --> 01:36:44.720
<v Speaker 5>maybe you start with a pro wrestler </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're,</v>

1611
01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:45.733
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not that conceptually </v>

1612
01:36:46.311 --> 01:36:47.144
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then maybe you move to Batman and </v>

1613
01:36:49.071 --> 01:36:49.904
<v Speaker 5>then maybe move from Batman to thor in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the marvel cartoons and narrow you're </v>

1614
01:36:54.831 --> 01:36:55.664
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in the domain of quats </v>

1615
01:36:57.051 --> 01:36:59.060
<v Speaker 5>identities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then maybe you get a little bit more</v>

1616
01:36:59.061 --> 01:36:59.894
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated than that and you try on </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus or Buddha and then you ask </v>

1617
01:37:04.011 --> 01:37:04.611
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1618
01:37:04.611 --> 01:37:07.880
<v Speaker 5>what would happen to the world if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>tried those on completely?</v>

1619
01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:12.990
<v Speaker 5>And that's the real question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's where the historical element</v>

1620
01:37:12.991 --> 01:37:13.824
<v Speaker 5>and the mythological element meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's obviously a hierarchy of </v>

1621
01:37:16.811 --> 01:37:17.644
<v Speaker 5>rank among individuals and some people </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a much more positive impact on the </v>

1622
01:37:21.011 --> 01:37:24.070
<v Speaker 5>world through their actions than others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's an,</v>

1623
01:37:24.190 --> 01:37:27.070
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some hypothetical ultimate limit</v>

1624
01:37:27.071 --> 01:37:27.904
<v Speaker 5>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were the best person you could </v>

1625
01:37:29.761 --> 01:37:30.594
<v Speaker 5>possibly be in every possible way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just exactly how much good could you </v>

1626
01:37:34.261 --> 01:37:35.094
<v Speaker 5>bring into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And at what point would you be a bought </v>

1627
01:37:37.311 --> 01:37:38.144
<v Speaker 5>of sap?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>

1628
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:41.250
<v Speaker 5>that's something Buddhist sask </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves all the time.</v>

1629
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:43.950
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you be an incarnation of Christ?</v>

1630
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:48.710
<v Speaker 5>Something that isn't just mythological </v>
<v Speaker 5>or imaginative or delusional.</v>

1631
01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:52.790
<v Speaker 5>It's a partial because if the ideal </v>
<v Speaker 5>recedes as you approach it,</v>

1632
01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:57.680
<v Speaker 5>but there's a reality underneath which </v>
<v Speaker 5>is better,</v>

1633
01:37:57.681 --> 01:38:00.470
<v Speaker 5>people are better and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are worse.</v>

1634
01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:02.830
<v Speaker 5>And there's archetipal limits to both of</v>
<v Speaker 5>those.</v>

1635
01:38:03.850 --> 01:38:06.840
<v Speaker 5>So these are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are very complicated things.</v>

1636
01:38:06.841 --> 01:38:07.870
<v Speaker 5>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1637
01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:08.713
<v Speaker 5>they're fiction in the sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I would think about the more as </v>

1638
01:38:10.571 --> 01:38:12.270
<v Speaker 5>metaphysician there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1639
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:13.143
<v Speaker 5>what happens when you distill fiction </v>
<v Speaker 5>into whatever centrally true about </v>

1640
01:38:16.631 --> 01:38:18.610
<v Speaker 5>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's really,</v>

1641
01:38:18.611 --> 01:38:19.690
<v Speaker 5>really true.</v>

1642
01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would grant you,</v>

1643
01:38:21.021 --> 01:38:23.130
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the topic of my book,</v>

1644
01:38:23.131 --> 01:38:23.964
<v Speaker 2>Waking Up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are possibilities on the </v>

1645
01:38:26.371 --> 01:38:27.204
<v Speaker 2>positive end of human psychology that </v>
<v Speaker 2>very few people actualize for any </v>

1646
01:38:31.261 --> 01:38:32.094
<v Speaker 2>significant amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people glimpse them in their best </v>

1647
01:38:35.181 --> 01:38:38.330
<v Speaker 2>moments in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have peak experiences,</v>

1648
01:38:38.331 --> 01:38:40.400
<v Speaker 2>whether on drugs or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1649
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:41.263
<v Speaker 2>after some crisis or they've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting or they have moments where they </v>

1650
01:38:44.901 --> 01:38:45.734
<v Speaker 2>feel as good as they have ever felt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They feel as in touch as they ever will </v>

1651
01:38:52.171 --> 01:38:53.004
<v Speaker 2>with just the sheer profundity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>slamming into the present moment and </v>

1652
01:38:57.471 --> 01:39:01.280
<v Speaker 2>finding it totally captivating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>worthy of their attention.</v>

1653
01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:03.310
<v Speaker 2>They're not looking elsewhere for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1654
01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:04.453
<v Speaker 2>They have become identical to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling of being and found it to be in </v>

1655
01:39:10.571 --> 01:39:12.280
<v Speaker 2>some basic sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

1656
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:13.423
<v Speaker 2>Now that's available to us as human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings and there's not much of a </v>

1657
01:39:17.931 --> 01:39:20.690
<v Speaker 2>scientific story to tell about it at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

1658
01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:26.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not arrived at by understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>more about the universe scientifically,</v>

1659
01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:30.400
<v Speaker 2>so it is in some sense orthogonal to all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of science,</v>

1660
01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:31.020
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1661
01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:31.310
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1662
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:35.090
<v Speaker 2>My point is that it doesn't require </v>
<v Speaker 2>delusion either.</v>

1663
01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:38.420
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't require belief in anything on</v>
<v Speaker 2>insufficient evidence.</v>

1664
01:39:38.421 --> 01:39:42.290
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't require that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe certain books were revealed by</v>

1665
01:39:42.291 --> 01:39:44.120
<v Speaker 2>the creator of the universe and others </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't.</v>

1666
01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:45.093
<v Speaker 2>You can get rid of 90% of what people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing in the name of religion and </v>

1667
01:39:51.281 --> 01:39:55.480
<v Speaker 2>spirituality and mysticism and still </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1668
01:39:55.670 --> 01:39:56.503
<v Speaker 2>This project captivating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 10% that you retained perhaps is </v>

1669
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:01.783
<v Speaker 2>when you hear these stories about people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Buddha and Jesus and all of the </v>

1670
01:40:05.581 --> 01:40:08.370
<v Speaker 2>people who have made heroic efforts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like them.</v>

1671
01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Historically Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contemplative and Buddhist monks and all</v>

1672
01:40:12.901 --> 01:40:13.734
<v Speaker 2>the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can find in the biographies and </v>

1673
01:40:16.821 --> 01:40:17.654
<v Speaker 2>pseudo biographies of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some evidence that transforming the </v>

1674
01:40:21.501 --> 01:40:22.334
<v Speaker 2>human mind as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can find that evidence in your </v>

1675
01:40:24.581 --> 01:40:26.830
<v Speaker 2>own life if you have the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

1676
01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.940
<v Speaker 2>And you can see that human consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>is perturbed,</v>

1677
01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:30.774
<v Speaker 2>bubble and plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you need not be who you were </v>

1678
01:40:33.531 --> 01:40:34.364
<v Speaker 2>yesterday.</v>

1679
01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:37.570
<v Speaker 2>And so when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming your best self or becoming more</v>

1680
01:40:37.571 --> 01:40:40.330
<v Speaker 2>and more like the best selves that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever existed,</v>

1681
01:40:40.710 --> 01:40:44.220
<v Speaker 2>are you talk about transcending the self</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself as an illusion,</v>

1682
01:40:44.221 --> 01:40:45.054
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this stuff is worth thinking </v>

1683
01:40:46.691 --> 01:40:49.180
<v Speaker 2>about and paying attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there is a there there.</v>

1684
01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:53.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doubting that for a second what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm insisting upon.</v>

1685
01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:53.993
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>

1686
01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:59.280
<v Speaker 2>We need never step off the razor's edge </v>
<v Speaker 2>of real honesty and conceptual integrity</v>

1687
01:41:02.630 --> 01:41:05.640
<v Speaker 2>even for a moment in order to walk in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that direction.</v>

1688
01:41:05.641 --> 01:41:07.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

1689
01:41:07.051 --> 01:41:07.884
<v Speaker 2>most new agers see no problem in </v>
<v Speaker 2>indulging any kind of happy talk about </v>

1690
01:41:11.711 --> 01:41:15.110
<v Speaker 2>the significance of crystals or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is they're connected to.</v>

1691
01:41:15.170 --> 01:41:19.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's where it becomes startlingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unscientific.</v>

1692
01:41:19.091 --> 01:41:19.924
<v Speaker 2>And that's where he's someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Deepak Chopra and I can't agree about </v>

1693
01:41:23.130 --> 01:41:25.790
<v Speaker 2>how talk about things because the moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>we start,</v>

1694
01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:27.450
<v Speaker 2>he hits me with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1695
01:41:27.451 --> 01:41:28.284
<v Speaker 2>you close your eyes and you feel at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the universe that proves that you </v>

1696
01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.210
<v Speaker 2>proceeded the Big Bang.</v>

1697
01:41:33.210 --> 01:41:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Your consciousness was there before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>big bang.</v>

1698
01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Now of course it proves nothing of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind.</v>

1699
01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:39.710
<v Speaker 2>That's where he becomes a pseudo </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>

1700
01:41:39.711 --> 01:41:43.100
<v Speaker 2>And so what I'm arguing for is that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>just remain attentive.</v>

1701
01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:44.423
<v Speaker 2>Two honest talk about what we know about</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality even while we have deep </v>

1702
01:41:50.411 --> 01:41:53.140
<v Speaker 2>experiences and seek them out by </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever means.</v>

1703
01:41:53.141 --> 01:41:53.974
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will grant you that there are means </v>

1704
01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:57.173
<v Speaker 2>what amount to a kind of internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>costume party where you can think in </v>

1705
01:42:00.491 --> 01:42:02.500
<v Speaker 2>terms of myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you said to me,</v>

1706
01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:03.533
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to think of the rest of your </v>

1707
01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:05.484
<v Speaker 2>day in terms of the hero archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing today to slay the </v>

1708
01:42:10.511 --> 01:42:14.410
<v Speaker 2>dragon and bring back that hoarded </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth to your community?</v>

1709
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:18.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a pattern of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no question.</v>

1710
01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Could have some utility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1711
01:42:20.190 --> 01:42:21.970
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what we were doing today.</v>

1712
01:42:21.971 --> 01:42:22.470
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1713
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:23.011
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1714
01:42:23.011 --> 01:42:28.011
<v Speaker 2>the crucial bit is that in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making claims to knowledge about</v>

1715
01:42:28.570 --> 01:42:32.040
<v Speaker 2>the ethereal existence of archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1716
01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:32.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Akashic record or collective </v>

1717
01:42:34.261 --> 01:42:35.094
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1718
01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:36.053
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making claims that kind at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order to find this way of thinking </v>

1719
01:42:39.931 --> 01:42:40.764
<v Speaker 2>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aligning myself with any </v>

1720
01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:43.733
<v Speaker 2>provincial tradition of mythmaking I e </v>
<v Speaker 2>or religion and claiming that my </v>

1721
01:42:48.891 --> 01:42:52.110
<v Speaker 2>religion is better than others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1722
01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we see every time we open the </v>

1723
01:42:53.851 --> 01:42:54.684
<v Speaker 2>newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a divisive game that we have to figure </v>

1724
01:42:56.491 --> 01:42:58.120
<v Speaker 2>out some way of unraveling.</v>

1725
01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.393
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We do and mean your emphasis on </v>

1726
01:43:01.081 --> 01:43:01.914
<v Speaker 5>clearheaded thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is part of the reason why I </v>

1727
01:43:04.021 --> 01:43:04.854
<v Speaker 5>wanted to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean certainly one of the things that </v>

1728
01:43:07.991 --> 01:43:11.570
<v Speaker 5>you demonstrated the first time we </v>
<v Speaker 5>talked was your capacity for clearheaded</v>

1729
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:12.540
<v Speaker 5>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're,</v>

1730
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:16.030
<v Speaker 5>you're crazily incisive and laser </v>
<v Speaker 5>focused and you know,</v>

1731
01:43:16.031 --> 01:43:16.864
<v Speaker 5>those are extraordinarily useful </v>
<v Speaker 5>attributes and that's partly why I </v>

1732
01:43:19.641 --> 01:43:22.340
<v Speaker 5>thought it would be so useful for us to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a conversation.</v>

1733
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:26.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm an advocate of critical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to get this right.</v>

1734
01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:32.300
<v Speaker 5>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the abandonment of all value structures,</v>

1735
01:43:32.301 --> 01:43:33.134
<v Speaker 5>which is say the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective isn't a way forward because </v>

1736
01:43:36.431 --> 01:43:39.190
<v Speaker 5>it leads to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it leads to a situation where people are</v>

1737
01:43:39.191 --> 01:43:43.550
<v Speaker 5>going to be unconsciously possessed by </v>
<v Speaker 5>far more foolish ideas.</v>

1738
01:43:43.551 --> 01:43:44.900
<v Speaker 5>Then they left behind them.</v>

1739
01:43:45.210 --> 01:43:46.043
<v Speaker 2>You're certainly not getting that in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not advocating that we abandoned </v>

1740
01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:51.770
<v Speaker 2>value structure is there the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the value</v>

1741
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.843
<v Speaker 3>that we should have in hand perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>before any other is the one you </v>

1742
01:43:56.361 --> 01:43:57.194
<v Speaker 3>referenced earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is honesty on every level because </v>

1743
01:44:00.471 --> 01:44:03.410
<v Speaker 3>it's the only thing when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about honest speech,</v>

1744
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:04.303
<v Speaker 3>it's the only thing that that allows us </v>
<v Speaker 3>to course correct collectively is the </v>

1745
01:44:07.671 --> 01:44:10.280
<v Speaker 3>only thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to lie to me,</v>

1746
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:14.930
<v Speaker 3>then you are denying me your view of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality and in so far as you have a view</v>

1747
01:44:14.931 --> 01:44:15.764
<v Speaker 3>that can be useful to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're now playing a game that is not at </v>

1748
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:21.680
<v Speaker 3>all optimized for course correction and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so as a,</v>

1749
01:44:21.681 --> 01:44:24.550
<v Speaker 3>as a society we need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where you are,</v>

1750
01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:27.410
<v Speaker 3>defensive free speech comes in and has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been so useful.</v>

1751
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:31.190
<v Speaker 3>We have to be committed to defending </v>
<v Speaker 3>free speech.</v>

1752
01:44:31.191 --> 01:44:32.024
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impolitic or unpopular or even wrong </v>

1753
01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:40.660
<v Speaker 3>because defending that is the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>barrier to in the limit violence because</v>

1754
01:44:42.111 --> 01:44:42.944
<v Speaker 3>the only way we can influence one </v>
<v Speaker 3>another short of physical violence is </v>

1755
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.160
<v Speaker 3>through speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through communicating ideas.</v>

1756
01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.830
<v Speaker 3>And the moment you say certain ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't be communicated,</v>

1757
01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:52.873
<v Speaker 3>you create a circumstance where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have no alternative but to go hands on </v>

1758
01:44:57.171 --> 01:44:57.951
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

1759
01:44:57.951 --> 01:44:58.784
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing in me that is echoing a </v>

1760
01:45:01.731 --> 01:45:02.564
<v Speaker 3>postmodern relinquishment of a sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are right and wrong answers </v>

1761
01:45:06.771 --> 01:45:07.604
<v Speaker 3>to the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that and I'm certainly not </v>

1762
01:45:09.861 --> 01:45:14.090
<v Speaker 3>assuming that you are in that camp or </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you think that way.</v>

1763
01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:17.390
<v Speaker 3>It's quite clear to me that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>say I'm getting tired.</v>

1764
01:45:17.391 --> 01:45:19.730
<v Speaker 3>I kind of to just say one more thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1765
01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:20.721
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With you.</v>

1766
01:45:20.721 --> 01:45:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to do with this course correction</v>

1767
01:45:24.261 --> 01:45:25.094
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to perhaps leave you with </v>

1768
01:45:26.751 --> 01:45:29.870
<v Speaker 3>another architectural idea that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>show on if you want.</v>

1769
01:45:29.871 --> 01:45:34.250
<v Speaker 3>So there's an idea that's paramount in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>

1770
01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:37.490
<v Speaker 3>which is a creed I understand better </v>
<v Speaker 3>than most,</v>

1771
01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:40.820
<v Speaker 3>mostly as a consequence of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>educational history.</v>

1772
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:41.703
<v Speaker 3>But the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a very weird idea and not in </v>

1773
01:45:44.001 --> 01:45:49.001
<v Speaker 3>that is that at the beginning of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>God spoke order out of chaos.</v>

1774
01:45:50.751 --> 01:45:51.584
<v Speaker 3>The chaos was like a potential and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the act of speaking truthfully </v>

1775
01:45:56.241 --> 01:45:57.074
<v Speaker 3>that brought forth the proper kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>order and that was the paradise will </v>

1776
01:46:00.081 --> 01:46:03.860
<v Speaker 3>order that Adam and eve in habit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's this deep idea lurking in</v>

1777
01:46:03.861 --> 01:46:04.694
<v Speaker 3>there that was drawn from many sources </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this spoken truth is what </v>

1778
01:46:08.031 --> 01:46:11.780
<v Speaker 3>transforms chaotic potential into </v>
<v Speaker 3>habitable orders.</v>

1779
01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:13.513
<v Speaker 3>And then weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened with that idea over the </v>

1780
01:46:16.221 --> 01:46:17.054
<v Speaker 3>period of about 3000 years as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity emerged from Judaism was </v>

1781
01:46:20.331 --> 01:46:21.164
<v Speaker 3>that by the time Christianity emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an insistence that Christ was </v>

1782
01:46:25.761 --> 01:46:26.594
<v Speaker 3>the word that God used at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 3>of time to extract habitable order from </v>

1783
01:46:31.461 --> 01:46:33.500
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea there,</v>

1784
01:46:33.501 --> 01:46:34.334
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the most brilliant ideas of </v>

1785
01:46:35.391 --> 01:46:36.224
<v Speaker 3>mankind is that by speaking the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've faced the chaos of potential and </v>

1786
01:46:42.921 --> 01:46:43.754
<v Speaker 3>bring forth the most benevolent possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>type of ordered combined with that </v>

1787
01:46:48.591 --> 01:46:50.470
<v Speaker 3>course that you're describing.</v>

1788
01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:53.420
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's the central idea of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the West.</v>

1789
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:55.243
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can find that idea echoed in other </v>

1790
01:46:57.010 --> 01:47:01.000
<v Speaker 5>areas like in Buddhism for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in other religions for that matter,</v>

1791
01:47:01.001 --> 01:47:01.834
<v Speaker 5>but I believe that it reached it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>highest in logistics development at </v>

1792
01:47:05.601 --> 01:47:06.434
<v Speaker 5>least as far as I can tell in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's also why we have societies </v>

1793
01:47:09.771 --> 01:47:14.771
<v Speaker 5>that are predicated on the sacredness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak of the spoken truth.</v>

1794
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:16.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question of why we value the spoken </v>

1795
01:47:19.891 --> 01:47:23.090
<v Speaker 2>truth to the degree that we do is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting one.</v>

1796
01:47:23.091 --> 01:47:25.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's largely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes it is.</v>

1797
01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.433
<v Speaker 2>It has as much to do with a reaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>against western religion by science and </v>

1798
01:47:30.861 --> 01:47:35.720
<v Speaker 2>philosophy as it does with anything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from western religion,</v>

1799
01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:37.760
<v Speaker 2>but I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1800
01:47:37.761 --> 01:47:38.594
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is something that is unraveling in </v>

1801
01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:42.633
<v Speaker 2>the strangest of places now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's in so far as you and I can make </v>

1802
01:47:46.041 --> 01:47:51.041
<v Speaker 2>common cause defending the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>protecting free speech across the board,</v>

1803
01:47:51.881 --> 01:47:54.210
<v Speaker 2>however unpopular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think practically speaking,</v>

1804
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:56.240
<v Speaker 2>that's an extraordinarily useful thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1805
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:57.223
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's the best way at the moment </v>

1806
01:47:58.431 --> 01:48:00.740
<v Speaker 5>that we can slay our respective dragons.</v>

1807
01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.293
<v Speaker 2>Well listen Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pleasure to talk to a second </v>

1808
01:48:04.601 --> 01:48:05.434
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope people found something of value </v>

1809
01:48:08.771 --> 01:48:09.604
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would never imagine we disagreed as </v>

1810
01:48:11.531 --> 01:48:12.364
<v Speaker 2>much as we did the first time around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you only heard this second </v>

1811
01:48:14.381 --> 01:48:15.214
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

1812
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:17.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well sometimes it's sometimes some,</v>

1813
01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:20.630
<v Speaker 5>some stupid persistence is useful and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1814
01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:24.050
<v Speaker 5>I think the rabbit hole we went down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was an interesting one.</v>

1815
01:48:24.051 --> 01:48:26.760
<v Speaker 5>Even though it was painful and perhaps</v>

1816
01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:28.010
<v Speaker 2>luck,</v>

1817
01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:31.070
<v Speaker 5>it was productive because it got us to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the second conversation.</v>

1818
01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:33.770
<v Speaker 5>Hurray for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like if you,</v>

1819
01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:34.730
<v Speaker 2>if you</v>

1820
01:48:34.730 --> 01:48:37.790
<v Speaker 5>feel inclined at some point to speak in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the future with me,</v>

1821
01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:40.690
<v Speaker 5>we'll see how people respond to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1822
01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:43.650
<v Speaker 5>I found the conversation very useful and</v>
<v Speaker 5>harrain for that.</v>

1823
01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well listen,</v>

1824
01:48:44.691 --> 01:48:48.860
<v Speaker 2>so I will invite people to respond yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>again as I did the first time.</v>

1825
01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:52.630
<v Speaker 2>I think you and I both pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

1826
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:53.743
<v Speaker 2>At least I pay attention to twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>really exclusively in terms of social </v>

1827
01:48:56.791 --> 01:48:57.920
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1828
01:48:57.921 --> 01:48:58.754
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much twitter is a good place to </v>

1829
01:48:59.991 --> 01:49:03.670
<v Speaker 2>make noise at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have these kinds of conversations for</v>

1830
01:49:03.671 --> 01:49:05.000
<v Speaker 2>you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1831
01:49:05.001 --> 01:49:07.460
<v Speaker 2>I said the first time around this you </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>

1832
01:49:07.461 --> 01:49:11.200
<v Speaker 2>where my most requested guest vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a factor of,</v>

1833
01:49:11.201 --> 01:49:12.034
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was remarkable how many people </v>

1834
01:49:14.250 --> 01:49:18.010
<v Speaker 2>wanted us to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've now done it a second time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of luck with your entanglements with </v>

1837
01:49:23.691 --> 01:49:27.130
<v Speaker 2>crazy bureaucracies and everything else </v>
<v Speaker 2>here doing because you're,</v>

1838
01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:28.163
<v Speaker 2>you are on the front lines of a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of culture war and it can't be </v>

1839
01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.193
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it must be stressful and I just </v>

<v Speaker 2>wish you the best with all of it.</v>
