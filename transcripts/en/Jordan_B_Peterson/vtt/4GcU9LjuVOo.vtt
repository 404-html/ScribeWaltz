1
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.003
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've lined up a very large number </v>

2
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>of questions today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of things.</v>

3
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a number of</v>

4
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.140
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos and podcasts lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One with Steven Pinker,</v>

5
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.263
<v Speaker 1>author of enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one was Warren Farrell who wrote a </v>

6
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:35.194
<v Speaker 1>very interesting book called the boy </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis and also a previous book called </v>

7
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>why men earn more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.830
<v Speaker 1>one with an animator named Nina Paley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.423
<v Speaker 1>one with a young guy named Charlie Kirk </v>
<v Speaker 1>who has organized a large number of </v>

10
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.113
<v Speaker 1>campus youth groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more on the conservative end of things </v>

11
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:57.814
<v Speaker 1>and associated with freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all those will be coming out in the </v>

12
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:02.471
<v Speaker 1>next month and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

13
00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And so thank you for your continued </v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

14
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>It makes all of this possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

15
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm also going on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume some of you know that if you </v>

16
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:16.210
<v Speaker 1>go to Jordan beat peterson.com and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look up events,</v>

17
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:19.630
<v Speaker 1>you can see where it's about 40 cities </v>
<v Speaker 1>listed so far.</v>

18
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are in us and a couple in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

19
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK.</v>

20
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're announcing we're going to </v>

21
00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:31.300
<v Speaker 1>announce 10 Canadian cities here in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next week as well.</v>

22
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.033
<v Speaker 1>So that's all what's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening with me in the next two </v>

23
00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll be on the road with my wife that</v>

24
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:42.520
<v Speaker 1>whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in a plane,</v>

25
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just commercial travel,</v>

26
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in a motorhome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on where we're going and how,</v>

27
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.510
<v Speaker 1>so I'm looking forward to seeing you if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you come out to the events.</v>

28
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.613
<v Speaker 1>I've been enjoying them quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to be able to talk to so many </v>

29
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.390
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

30
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.373
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life as sold about a </v>

31
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>million copies now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really quite something.</v>

32
00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:08.020
<v Speaker 1>And I think we've sold foreign rights in</v>
<v Speaker 1>43 countries,</v>

33
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.350
<v Speaker 1>so it'll come out in not quite that many</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

34
00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>but just about over the next year and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>

35
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.300
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

36
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.540
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

37
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.423
<v Speaker 1>let's get at it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully I could warm up and get my </v>

38
00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>brain going and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and answer some questions.</v>

39
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>343 people have voted this one up.</v>

40
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you please discuss freewill and </v>

41
00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris's and others' ideas of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>non nonexistence.</v>

42
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good complicated question </v>
<v Speaker 1>to kick things off.</v>

43
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>So I want to tell you a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to conceptualize freewill.</v>

44
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I think first because it's obvious that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have infinite free will are our</v>

45
00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our choices are constrained in all sorts</v>

46
00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:49.294
<v Speaker 1>of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason that </v>

47
00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:51.244
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a continual discussion about freewill </v>

48
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>and the philosophical and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical literature is because</v>

49
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>just conceptualizing the issue properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>is extraordinarily difficult.</v>

50
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>So I like to think about it at least in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

51
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>the way that you think about a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the game has rules.</v>

53
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>So if it's a chess game or a basketball </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

54
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>then there are things that you can do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things that you can't do.</v>

55
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.440
<v Speaker 1>And but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it,</v>

56
00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

57
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.433
<v Speaker 1>it's a closed world in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that there are things you </v>

58
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:28.384
<v Speaker 1>can't do when you play a game also seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>to open up a universe of possibilities </v>

59
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:32.704
<v Speaker 1>for things that you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So chess obviously constraints you to a </v>

60
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>board and to a certain number of men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a certain pattern of rules.</v>

61
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>But the strange thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when you put in those rules,</v>

62
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:44.644
<v Speaker 1>because rules sound like limits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sound always like things you can't </v>

63
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:47.794
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you set up a constrained world </v>

64
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>like that and you lay out a system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>

65
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>what you do is open up an infinity of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a near infinity of possibilities.</v>

66
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Same with music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:01.070
<v Speaker 1>music has rules obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

68
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>and if you follow the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can make an infinite variety of</v>

69
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:05.434
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

70
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a,</v>

71
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:08.884
<v Speaker 1>there's a very interesting dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to understand between </v>

72
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:12.664
<v Speaker 1>constraint and possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a deep idea that's </v>

73
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>associated with that that I read in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish commentary on,</v>

74
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 1>on the biblical stories that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a long time ago.</v>

75
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between God and man.</v>

76
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:30.660
<v Speaker 1>And the idea was that God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine,</v>

77
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:31.494
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being with the classical attributes of </v>

78
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>omniscience,</v>

79
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>omnipotence and omnipresence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all seeing,</v>

80
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 1>all knowing and all powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it being like that lack,</v>

81
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 1>and obviously the answer is nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

82
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:47.581
<v Speaker 1>Because by definition those three traits</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide for absence of limitation.</v>

83
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>But then that's exactly what's lacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>is limitation.</v>

84
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.950
<v Speaker 1>And there's some strange connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>between limitation and,</v>

85
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.843
<v Speaker 1>and I was saying say limitation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's rule governed as I mentioned </v>

86
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the opening up of possibility.</v>

87
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.610
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't necessarily the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>now determine determinism and limitation</v>

88
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:09.604
<v Speaker 1>aren't exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're analogous and they need to </v>

89
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 1>be discussed together.</v>

90
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.353
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now,</v>

91
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>so that's the first thing is that our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever our free choice is,</v>

92
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>it isn't limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's or it's limited.</v>

93
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>It's deeply limited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's another thing.</v>

94
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>If I take my arm and I go like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

95
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you see there's a movement like that</v>

96
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>and then my hand stopped just before my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my other hand.</v>

97
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.643
<v Speaker 1>Now it takes a certain amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the neural messages to go from my </v>

98
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 1>brain to my arm and back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the time it takes my hand to go like</v>

99
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 1>this and stop is actually shorter than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time it takes a message to get to my</v>

100
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>brain and back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that when I,</v>

101
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>when I planned this movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called a ballistic movement,</v>

102
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>it's called a ballistic movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a bullet.</v>

103
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Once you let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>

104
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.500
<v Speaker 1>There's no calling back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually organized the neurological</v>

105
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>and muscular sequences that enabled that</v>
<v Speaker 1>action before it's implemented.</v>

106
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I set all that up and then it's released</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole thing cascades.</v>

107
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>And so once the action has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>released,</v>

108
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:17.474
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I don't really have any freewill </v>

109
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>because I can't stop it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

110
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.633
<v Speaker 1>so you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like there's a temporal </v>

111
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.064
<v Speaker 1>gradient with regards to freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that as you look out into the future </v>

112
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>meet perhaps the farther out you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the future,</v>

113
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the farther down the road,</v>

114
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>let's say the more free your choices </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

115
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but the closer they get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementation,</v>

116
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:40.184
<v Speaker 1>the more they become deterministic </v>
<v Speaker 1>governed by standard cause a processes </v>

117
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:45.284
<v Speaker 1>and there's some transition point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they change from being what we would </v>

118
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 1>describe as choice that we haven't got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to free choice yet,</v>

119
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 1>but at least to choice.</v>

120
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 1>There's some transition point between </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and ballistic movement.</v>

121
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Here's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we know for example,</v>

122
00:06:59.061 --> 00:06:59.894
<v Speaker 1>that people who are expert at playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the piano look ahead of where they're </v>

123
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 1>playing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing the same thing.</v>

124
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 1>They're watching the notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're seeing where they're going,</v>

125
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then their disinhibiting,</v>

126
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:13.124
<v Speaker 1>the automated structures that enable </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to play what they've practiced so </v>

127
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're disinhibited.</v>

128
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Those structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they go automatically.</v>

129
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.153
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens if you make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake is that consciousness notes the </v>

130
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:25.664
<v Speaker 1>error and then unpacks the motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequences that have been practiced and </v>

131
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:30.494
<v Speaker 1>then you read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice them and sequence them again </v>

132
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 1>until they become automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And deterministic.</v>

133
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 1>So there's choice in that you're reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead,</v>

134
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.880
<v Speaker 1>but there's no choice in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you've read ahead in disinhibited,</v>

135
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>the auctions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they run ballistically.</v>

136
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.053
<v Speaker 1>And then you can think about the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's happening when you're </v>

137
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:46.670
<v Speaker 1>driving in a car.</v>

138
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.803
<v Speaker 1>You don't look right in front of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're driving a car because </v>

139
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>whatever is right in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going 40 miles an hour,</v>

140
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:54.194
<v Speaker 1>whatever you've already run over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look a quarter of a mile down the </v>

141
00:07:57.381 --> 00:07:58.214
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that gives you the opportunity to </v>

142
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 1>see what's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to set up a sequence of increasingly</v>

143
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:04.994
<v Speaker 1>automated movements that culminate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that you're doing while </v>

144
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:08.594
<v Speaker 1>you're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a gradation from choice </v>

145
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 1>to determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a temporal gradation.</v>

146
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.210
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

147
00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't often see that addressed when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk about free will.</v>

148
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.603
<v Speaker 1>And now Sam's issue with freewill is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you get someone to do something </v>

149
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:25.094
<v Speaker 1>like lift their finger and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you scan their brains using a </v>

150
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 1>variety of techniques while they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>

151
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 1>what you'll see is that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>action potential that emerge and you ask</v>

152
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>them to voluntarily move their fingers.</v>

153
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say by free choice,</v>

154
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 1>there's an action potential that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

155
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.663
<v Speaker 1>that you can read off the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs before the person either moves </v>

156
00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>their finger or let's say decides to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move their finger.</v>

157
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.523
<v Speaker 1>And that occurs quite a bit before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of volunteerism or that </v>

158
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.793
<v Speaker 1>voluntary act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's been read by Benjamin </v>

159
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Libet who did the experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

160
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 1>as indication that even the feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary choices determined.</v>

161
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.183
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful way of addressing the issue </v>

162
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:11.784
<v Speaker 1>because the issue of when you lift your </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger in up again is it requires </v>

163
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:20.310
<v Speaker 1>pre-programming to disinhibit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know how to do this right?</v>

164
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.593
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to learn to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a little automated circuit </v>

165
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:24.564
<v Speaker 1>that does this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these finger movements and </v>

166
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:26.904
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see babies practicing them and </v>

167
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:32.880
<v Speaker 1>they develop automated circuitry that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tends to be posterior left hemisphere in</v>

168
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 1>order to run those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those automated processes out.</v>

169
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.373
<v Speaker 1>And what you're basically doing when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide to do something that's a routine </v>

170
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:41.754
<v Speaker 1>that you've already practiced or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or made out of sub routines that you've </v>

171
00:09:43.831 --> 00:09:47.500
<v Speaker 1>already practiced is disinhibiting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

172
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.343
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which you might regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as free exactly is unclear as are </v>

173
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 1>the temporal limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that limits experiments</v>

174
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.173
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate conclusively that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>such thing as free will even though </v>

175
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:00.624
<v Speaker 1>there are action potentials that </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate that there is brain activity </v>

176
00:10:03.851 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the onset of a voluntary choice,</v>

177
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary choice early.</v>

178
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

179
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.810
<v Speaker 1>another thing that we might look at in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to that is,</v>

180
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

181
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.140
<v Speaker 1>so we can look at it phenomenologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we could also look at it in,</v>

182
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:23.263
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to how people treat one </v>

183
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:25.374
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So phenomenologically it seems clear </v>

184
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:28.974
<v Speaker 1>that we have free choice and it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious to me why we have consciousness </v>

185
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:33.540
<v Speaker 1>if free choice isn't real.</v>

186
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.583
<v Speaker 1>Cause consciousness looks to me like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism that deals with potential </v>

187
00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:40.890
<v Speaker 1>before it's transformed into actuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

188
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think consciousness is also the,</v>

189
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 1>the faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

190
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:47.334
<v Speaker 1>or a manifestation of the faculty that </v>
<v Speaker 1>enables us to preprogram deterministic </v>

191
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

192
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:53.940
<v Speaker 1>let's think about someone playing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>piano.</v>

193
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.510
<v Speaker 1>They're practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:59.070
<v Speaker 1>after you repeat and you repeat your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your finger movements,</v>

195
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:01.590
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing the piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any complex motor skill is like that.</v>

196
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:03.810
<v Speaker 1>You have to repeat it and repeat it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeat it and repeat it.</v>

197
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And you're using consciousness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>program it,</v>

198
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:09.870
<v Speaker 1>to sequence the motor movements and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to them.</v>

199
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>That all seems voluntary and it involves</v>
<v Speaker 1>the activation of a tremendous amount of</v>

200
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're doing something new,</v>

201
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 1>a lot of your brain is activated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as you practice it,</v>

202
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.850
<v Speaker 1>the amount of brain that's activated </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreases.</v>

203
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:24.684
<v Speaker 1>It shifts from right to left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it shifts from frontal to </v>

204
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.120
<v Speaker 1>posterior and a smaller and smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

205
00:11:31.121 --> 00:11:31.954
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is creating little </v>

206
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:37.980
<v Speaker 1>machines in the back of your head that </v>
<v Speaker 1>do things in an automated manner.</v>

207
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.323
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

208
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.293
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

209
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.223
<v Speaker 1>the volume that consciousness looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness appears and feels that </v>

210
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:50.024
<v Speaker 1>would be the phenomenological and as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's doing that voluntarily and it is </v>

211
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 1>associated with a different pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain activity.</v>

212
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

213
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:58.144
<v Speaker 1>so there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the fund long phenomenological </v>

214
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.280
<v Speaker 1>reality of voluntary choice and effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

215
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Cause conscious programming of that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also effortful.</v>

216
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to run deterministically</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a clock does.</v>

217
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also,</v>

218
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what you think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this with regards to evidence,</v>

219
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.463
<v Speaker 1>but what constitutes evidence is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>always that easy to determine even in </v>

220
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.220
<v Speaker 1>the scientific domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine,</v>

221
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:24.903
<v Speaker 1>think about how we think about ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people and how we treat </v>

222
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:28.354
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine that you're like a </v>

223
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 1>clock running down and that's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deterministic model.</v>

224
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 1>But people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clocks were dissipative structures.</v>

225
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>A clock is something that runs downhill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But human beings,</v>

226
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.243
<v Speaker 1>you can look up dissipative structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was an idea that was first </v>

227
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 1>formulated by the physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schrodinger we,</v>

228
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.251
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

229
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:52.084
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not clocks by any stretch of the </v>

230
00:12:53.531 --> 00:12:54.364
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we take energy in and we disperse </v>

231
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:57.934
<v Speaker 1>energy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were anti entropic in an in a </v>

232
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:02.434
<v Speaker 1>temporary sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that makes us and and so and life is </v>

233
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>as well shorting a wrote about that in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book called what is life and</v>

234
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.870
<v Speaker 1>we don't what we seem to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how it looks to me.</v>

235
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.580
<v Speaker 1>We don't contend with the present and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not driven by the past.</v>

236
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.623
<v Speaker 1>Instead what we see in front of us is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape of possibility and my wilder </v>

237
00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:25.984
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's associated with the </v>

238
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:31.060
<v Speaker 1>physical idea of multiple universes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's in my wilder moments.</v>

239
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:31.893
<v Speaker 1>It's just a speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we see in front of us is an </v>

240
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:35.674
<v Speaker 1>array of potential universes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are the universes that we </v>

241
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:41.800
<v Speaker 1>could bring about as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our actions and it,</v>

242
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>and we make choices to the right or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

243
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.213
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation about that sort of idea to </v>

244
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:48.683
<v Speaker 1>in an ethical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we decide what sort of reality </v>

245
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.264
<v Speaker 1>that we want to bring into being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we encounter potential like God </v>

246
00:13:55.721 --> 00:14:00.721
<v Speaker 1>did at the beginning of time when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>made order out of chaos.</v>

247
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.593
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is this chaotic potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We confront chaotic potential with our </v>

248
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:09.181
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and we cast that into </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and that now then you think,</v>

249
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:10.744
<v Speaker 1>well is that really the case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's hard to say because there </v>

250
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:17.740
<v Speaker 1>are limits to our knowledge about </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and about reality.</v>

251
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:18.574
<v Speaker 1>But if you treat yourself like you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>free moral agent with choice and that </v>

252
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you can determine the course of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

253
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:25.923
<v Speaker 1>then you seem to get along better with </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and to be less anxious and to </v>

254
00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:29.680
<v Speaker 1>be more productive.</v>

255
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.700
<v Speaker 1>And if you treat other people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're free agents that are making</v>

256
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:34.534
<v Speaker 1>voluntary choices about how reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to come into being and you reward </v>

257
00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>them when they do it properly and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>punish them,</v>

258
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or otherwise discipline them when they </v>

259
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:44.770
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they do it badly,</v>

260
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.010
<v Speaker 1>then your relationships with them seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>

261
00:14:48.011 --> 00:14:48.844
<v Speaker 1>And then if we predicate our society on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the presupposition that each individual </v>

262
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 1>human being is capable of doing just </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

263
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.060
<v Speaker 1>then we seem to have extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional societies.</v>

264
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.343
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that Sam Harris </v>

265
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 1>has been taken to task for many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if you dispense with the idea of free</v>

266
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it you organize your relationship</v>

267
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:10.454
<v Speaker 1>to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your interactions with your family and </v>

268
00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:15.200
<v Speaker 1>your relationships with the broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>social community?</v>

269
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.123
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe strongly that we have free </v>

270
00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're responsible for our choices.</v>

271
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Those choices are constrained in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>

272
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.483
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a gradient of freewill </v>
<v Speaker 1>from free out into the future to </v>

273
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:34.154
<v Speaker 1>increasingly constrained as the present </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself to deterministic in the </v>

274
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:41.640
<v Speaker 1>moment when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when in the moment of action we,</v>

275
00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:42.474
<v Speaker 1>and you might think that we entered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of deterministic causality at the </v>

276
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:47.240
<v Speaker 1>moment of action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

277
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 1>That's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

278
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.313
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at this rate we're going to answer </v>

279
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 1>about five questions so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was a very,</v>

280
00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:56.420
<v Speaker 1>very hard one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

281
00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maelstrom.</v>

282
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Who is apparently chaos given the name </v>
<v Speaker 1>asks me,</v>

283
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:05.360
<v Speaker 1>am I chaos or am I order?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

284
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say a lot of the time I'm chaos,</v>

285
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.270
<v Speaker 1>but I do everything I can to put things </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order.</v>

286
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to answer that in a deeper</v>

287
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:15.590
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

288
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>

289
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.530
<v Speaker 1>everything and everyone is chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>order at the same time.</v>

290
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.490
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean that in a trait sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a technical sense,</v>

291
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:26.324
<v Speaker 1>which is order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically speaking in my way of </v>

292
00:16:29.151 --> 00:16:29.984
<v Speaker 1>viewing the world is order is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain you inhabit when what you're </v>

293
00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>doing produces the results that you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have happen.</v>

294
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a pragmatic perspective from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a philosophical perspective,</v>

295
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:41.084
<v Speaker 1>it's derived at least in part or as </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogous to the pragmatism of people </v>

296
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

297
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cs purse and William James,</v>

298
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.760
<v Speaker 1>the American pr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early American pragmatists.</v>

299
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:53.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a great book on all that if </v>

300
00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:58.700
<v Speaker 1>you're interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the metaphysical club.</v>

301
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.273
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so order is where you are when what </v>

302
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:04.184
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is producing the results </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you intended and that validates </v>

303
00:17:06.711 --> 00:17:07.670
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

304
00:17:07.671 --> 00:17:09.380
<v Speaker 1>that that's a pragmatic form of truth.</v>

305
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Your theory is accurate when if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>enact it,</v>

306
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:13.663
<v Speaker 1>then the results that you intend emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the definition of truth from a </v>

307
00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:17.624
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic perspective to have very </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful definition and it's very much </v>

308
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 1>associated with the Darwinian notion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

309
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:25.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's worth looking into.</v>

310
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.283
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously there are times when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>implement a plan and a and at world </v>

311
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.400
<v Speaker 1>conception that goes along with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan and what you wanted didn't happen.</v>

312
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.790
<v Speaker 1>And so then the domain of chaos comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

313
00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:41.624
<v Speaker 1>the domain of the unpredictable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected and you have to contend with </v>

314
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:47.090
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes when you are acting,</v>

315
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.043
<v Speaker 1>you do perverse things and things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that surprise you and then things don't </v>

316
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Speaker 1>work out well for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

317
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.230
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you get a surprise and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that might even be positive.</v>

318
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.303
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the chaos within you </v>
<v Speaker 1>as manifested itself and you've done </v>

319
00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 1>something that exceeds the bounds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your understanding.</v>

320
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.383
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can happen to people so badly that </v>

321
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 1>they developed post traumatic stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post traumatic stress disorder.</v>

322
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially naive young soldiers,</v>

323
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:15.684
<v Speaker 1>will go on a battlefield and watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves do something they can't </v>

324
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:18.384
<v Speaker 1>imagine they're capable of doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they have permanent post traumatic </v>

325
00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:21.684
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a chaos within that can </v>

326
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:27.660
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can disrupt whatever order you are.</v>

327
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know that minor ways because </v>

328
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:33.060
<v Speaker 1>everybody's always running around doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that aren't good for them,</v>

329
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:35.580
<v Speaker 1>that they know they shouldn't do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can't control.</v>

330
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.600
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a chaotic and an orderly </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect to everything,</v>

331
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.120
<v Speaker 1>to the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the family,</v>

332
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.040
<v Speaker 1>to the social world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the natural world.</v>

333
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.790
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos and order at every level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis simultaneously,</v>

334
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 1>which is why the Dallas think of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is made out of Yin and Yang,</v>

335
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:51.774
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>analogous to the idea of order and </v>

336
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:55.764
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

337
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's another element too.</v>

338
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 1>So your order and your chaos and w the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place that you live,</v>

339
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 1>the environment is order and chaos as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

340
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.270
<v Speaker 1>But you're also the process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediates between the two.</v>

341
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.493
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is you're the forest</v>
<v Speaker 1>that confronts chaos and cast it into </v>

342
00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:14.274
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that in the freewill </v>

343
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:18.210
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the basis for the dragon math,</v>

344
00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:19.800
<v Speaker 1>or at least part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero myth.</v>

345
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>You're the forest that confronts chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and transforms it into habitable order.</v>

346
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And there's an idea that if you do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>using truthful speech,</v>

347
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.430
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the deepest idea in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible.</v>

348
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 1>If you confront chaos and the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 1>using truthful speech,</v>

349
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:34.824
<v Speaker 1>then the order that you produce is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that also means that your chaos and </v>

350
00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:42.900
<v Speaker 1>order and the process that intermediates</v>
<v Speaker 1>between them,</v>

351
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.150
<v Speaker 1>and that's really the basis of the hero </v>
<v Speaker 1>myth.</v>

352
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.540
<v Speaker 1>So part of that is the hero story and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon Myth.</v>

353
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Go Out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confront the drag and get the gold,</v>

354
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:52.590
<v Speaker 1>bring it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>share it with the community.</v>

355
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.990
<v Speaker 1>And the dragon is a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that which dwells beyond the confines of</v>

356
00:19:57.991 --> 00:20:00.330
<v Speaker 1>the safe and habitable space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

357
00:20:00.331 --> 00:20:02.970
<v Speaker 1>It's an image of a predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what it is.</v>

358
00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Although it's way more complicated than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

359
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.323
<v Speaker 1>And you're also the forest that </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronts order when it becomes too </v>

360
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:09.444
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical and restructures it back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and then restructures the chaos </v>

361
00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:17.010
<v Speaker 1>back into more beneficial order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do.</v>

362
00:20:17.011 --> 00:20:17.844
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an argument with someone </v>

363
00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Speaker 1>that you settle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

364
00:20:21.001 --> 00:20:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Cause the argument takes the orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

365
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.590
<v Speaker 1>relation that you have with that person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then produces a chaotic interlude,</v>

366
00:20:28.591 --> 00:20:30.990
<v Speaker 1>which is all the pain that's associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the argument.</v>

367
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's a dissolution into what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Murcia Ellie Audi called pre cosmic gone</v>

368
00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:36.594
<v Speaker 1>to chaos.</v>

369
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 1>And out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new order can emerge.</v>

370
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And so the best way to construe yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not as chaos or as order,</v>

371
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.740
<v Speaker 1>but as the process that mediates between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

372
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:52.120
<v Speaker 1>and that's the basis for the ethos of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the West is that the human being is best</v>

373
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.493
<v Speaker 1>represented as the individual and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual is that attentive and </v>

374
00:20:57.521 --> 00:20:58.354
<v Speaker 1>communicative entity that is continually</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of mediating properly between </v>

375
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:06.160
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a deep idea.</v>

376
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 1>You could read maps of meaning if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like.</v>

377
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.130
<v Speaker 1>The audio version of that is coming out </v>
<v Speaker 1>June 12th,</v>

378
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:12.964
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I will make a video detailing the </v>

379
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:17.350
<v Speaker 1>relationship between maps of meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules of life.</v>

380
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.633
<v Speaker 1>But you can construe yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should construe yourself as the </v>

381
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:24.130
<v Speaker 1>process that mediates between chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

382
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.323
<v Speaker 1>And you should aim to be the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does that properly using truthful </v>

383
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.943
<v Speaker 1>communication because that's how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the elements of existence properly </v>

384
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 1>balanced.</v>

385
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.170
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

386
00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:37.270
<v Speaker 1>but is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

387
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.823
<v Speaker 1>if you read maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a section on neuropsychology </v>

388
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.670
<v Speaker 1>that's also buttressed by a book written</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Ian Mcgilchrist called the master and</v>

389
00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:46.504
<v Speaker 1>his emissary that lays out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the right and left </v>

390
00:21:49.331 --> 00:21:50.164
<v Speaker 1>hand Miss Hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's quite strange that we have a </v>

391
00:21:52.421 --> 00:21:53.254
<v Speaker 1>right and left hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if we have two </v>

392
00:21:55.361 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 1>consciousnesses dwelling in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our,</v>

393
00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.620
<v Speaker 1>in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our being.</v>

394
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're quite separable.</v>

395
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.910
<v Speaker 1>If you cut the Corpus callosum that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unites the two,</v>

396
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:06.880
<v Speaker 1>then the two hemispheres will act </v>
<v Speaker 1>independently to some degree.</v>

397
00:22:06.881 --> 00:22:09.280
<v Speaker 1>You can communicate with each of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat independently.</v>

398
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.470
<v Speaker 1>So they actually view the world quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

399
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 1>And that that hemisphere distinction is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only they're in human beings,</v>

400
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but also an animals along way down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phylogenetic chain.</v>

401
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.143
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made the claim partly because I was </v>

402
00:22:20.771 --> 00:22:25.771
<v Speaker 1>reading a man named El Conan Goldberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a student of Alexander Luria,</v>

403
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.570
<v Speaker 1>the most brilliant neuro psychologist of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century.</v>

404
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.480
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Goldberg made the case that,</v>

405
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left hemisphere is specialized for,</v>

406
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what's known.</v>

407
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:38.794
<v Speaker 1>And the right hemisphere is specialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>for anomaly and [inaudible] </v>

408
00:22:41.421 --> 00:22:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Rameshchandra and who's a famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurologist.</v>

409
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm an MD in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in California,</v>

410
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:46.894
<v Speaker 1>has also made it very similar claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on his analysis of brain damaged </v>

411
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.613
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Goldberg's case was the left </v>

412
00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:54.700
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere is specialized for what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

413
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:55.534
<v Speaker 1>how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the right hemisphere is specialized </v>

414
00:22:57.431 --> 00:23:02.431
<v Speaker 1>for response to what's unknown and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>maps onto this order chaos dimension,</v>

415
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the right hemisphere.</v>

416
00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

417
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.353
<v Speaker 1>mcgilchrist in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the master and his emissary has pointed </v>

418
00:23:09.401 --> 00:23:12.790
<v Speaker 1>out quite clearly that the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere has a tyrannical tendency,</v>

419
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:17.680
<v Speaker 1>which Rameshchandra and also viewed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his brain damaged patients by the way,</v>

420
00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.740
<v Speaker 1>and that the left hemisphere is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to impose.</v>

421
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 1>It's logical and restricted order on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

422
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:25.990
<v Speaker 1>And to make the world fit into that.</v>

423
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Now it has to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's reasons for that.</v>

424
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:29.763
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if your theory you've worked on </v>

425
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:34.930
<v Speaker 1>for 10 years makes one prediction era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't throw the whole damn thing</v>

426
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:37.390
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should doubt the prediction error,</v>

427
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:38.463
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you never know when your data is </v>

428
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:42.580
<v Speaker 1>actually data or is just another kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

429
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 1>We can't get into that at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

430
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:46.783
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgilchrist makes it very strong case </v>

431
00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think in a more elaborated case </v>
<v Speaker 1>than I made in maps of meaning.</v>

432
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:53.564
<v Speaker 1>But it's the same argument fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the right hemisphere is concerned </v>

433
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 1>with reaction to anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

434
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.003
<v Speaker 1>so what happens in some senses something</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected happens that's the domain of </v>

435
00:24:04.341 --> 00:24:07.010
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that stops you in your tracks,</v>

436
00:24:07.011 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 1>it freezes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a Predator response.</v>

437
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 1>A prey response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

438
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 1>you're frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown has manifested itself.</v>

439
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.383
<v Speaker 1>You're not in order anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you are and you </v>

440
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:17.930
<v Speaker 1>don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

441
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:19.970
<v Speaker 1>and you can't just shut down like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer does.</v>

442
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:20.893
<v Speaker 1>You freeze instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is that the </v>

443
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:24.224
<v Speaker 1>ancient mechanisms that have helped our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors for tens of millions of years </v>

444
00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:28.484
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps longer than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>react to that which lurks beyond the </v>

445
00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:35.060
<v Speaker 1>confines of the unknown kick in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you start,</v>

446
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:35.894
<v Speaker 1>first of all that's motoric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you freeze and then you cautiously </v>

447
00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:40.700
<v Speaker 1>start to explore and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagistic.</v>

448
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:43.190
<v Speaker 1>You start making imaginal </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>

449
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.323
<v Speaker 1>metaphoric representations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic representations of what might </v>

450
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:48.014
<v Speaker 1>constitute the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those representations are </v>

451
00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:51.764
<v Speaker 1>practiced and implemented in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they become more and more fine </v>

452
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 1>grained and automatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as that happens,</v>

453
00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 1>the locale that they're represented in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain shifts from right to left.</v>

454
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

455
00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:07.250
<v Speaker 1>so the reason I'm telling you all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because you know,</v>

456
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 1>this is where the metaphysical and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical unite,</v>

457
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:10.754
<v Speaker 1>and this is the sort of argument that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to make to Sam Harris and </v>

458
00:25:13.281 --> 00:25:15.890
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we'll be able to continue </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that because I'm going to meet him</v>

459
00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 1>three times in the next few months.</v>

460
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yin Yang idea,</v>

461
00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:21.884
<v Speaker 1>the chaos order ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical in some sense to say that </v>

462
00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:25.094
<v Speaker 1>the world is made up of order and chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't sound like an empirical </v>

463
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:29.690
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but strangely enough,</v>

464
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.943
<v Speaker 1>the world to which our brains are </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapted is actually the world of chaos </v>

465
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 1>and order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it as unexplored,</v>

466
00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:39.110
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another,</v>

467
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.140
<v Speaker 1>that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:41.683
<v Speaker 1>take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think from a Darwinian </v>

469
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:45.860
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it this way.</v>

470
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.650
<v Speaker 1>From a Darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an,</v>

471
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.753
<v Speaker 1>there's an an axiomatic presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is reality is that which </v>

472
00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:55.580
<v Speaker 1>selects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

473
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.760
<v Speaker 1>reality is the force that selects over </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary time.</v>

474
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:00.223
<v Speaker 1>And so the forest that selects over </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary time has selected for </v>

475
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:07.010
<v Speaker 1>hemispheric specialization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bilateral hemispheric specialization,</v>

476
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.173
<v Speaker 1>which indicates the two different modes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of looking at the world are necessary </v>

477
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.710
<v Speaker 1>for survival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

478
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:13.544
<v Speaker 1>So that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that the world is made </v>

479
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:18.800
<v Speaker 1>out of chaos and order is perhaps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most real idea.</v>

480
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:19.783
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something else cool that's </v>

481
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:24.500
<v Speaker 1>associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is an antidote to nihilism.</v>

482
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I also think it's an antidote to two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call 'em?</v>

483
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological possession.</v>

484
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.593
<v Speaker 1>So when you encounter something unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you orient towards it and that's an </v>

485
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:37.664
<v Speaker 1>involuntary response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could even think about it as a </v>

486
00:26:39.301 --> 00:26:40.134
<v Speaker 1>deterministic response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what orients you very </v>

487
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:45.780
<v Speaker 1>rapidly towards predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't kill you before you have a</v>

488
00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:47.460
<v Speaker 1>chance to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

489
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 1>so you react because the normalist thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is meaningful,</v>

490
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:51.414
<v Speaker 1>it's intrinsically meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reaction is first terror with </v>

491
00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:58.290
<v Speaker 1>perhaps an overlay of disgust and second</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity.</v>

492
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's terrorist so that you freeze </v>
<v Speaker 1>and remained paralyzed.</v>

493
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:02.964
<v Speaker 1>You turn to stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the basilisk or the </v>

494
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:06.630
<v Speaker 1>snake or the Gorgon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you turned to stone,</v>

495
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:07.464
<v Speaker 1>you're paralyzed like a prey animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so the prey Predator can't </v>

496
00:27:10.201 --> 00:27:11.940
<v Speaker 1>see you at least in part.</v>

497
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.013
<v Speaker 1>And there's other elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orienting reflects that are associated </v>

498
00:27:14.911 --> 00:27:15.744
<v Speaker 1>with Predator avoidance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if nothing additionally </v>

499
00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:18.264
<v Speaker 1>terrible happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to thaw out and you start to </v>

500
00:27:20.851 --> 00:27:21.684
<v Speaker 1>explore and you do that with image first</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then pr and then practice the </v>

501
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:27.270
<v Speaker 1>appropriate behaviors and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then automate those.</v>

502
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Now look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing that's cool.</v>

503
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:35.390
<v Speaker 1>So that orienting reflects to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown is it's an admixture of threat,</v>

504
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Speaker 1>fear and curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward.</v>

505
00:27:40.981 --> 00:27:43.800
<v Speaker 1>So negative emotions and positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions now,</v>

506
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's dose dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The larger the anomaly,</v>

507
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:52.250
<v Speaker 1>which means the larger the map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it blows out when it manifests itself.</v>

508
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:53.454
<v Speaker 1>Think of the difference between being </v>
<v Speaker 1>irritated at your marital partner </v>

509
00:27:57.211 --> 00:27:58.500
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

510
00:27:58.501 --> 00:27:59.101
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

511
00:27:59.101 --> 00:27:59.934
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they were late to pick you up </v>

512
00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:02.064
<v Speaker 1>for work compared to how irritated you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be if you found out they were </v>

513
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:05.490
<v Speaker 1>having an affair.</v>

514
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:06.503
<v Speaker 1>Difference in size of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally the first one disrupts a tiny </v>

515
00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:12.510
<v Speaker 1>little part of your space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time orientation,</v>

516
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.240
<v Speaker 1>and the second one demolishes your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

517
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:17.760
<v Speaker 1>and future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the larger the disruption,</v>

518
00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:20.280
<v Speaker 1>the more negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

519
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.353
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's this weird interplay between </v>

520
00:28:24.091 --> 00:28:27.630
<v Speaker 1>negative and positive emotion in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to a normally and,</v>

521
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's deeply meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's even if it paralyzes you,</v>

522
00:28:31.111 --> 00:28:32.820
<v Speaker 1>even if it's terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's meaningful.</v>

523
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.773
<v Speaker 1>And then that transforms perhaps into </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense curiosity and you start to </v>

524
00:28:36.211 --> 00:28:37.044
<v Speaker 1>explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the phenomena of meaning is a </v>

525
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.890
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of the complex orienting </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex.</v>

526
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:49.080
<v Speaker 1>And so you're wired so that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just order and you're not just chaos,</v>

527
00:28:49.081 --> 00:28:53.760
<v Speaker 1>your order continually confronting chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the order remains updated.</v>

528
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.530
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

529
00:28:55.531 --> 00:28:56.364
<v Speaker 1>how do you know how much chaos you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should confront in order to keep the </v>

530
00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:00.780
<v Speaker 1>order continually updated?</v>

531
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:05.030
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

532
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:05.873
<v Speaker 1>something is meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that something is meaningful </v>

533
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:08.724
<v Speaker 1>is because you're getting a deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctual signal that you're </v>

534
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:15.630
<v Speaker 1>encountering a normally at a rate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exceed your capability.</v>

535
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.560
<v Speaker 1>That's also the rate at which you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep yourself updated optimally.</v>

536
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And so meaning isn't epit phenomenal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

537
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:23.723
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't some kind of delusion that </v>

538
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:28.200
<v Speaker 1>rationality can and should overcome to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

539
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:29.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's meaningless.</v>

540
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:29.911
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

541
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:32.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning is the most fundamental instinct</v>

542
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 1>for adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly why in 12 rules for</v>

543
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:37.290
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said one of the rules,</v>

544
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's rule seven is do what is </v>

545
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:43.810
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what is expedient because meaning is</v>

546
00:29:43.811 --> 00:29:46.090
<v Speaker 1>a really good guide to longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation.</v>

547
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing about meaning,</v>

548
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Speaker 1>which is what happens when you get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance between chaos and order,</v>

549
00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

550
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Is that meaning is the antidote to </v>
<v Speaker 1>despair.</v>

551
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.320
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's all sorts of reasons in life</v>

552
00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:00.154
<v Speaker 1>to be desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you immerse yourself in </v>

553
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn to do that.</v>

554
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.593
<v Speaker 1>You can learn to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make that goal your highest </v>

555
00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:08.860
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the highest goal would be to</v>

556
00:30:08.861 --> 00:30:11.920
<v Speaker 1>be the sort of mythological hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

557
00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:16.750
<v Speaker 1>to embody and incarnate and imitate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological hero,</v>

558
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:19.660
<v Speaker 1>like the imitation of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you're called to do.</v>

559
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:23.500
<v Speaker 1>If you happen to be Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that you live in meaning.</v>

560
00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:24.334
<v Speaker 1>And that meaning is the antidote to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering of life that would otherwise </v>

561
00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:30.220
<v Speaker 1>make you brutal and vengeful and unhappy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and miserable.</v>

562
00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:31.054
<v Speaker 1>And like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that young guy who just mowed down 12 </v>

563
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:36.970
<v Speaker 1>people in Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are real things.</v>

564
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:40.530
<v Speaker 1>You lose your sense of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You end up in hell and inhale,</v>

565
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.520
<v Speaker 1>you do all sorts of terrible things.</v>

566
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:43.683
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are dreadful realities and it </v>

567
00:30:46.031 --> 00:30:49.090
<v Speaker 1>isn't as if they're not grounded in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate science.</v>

568
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.343
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was also a very complicated </v>

569
00:30:53.381 --> 00:30:57.340
<v Speaker 1>question began in a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

570
00:30:57.341 --> 00:30:58.174
<v Speaker 1>We are considering kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts about gay people </v>

571
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:02.330
<v Speaker 1>raising children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

572
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I think the devil's in the details to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you the truth.</v>

573
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:10.660
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was ever talking to any individuals</v>

574
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:11.710
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

575
00:31:11.711 --> 00:31:12.461
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

576
00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:13.750
<v Speaker 1>how would you raise them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

577
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:14.980
<v Speaker 1>you have problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

578
00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.300
<v Speaker 1>If you're both of the same sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have the problem of</v>

579
00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:21.910
<v Speaker 1>how to provide the proper model for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

580
00:31:21.911 --> 00:31:24.160
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a boy and a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

581
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.193
<v Speaker 1>we know this is indisputable and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I've talked to Warren Farrell </v>

582
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:29.854
<v Speaker 1>about kids in intacct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual families where the father </v>

583
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:33.874
<v Speaker 1>is present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do way better on multiple indices than </v>

584
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:40.930
<v Speaker 1>kids who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are part of single parent families.</v>

585
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean that there are no </v>
<v Speaker 1>single parents who do a good job,</v>

586
00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same bloody claim.</v>

587
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Those are different claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on average kid,</v>

588
00:31:51.161 --> 00:31:53.920
<v Speaker 1>not only do kids where fathers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>present do better,</v>

589
00:31:53.921 --> 00:31:54.754
<v Speaker 1>but societies or even even local </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies where there are more fathers </v>

590
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:00.124
<v Speaker 1>present do better not only for the kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're fathering but the kids in </v>

591
00:32:04.121 --> 00:32:04.954
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether lots of intact families with </v>

592
00:32:06.851 --> 00:32:07.684
<v Speaker 1>fathers do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I believe quite firmly that the </v>

593
00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 1>nuclear family is the smallest viable </v>
<v Speaker 1>human unit,</v>

594
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.380
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

595
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.810
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smallest viable unit.</v>

596
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.780
<v Speaker 1>And if you fragment it below that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you end up paying.</v>

597
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Now that that doesn't mean that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are way,</v>

598
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.093
<v Speaker 1>there aren't ways that you can operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in smaller unit or a different unit </v>

599
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.313
<v Speaker 1>effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have to contend with the fact </v>

600
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:39.750
<v Speaker 1>that it's necessary for pe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for kids to have models for both sexes.</v>

601
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.473
<v Speaker 1>And that means that means accepting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sexes are different even though </v>

602
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:45.224
<v Speaker 1>there's a fair overlap between the mix </v>
<v Speaker 1>epting that they're different and that </v>

603
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 1>both sexes play their role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like what fathers do.</v>

604
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:53.600
<v Speaker 1>And I talked to Warren Farrell a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

605
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:57.860
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to release this video this</v>
<v Speaker 1>month about what fathers do and a lot of</v>

606
00:32:57.861 --> 00:33:01.280
<v Speaker 1>what they do is rough and tumble play </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the kids,</v>

607
00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 1>which kids really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

608
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:03.344
<v Speaker 1>really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really important as Jaak </v>

609
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:06.643
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp a great effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientists laid out in his studies </v>

610
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:09.344
<v Speaker 1>on routes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He discovered the place circuitry and </v>

611
00:33:11.271 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 1>fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something feral told me,</v>

612
00:33:13.521 --> 00:33:14.354
<v Speaker 1>which was extraordinarily interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that fathers used the joy of the </v>

613
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:18.434
<v Speaker 1>possibility of play as a scaffold to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help children learn to delay </v>

614
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:22.994
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine a father spends a bunch of </v>

615
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:26.780
<v Speaker 1>time playing with his kids and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a great old time.</v>

616
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.613
<v Speaker 1>They're wrestling around and pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's limits to find out where </v>

617
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:31.064
<v Speaker 1>they are and learning the physiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>dance that goes along with direct </v>

618
00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:36.170
<v Speaker 1>contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct,</v>

619
00:33:36.171 --> 00:33:39.080
<v Speaker 1>exciting contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning what hurts and what doesn't and</v>

620
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.123
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes fair play and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't and how everybody can play and </v>

621
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:43.544
<v Speaker 1>still enjoy the game and how excited you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could get before it's too much and how </v>

622
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:48.920
<v Speaker 1>much you should wine and how much you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't and when you can.</v>

623
00:33:48.921 --> 00:33:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Object to being hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that at a deeply embodied level.</v>

624
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.620
<v Speaker 1>The kids love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll line up for that.</v>

625
00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:55.454
<v Speaker 1>And panksepp demonstrated very clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that rats will work to play and that </v>

626
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:00.463
<v Speaker 1>routes play fair and they learned to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play fair because of iterated play </v>

627
00:34:03.021 --> 00:34:03.854
<v Speaker 1>bouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that if you don't let juvenile male </v>

628
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:07.064
<v Speaker 1>rats play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then their prefrontal cortex is don't </v>

629
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:12.590
<v Speaker 1>develop and they get attention deficit </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder or the equivalent in rats.</v>

630
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.210
<v Speaker 1>And then you can treat that with rental </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

631
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 1>And so this is all very vital material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're going to,</v>

632
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.320
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're gay,</v>

633
00:34:21.321 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two men or two women,</v>

634
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:28.810
<v Speaker 1>then you have the problem of what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do for the Contra Sexual,</v>

635
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:30.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>

636
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:30.890
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

637
00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:33.590
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between men and women.</v>

638
00:34:33.591 --> 00:34:34.424
<v Speaker 1>And you can gerrymander the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>question that way and avoid you're </v>

639
00:34:36.701 --> 00:34:39.830
<v Speaker 1>remorseful responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can face it squarely and say,</v>

640
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:40.664
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've decided to step outside of the </v>

641
00:34:42.351 --> 00:34:45.260
<v Speaker 1>cultural norm and to organize a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonstandard relationship,</v>

642
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.930
<v Speaker 1>which puts a tremendous rented </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility on you.</v>

643
00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.830
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can provide for your children what it is</v>

644
00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:55.190
<v Speaker 1>that they would get in the classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimal human unit.</v>

645
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more power to you.</v>

646
00:34:57.171 --> 00:34:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I hope you can do a good job of it.</v>

647
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's room in the world for,</v>

648
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.870
<v Speaker 1>for a diverse range of approaches to </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex life problems,</v>

649
00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:08.300
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like having kids and finding a partner.</v>

650
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.990
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you get to bury </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head in the sand about the absolute</v>

651
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:12.943
<v Speaker 1>realities of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that there are biological </v>

652
00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:15.524
<v Speaker 1>differences between men and women to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deny that is reprehensible in my </v>

653
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.570
<v Speaker 1>estimation and besides the empirical </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt at the scientific data are crystal</v>

654
00:35:23.571 --> 00:35:25.430
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and so.</v>

655
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.833
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jung says that everything </v>

656
00:35:30.411 --> 00:35:31.244
<v Speaker 1>unconscious is projected into reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know if you are perceiving </v>

657
00:35:33.801 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 1>reality accurately or are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>projecting?</v>

658
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

659
00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why I'm a pragmatist.</v>

660
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of ways.</v>

661
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of ways that,</v>

662
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain tells you</v>

663
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 1>if you make a mistake and you hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself while then you're stupid theory</v>

664
00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:51.060
<v Speaker 1>was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

665
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what the pain says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stupid theory was wrong.</v>

666
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's a pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

667
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:58.980
<v Speaker 1>that's another indication of pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory of truth.</v>

668
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 1>You lay out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

669
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.613
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the world with a set of </v>

670
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:04.164
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I outlined that in chapter 10 in in </v>

671
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.403
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 12 rules for life called be precise </v>

672
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:09.984
<v Speaker 1>in your speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It indicates that when you look at the </v>

673
00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:13.674
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at it through a value </v>

674
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:15.384
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't help that because you're </v>

675
00:36:16.381 --> 00:36:17.214
<v Speaker 1>always aiming at something in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're always aiming at something </v>

676
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:19.734
<v Speaker 1>you want and you're trying to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that you look at the </v>

677
00:36:22.381 --> 00:36:23.214
<v Speaker 1>world through a value structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is whether or not that </v>

678
00:36:25.591 --> 00:36:29.190
<v Speaker 1>value structure is valid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very complicated question.</v>

679
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do you know if it's valid?</v>

680
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lay it out and you act it out.</v>

681
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:35.263
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you implement it perceptually and then </v>

682
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:39.120
<v Speaker 1>you act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you get what you wanted,</v>

683
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.940
<v Speaker 1>what the theory predicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another way of thinking about it,</v>

684
00:36:41.941 --> 00:36:43.830
<v Speaker 1>but wanted is a better way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

685
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:44.903
<v Speaker 1>Then the fact that that behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>routine and perceptual structure </v>

686
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 1>produced the intended result validates </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as a tool for obtaining that result.</v>

687
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's a form of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

688
00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:56.963
<v Speaker 1>it might be the only form of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not convinced of that </v>

689
00:36:59.191 --> 00:37:00.390
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it might be,</v>

690
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

691
00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if you're stupid theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>is wrong.</v>

692
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

693
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.660
<v Speaker 1>it fails and you're hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pain tells you,</v>

694
00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.330
<v Speaker 1>you pragmatically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your theory was wrong.</v>

695
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.313
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you should pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your own pain because your suffering </v>

696
00:37:15.631 --> 00:37:17.760
<v Speaker 1>is indication that you still have things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn.</v>

697
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.520
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the suffering of other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also that,</v>

698
00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:21.963
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe something unexpected or </v>

699
00:37:23.131 --> 00:37:23.964
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable happens when you're laying</v>
<v Speaker 1>out your plan and then the anomalous </v>

700
00:37:27.001 --> 00:37:29.400
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unexpected or chaos.</v>

701
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you get anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

702
00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:35.100
<v Speaker 1>anxiety is an indication that your plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Arrow didn't fly too.</v>

703
00:37:35.101 --> 00:37:37.080
<v Speaker 1>It's mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you aimed wrong.</v>

704
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And that might mean a small error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:40.704
<v Speaker 1>maybe a tiny adjustment of your bowl or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it might mean you just don't know what </v>

706
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:45.900
<v Speaker 1>the hell you're doing at all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is lost.</v>

707
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:50.310
<v Speaker 1>And so anxiety tells you if your theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>is wrong and then,</v>

708
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.313
<v Speaker 1>and then other people tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you want to surround </v>

709
00:37:54.061 --> 00:37:59.061
<v Speaker 1>yourself with other people because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribute your cognitive resources.</v>

710
00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Ew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

711
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.920
<v Speaker 1>you distribute your problems to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive resources of the social group.</v>

712
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:08.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do when we price things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

713
00:38:08.761 --> 00:38:09.594
<v Speaker 1>Everyone votes on the price of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so difficult because the </v>

714
00:38:12.121 --> 00:38:12.954
<v Speaker 1>price of something has to be established</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to the price of </v>

715
00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:17.580
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's always in flux.</v>

716
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And so it's computationally impossible </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

717
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.950
<v Speaker 1>And so we outsource it to the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the free cognitive decision of,</v>

718
00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.920
<v Speaker 1>of millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we determine price.</v>

719
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:29.933
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you do to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that you're not any stupider than </v>

720
00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you have to be blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorant,</v>

721
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:37.180
<v Speaker 1>biased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that is you surround yourself</v>

722
00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:38.014
<v Speaker 1>with other people and you try to treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>them well enough so that they can </v>

723
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:40.894
<v Speaker 1>tolerate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then every time that you do </v>

724
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:46.630
<v Speaker 1>something stupid because one of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories is it is vague or incomplete or</v>

725
00:38:46.631 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 1>wrong or biased or you're willfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind,</v>

726
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 1>then they slap you on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

727
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:51.663
<v Speaker 1>They ignore you because you're boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't laugh at your jokes because </v>

728
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 1>they're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

729
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.463
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are irritated at your auctions </v>

730
00:38:58.301 --> 00:38:59.134
<v Speaker 1>because you're not taking your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm interests or the interests of </v>

731
00:39:01.781 --> 00:39:02.950
<v Speaker 1>other people into account.</v>

732
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.370
<v Speaker 1>And so you have pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have anxiety,</v>

733
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.670
<v Speaker 1>you have the reward of success that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

734
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.533
<v Speaker 1>that's a positive indicator that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory is okay and then you have the </v>

735
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:16.870
<v Speaker 1>reactions of everyone else and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>clued in,</v>

736
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:20.230
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention to all of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you try to update your,</v>

737
00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.350
<v Speaker 1>your order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your perceptions.</v>

738
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.333
<v Speaker 1>You try to update your order constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of being humble in the </v>

739
00:39:27.311 --> 00:39:28.144
<v Speaker 1>face of your errors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why humility is the </v>

740
00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:32.890
<v Speaker 1>precondition for learning and why it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the highest moral virtues.</v>

741
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.720
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perceiving reality accurately.</v>

742
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:42.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't really perceive reality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really perceive accurately.</v>

743
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:47.350
<v Speaker 1>You perceive small portions of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily limited in space.</v>

744
00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.184
<v Speaker 1>And time and accurately means well </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that when you do what you're </v>

745
00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

746
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm a pragmatist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

747
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:55.960
<v Speaker 1>not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

748
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lots of other </v>

749
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.670
<v Speaker 1>philosophical streams that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced my thought.</v>

750
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Existentialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal Log,</v>

751
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.090
<v Speaker 1>phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension to others.</v>

752
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.313
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is you can't perceive </v>

753
00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 1>reality accurately because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know everything.</v>

754
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:11.404
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're full of biases and you're </v>

755
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.503
<v Speaker 1>ignorant as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the best you can do is perceive </v>

756
00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:16.354
<v Speaker 1>small bits of reality well enough so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can more or less get what you </v>

757
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:19.384
<v Speaker 1>need in a relatively short period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time without screwing yourself up too </v>

758
00:40:22.511 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 1>badly in the medium to longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much what you've got.</v>

759
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:28.660
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean truth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible,</v>

760
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:29.543
<v Speaker 1>just means that it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated to decide what truth </v>

761
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:32.944
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because the question is what is </v>

762
00:40:34.751 --> 00:40:36.790
<v Speaker 1>truth for someone whose knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited,</v>

763
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:40.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously because your knowledge</v>

764
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:44.050
<v Speaker 1>is limited and you don't know everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying some fundamental way,</v>

765
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.510
<v Speaker 1>you're ignorant or wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

766
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.120
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't help because you still </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to act in the world.</v>

767
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:53.110
<v Speaker 1>So there are bounded truths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are bounded truths and so,</v>

768
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:58.090
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if past experiences shape us,</v>

769
00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed one.</v>

770
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:00.963
<v Speaker 1>You cite a tired brain foggy thinking as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason to stop answering questions </v>

771
00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:05.974
<v Speaker 1>or giving a talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you combat this well working or </v>

772
00:41:08.081 --> 00:41:10.160
<v Speaker 1>writing daily?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

773
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:14.710
<v Speaker 1>well I eat a big breakfast relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon on waking.</v>

774
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:15.783
<v Speaker 1>That really helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If any of you out there are anxious and </v>

775
00:41:18.131 --> 00:41:18.964
<v Speaker 1>many of you no doubt are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a large number of you who </v>

776
00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:22.474
<v Speaker 1>are anxious and don't eat breakfast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a whole bunch of you out </v>

777
00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:25.600
<v Speaker 1>there who think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't eat breakfast.</v>

778
00:41:25.601 --> 00:41:27.610
<v Speaker 1>It isn't necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's wrong.</v>

779
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.100
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fasted all night.</v>

780
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.680
<v Speaker 1>If you load yourself cognitively or </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically in the morning,</v>

781
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.843
<v Speaker 1>your brain stressed will produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will encourage your body to produce </v>

782
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:39.614
<v Speaker 1>insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will take all the blood sugar out of </v>

783
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:44.570
<v Speaker 1>your blood and then you're done for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and then you'll be anxious.</v>

784
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.870
<v Speaker 1>And another lot of the rest of you too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find if you're anxious,</v>

785
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:49.010
<v Speaker 1>try this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

786
00:41:49.011 --> 00:41:53.990
<v Speaker 1>really interesting experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next time you anxious,</v>

787
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.973
<v Speaker 1>go eat something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat like eat some protein and fat would </v>

788
00:41:57.861 --> 00:41:59.660
<v Speaker 1>be best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have cheese and crackers.</v>

789
00:41:59.661 --> 00:42:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big fan of carbohydrates but </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

790
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Eat whatever you're willing to eat but </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it solid.</v>

791
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:06.014
<v Speaker 1>Don't eat a peanut butter or don't need </v>
<v Speaker 1>a like a chocolate bar or something </v>

792
00:42:08.031 --> 00:42:09.860
<v Speaker 1>sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat something substantial,</v>

793
00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:11.420
<v Speaker 1>a piece of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of cheese,</v>

794
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.403
<v Speaker 1>some peanut butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and then wait 10 </v>

795
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:15.974
<v Speaker 1>minutes and see if you're less anxious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and try that for like two weeks every </v>

796
00:42:18.711 --> 00:42:19.544
<v Speaker 1>time you get anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat something because then you can find </v>

797
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:25.040
<v Speaker 1>out if you're anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're anxiety is linked to low blood</v>

798
00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:28.850
<v Speaker 1>sugar and it's very likely that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you also get irritable and</v>

799
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.880
<v Speaker 1>foggy and your thinking and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the best way to treat that as far as</v>

800
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I've been able to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a decent literature on this,</v>

801
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:39.470
<v Speaker 1>is to make sure that you eat a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast and you might say,</v>

802
00:42:39.471 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hungry in the morning.</v>

803
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell cares if you're hungry?</v>

804
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say enjoy your breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

805
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:47.240
<v Speaker 1>eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing.</v>

806
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.643
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things that you need to </v>

807
00:42:49.641 --> 00:42:52.580
<v Speaker 1>do that you don't enjoy to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get hungry in six months and then</v>

808
00:42:52.581 --> 00:42:55.460
<v Speaker 1>you'll start to enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a massive difference.</v>

809
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I take small naps quite frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm wiped out,</v>

810
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go have a nap for 10 minutes or 15 </v>

811
00:43:01.761 --> 00:43:04.700
<v Speaker 1>minutes and then that helps quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

812
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I try to wake up fairly regular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot on a fairly regular schedule.</v>

813
00:43:10.491 --> 00:43:11.324
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing I would really </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend for people whose lives are in </v>

814
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:17.210
<v Speaker 1>disarray and who are anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to fix your wake time,</v>

815
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.940
<v Speaker 1>sleep going when you sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not so important.</v>

816
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.240
<v Speaker 1>So you can still stay up late and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun and all that.</v>

817
00:43:23.241 --> 00:43:25.370
<v Speaker 1>But getting up in the morning is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>

818
00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

819
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

820
00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

821
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.210
<v Speaker 1>you also have to figure out how much you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can work or write.</v>

822
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:33.463
<v Speaker 1>I can't write for more than about Max.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My sustainable maximum for writing is </v>

823
00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:40.280
<v Speaker 1>three hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I push it past that,</v>

824
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.070
<v Speaker 1>then especially if I'm editing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

825
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm editing.</v>

826
00:43:44.751 --> 00:43:48.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's counterproductive and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustain it across time.</v>

827
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.940
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't really think you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than about three hours of extremely</v>

828
00:43:52.941 --> 00:43:55.910
<v Speaker 1>intense intellectual work a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although if you have a nap,</v>

829
00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.470
<v Speaker 1>you can stretch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think at least I end up paying for</v>

830
00:43:59.471 --> 00:44:02.450
<v Speaker 1>it across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nap,</v>

831
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.460
<v Speaker 1>make sure you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

832
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:05.623
<v Speaker 1>and make sure you eat protein and fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not carbohydrates because </v>

833
00:44:07.761 --> 00:44:10.380
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates are basically poisonous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

834
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:14.443
<v Speaker 1>that's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about and make sure that you get </v>

835
00:44:15.621 --> 00:44:17.210
<v Speaker 1>enough sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

836
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.750
<v Speaker 1>that's how I combat it and try to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself hyper efficient,</v>

837
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.880
<v Speaker 1>which is also a really interesting thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try.</v>

838
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:26.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my agents at CAA,</v>

839
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:27.074
<v Speaker 1>creative artists agency in La and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>hired a publicist to help me manage </v>

840
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:31.333
<v Speaker 1>media in a more intelligent manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're trying to think about our </v>

841
00:44:34.201 --> 00:44:35.760
<v Speaker 1>overarching philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

842
00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:36.603
<v Speaker 1>and I first proposed to the CA guys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are overarching philosophy would be </v>

843
00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you need an overarching philosophy</v>

844
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.260
<v Speaker 1>under which you nest all your specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

845
00:44:46.261 --> 00:44:49.560
<v Speaker 1>It was something like to educate as many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people as possible.</v>

846
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:52.500
<v Speaker 1>In the shortest period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems like a really good goal,</v>

847
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:53.334
<v Speaker 1>like why the hell not do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then we broadened out a little bit </v>

848
00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:58.710
<v Speaker 1>this week which was to try to do as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>good as possible,</v>

849
00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 1>as efficiently as possible and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency thing is really fun.</v>

850
00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.770
<v Speaker 1>If you guys who are listening are out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a challenge,</v>

851
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:05.604
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this heightens the meaning in </v>

852
00:45:08.071 --> 00:45:10.560
<v Speaker 1>your life is to try to do difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

853
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:11.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aim High,</v>

854
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.013
<v Speaker 1>don't name Sadam High,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't manage it and make sure you </v>

855
00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:19.410
<v Speaker 1>break down your aims into reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 1>attainable sub goals,</v>

856
00:45:19.411 --> 00:45:20.244
<v Speaker 1>but you want to aim high and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see how hyper efficient you can </v>

857
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:25.350
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great thing to do in your early</v>

858
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 1>twenties is to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

859
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:28.680
<v Speaker 1>like discipline yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

860
00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:29.514
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much work can I do if I load myself </v>

861
00:45:31.111 --> 00:45:33.960
<v Speaker 1>right to the maximum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far do I,</v>

862
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.823
<v Speaker 1>how far can I work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard can I work until I exhaust </v>

863
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:38.334
<v Speaker 1>myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you back off obviously because </v>

864
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.590
<v Speaker 1>the optimal amount of working productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement,</v>

865
00:45:43.591 --> 00:45:44.424
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that which is sustainable across </v>

866
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:47.820
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to,</v>

867
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.713
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't learn that without </v>

868
00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 1>stretching yourself to your limits to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

869
00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:53.423
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your life isn't everything it could </v>

870
00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:55.374
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're suffering from an excess </v>

871
00:45:56.671 --> 00:45:59.670
<v Speaker 1>of meaninglessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it means you're not oriented in the</v>

872
00:45:59.671 --> 00:46:00.504
<v Speaker 1>world of chaos and order properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could learn to discipline </v>

873
00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:04.470
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

874
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:05.304
<v Speaker 1>figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what it is that you need to </v>

875
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:09.540
<v Speaker 1>do and that you want to do and then see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how efficient you can get.</v>

876
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun is to figure out if you have a task.</v>

877
00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I always tell my graduate students this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're doing an experiment too,</v>

878
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:18.023
<v Speaker 1>if you have a task that you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting to spend a few </v>

879
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.860
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes hours,</v>

880
00:46:22.861 --> 00:46:23.694
<v Speaker 1>depending on how long the task is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can figure out how to do it </v>

881
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.290
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from five to 10 times faster.</v>

882
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.990
<v Speaker 1>It means you'll have to rearrange the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way you think about it,</v>

883
00:46:30.991 --> 00:46:32.130
<v Speaker 1>but you can often do it.</v>

884
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's how extremely productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get.</v>

885
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:35.690
<v Speaker 1>So hyper efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

886
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.593
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it means you have to delegate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means sometimes it means you have to </v>

887
00:46:38.671 --> 00:46:41.610
<v Speaker 1>bring other people aboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's delegation as well I suppose.</v>

888
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of preconceptions that</v>

889
00:46:44.461 --> 00:46:45.294
<v Speaker 1>you hold about who you are and who the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is that you could dispense with </v>

890
00:46:47.941 --> 00:46:50.670
<v Speaker 1>that would make you a way more efficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>actor in the world.</v>

891
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.830
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

892
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.060
<v Speaker 1>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

893
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:58.020
<v Speaker 1>If past experiences shape us from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment of birth,</v>

894
00:46:58.021 --> 00:46:58.854
<v Speaker 1>how can an action be ever said to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>result of freewill rather than the </v>

895
00:47:01.621 --> 00:47:03.630
<v Speaker 1>accumulation of past influences?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

896
00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:04.464
<v Speaker 1>it is in large part the accumulation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>past influences because that's </v>

897
00:47:06.811 --> 00:47:08.130
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I addressed that,</v>

898
00:47:08.131 --> 00:47:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I would say already pretty thoroughly in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my discussion of freewill.</v>

899
00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your freewill isn't absolute.</v>

900
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you a genie?</v>

901
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Even a genie is constrained inside a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lamp,</v>

902
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

903
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.990
<v Speaker 1>there's no action without constraint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no action without limitation.</v>

904
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

905
00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.690
<v Speaker 1>it's just not conceptualized well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your choices are constrained,</v>

906
00:47:27.691 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 1>not least by the fact that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep yourself alive.</v>

907
00:47:30.161 --> 00:47:34.570
<v Speaker 1>So even just because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations that emerge,</v>

908
00:47:34.571 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 1>say as a consequence of the accumulation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of past influences doesn't mean that you</v>

909
00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:39.124
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't still have a massive </v>

910
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:41.434
<v Speaker 1>domain of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is your opinion of attachment </v>

911
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:49.720
<v Speaker 1>based therapy and do you think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy is at risk of encouraging people</v>

912
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:50.554
<v Speaker 1>to wallow in self pity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not going to talk about </v>

913
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:53.314
<v Speaker 1>attachment based therapy cause I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know enough about it to provide an </v>

914
00:47:55.361 --> 00:47:56.194
<v Speaker 1>intelligent critique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can answer the second part of the </v>

915
00:47:58.061 --> 00:47:58.894
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I think that therapy risks </v>

916
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:02.260
<v Speaker 1>encouraging people to wallow in self </v>
<v Speaker 1>pity?</v>

917
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Not if it's done by a competent </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist.</v>

918
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.740
<v Speaker 1>If you're a therapist is encouraging you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to wallow in self pity,</v>

919
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:10.360
<v Speaker 1>then it's time to get the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

920
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:11.323
<v Speaker 1>You've got a therapist who thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to offer you a safe </v>

921
00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:15.310
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not helpful.</v>

922
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do as a therapist?</v>

923
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.013
<v Speaker 1>You Act as a strategic counselor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's imagine someone comes to see </v>

924
00:48:22.931 --> 00:48:24.760
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's two big mysteries,</v>

925
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:27.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong and what,</v>

926
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.400
<v Speaker 1>what would look better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong and,</v>

927
00:48:30.401 --> 00:48:32.170
<v Speaker 1>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it cure look like?</v>

928
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.840
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're a therapist,</v>

929
00:48:34.841 --> 00:48:35.674
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you want to do is figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that you don't know what's wrong </v>

930
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:39.730
<v Speaker 1>with this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And probably neither do they.</v>

931
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.650
<v Speaker 1>And you also don't know what's right for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

932
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 1>And so then you start talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person to try to solve that problem.</v>

933
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:45.341
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

934
00:48:45.341 --> 00:48:48.070
<v Speaker 1>you've come to see me because something </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't right in your life.</v>

935
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:49.803
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the person has to talk and </v>

936
00:48:51.791 --> 00:48:52.624
<v Speaker 1>talk and talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to ask them questions to </v>

937
00:48:53.771 --> 00:48:56.320
<v Speaker 1>find out because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're depressed,</v>

938
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:58.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they came from a terrible family.</v>

939
00:48:59.160 --> 00:48:59.993
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're really hard on themselves </v>

940
00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:03.310
<v Speaker 1>and things are actually going better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they think.</v>

941
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Like you have no idea what's wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

942
00:49:05.471 --> 00:49:07.090
<v Speaker 1>You're ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ignorant.</v>

943
00:49:07.091 --> 00:49:09.430
<v Speaker 1>And so are they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you say,</v>

944
00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:10.264
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell me anything as long try to </v>

945
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:12.574
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth because otherwise we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not going to get anywhere because </v>

946
00:49:14.261 --> 00:49:17.350
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to deal with reality here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me the truth.</v>

947
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be judgemental in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid sense.</v>

948
00:49:20.681 --> 00:49:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to judge like mad cause I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help you do things right.</v>

949
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.110
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be judging like mad,</v>

950
00:49:26.111 --> 00:49:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to throw you out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the things you say.</v>

951
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:29.883
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to wander all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird territory to explain your problem </v>

952
00:49:33.371 --> 00:49:36.130
<v Speaker 1>because you don't even know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to listen a lot.</v>

953
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.140
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing you want to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out is okay,</v>

954
00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:38.974
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the personal tell you a hundred </v>

955
00:49:41.801 --> 00:49:42.634
<v Speaker 1>things that might be wrong and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is quite painful to listen too </v>

956
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:46.180
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

957
00:49:46.181 --> 00:49:47.800
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you about their past and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their present.</v>

958
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean painful in that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging or that it's not worthwhile.</v>

959
00:49:53.621 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean people whose lives have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain in them.</v>

960
00:49:56.051 --> 00:49:56.884
<v Speaker 1>So it's painful to partake in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll tell you like a hundred </v>

961
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:03.310
<v Speaker 1>things that might be wrong and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do an analysis with them and you think,</v>

962
00:50:03.311 --> 00:50:04.144
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

963
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.570
<v Speaker 1>how many of those things really probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't a problem?</v>

964
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:10.780
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that happens is if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>let a person talk about,</v>

965
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.910
<v Speaker 1>let's say they tell you about a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

966
00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.110
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you find out is that 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them aren't real problems.</v>

967
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:20.500
<v Speaker 1>And the person just figures that out as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they talked them through.</v>

968
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.453
<v Speaker 1>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's linked to this and maybe </v>

969
00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:23.374
<v Speaker 1>that's not really a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not as bad as I thought it </v>

970
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.380
<v Speaker 1>wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can probably ignore that.</v>

971
00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:27.214
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have a handful of cards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't organized and they don't </v>

972
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:33.560
<v Speaker 1>know what to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many cards.</v>

973
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 1>And so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

974
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.450
<v Speaker 1>lay your cards on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

975
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:38.303
<v Speaker 1>This is also what you do when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to someone you're intimate </v>

976
00:50:40.101 --> 00:50:42.830
<v Speaker 1>with and they're trying to solve a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and you have to be patient to do</v>

977
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:44.720
<v Speaker 1>this cause they're all upset about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

978
00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

979
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:46.303
<v Speaker 1>And you don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they're upset about you and </v>

980
00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:50.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're upset about themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not handling it very well,</v>

981
00:50:50.871 --> 00:50:54.260
<v Speaker 1>and they're impulsive and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and volatile and hard on you.</v>

982
00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:55.041
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

983
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to listen to you.</v>

984
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:58.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your stupid problem?</v>

985
00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:00.590
<v Speaker 1>And then they lay out their problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

986
00:51:00.591 --> 00:51:01.424
<v Speaker 1>The problem space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to listen and not jump in </v>

987
00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:07.250
<v Speaker 1>there too quickly with a dam solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what the hell do you know?</v>

988
00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:09.560
<v Speaker 1>So you listened to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay out the problem space,</v>

989
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:11.870
<v Speaker 1>they lay their cards on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you say,</v>

990
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:12.704
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to pay attention to this </v>

991
00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:15.080
<v Speaker 1>and we don't have to pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

992
00:51:15.081 --> 00:51:15.914
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to pay attention to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the cutting the dragon of </v>

993
00:51:18.051 --> 00:51:20.450
<v Speaker 1>chaos down to size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

994
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.030
<v Speaker 1>You look at the dragon of chaos and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to shrink.</v>

995
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:24.403
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

996
00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:25.903
<v Speaker 1>and that's because by looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you indicate to the dragon that you're </v>

997
00:51:29.001 --> 00:51:29.834
<v Speaker 1>bigger than you thought you were and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're bigger than it thought you </v>

998
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:34.220
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>

999
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:35.390
<v Speaker 1>very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1000
00:51:35.391 --> 00:51:38.030
<v Speaker 1>you lay out your cards and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to organize them.</v>

1001
00:51:38.031 --> 00:51:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well actually I only have 10 problems.</v>

1002
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:41.750
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

1003
00:51:41.751 --> 00:51:42.584
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we break those problems down </v>

1004
00:51:43.431 --> 00:51:44.264
<v Speaker 1>into manageable sub problems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how can you go about addressing </v>

1005
00:51:46.191 --> 00:51:47.780
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be very complicated.</v>

1006
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I hate my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1007
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:51.350
<v Speaker 1>do you have an alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1008
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:52.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

1009
00:51:52.461 --> 00:51:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a resume.</v>

1010
00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I hate being interviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid to make a resume.</v>

1011
00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I lost up my education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1012
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1013
00:52:00.651 --> 00:52:02.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of problems man.</v>

1014
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1015
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.303
<v Speaker 1>those are strategic problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to figure out how to </v>

1016
00:52:06.111 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 1>help the PR person strategize and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>implement the strategies.</v>

1017
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.840
<v Speaker 1>And so the next step is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1018
00:52:11.841 --> 00:52:12.674
<v Speaker 1>now we know your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could have a solution like that </v>

1019
00:52:17.031 --> 00:52:20.420
<v Speaker 1>would be the opposite of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What might a solution looked like?</v>

1020
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Same issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1021
00:52:22.401 --> 00:52:23.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of solutions.</v>

1022
00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what job to have.</v>

1023
00:52:26.091 --> 00:52:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what person to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1024
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:29.743
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish a long term intimate </v>

1025
00:52:31.461 --> 00:52:32.294
<v Speaker 1>relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I would like to do </v>

1026
00:52:33.711 --> 00:52:34.544
<v Speaker 1>with my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to use my time outside </v>

1027
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:36.884
<v Speaker 1>of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to resist temptation </v>

1028
00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:40.910
<v Speaker 1>like drug and alcohol abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1029
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:41.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to take care of myself </v>

1030
00:52:43.311 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 1>mentally and physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these complicated problems.</v>

1031
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:46.911
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1032
00:52:46.911 --> 00:52:50.540
<v Speaker 1>let's sketch out a potential solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could have what you wanted.</v>

1033
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:51.920
<v Speaker 1>So that would be a cure.</v>

1034
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:55.430
<v Speaker 1>What would that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We formalize this by the way,</v>

1035
00:52:55.431 --> 00:52:56.264
<v Speaker 1>in the future authoring process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you do the future authoring </v>

1036
00:52:58.341 --> 00:52:59.174
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the self authoring </v>

1037
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:02.420
<v Speaker 1>suite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will guide you through doing this.</v>

1038
00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:03.363
<v Speaker 1>And it's unbelievably useful to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're not going to hit what you </v>

1039
00:53:05.931 --> 00:53:07.850
<v Speaker 1>don't aim at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1040
00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:10.100
<v Speaker 1>so then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the person lay out,</v>

1041
00:53:10.101 --> 00:53:11.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well where are we headed?</v>

1042
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.313
<v Speaker 1>It's a map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know where we are and it's a </v>

1043
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:14.804
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have to figure out where we're </v>

1044
00:53:15.831 --> 00:53:17.240
<v Speaker 1>headed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1045
00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:20.120
<v Speaker 1>and then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we figure out where we're headed,</v>

1046
00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>we have to figure out how to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to make the map.</v>

1047
00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.500
<v Speaker 1>It's got a beginning place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got an in place.</v>

1048
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Now we have to map out the terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

1049
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:32.340
<v Speaker 1>well I didn't finish my degree or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to college or maybe I didn't</v>

1050
00:53:32.341 --> 00:53:33.120
<v Speaker 1>finish high school.</v>

1051
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:33.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1052
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.430
<v Speaker 1>do you need a different job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1053
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you need a high school diploma to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1054
00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:38.693
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What steps do you have to take to get a </v>

1055
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:43.240
<v Speaker 1>high school diploma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1056
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to start with one course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1057
00:53:46.171 --> 00:53:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you find the course?</v>

1058
00:53:47.461 --> 00:53:48.294
<v Speaker 1>You'd go look it up online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What things make you afraid to go back </v>

1059
00:53:51.241 --> 00:53:53.280
<v Speaker 1>to school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which of those things are stopping you?</v>

1060
00:53:53.281 --> 00:53:55.080
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to overcome those </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears?</v>

1061
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.063
<v Speaker 1>So you take the large scale vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the place you're headed to in </v>

1062
00:53:58.801 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the cure.</v>

1063
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:04.080
<v Speaker 1>And then you break it down into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategic elements that are necessary to</v>

1064
00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:04.914
<v Speaker 1>be implemented on a day to day basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do that so that they're </v>

1065
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.110
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But attainable.</v>

1066
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 1>And then the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're not difficult,</v>

1067
00:54:12.661 --> 00:54:14.760
<v Speaker 1>then they're not worth attaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

1068
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you're not pushing yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want the person not only to </v>

1069
00:54:18.691 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 1>develop in the direction they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to develop,</v>

1070
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.860
<v Speaker 1>but you want to get them better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing.</v>

1071
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:26.100
<v Speaker 1>So you want to push them just like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with kids or yourself if you have any</v>

1072
00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:30.870
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll break it down into small,</v>

1073
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.850
<v Speaker 1>implementable daily processes and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you review those with your,</v>

1074
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:39.030
<v Speaker 1>with your client.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that's wallowing in self pity,</v>

1075
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary,</v>

1076
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.330
<v Speaker 1>quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1077
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:46.440
<v Speaker 1>so psychotherapy is get your story </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1078
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Who are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going,</v>

1079
00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.610
<v Speaker 1>where are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your strategy?</v>

1080
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.013
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to learn to overcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>the frightening and unexpected things </v>

1081
00:54:54.511 --> 00:54:57.630
<v Speaker 1>that are going to pop up at you when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>implement that strategy?</v>

1082
00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.960
<v Speaker 1>So in those can be some of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be the natural world.</v>

1083
00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of illness,</v>

1084
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:04.703
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of those can be the social </v>

1085
00:55:06.751 --> 00:55:07.980
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of my boss.</v>

1086
00:55:07.981 --> 00:55:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of my friends.</v>

1087
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of being humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid that people won't like me.</v>

1088
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two big classes of fears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1089
00:55:16.411 --> 00:55:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Fear of the Great Mother Nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of the great father culture.</v>

1090
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.353
<v Speaker 1>And if you're really afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to have both those fears at the </v>

1091
00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:23.844
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's nothing about that that's </v>

1092
00:55:25.591 --> 00:55:27.900
<v Speaker 1>wallowing in self pity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>

1093
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:31.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad therapist that does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not there to make,</v>

1094
00:55:31.141 --> 00:55:31.974
<v Speaker 1>to feel sorry for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are there to be on the side of the </v>

1095
00:55:35.941 --> 00:55:40.560
<v Speaker 1>part of you that's aiming up and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage you and to allow you to have a</v>

1096
00:55:40.561 --> 00:55:45.030
<v Speaker 1>space where you can lay out your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts using your free speech to think</v>

1097
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.180
<v Speaker 1>where you can lay out your thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what's wrong with you and how that</v>

1098
00:55:48.181 --> 00:55:51.480
<v Speaker 1>might be set right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has nothing to do with wallowing in self</v>

1099
00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:52.314
<v Speaker 1>pity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to calculate high </v>

1100
00:55:55.201 --> 00:55:58.770
<v Speaker 1>resolution utopia for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only to have it squandered by fortune.</v>

1101
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:01.980
<v Speaker 1>How do I ensure the meaning I </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced a self determined?</v>

1102
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Well you can't because there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary element to existence.</v>

1103
00:56:07.081 --> 00:56:10.530
<v Speaker 1>So it is going to be squandered to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree by fortune,</v>

1104
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.150
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the point.</v>

1105
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:12.984
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sit back on your laurels and wait </v>

1106
00:56:14.521 --> 00:56:16.950
<v Speaker 1>for things to roll over you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you do,</v>

1107
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.190
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero myth basically says,</v>

1108
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:22.980
<v Speaker 1>go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confront the drag,</v>

1109
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.970
<v Speaker 1>get the gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>share it with the community and,</v>

1110
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.500
<v Speaker 1>and live properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it says the alternative.</v>

1111
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:31.060
<v Speaker 1>He has faced the tyrant.</v>

1112
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Enter the desert as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything falls apart.</v>

1113
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Recast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

1114
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:38.943
<v Speaker 1>find the promise land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two elements to the hero </v>

1115
00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:43.180
<v Speaker 1>myth and you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's divine.</v>

1116
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 1>It's the closest thing to divine that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1117
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:46.540
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1118
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.570
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you follow the divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>path?</v>

1119
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 1>And the answer might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1120
00:56:51.401 --> 00:56:54.520
<v Speaker 1>everything turns out perfectly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>God is on your side.</v>

1121
00:56:54.521 --> 00:56:55.354
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1122
00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.050
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what happens because things </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't turn out perfectly.</v>

1123
00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:02.620
<v Speaker 1>It's your best bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your best strategy,</v>

1124
00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:04.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1125
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:05.883
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragons wouldn't be dragons if they </v>

1126
00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:09.640
<v Speaker 1>couldn't eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1127
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:12.010
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

1128
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And this is something I found so useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the biblical stories,</v>

1129
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.113
<v Speaker 1>especially about the abrahamic stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't know that well until I </v>

1130
00:57:18.041 --> 00:57:19.900
<v Speaker 1>lectured about them last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1131
00:57:19.901 --> 00:57:22.960
<v Speaker 1>God calls people to the adventure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives.</v>

1132
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is that force within you,</v>

1133
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.570
<v Speaker 1>which calls you to the adventure of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1134
00:57:28.571 --> 00:57:30.190
<v Speaker 1>And it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from your family.</v>

1135
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:31.203
<v Speaker 1>Get away from your blind and unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort and get the hell out there in </v>

1136
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:35.320
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1137
00:57:35.321 --> 00:57:36.154
<v Speaker 1>God calls Abraham out from his father's </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he stayed far too long and from </v>

1138
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:42.940
<v Speaker 1>his kin where it's secure and like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing he encounters is a famine.</v>

1139
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:43.953
<v Speaker 1>And then he encounters a tyranny </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabited by people who want to steal </v>

1140
00:57:46.301 --> 00:57:47.980
<v Speaker 1>his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you think,</v>

1141
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:49.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keith Abraham,</v>

1142
00:57:49.391 --> 00:57:52.600
<v Speaker 1>he should have just stayed in bed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored God obviously.</v>

1143
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't how it is.</v>

1144
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:57.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're built for struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>US human beings,</v>

1145
00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:02.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not after the bubbles of blessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does Dsq described in,</v>

1146
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.770
<v Speaker 1>in notes from underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're built to contend with the world.</v>

1147
00:58:05.771 --> 00:58:07.420
<v Speaker 1>We're built to contend with reality.</v>

1148
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:11.740
<v Speaker 1>You want to challenge and the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can take on a challenge because</v>

1149
00:58:11.741 --> 00:58:13.000
<v Speaker 1>it challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortifies you.</v>

1150
00:58:13.001 --> 00:58:16.240
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to be secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be strong and you get strong</v>

1151
00:58:16.241 --> 00:58:17.074
<v Speaker 1>by taking on optimal challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you lay out your destiny in the </v>

1152
00:58:19.991 --> 00:58:20.824
<v Speaker 1>world and you take the slings and arrows</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fate and you make yourself stronger </v>

1153
00:58:23.531 --> 00:58:24.364
<v Speaker 1>while you're doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might fail and fortune might do </v>

1154
00:58:26.711 --> 00:58:28.840
<v Speaker 1>you in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's your best bet.</v>

1155
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.033
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have also people if that </v>

1156
00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:36.580
<v Speaker 1>extracted unbelievable successes out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic failures.</v>

1157
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:39.700
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that in a naive way,</v>

1158
00:58:39.701 --> 00:58:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I know perfectly well what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1159
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:42.543
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing fine in life and then you </v>

1160
00:58:43.661 --> 00:58:44.494
<v Speaker 1>get cancer and then six months later </v>
<v Speaker 1>your debt and all the heroism in the </v>

1161
00:58:47.651 --> 00:58:49.420
<v Speaker 1>world isn't going to save you at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1162
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point.</v>

1163
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Life is bounded by mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that you don't get</v>

1164
00:58:56.411 --> 00:58:57.244
<v Speaker 1>out there and contend and you develop by</v>
<v Speaker 1>contending and you minimize the net </v>

1165
00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:03.460
<v Speaker 1>amount of suffering in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something,</v>

1166
00:59:03.461 --> 00:59:04.660
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something to do.</v>

1167
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:06.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1168
00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:07.173
<v Speaker 1>it beats laying in your basement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting bitter and then doing the </v>

1169
00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:14.970
<v Speaker 1>terrible things that bitter people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't ensure that the meaning you</v>

1170
00:59:15.371 --> 00:59:16.204
<v Speaker 1>experience his self determined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can play your role to the best </v>

1171
00:59:19.661 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 1>of your ability and that will be good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and that will be good enough.</v>

1172
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:25.503
<v Speaker 1>That meaning the meaning that you all </v>
<v Speaker 1>find in then in that I believe is </v>

1173
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:34.910
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to be sustaining and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>even sustaining through the flood.</v>

1174
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:38.240
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't that you can avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>

1175
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:42.740
<v Speaker 1>it's that you can prepare yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with it honorably when it arrives.</v>

1176
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what you've got.</v>

1177
00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I have very high order lead ness and low</v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness.</v>

1178
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.850
<v Speaker 1>23rd I have very high orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90th percentile,</v>

1179
00:59:55.851 --> 00:59:58.430
<v Speaker 1>low industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23rd percentile.</v>

1180
00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:00.860
<v Speaker 1>What can I do to remedy this and get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher industriousness?</v>

1181
01:00:00.861 --> 01:00:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1182
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.670
<v Speaker 1>that's not that low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1183
01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.620
<v Speaker 1>we've got to think about percentiles </v>
<v Speaker 1>here for a minute.</v>

1184
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're not percentages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're different.</v>

1185
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>So if you're at the 23rd percentile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there were four people in a room,</v>

1186
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:15.320
<v Speaker 1>you'd be the least industrious of four </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and that kind of puts you in the</v>

1187
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:17.660
<v Speaker 1>average range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big of deal.</v>

1188
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:18.913
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's problems with it and we'll get </v>

1189
01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:21.380
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you may,</v>

1190
01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're high in openness to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

1191
01:00:23.811 --> 01:00:24.644
<v Speaker 1>I won't get into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>low would be fifth percentile because </v>

1192
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:29.504
<v Speaker 1>that makes you one in 20 or second </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile cause that makes you one in </v>

1193
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:33.104
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like interesting to v </v>

1194
01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.273
<v Speaker 1>visualize a fairly large high school </v>
<v Speaker 1>class and then to think of yourself as </v>

1195
01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:39.050
<v Speaker 1>situated in there.</v>

1196
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>If you're the least industrious person </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of 50,</v>

1197
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:42.943
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better be smart or have some other </v>

1198
01:00:45.021 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>things going for you because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have a hard time being diligent</v>

1199
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>enough to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1200
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:51.853
<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and maybe first percentile makes you </v>

1201
01:00:55.311 --> 01:00:59.120
<v Speaker 1>one in a hundred and 0.0 0.1%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you one in a thousand.</v>

1202
01:00:59.121 --> 01:01:01.100
<v Speaker 1>So you got to think about percentiles </v>
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>

1203
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so having said that,</v>

1204
01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're not very high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness,</v>

1205
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>what should you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

1206
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>make a damn plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1207
01:01:09.651 --> 01:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>you need a plan for your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say use the future authoring</v>

1208
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>program because that will help you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a plan or make a plan on your own.</v>

1209
01:01:16.551 --> 01:01:17.384
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or make a plan because you talk to </v>

1210
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:19.850
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1211
01:01:19.851 --> 01:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>we put the future authoring program </v>
<v Speaker 1>together to help people develop a vision</v>

1212
01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:28.280
<v Speaker 1>of where they could be a counter vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>to scare the hell out of them by helping</v>

1213
01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:29.114
<v Speaker 1>them think through how catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 1>things could become if they let all </v>

1214
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:32.144
<v Speaker 1>their stupidities get the upper hand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a second part of the program that </v>

1215
01:01:35.631 --> 01:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>helps you make a strategy.</v>

1216
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>And we know the future authoring program</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps people,</v>

1217
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>young men in particular who are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

1218
01:01:42.021 --> 01:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in academic situations,</v>

1219
01:01:43.671 --> 01:01:44.504
<v Speaker 1>it increases the probability that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will stay in college and university by </v>

1220
01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.613
<v Speaker 1>between 25 and 50%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So make a damn plant and make when you </v>

1221
01:01:51.981 --> 01:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like don't make a plan.</v>

1222
01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:57.350
<v Speaker 1>That is what you should do even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be what you should do.</v>

1223
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Make a plan that outlines a future so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could sit back and say,</v>

1224
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had that future,</v>

1225
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.143
<v Speaker 1>then all the horrible things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen to me are going to be </v>

1226
01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:09.560
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want.</v>

1227
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to think this game is worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing despite its tragedy?</v>

1228
01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.713
<v Speaker 1>That's what you've got in life and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>for meaning to serve as an antidote to </v>

1229
01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:19.184
<v Speaker 1>tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right now and then you generate a </v>

1230
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:22.074
<v Speaker 1>strategy and then the other thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do if you're not very </v>

1231
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:24.744
<v Speaker 1>industrious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrious is disciplined yourself and </v>

1232
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do with that?</v>

1233
01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Eat three times a day at regular meal </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

1234
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:33.293
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to practice because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that starts to put some stability into </v>

1235
01:02:36.241 --> 01:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get up at the same time.</v>

1236
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:39.443
<v Speaker 1>I would highly recommend all those young</v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there who are listening like </v>

1237
01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>you want to get a jump on life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the hell out of bed in the morning.</v>

1238
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've got older,</v>

1239
01:02:46.891 --> 01:02:47.724
<v Speaker 1>I've got up earlier and earlier now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly because you don't need as </v>

1240
01:02:49.651 --> 01:02:50.484
<v Speaker 1>much sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly because I've got </v>

1241
01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>more and more disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like get up early in the morning and get</v>

1242
01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>your things done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1243
01:02:57.090 --> 01:03:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Learn to get up at six in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll be one deadly creature,</v>

1244
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:01.023
<v Speaker 1>especially if you can get to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have half your damn day down by </v>

1245
01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:06.480
<v Speaker 1>the time other people haul their story </v>
<v Speaker 1>houses out of bed.</v>

1246
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive advantage.</v>

1247
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Look will pharrel Warren Farrell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the comedian Warren Farrell,</v>

1248
01:03:13.921 --> 01:03:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He outlined data in why men earn more,</v>

1249
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:19.650
<v Speaker 1>which is a book I would recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1250
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.620
<v Speaker 1>showing that if you work 13% longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

1251
01:03:22.621 --> 01:03:25.820
<v Speaker 1>you make 40% more money and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonlinear.</v>

1252
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.120
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

1253
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you had 10 employees and one of </v>

1254
01:03:29.491 --> 01:03:33.180
<v Speaker 1>them works and extra 10% it's not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1255
01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:36.630
<v Speaker 1>how often is that person going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted,</v>

1256
01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:40.290
<v Speaker 1>assuming you have a clue as a boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're going to look at the 10</v>

1257
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:41.051
<v Speaker 1>people and you gotta think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1258
01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:43.650
<v Speaker 1>that guy's always here like 45 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>early.</v>

1259
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we give him the promotion,</v>

1260
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.190
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1261
01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:48.024
<v Speaker 1>So these tied these small edges that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can manage like that work an extra 10% </v>

1262
01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:56.040
<v Speaker 1>extra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13% have non-proportional payoffs.</v>

1263
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.900
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the parade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh distribution.</v>

1264
01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:03.090
<v Speaker 1>So get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your sleep cycle organized.</v>

1265
01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:04.980
<v Speaker 1>So you get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to do it.</v>

1266
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.320
<v Speaker 1>No excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too tired in the morning.</v>

1267
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't like mornings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

1268
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 1>That's not relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like discipline yourself so you can</v>

1269
01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:13.134
<v Speaker 1>manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schedule your meals cause that's a good </v>

1270
01:04:15.631 --> 01:04:16.464
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then learn to use a calendar like </v>

1271
01:04:19.471 --> 01:04:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Google calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of you,</v>

1272
01:04:20.881 --> 01:04:22.890
<v Speaker 1>many of you out there do not use a </v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar.</v>

1273
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:24.023
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A calendar is not a prison and it's not </v>

1274
01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not if you use it properly.</v>

1275
01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:29.183
<v Speaker 1>A calendar keeps anxiety at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sure that you do what you need </v>

1276
01:04:32.941 --> 01:04:34.920
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is important because otherwise you</v>

1277
01:04:34.921 --> 01:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>fall behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you use it property though,</v>

1278
01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.510
<v Speaker 1>it's also helps you plan what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1279
01:04:39.511 --> 01:04:40.550
<v Speaker 1>So I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Leo,</v>

1280
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.560
<v Speaker 1>your damn calendar and designed the days</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would like to have.</v>

1281
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what your calendar is.</v>

1282
01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Ha is four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can put in all sorts of things in</v>

1283
01:04:48.991 --> 01:04:51.330
<v Speaker 1>there you want to do and that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

1284
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:52.463
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good way to start being more </v>

1285
01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:57.330
<v Speaker 1>industrious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a plan.</v>

1286
01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:01.890
<v Speaker 1>You need a plan for three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a plan for the next year,</v>

1287
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you need to plan for the next six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

1288
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.610
<v Speaker 1>you need to plan for the next three </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

1289
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:09.090
<v Speaker 1>You need a plan for the week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a plan for the day,</v>

1290
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:11.820
<v Speaker 1>you need to plan for the hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

1291
01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:12.923
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make lists constantly of what I have </v>

1292
01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:16.800
<v Speaker 1>to do and they're like daily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weekly,</v>

1293
01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>monthly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yearly.</v>

1294
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Right now I can't look out more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>about six months,</v>

1295
01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:21.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause my life is too complicated and </v>

1296
01:05:22.691 --> 01:05:23.524
<v Speaker 1>chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1297
01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>but you need a vision of who you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1298
01:05:26.621 --> 01:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>what character you could have three to </v>
<v Speaker 1>five years out.</v>

1299
01:05:29.141 --> 01:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>You can't go much farther than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because life is too unpredictable.</v>

1300
01:05:33.281 --> 01:05:34.114
<v Speaker 1>I think to make vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's longer term than that subject </v>

1301
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:39.634
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1302
01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>There's too much chance associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to spend a lot of time on.</v>

1303
01:05:44.381 --> 01:05:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can stretch it to five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in rare cases you can have a 10 year</v>

1304
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be pretty low resolution.</v>

1305
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>But you want plans at all those levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>of resolution.</v>

1306
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>You want to write the things down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1307
01:05:56.201 --> 01:05:58.450
<v Speaker 1>because what are you gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna Stumble around and get,</v>

1308
01:05:58.451 --> 01:05:59.284
<v Speaker 1>get what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to stumble around and be </v>

1309
01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:01.624
<v Speaker 1>useful to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's useful to be useful to other </v>

1310
01:06:03.851 --> 01:06:04.684
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1311
01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.570
<v Speaker 1>they want to work with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they want to do things with you.</v>

1312
01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.310
<v Speaker 1>They want to have you around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they trust you,</v>

1313
01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:12.490
<v Speaker 1>they open up opportunities for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you stumble around,</v>

1314
01:06:12.491 --> 01:06:13.324
<v Speaker 1>like you're blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna get anywhere and then </v>

1315
01:06:14.741 --> 01:06:17.170
<v Speaker 1>you're going to suffer and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be bitter and then you're going</v>

1316
01:06:17.171 --> 01:06:18.004
<v Speaker 1>to be cruel.</v>

1317
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's a bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hell.</v>

1318
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:22.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unless you want that,</v>

1319
01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:24.670
<v Speaker 1>don't aim for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And or,</v>

1320
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.100
<v Speaker 1>or aim for the opposite because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you get out of it.</v>

1321
01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.293
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical attractiveness is extensively </v>

1322
01:06:31.781 --> 01:06:32.614
<v Speaker 1>studied in departments of psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big of a determinant of success is </v>

1323
01:06:35.471 --> 01:06:38.140
<v Speaker 1>it apart from Iq or any of the other big</v>
<v Speaker 1>five traits?</v>

1324
01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tough.</v>

1325
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:45.640
<v Speaker 1>One because physical attractiveness is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex trait.</v>

1326
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

1327
01:06:47.021 --> 01:06:47.854
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a marker of health and of course </v>

1328
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.260
<v Speaker 1>health is a mar is a prerequisite for </v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

1329
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:54.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1330
01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.413
<v Speaker 1>I you can't take attractiveness as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>unitary dimension and measure it </v>

1331
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:02.480
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1332
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I should back up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one that I know of has taken physical</v>

1333
01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:07.984
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness as a unitary concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measured it accurately and then pitted </v>

1334
01:07:12.311 --> 01:07:15.730
<v Speaker 1>against Iq and the big five to see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1335
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:16.833
<v Speaker 1>to what degree it adds incremental </v>
<v Speaker 1>validity to the prediction of longterm </v>

1336
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.880
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but physical,</v>

1337
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:22.833
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I can't give you a technical </v>

1338
01:07:24.161 --> 01:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

1339
01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say,</v>

1340
01:07:25.391 --> 01:07:26.224
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a complex job over the long run Iq </v>

1341
01:07:28.331 --> 01:07:29.164
<v Speaker 1>accounts for maybe 20% of the variance </v>
<v Speaker 1>in success leaving 80% therefore random </v>

1342
01:07:34.391 --> 01:07:35.224
<v Speaker 1>events and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the big five traits and connection </v>

1343
01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:38.254
<v Speaker 1>networks and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and family background and all those </v>

1344
01:07:40.361 --> 01:07:43.450
<v Speaker 1>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender perhaps that all the other things</v>

1345
01:07:43.451 --> 01:07:45.890
<v Speaker 1>that determine success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical a true,</v>

1346
01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:46.763
<v Speaker 1>we know that physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people who are physically </v>

1347
01:07:48.371 --> 01:07:51.610
<v Speaker 1>attractive though are given the benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of doubt by other people.</v>

1348
01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:52.863
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they benefit from the positive halo </v>

1349
01:07:54.551 --> 01:07:55.384
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the positive halo effect is the </v>

1350
01:07:56.441 --> 01:08:00.190
<v Speaker 1>propensity of people to assume good </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about someone.</v>

1351
01:08:00.191 --> 01:08:03.760
<v Speaker 1>If there is one outstanding thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them that's easily evident,</v>

1352
01:08:03.790 --> 01:08:05.650
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're,</v>

1353
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.053
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stand up straight with your </v>

1354
01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:09.034
<v Speaker 1>shoulders back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's rule one and 12 rules for </v>

1355
01:08:10.841 --> 01:08:12.520
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people are going to see you as more</v>

1356
01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:14.200
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're symmetrical,</v>

1357
01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:17.510
<v Speaker 1>you're more attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're thin but not too thin,</v>

1358
01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>you're more attractive.</v>

1359
01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's like good skin and good</v>

1360
01:08:22.691 --> 01:08:26.500
<v Speaker 1>teeth and good heroin and all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in proper proportions and youth.</v>

1361
01:08:26.501 --> 01:08:28.470
<v Speaker 1>And there's a whole slew of things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1362
01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:29.503
<v Speaker 1>that feed into that if you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by a plethora of those </v>

1363
01:08:32.621 --> 01:08:33.454
<v Speaker 1>features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people are also going to assume </v>

1364
01:08:34.481 --> 01:08:37.870
<v Speaker 1>that you're more competent and more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

1365
01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:41.680
<v Speaker 1>more worth having around let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

1366
01:08:41.681 --> 01:08:42.514
<v Speaker 1>is that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so separating out the attractiveness </v>

1367
01:08:45.911 --> 01:08:49.360
<v Speaker 1>from the things the attractiveness are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is correlated with is very hard.</v>

1368
01:08:49.361 --> 01:08:51.940
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have to do multivariate </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

1369
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:52.833
<v Speaker 1>That's multivariable analysis in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex social science because a lot of </v>

1370
01:08:56.951 --> 01:08:59.020
<v Speaker 1>these traits overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1371
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.790
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1372
01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:01.683
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1373
01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.940
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things you can do about that.</v>

1374
01:09:03.941 --> 01:09:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Postural adjustment is helpful to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with weights.</v>

1375
01:09:07.481 --> 01:09:10.090
<v Speaker 1>That's extraordinarily helpful that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>increases,</v>

1376
01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>improves your posture and makes you more</v>
<v Speaker 1>confident and,</v>

1377
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.510
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1378
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:14.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at,</v>

1379
01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.480
<v Speaker 1>and you can dress reasonably well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligently and,</v>

1380
01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things too,</v>

1381
01:09:21.421 --> 01:09:25.360
<v Speaker 1>to help yourself capitalize on whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness you can muster.</v>

1382
01:09:25.690 --> 01:09:26.523
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1383
01:09:31.150 --> 01:09:33.550
<v Speaker 1>what is your view on psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>egoism?</v>

1384
01:09:33.551 --> 01:09:36.010
<v Speaker 1>If we're all ultimately acting out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>self interest,</v>

1385
01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.113
<v Speaker 1>then does altruism have any merit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the questions well post </v>

1386
01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:41.613
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those questions that leads </v>

1387
01:09:42.701 --> 01:09:43.534
<v Speaker 1>into a philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dead end because it's not well post </v>

1388
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:47.223
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't any such thing as self </v>

1389
01:09:48.731 --> 01:09:51.490
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right way to think about it</v>

1390
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.050
<v Speaker 1>because you're not alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is why like piaget,</v>

1391
01:09:56.051 --> 01:10:01.051
<v Speaker 1>John Piaget cause he thought about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligently look first of all who self</v>

1392
01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:05.230
<v Speaker 1>interest you meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean your immediate self interest</v>

1393
01:10:05.231 --> 01:10:07.330
<v Speaker 1>in the next second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be impulsive pleasure.</v>

1394
01:10:07.331 --> 01:10:08.164
<v Speaker 1>We're all acting for the gaining of </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive pleasure and to hell with </v>

1395
01:10:10.751 --> 01:10:11.584
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously that's a stupid way to </v>

1396
01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:18.010
<v Speaker 1>behave because everyone knows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can do impulsive,</v>

1397
01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.113
<v Speaker 1>short term gratifying things like snort </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine now and you can keep doing that </v>

1398
01:10:22.781 --> 01:10:23.614
<v Speaker 1>and it pay off real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real well in the extremely short term </v>

1399
01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:30.850
<v Speaker 1>and they'll just auger you into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground in the medium to long term.</v>

1400
01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:34.240
<v Speaker 1>So if you're acting in your own self </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>

1401
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:38.350
<v Speaker 1>let's take that apart over what period </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

1402
01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1403
01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Your self interest in the next second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're self interest in the next hour.</v>

1404
01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.453
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're impulsive and you want to </v>

1405
01:10:46.091 --> 01:10:46.924
<v Speaker 1>gratify an impulse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously acting in your self </v>

1406
01:10:48.641 --> 01:10:52.510
<v Speaker 1>interest in the next second or the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>two seconds or the next minute.</v>

1407
01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.040
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll pay for that.</v>

1408
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you punch someone or you slap </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone cause you're so angry and they,</v>

1409
01:10:57.881 --> 01:10:58.714
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they knock you for a loop and then </v>

1410
01:11:00.011 --> 01:11:02.860
<v Speaker 1>they charge you with assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1411
01:11:02.861 --> 01:11:05.830
<v Speaker 1>so well it was great in your self </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in the second,</v>

1412
01:11:05.831 --> 01:11:09.640
<v Speaker 1>but like future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that simpsons episode,</v>

1413
01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>homer drank a quarter manet's and vodka </v>
<v Speaker 1>and margin,</v>

1414
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.080
<v Speaker 1>all his kids were telling him not to and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1415
01:11:16.081 --> 01:11:19.710
<v Speaker 1>well that's a problem for future homer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sure don't envy that guy.</v>

1416
01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the best Simpson's lines</v>

1417
01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:22.501
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1418
01:11:22.501 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And well that's it.</v>

1419
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1420
01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:26.310
<v Speaker 1>well there isn't just you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1421
01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>there's now you and there's tonight you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's tomorrow morning you,</v>

1422
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:33.360
<v Speaker 1>that's the one that'll have the hangover</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1423
01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:37.350
<v Speaker 1>And there's next week you and next month</v>
<v Speaker 1>and next year you and old you.</v>

1424
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.660
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to act in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>self interest,</v>

1425
01:11:39.661 --> 01:11:40.494
<v Speaker 1>you have to take that collective of use </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time into account when you make </v>

1426
01:11:44.761 --> 01:11:45.594
<v Speaker 1>your decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now here's the cool thing about </v>

1427
01:11:47.461 --> 01:11:48.450
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then that say,</v>

1428
01:11:48.451 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 1>well that would be acting in your self </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest writ large,</v>

1429
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:52.014
<v Speaker 1>right across times pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is future you and someone </v>

1430
01:11:56.371 --> 01:11:58.650
<v Speaker 1>else that you have to live with right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now that's not,</v>

1431
01:11:58.651 --> 01:11:59.484
<v Speaker 1>you are pretty much the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to act in your </v>

1432
01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:04.560
<v Speaker 1>self interest and you have other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you,</v>

1433
01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:05.394
<v Speaker 1>then you also want to act in their self </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest because otherwise they won't </v>

1434
01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:08.724
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't cooperate with you and they </v>

1435
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:12.420
<v Speaker 1>won't compete with you in a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

1436
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:13.463
<v Speaker 1>And so that's going to be a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to act out what's good </v>

1437
01:12:17.161 --> 01:12:20.670
<v Speaker 1>for you now and what's good for you next</v>
<v Speaker 1>month and next year,</v>

1438
01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:22.163
<v Speaker 1>and you want to do that in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you and your family and your </v>

1439
01:12:24.421 --> 01:12:27.510
<v Speaker 1>community right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next week and next year,</v>

1440
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:30.840
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to take all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things into account at the same time.</v>

1441
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:34.320
<v Speaker 1>That's an equivalent rated game from </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] perspective,</v>

1442
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:35.423
<v Speaker 1>and it was his idea that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted the basis for proper moral </v>

1443
01:12:38.011 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 1>judgment and it's a brilliant idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant idea.</v>

1444
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:42.833
<v Speaker 1>And so that's your true self interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference between your </v>

1445
01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:48.960
<v Speaker 1>interest in the interest of others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in any fundamental sense,</v>

1446
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.093
<v Speaker 1>even your enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you're enjoying to treat </v>

1447
01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:55.800
<v Speaker 1>your enemy as if he was yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he is,</v>

1448
01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

1449
01:12:57.061 --> 01:12:57.721
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should wish,</v>

1450
01:12:57.721 --> 01:12:59.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should wish your enemies well.</v>

1451
01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:00.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1452
01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that you hope they get a bigger</v>

1453
01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:05.520
<v Speaker 1>house than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that.</v>

1454
01:13:05.521 --> 01:13:06.354
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being pursued and tormented by </v>

1455
01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:10.950
<v Speaker 1>someone who's truly reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person is,</v>

1456
01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:12.540
<v Speaker 1>they have a miserable life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1457
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:14.850
<v Speaker 1>In all likelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say they're truly malevolent,</v>

1458
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:16.283
<v Speaker 1>you know they live in hell and what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might hope for them is that they could </v>

1459
01:13:19.501 --> 01:13:22.500
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get out of there cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for them and it's not good</v>

1460
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:24.900
<v Speaker 1>for anyone else think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well even your enemies,</v>

1461
01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:25.734
<v Speaker 1>it's like wouldn't it be good if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could get their act together and stop </v>

1462
01:13:27.721 --> 01:13:32.721
<v Speaker 1>being so unnecessarily malevolent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's in your self interest.</v>

1463
01:13:33.091 --> 01:13:33.924
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that your self interest is </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow opposed to other people's or </v>

1464
01:13:37.261 --> 01:13:38.094
<v Speaker 1>that if you maximize yourself interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not operating in the best </v>

1465
01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:42.893
<v Speaker 1>interest of other people is predicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a poor idea of what constitutes </v>

1466
01:13:46.231 --> 01:13:47.064
<v Speaker 1>yourself interest.</v>

1467
01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're not separate in any real </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense from other people.</v>

1468
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:53.340
<v Speaker 1>You maybe not separate from everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some real sense.</v>

1469
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:54.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean young,</v>

1470
01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:59.040
<v Speaker 1>young in his book mysterium [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this idea,</v>

1471
01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go through it real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated idea that this is how</v>

1472
01:14:03.361 --> 01:14:06.190
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you do is you,</v>

1473
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:08.970
<v Speaker 1>you join your emotions and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your rationality.</v>

1474
01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:09.893
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that your mind and your emotions are </v>

1475
01:14:13.181 --> 01:14:15.250
<v Speaker 1>one thing he called that the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjunction.</v>

1476
01:14:15.810 --> 01:14:16.643
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that your motivations and your </v>

1477
01:14:19.391 --> 01:14:20.224
<v Speaker 1>emotions and the way that you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the world are all acting in the </v>

1478
01:14:22.121 --> 01:14:23.560
<v Speaker 1>same direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1479
01:14:23.561 --> 01:14:26.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first conjunction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get your act together that way.</v>

1480
01:14:26.111 --> 01:14:30.400
<v Speaker 1>So that would mean incorporation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression and sexuality from a Freudian</v>

1481
01:14:30.401 --> 01:14:32.530
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those parts of you that are difficult to</v>

1482
01:14:32.531 --> 01:14:35.260
<v Speaker 1>integrate come to be integrated into one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1483
01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.573
<v Speaker 1>So you can use your anger when you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and you have your sexuality under </v>

1484
01:14:40.181 --> 01:14:41.530
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have you,</v>

1485
01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 1>but you know how to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a power for you.</v>

1486
01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1487
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.150
<v Speaker 1>and you're properly assertive in all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

1488
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:49.984
<v Speaker 1>And so you build yourself into one </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological unit and then you embody </v>

1489
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:54.580
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the second conjunction.</v>

1490
01:14:54.581 --> 01:14:57.850
<v Speaker 1>The second conjunction is take your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

1491
01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.650
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>

1492
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.170
<v Speaker 1>unity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and acted out,</v>

1493
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:03.183
<v Speaker 1>acted out in the world so that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no distinction between you and what you </v>

1494
01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:06.964
<v Speaker 1>do between you and the way you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the world and your philosophy and </v>

1495
01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:12.580
<v Speaker 1>how you act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes you a second kind of unity.</v>

1496
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.790
<v Speaker 1>And then the final conjunction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the most difficult one,</v>

1497
01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:19.330
<v Speaker 1>is to stop thinking that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than you are.</v>

1498
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:23.650
<v Speaker 1>This is why I ask people to clean up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms just like your room is you,</v>

1499
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:25.143
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>

1500
01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:27.640
<v Speaker 1>And so you go in there and you clean up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your room,</v>

1501
01:15:27.641 --> 01:15:30.910
<v Speaker 1>your cleaning you up to the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're developing discipline,</v>

1502
01:15:30.911 --> 01:15:31.744
<v Speaker 1>you're putting yourself in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're developing a vision of the </v>

1503
01:15:34.121 --> 01:15:36.190
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're figuring out how to dress,</v>

1504
01:15:36.191 --> 01:15:38.380
<v Speaker 1>you're figuring out how to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your things.</v>

1505
01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:39.483
<v Speaker 1>You're interacting with the micro cosmos</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have in front of you and </v>

1506
01:15:42.551 --> 01:15:43.384
<v Speaker 1>learning how to balance chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference between you and </v>

1507
01:15:46.421 --> 01:15:47.254
<v Speaker 1>what's around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very difficult thing to </v>

1508
01:15:49.091 --> 01:15:49.924
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to act in a way that's </v>

1509
01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:53.710
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But good for everything else at the same</v>

1510
01:15:53.711 --> 01:15:58.630
<v Speaker 1>time and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a high moral virtue and that,</v>

1511
01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:00.700
<v Speaker 1>so there is there.</v>

1512
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:03.283
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1513
01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:04.203
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between psychological </v>

1514
01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.000
<v Speaker 1>egoism and altruism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're,</v>

1515
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:14.980
<v Speaker 1>as you move towards a broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization of things,</v>

1516
01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:19.130
<v Speaker 1>you start to understand that there is no</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish selfish.</v>

1517
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:24.070
<v Speaker 1>There is no selfish self interest isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>how life works.</v>

1518
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're married to someone for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

1519
01:16:26.411 --> 01:16:28.660
<v Speaker 1>and you're stuck with them for the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years,</v>

1520
01:16:28.661 --> 01:16:31.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can't win an argument with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1521
01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:35.920
<v Speaker 1>You can make peace because there you </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1522
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:37.143
<v Speaker 1>there you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a huge part of your </v>

1523
01:16:38.621 --> 01:16:41.380
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to treat that person as if they</v>

1524
01:16:41.381 --> 01:16:43.630
<v Speaker 1>are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if it's not,</v>

1525
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.730
<v Speaker 1>it isn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm going to treat you well because</v>

1526
01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:46.564
<v Speaker 1>you're me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not because people don't treat </v>

1527
01:16:47.501 --> 01:16:48.334
<v Speaker 1>themselves very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often it's way more complicated than </v>

1528
01:16:50.501 --> 01:16:52.180
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

1529
01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.073
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to defeat your wife man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you live with a defeated </v>

1530
01:16:56.021 --> 01:16:58.600
<v Speaker 1>wife and if you think she isn't going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take revenge on you,</v>

1531
01:16:58.601 --> 01:17:00.220
<v Speaker 1>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not very bright.</v>

1532
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.863
<v Speaker 1>So you want to listen to what she has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say and you want to listen to her </v>

1533
01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:05.074
<v Speaker 1>problems and you want to help her solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because she's you and you want to </v>

1534
01:17:08.381 --> 01:17:09.214
<v Speaker 1>do the same with your kids and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do the same with the people </v>

1535
01:17:11.151 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 1>around you if you can do it.</v>

1536
01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:13.933
<v Speaker 1>So and so the whole idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're basically wired to be </v>

1537
01:17:17.901 --> 01:17:21.620
<v Speaker 1>selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we are when we're not very wise and</v>

1538
01:17:21.621 --> 01:17:26.450
<v Speaker 1>we act impulsively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as your view of the world broadens,</v>

1539
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you start to understand that this is why</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Buddhist philosophy,</v>

1540
01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:31.354
<v Speaker 1>no Buddha attained nirvana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that meant he could stay in union </v>

1541
01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:35.660
<v Speaker 1>with the gods so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1542
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:36.703
<v Speaker 1>he attained the highest form of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of subjective experience with might be </v>

1543
01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:44.750
<v Speaker 1>but which might be something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally immersion in bliss and meaning.</v>

1544
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.883
<v Speaker 1>But he rejected it because he went back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the world to help other people </v>

1545
01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:50.414
<v Speaker 1>attain nirvana or at least to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards it because he realized that </v>

1546
01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:56.960
<v Speaker 1>there was no individual redemption </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the redemption of all.</v>

1547
01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.840
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand that,</v>

1548
01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:00.674
<v Speaker 1>then you're just not very wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're trying to be a force for </v>

1549
01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:04.460
<v Speaker 1>good in the world.</v>

1550
01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.950
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean just good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

1551
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:12.310
<v Speaker 1>it's just blind because there isn't any </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated you that isn't how things are,</v>

1552
01:18:13.491 --> 01:18:14.324
<v Speaker 1>that is now realities lays itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is your current thinking on </v>

1553
01:18:19.311 --> 01:18:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox Christianity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Orthodox Christians like me,</v>

1554
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I have some idea,</v>

1555
01:18:26.271 --> 01:18:27.140
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1556
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 1>I've got a lot of letters from religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1557
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:31.310
<v Speaker 1>a lot of lot from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Muslims,</v>

1558
01:18:31.311 --> 01:18:32.570
<v Speaker 1>from Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1559
01:18:32.571 --> 01:18:35.330
<v Speaker 1>from Orthodox Jews in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough,</v>

1560
01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:38.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Christian monks,</v>

1561
01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.200
<v Speaker 1>monks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1562
01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:43.010
<v Speaker 1>but a lot from Orthodox Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that,</v>

1563
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:43.844
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox look at Christianity from a </v>

1564
01:18:48.441 --> 01:18:51.140
<v Speaker 1>slightly different angle than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Protestants and the Catholics.</v>

1565
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.330
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not putting down the Protestants</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Catholics,</v>

1566
01:18:53.331 --> 01:18:55.670
<v Speaker 1>they have a perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reason for their viewpoint.</v>

1567
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:59.390
<v Speaker 1>But what's happened in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1568
01:18:59.391 --> 01:19:01.280
<v Speaker 1>and this is a dreadful over </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplification,</v>

1569
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:06.281
<v Speaker 1>so please forgive me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the West has viewed Christianity</v>

1570
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:08.443
<v Speaker 1>more as a set of beliefs that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogous in some sense to a cognitive </v>

1571
01:19:12.921 --> 01:19:14.060
<v Speaker 1>theory of the world.</v>

1572
01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.193
<v Speaker 1>So to be a Christian in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to accept that Christ died for </v>

1573
01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:19.274
<v Speaker 1>your sins and that you're redeemed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to accept Christ as your </v>

1574
01:19:22.461 --> 01:19:23.294
<v Speaker 1>redeemer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that really means to state that you </v>

1575
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:28.550
<v Speaker 1>believe a set of propositions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

1576
01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:32.600
<v Speaker 1>that he was the son of God and that his </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and resurrection,</v>

1577
01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:33.434
<v Speaker 1>his sacrifice redeemed mankind and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you partake in that redemption </v>

1578
01:19:37.491 --> 01:19:41.930
<v Speaker 1>by laying out that co that accordance </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a set of facts,</v>

1579
01:19:41.931 --> 01:19:43.490
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1580
01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.520
<v Speaker 1>I understand why that's how it's worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1581
01:19:46.521 --> 01:19:51.521
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a big risk in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think the Orthodox fell into</v>

1582
01:19:51.711 --> 01:19:54.530
<v Speaker 1>that to the same degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their idea more,</v>

1583
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:58.790
<v Speaker 1>and this is their products in </v>
<v Speaker 1>protestantism and Catholicism to,</v>

1584
01:19:58.791 --> 01:19:59.750
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1585
01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.870
<v Speaker 1>it's given more secondary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more implicit emphasis.</v>

1586
01:20:02.871 --> 01:20:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the modern world.</v>

1587
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:06.583
<v Speaker 1>There are Orthodox would say as near as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell that you should pick up your </v>

1588
01:20:10.081 --> 01:20:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Damn Cross and stumble up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your job,</v>

1589
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:16.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cross is the x where everyone is</v>

1590
01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:18.240
<v Speaker 1>located.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right at the center of reality,</v>

1591
01:20:18.241 --> 01:20:19.074
<v Speaker 1>your suffering and dying and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>reborn all the time at the center of </v>

1592
01:20:22.021 --> 01:20:22.854
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you transform and you have to accept </v>

1593
01:20:24.541 --> 01:20:26.370
<v Speaker 1>that and embrace it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

1594
01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:27.253
<v Speaker 1>and that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard thing to do because it means </v>

1595
01:20:28.921 --> 01:20:29.754
<v Speaker 1>to embrace all your flaws and the flaws </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality and the tragedy of existence </v>

1596
01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:36.240
<v Speaker 1>and your death and the sum total of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human evil,</v>

1597
01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:39.690
<v Speaker 1>all of that unbelievably demanding</v>

1598
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:43.280
<v Speaker 1>requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you do what you can to do that.</v>

1599
01:20:43.281 --> 01:20:46.130
<v Speaker 1>And then not only do you pick up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cross so to speak,</v>

1600
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:49.160
<v Speaker 1>but you stumble up hill towards the city</v>
<v Speaker 1>of God.</v>

1601
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you stumble up towards what's good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's your destiny and that's where</v>

1602
01:20:54.231 --> 01:20:55.064
<v Speaker 1>meaning is to be had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Orthodox lay that out quite </v>

1603
01:20:57.891 --> 01:20:58.724
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your goal is the imitation of </v>

1604
01:20:59.841 --> 01:21:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Christ and Christ is the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the Christian story.</v>

1605
01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:04.543
<v Speaker 1>Christ is the logos that God uses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the beginning of time to transform </v>

1606
01:21:07.401 --> 01:21:09.950
<v Speaker 1>pre cosmic gone chaos into habitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

1607
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:12.530
<v Speaker 1>truthful speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing,</v>

1608
01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:13.693
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the fact that you're capable of </v>

1609
01:21:15.771 --> 01:21:16.604
<v Speaker 1>uttering truthful speech is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>indication that you shouldered your </v>

1610
01:21:18.921 --> 01:21:22.190
<v Speaker 1>cross and are stumbling up hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very coherent theory.</v>

1611
01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:23.293
<v Speaker 1>And the Orthodox I think have done a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good job of keeping that idea at </v>

1612
01:21:27.111 --> 01:21:29.780
<v Speaker 1>the forefront of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their belief.</v>

1613
01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:32.810
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what I think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox Christianity.</v>

1614
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Do I have any thoughts on the Myers </v>
<v Speaker 1>Briggs personality test?</v>

1615
01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's old.</v>

1616
01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:38.533
<v Speaker 1>It isn't psychometrically valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't derived by factor analytic </v>

1617
01:21:41.361 --> 01:21:43.970
<v Speaker 1>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be replaced by the big five or</v>

1618
01:21:43.971 --> 01:21:44.804
<v Speaker 1>the big five aspect scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can use if you go to </v>

1619
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:47.623
<v Speaker 1>understand myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot Com we put it online for people to </v>

1620
01:21:49.581 --> 01:21:52.280
<v Speaker 1>use and to generate a personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>

1621
01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:53.533
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Myers and briggs attempted to make a </v>

1622
01:21:55.401 --> 01:21:56.234
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire predicated on union </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions and perhaps they did a </v>

1623
01:21:59.031 --> 01:21:59.864
<v Speaker 1>fine job for the 1930s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was a long time ago and there </v>

1624
01:22:02.241 --> 01:22:03.074
<v Speaker 1>weren't any powerful computational </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices of the kind that were necessary </v>

1625
01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.410
<v Speaker 1>to sort out the structure of personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

1626
01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.500
<v Speaker 1>which we've managed to do since about </v>
<v Speaker 1>1960 onward.</v>

1627
01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:13.633
<v Speaker 1>So now the Myers Briggs is a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful tool if what you want to do is </v>

1628
01:22:17.601 --> 01:22:18.434
<v Speaker 1>get people to talk about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are individual differences in </v>

1629
01:22:20.691 --> 01:22:21.524
<v Speaker 1>personality and corporations love it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no one gets offended by it </v>

1630
01:22:24.921 --> 01:22:27.950
<v Speaker 1>because everyone wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want a personality tests that</v>

1631
01:22:27.951 --> 01:22:31.190
<v Speaker 1>actually tells you who you are that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid and reliable,</v>

1632
01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:33.290
<v Speaker 1>then you use the big five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1633
01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.233
<v Speaker 1>and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say the Myers Briggs </v>

1634
01:22:36.591 --> 01:22:37.424
<v Speaker 1>should be relegated to the dustbins of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past because it's a defunct and </v>

1635
01:22:40.491 --> 01:22:43.250
<v Speaker 1>archaic instrument and it's no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly valid.</v>

1636
01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:45.230
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1637
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:47.683
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

1638
01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1639
01:22:56.890 --> 01:22:57.723
<v Speaker 1>How can women who waited too long to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have children find meaning in their </v>

1640
01:22:59.621 --> 01:23:03.400
<v Speaker 1>lives once they realized their mistake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can we cope with the regret?</v>

1641
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard question.</v>

1642
01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.553
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1643
01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:15.070
<v Speaker 1>there are other avenues to meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1644
01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1645
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:21.130
<v Speaker 1>that's the first thing to realize is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are,</v>

1646
01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:22.083
<v Speaker 1>there's intimate relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's familial relationships that </v>

1647
01:23:25.451 --> 01:23:30.310
<v Speaker 1>aren't in accordance with children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's other people that you can serve.</v>

1648
01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:32.410
<v Speaker 1>There are other children that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve.</v>

1649
01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:33.453
<v Speaker 1>So what you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because intimate relationships are so </v>

1650
01:23:37.421 --> 01:23:40.150
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm including that close familial,</v>

1651
01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

1652
01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about very close social </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

1653
01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:47.050
<v Speaker 1>The thing about having children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky,</v>

1654
01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.580
<v Speaker 1>is that you have a relationship there of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a depth that you don't get anywhere else</v>

1655
01:23:51.581 --> 01:23:55.210
<v Speaker 1>with the possible exception of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents and siblings and your partner.</v>

1656
01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:56.643
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about the child </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship that's even more </v>

1657
01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:00.093
<v Speaker 1>fundamental because the thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a child is that if you have any </v>

1658
01:24:03.401 --> 01:24:05.200
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you have a child,</v>

1659
01:24:05.201 --> 01:24:07.060
<v Speaker 1>you are no longer the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1660
01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:07.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1661
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:10.660
<v Speaker 1>You're no longer the person that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have primary responsibility for.</v>

1662
01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:11.494
<v Speaker 1>It's now your child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that produces a psychological </v>

1663
01:24:13.241 --> 01:24:14.074
<v Speaker 1>transformation and it produces a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship of a depth that can't be </v>

1664
01:24:16.631 --> 01:24:17.464
<v Speaker 1>easily duplicated elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not like that's the only thing </v>

1665
01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:22.150
<v Speaker 1>that there is to do in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1666
01:24:22.151 --> 01:24:22.984
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other relationships and I </v>

1667
01:24:25.901 --> 01:24:26.734
<v Speaker 1>would say what you do is you foster them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that that's possible and </v>

1668
01:24:29.321 --> 01:24:31.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could find other kids to </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve.</v>

1669
01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:32.403
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility of </v>

1670
01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:35.110
<v Speaker 1>volunteering for hospitals or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1671
01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:38.230
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or working in places where children need</v>

1672
01:24:38.231 --> 01:24:40.510
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a possibility as well.</v>

1673
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:43.390
<v Speaker 1>And so you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1674
01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:44.253
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a variety of sources of </v>

1675
01:24:45.311 --> 01:24:48.640
<v Speaker 1>meaning in people's lives and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not unlimited.</v>

1676
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:49.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's career,</v>

1677
01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:52.390
<v Speaker 1>there's education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's what you do that's meaningful,</v>

1678
01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.340
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully engages you outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1679
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:57.430
<v Speaker 1>There's your social relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends and so forth.</v>

1680
01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.713
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you have five lakes lakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stand on and you missed one cause he </v>

1681
01:25:01.691 --> 01:25:04.000
<v Speaker 1>didn't have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you missed too because kids are</v>

1682
01:25:04.001 --> 01:25:04.834
<v Speaker 1>a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean the rest of them </v>

1683
01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:07.084
<v Speaker 1>aren't accessible to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you optimize your functioning </v>

1684
01:25:09.281 --> 01:25:11.500
<v Speaker 1>along the dimensions that are left to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1685
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:16.180
<v Speaker 1>And then I would also say maybe you try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to forgive yourself a little bit.</v>

1686
01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.613
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's very difficult to go through </v>

1687
01:25:18.911 --> 01:25:22.150
<v Speaker 1>life without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without regrets,</v>

1688
01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:23.830
<v Speaker 1>without making mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1689
01:25:23.831 --> 01:25:24.664
<v Speaker 1>when you can't beat yourself to death </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it because then everyone would beat </v>

1690
01:25:26.651 --> 01:25:29.770
<v Speaker 1>themselves to death all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>

1691
01:25:29.771 --> 01:25:32.400
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I've,</v>

1692
01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:33.243
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too soon old and too late wise to </v>

1693
01:25:36.791 --> 01:25:40.450
<v Speaker 1>use an old cliche and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the lot of mankind.</v>

1694
01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:41.403
<v Speaker 1>We learn things too late often and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too bad and you forgive yourself </v>

1695
01:25:44.891 --> 01:25:47.890
<v Speaker 1>because you're stupid and you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and you're unwise just</v>

1696
01:25:47.891 --> 01:25:48.724
<v Speaker 1>like everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you're somewhat capable of </v>

1697
01:25:50.321 --> 01:25:51.154
<v Speaker 1>learning if you're careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go out and you try to </v>

1698
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:57.820
<v Speaker 1>foster relations and do good in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to the degree that you can outside</v>

1699
01:25:57.821 --> 01:26:00.610
<v Speaker 1>of the necessity of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of children.</v>

1700
01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:02.213
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you have nephews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nieces and can lavish some attention on </v>

1701
01:26:04.341 --> 01:26:07.310
<v Speaker 1>them and find your substitute where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

1702
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:10.580
<v Speaker 1>But I would say to forgive yourself is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big part of that.</v>

1703
01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:13.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like people make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big mistakes.</v>

1704
01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:17.060
<v Speaker 1>And the people that I've watched through</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that have been successful,</v>

1705
01:26:17.061 --> 01:26:20.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they didn't make mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everyone makes mistakes and they</v>

1706
01:26:20.301 --> 01:26:21.134
<v Speaker 1>do things they regret and they miss </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities and it's a bloody </v>

1707
01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:24.194
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they treat themselves with some </v>

1708
01:26:27.621 --> 01:26:29.480
<v Speaker 1>degree of mercy along with the justice.</v>

1709
01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.081
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1710
01:26:30.081 --> 01:26:30.914
<v Speaker 1>well I screwed up there and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to learn and I'm not going to do it </v>

1711
01:26:33.501 --> 01:26:34.334
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to beat myself to </v>

1712
01:26:35.601 --> 01:26:36.434
<v Speaker 1>death so that I can't get up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you do what you can to forgive </v>

1713
01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:41.120
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1714
01:26:41.121 --> 01:26:41.954
<v Speaker 1>it's a confusing time to live in in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways because we have the birth control </v>

1715
01:26:44.991 --> 01:26:49.040
<v Speaker 1>pill now and that means reproduction has</v>
<v Speaker 1>now become voluntary.</v>

1716
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when's a good time to reproduce?</v>

1717
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.903
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

1718
01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.730
<v Speaker 1>because who would ever think about doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1719
01:26:55.731 --> 01:26:56.564
<v Speaker 1>It's so ridiculously irrational and </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and the burden of </v>

1720
01:27:00.321 --> 01:27:04.010
<v Speaker 1>responsibility is so insanely high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you never secure enough to,</v>

1721
01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:05.023
<v Speaker 1>to have the proper place to bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>children into the world and you have to </v>

1722
01:27:07.851 --> 01:27:11.450
<v Speaker 1>get your career going and your and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship.</v>

1723
01:27:11.451 --> 01:27:13.070
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you have some struggle doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1724
01:27:13.071 --> 01:27:14.900
<v Speaker 1>And one day you wake up and it's a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>late.</v>

1725
01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:15.831
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1726
01:27:15.831 --> 01:27:16.664
<v Speaker 1>well you're a product of your time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the prices that we're going to </v>

1727
01:27:22.701 --> 01:27:23.534
<v Speaker 1>pay for having birth control for having </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable contraception is that some </v>

1728
01:27:28.461 --> 01:27:29.294
<v Speaker 1>people are going to make the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision with regards to having </v>

1729
01:27:31.791 --> 01:27:32.624
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you view yourself as a product </v>

1730
01:27:34.401 --> 01:27:36.080
<v Speaker 1>of your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a catastrophe,</v>

1731
01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because to be a product of your time is </v>

1732
01:27:38.391 --> 01:27:40.820
<v Speaker 1>in some ways a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1733
01:27:41.650 --> 01:27:44.570
<v Speaker 1>but there's other things to do in life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1734
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:48.350
<v Speaker 1>and augering yourself into the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>with regret and,</v>

1735
01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:49.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1736
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:54.350
<v Speaker 1>and self recrimination is not useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1737
01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn your lesson,</v>

1738
01:27:55.731 --> 01:27:57.260
<v Speaker 1>you have to take your lumps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

1739
01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.680
<v Speaker 1>but have some mercy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1740
01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:03.553
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have said that the only moral </v>

1741
01:28:07.971 --> 01:28:11.360
<v Speaker 1>absolute is always to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you have anne frank in the attic</v>

1742
01:28:11.361 --> 01:28:13.220
<v Speaker 1>and the Gestapo at your on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>doorstep,</v>

1743
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:14.203
<v Speaker 1>then I would say that there has been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of lies that have got you to that </v>

1744
01:28:16.881 --> 01:28:17.714
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you may be in a situation where </v>

1745
01:28:20.361 --> 01:28:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you're damned if you turn right and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're damned if you turn left.</v>

1746
01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.660
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is you made a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes along the way.</v>

1747
01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.393
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if the totalitarians or knocking at </v>

1748
01:28:30.261 --> 01:28:31.094
<v Speaker 1>your door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the totalitarians or knocking on </v>

1749
01:28:32.331 --> 01:28:34.820
<v Speaker 1>everyone's door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means everyone should have spoke up</v>

1750
01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:35.654
<v Speaker 1>a lot sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they wouldn't end up in a </v>

1751
01:28:37.521 --> 01:28:41.020
<v Speaker 1>situation where the Gestapo was out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>door and Anne Frank was in the owl is it</v>

1752
01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:41.893
<v Speaker 1>was in the attic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you now and then you end up in a </v>

1753
01:28:45.531 --> 01:28:46.364
<v Speaker 1>situation where you've made so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes that all you've got is hell </v>

1754
01:28:49.071 --> 01:28:49.904
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

1755
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 1>And that was certainly the case in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amsterdam say,</v>

1756
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:55.210
<v Speaker 1>or and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in when the Nazis came in on,</v>

1757
01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:56.053
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Dutch are now admirable </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and I know they were invaded by </v>

1758
01:28:58.791 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis and that was a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But many,</v>

1759
01:29:01.741 --> 01:29:02.311
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1760
01:29:02.311 --> 01:29:03.144
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people made many terrible moral </v>

1761
01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:05.874
<v Speaker 1>errors for all of that to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be awake and do </v>

1762
01:29:09.001 --> 01:29:11.090
<v Speaker 1>everything you can to make sure your </v>
<v Speaker 1>society doesn't.</v>

1763
01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:13.200
<v Speaker 1>This is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You be away.</v>

1764
01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Can you make sure everything you society</v>
<v Speaker 1>does doesn't lead to the point where the</v>

1765
01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Gestapo at your doorstep and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>Anne Frank in the attic,</v>

1766
01:29:21.361 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a little late to be thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I would say,</v>

1767
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:35.090
<v Speaker 1>well I have confidence in an opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it could be wrong.</v>

1768
01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Well partly because it could be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1769
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:40.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's better to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions as tools,</v>

1770
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.923
<v Speaker 1>you know or maybe to dispense with </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions altogether because who cares </v>

1771
01:29:44.811 --> 01:29:45.644
<v Speaker 1>about your stupid opinion but what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want is tools to work in the world and </v>

1772
01:29:49.311 --> 01:29:50.990
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I have a tool and it might work.</v>

1773
01:29:50.991 --> 01:29:54.530
<v Speaker 1>So like let's say that you're going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with someone while you're your</v>

1774
01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.433
<v Speaker 1>tool kit is your conceptual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conceptual structure and the habits </v>

1775
01:29:58.461 --> 01:29:59.294
<v Speaker 1>that you have that enable you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>construe the situation and to conduct </v>

1776
01:30:01.641 --> 01:30:03.290
<v Speaker 1>the negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1777
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:08.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to have confidence that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your tool kit is appropriate or you</v>

1778
01:30:08.331 --> 01:30:09.830
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't go out there and test it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

1779
01:30:09.831 --> 01:30:10.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong.</v>

1780
01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:11.151
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1781
01:30:11.151 --> 01:30:12.470
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to learn if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1782
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Unless you go out there and test it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to have provisional.</v>

1783
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay</v>

1784
01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.860
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you're um,</v>

1785
01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.313
<v Speaker 1>well let's say that you're using a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer to hammer in a nail and you </v>

1786
01:30:25.841 --> 01:30:26.674
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1787
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:28.143
<v Speaker 1>am I going to hit the nail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you aim at the nail and you hit it </v>

1788
01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:32.350
<v Speaker 1>and you watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you didn't hit it quite right,</v>

1789
01:30:32.351 --> 01:30:33.820
<v Speaker 1>then you aim a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1790
01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:36.250
<v Speaker 1>so you have enough confidence to swing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hammer.</v>

1791
01:30:36.251 --> 01:30:38.500
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you're not paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the outcome.</v>

1792
01:30:38.890 --> 01:30:42.160
<v Speaker 1>So you want to have confident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is the best answer,</v>

1793
01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:44.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to have confidence in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

1794
01:30:44.801 --> 01:30:45.634
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want it how you want to believe in </v>

1795
01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:50.950
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of moving forward in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world with your limited tool kit.</v>

1796
01:30:51.850 --> 01:30:52.930
<v Speaker 1>And also</v>

1797
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:56.683
<v Speaker 1>you want to make the the vow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that as you implement your </v>

1798
01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:01.154
<v Speaker 1>tools in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to pay attention to </v>

1799
01:31:02.661 --> 01:31:06.920
<v Speaker 1>what happens and you're going to modify </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as necessary as you move along.</v>

1800
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:09.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the adoption of the hero myth </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1801
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:10.430
<v Speaker 1>cause that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1802
01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:11.293
<v Speaker 1>let's say your opinion is a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>screwy and so you laid out in the world </v>

1803
01:31:13.851 --> 01:31:16.100
<v Speaker 1>and you get responses that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

1804
01:31:16.101 --> 01:31:17.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1805
01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.830
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that didn't work out quite right.</v>

1806
01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll go retool my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>

1807
01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.430
<v Speaker 1>you move out into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as a collection of opinions,</v>

1808
01:31:25.431 --> 01:31:30.431
<v Speaker 1>but as a collection of tools and as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process that can re cast those tools.</v>

1809
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:35.331
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1810
01:31:35.331 --> 01:31:38.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not so much that I have confidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinions.</v>

1811
01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that they're necessary to express</v>

1812
01:31:41.691 --> 01:31:45.530
<v Speaker 1>them because sometimes the work and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't work then I can learn.</v>

1813
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:46.783
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the recipe for forthright </v>

1814
01:31:49.701 --> 01:31:50.534
<v Speaker 1>action in the world.</v>

1815
01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:52.533
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1816
01:31:52.670 --> 01:31:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Our daughter entered her life at 24 due </v>
<v Speaker 1>to depression.</v>

1817
01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.410
<v Speaker 1>If someone is determined to end their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1818
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:59.000
<v Speaker 1>how can one change their mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1819
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:02.380
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sorry about that.</v>

1820
01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:07.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1821
01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I had this friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

1822
01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:22.503
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of depression in our </v>

1823
01:32:29.271 --> 01:32:30.104
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a question that cuts close to </v>

1824
01:32:32.961 --> 01:32:33.794
<v Speaker 1>the bone.</v>

1825
01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:35.883
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1826
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this friend,</v>

1827
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:44.270
<v Speaker 1>a friend of my parents and her grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter committed suicide,</v>

1828
01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:45.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just beating herself up about </v>

1829
01:32:48.330 --> 01:32:50.490
<v Speaker 1>what could have I done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could have I done differently?</v>

1830
01:32:50.491 --> 01:32:54.330
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem with suicide leaves </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody behind thinking,</v>

1831
01:32:54.331 --> 01:32:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could've I done?</v>

1832
01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I could have treated the person better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have listened.</v>

1833
01:32:58.411 --> 01:32:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I could've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1834
01:32:59.971 --> 01:33:00.804
<v Speaker 1>and she was just beating yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this really feeling that she </v>

1835
01:33:04.051 --> 01:33:07.050
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a useful person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she'd failed as a grandmother.</v>

1836
01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:08.790
<v Speaker 1>She's a really good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1837
01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:11.370
<v Speaker 1>And so I went for a walk with her and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1838
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:14.610
<v Speaker 1>she's married and she likes her husband </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a really good guy.</v>

1839
01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.370
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1840
01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:20.790
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're blaming yourself for the,</v>

1841
01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:22.890
<v Speaker 1>for your granddaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

1842
01:33:23.610 --> 01:33:25.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you blaming your husband?</v>

1843
01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Are you sitting him down and telling him</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to use?</v>

1844
01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:28.943
<v Speaker 1>Useless bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was as a grandfather because his </v>

1845
01:33:30.751 --> 01:33:33.630
<v Speaker 1>grand daughter committed suicide and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>he failed completely.</v>

1846
01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:34.981
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1847
01:33:34.981 --> 01:33:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

1848
01:33:37.231 --> 01:33:41.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it to yourself.</v>

1849
01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:44.733
<v Speaker 1>No people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression was a terrible thing and </v>

1850
01:33:49.091 --> 01:33:49.901
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1851
01:33:49.901 --> 01:33:52.300
<v Speaker 1>many things cause it and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1852
01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:55.060
<v Speaker 1>We understand some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lots of them,</v>

1853
01:33:55.061 --> 01:33:56.260
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1854
01:33:56.261 --> 01:33:58.720
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people get depressed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really sick.</v>

1855
01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:02.560
<v Speaker 1>We know that depression could be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory disease,</v>

1856
01:34:02.561 --> 01:34:05.110
<v Speaker 1>it might be associated with audio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immune dysfunction.</v>

1857
01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:08.610
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of reasons that people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and depressed.</v>

1858
01:34:08.611 --> 01:34:12.130
<v Speaker 1>People can go places that are so dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just cannot imagine it.</v>

1859
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't necessarily the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can always rescue someone,</v>

1860
01:34:16.481 --> 01:34:18.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and but,</v>

1861
01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:22.390
<v Speaker 1>but drowning yourself in the aftermath </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a suicide is not helpful.</v>

1862
01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:25.630
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good room for self forgiveness</v>

1863
01:34:25.631 --> 01:34:26.231
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1864
01:34:26.231 --> 01:34:27.064
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe you did some things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have done that were </v>

1865
01:34:29.411 --> 01:34:32.560
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible in all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to beat yourself up.</v>

1866
01:34:33.490 --> 01:34:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Remember the presumption of innocence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1867
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Innocent until proven guilty and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to apply that to yourself.</v>

1868
01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:41.373
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are times when people are </v>

1869
01:34:43.691 --> 01:34:46.090
<v Speaker 1>so depressed there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anything that anyone can do.</v>

1870
01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:48.670
<v Speaker 1>You know when the depressed person </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks,</v>

1871
01:34:48.930 --> 01:34:50.530
<v Speaker 1>and this is probably the worst part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1872
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.970
<v Speaker 1>the depressed person thinks</v>

1873
01:34:58.180 --> 01:34:59.013
<v Speaker 1>everywhere I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing but catastrophe and </v>

1874
01:35:01.621 --> 01:35:03.690
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any way out of it.</v>

1875
01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any path forward whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they think as well,</v>

1876
01:35:08.431 --> 01:35:09.264
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's the combination of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>two thoughts that that really make </v>

1877
01:35:11.521 --> 01:35:14.040
<v Speaker 1>people suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's hopeless.</v>

1878
01:35:14.730 --> 01:35:17.310
<v Speaker 1>It isn't going to get any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter where I turn.</v>

1879
01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:18.144
<v Speaker 1>There's no escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The suffering is unbearable and I have </v>

1880
01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:23.580
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no use whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do anyone.</v>

1881
01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:27.300
<v Speaker 1>It would be better for everyone if I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gone because I'm going,</v>

1882
01:35:27.330 --> 01:35:31.170
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not so much of a burden now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to destroy their life,</v>

1883
01:35:31.171 --> 01:35:35.280
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to be that much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>burden in the future.</v>

1884
01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:39.540
<v Speaker 1>And so it's hard to imagine what that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like for people,</v>

1885
01:35:39.541 --> 01:35:44.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's dreadful and there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways you get there and so</v>

1886
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:46.703
<v Speaker 1>you can listen to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can desperately encouraged them to </v>

1887
01:35:50.101 --> 01:35:51.120
<v Speaker 1>seek the help they need.</v>

1888
01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:51.953
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've,</v>

1889
01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I've seen antidepressants work miracles </v>
<v Speaker 1>on very,</v>

1890
01:35:54.541 --> 01:35:57.450
<v Speaker 1>very many people now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't work for everyone and they're</v>

1891
01:35:57.451 --> 01:36:00.140
<v Speaker 1>not a panacea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1892
01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:03.960
<v Speaker 1>they have side effects and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the side effects of untreated</v>

1893
01:36:03.961 --> 01:36:07.110
<v Speaker 1>depression is that you kill yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no recovery from that.</v>

1894
01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.560
<v Speaker 1>And the are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability is actually rather high.</v>

1895
01:36:11.190 --> 01:36:15.180
<v Speaker 1>So you can go to war with them about </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants.</v>

1896
01:36:15.181 --> 01:36:17.460
<v Speaker 1>If the person can't get out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and their,</v>

1897
01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:18.960
<v Speaker 1>and their suicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1898
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:22.080
<v Speaker 1>what did they have to lose one month on </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants?</v>

1899
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:24.000
<v Speaker 1>They'll know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1900
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:26.520
<v Speaker 1>they might have to experiment longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it would depend on,</v>

1901
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:27.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people respond better to some </v>

1902
01:36:28.261 --> 01:36:30.210
<v Speaker 1>classes of antidepressants than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

1903
01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:31.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth having a war with someone if </v>

1904
01:36:34.441 --> 01:36:37.680
<v Speaker 1>they're in dire straits and they won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do everything they can to get better.</v>

1905
01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:38.873
<v Speaker 1>ECT works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Electric convulsive therapy works for </v>

1906
01:36:40.801 --> 01:36:43.770
<v Speaker 1>intractable depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible thing to contemplate,</v>

1907
01:36:43.771 --> 01:36:47.820
<v Speaker 1>but the modern versions of ect aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>one flew over the cuckoo's nest.</v>

1908
01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:48.773
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's no coming back from </v>

1909
01:36:50.461 --> 01:36:54.590
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

1910
01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:56.930
<v Speaker 1>it isn't clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't rescue everyone.</v>

1911
01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.940
<v Speaker 1>People get sick and they die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes the way they die,</v>

1912
01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:07.010
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression is a multifaceted phenomena.</v>

1913
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:09.770
<v Speaker 1>You can be there for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can listen,</v>

1914
01:37:10.670 --> 01:37:12.950
<v Speaker 1>you can watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can intervene,</v>

1915
01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:17.180
<v Speaker 1>you can try to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hold them accountable.</v>

1916
01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:21.830
<v Speaker 1>You can do all of those things but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone has their own destiny,</v>

1917
01:37:21.831 --> 01:37:25.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not omnipotent.</v>

1918
01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:31.370
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes it catastrophe occurs </v>
<v Speaker 1>like your daughters and</v>

1919
01:37:34.170 --> 01:37:35.003
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1920
01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:36.973
<v Speaker 1>and then you should try to drag the </v>
<v Speaker 1>least amount of misery forward that you </v>

1921
01:37:39.711 --> 01:37:44.711
<v Speaker 1>can</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you recover from your grief.</v>

1922
01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:48.713
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1923
01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to answer one more question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Due to a recent incident.</v>

1924
01:37:58.131 --> 01:38:00.740
<v Speaker 1>My company is making me undergo implicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>bias training.</v>

1925
01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:04.100
<v Speaker 1>How should I come to terms with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible firing when I refuse?</v>

1926
01:38:07.930 --> 01:38:08.763
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1927
01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:12.830
<v Speaker 1>there's no sense in burning yourself at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the steak.</v>

1928
01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:14.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to take a principled </v>

1929
01:38:15.951 --> 01:38:19.610
<v Speaker 1>stance on something at work and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to refuse,</v>

1930
01:38:20.090 --> 01:38:20.923
<v Speaker 1>you have to get your tools in order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get your quiver full of </v>

1931
01:38:24.951 --> 01:38:26.660
<v Speaker 1>arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1932
01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:29.720
<v Speaker 1>what the hell good is it going to be for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just to get fired?</v>

1933
01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I maybe have a family that depends on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1934
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:33.223
<v Speaker 1>That's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean I think you should be </v>

1935
01:38:35.031 --> 01:38:37.520
<v Speaker 1>weak because you have a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be stronger.</v>

1936
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:40.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is your resume in order?</v>

1937
01:38:40.490 --> 01:38:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Is Your CV in order?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it updated?</v>

1938
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Have you sent out other job </v>
<v Speaker 1>applications?</v>

1939
01:38:45.561 --> 01:38:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Are you prepared?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a lateral move?</v>

1940
01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a battle.</v>

1941
01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:51.613
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so set yourself up and then make </v>

1942
01:38:55.221 --> 01:38:57.020
<v Speaker 1>your case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you make your case,</v>

1943
01:38:57.021 --> 01:38:59.300
<v Speaker 1>don't apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't do it carelessly.</v>

1944
01:38:59.870 --> 01:39:00.703
<v Speaker 1>You know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a lateral move because </v>

1945
01:39:03.201 --> 01:39:05.960
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're too exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1946
01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:12.290
<v Speaker 1>and if you're going to refuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have your arguments at at hand,</v>

1947
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:15.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have them in writing.</v>

1948
01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that you share them with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate people.</v>

1949
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Don't make unnecessary enemies</v>

1950
01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:26.510
<v Speaker 1>and do yourself the least amount of harm</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1951
01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Now look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

1952
01:39:29.210 --> 01:39:30.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to,</v>

1953
01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:32.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pay,</v>

1954
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.843
<v Speaker 1>you're either going to pay and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go do implicit bias training </v>

1955
01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.340
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to sell a bit of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul to do that.</v>

1956
01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to pay because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to refuse and you're going to take</v>

1957
01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:46.160
<v Speaker 1>that price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got priced to pay both ways.</v>

1958
01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.070
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to refuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it intelligently,</v>

1959
01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:52.310
<v Speaker 1>do it programmatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it philosophically.</v>

1960
01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Do it strategically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1961
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Stupid martyrdom is just stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>martyrdom.</v>

1962
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:57.703
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there may be people you need to talk </v>

1963
01:40:00.531 --> 01:40:01.364
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There may need to be more than one of </v>

1964
01:40:02.571 --> 01:40:03.770
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1965
01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:07.340
<v Speaker 1>so you may need to make contact with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>press.</v>

1966
01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to be strategic about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be intelligent about it.</v>

1967
01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:12.013
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to just let yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and out of protest because maybe </v>

1968
01:40:15.231 --> 01:40:16.064
<v Speaker 1>there'll just be a pile of ashes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people sweep up and go on with their </v>

1969
01:40:18.141 --> 01:40:19.730
<v Speaker 1>idiocy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1970
01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:24.880
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1979
01:40:43.381 --> 01:40:44.214
<v Speaker 1>or not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the other things that I'm </v>

1980
01:40:45.241 --> 01:40:48.150
<v Speaker 1>thinking about am I tried to make every </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk different.</v>

1981
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:49.501

<v Speaker 1>Thank you for all the patrons support.</v>

1985
01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I know it's been a little while since </v>
<v Speaker 1>this last q and a.</v>

1986
01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's life,</v>

01:41:09.251 --> 01:41:11.440

<v Speaker 1>They'll probably do it with my laptop.</v>

1990
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:13.330
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>would be good if everyone was out there </v>

1994
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:28.630
<v Speaker 1>shape or into better shape than it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been.</v>

1995
01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:31.300
<v Speaker 1>That would be lovely thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:33.790
<v Speaker 1>goodbye for now.</v>
