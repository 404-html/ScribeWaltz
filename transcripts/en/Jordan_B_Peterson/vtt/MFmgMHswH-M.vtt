00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>So you're all wondering what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers,</v>

2
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 1>no doubt they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark do I have no,</v>

3
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.873
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave the papers outside my office </v>

4
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>on my bench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully tomorrow morning.</v>

5
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.203
<v Speaker 1>I am struck hypothesis about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relative value of things including the </v>

6
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>self and others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this might not make sense.</v>

7
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty complicated idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What pages are going,</v>

8
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>don't you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you have that memorized?</v>

9
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

10
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're simpler.</v>

11
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>One 31 30 middle of the first power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

12
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:47.934
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we haven't,</v>

14
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things get complex here rapidly,</v>

15
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:56.024
<v Speaker 1>so that's what we're going to do at </v>
<v Speaker 1>first a little bit is do some brick </v>

16
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 1>capitulation so everyone knows where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are before we go somewhere new.</v>

17
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.513
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to convince you of the notion </v>

18
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we model our experience,</v>

19
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>we're coming up with two different kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of models,</v>

20
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>which are usually conflated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

21
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>we're not really clear about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between,</v>

22
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.163
<v Speaker 1>one is a map of fact and that map it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction has construction of that </v>

23
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>map has been formalized as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific endeavor.</v>

24
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>The map itself is the sum total of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific knowledge.</v>

25
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Science is how we generate our knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

26
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sort of in that fact,</v>

27
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:47.544
<v Speaker 1>is</v>
<v Speaker 1>consensually apprehensible phenomena or </v>

28
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:52.284
<v Speaker 1>its pattern of transformation because </v>
<v Speaker 1>science is not only interested in </v>

29
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.303
<v Speaker 1>clarifying the nature of objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who also wants to be able to tell how </v>

30
00:02:58.801 --> 00:02:59.634
<v Speaker 1>one object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how an object changes into something </v>

31
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>else over time.</v>

32
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>As Einstein pointed out in the quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I</v>

33
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.533
<v Speaker 1>provided by him</v>
<v Speaker 1>were generally used to regarding that </v>

34
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.294
<v Speaker 1>sort of phenomenon has real</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein wasn't a philosopher of </v>

35
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:20.674
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was obviously a great </v>

36
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.584
<v Speaker 1>scientist and at the very least his </v>
<v Speaker 1>quotation who talks about the </v>

37
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:29.614
<v Speaker 1>consensually validatable properties or </v>
<v Speaker 1>things describes the manner in which </v>

38
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>people conduct science under normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

39
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.244
<v Speaker 1>That's what we think we're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a different kind of map and </v>

40
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>that's a map not of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact about things,</v>

41
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>but about what those things signify for </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

42
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.270
<v Speaker 1>And I mean for motor output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they signify for what you should do</v>

43
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>when you're around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you encounter them.</v>

44
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>And we don't really understand that map </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

45
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.853
<v Speaker 1>We don't naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we naturally think of it </v>

46
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:05.854
<v Speaker 1>as sort of a separable phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It strikes me that you can make a </v>

47
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:10.774
<v Speaker 1>reasonable case that it's actually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of map that proceeded the formal </v>

48
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:16.354
<v Speaker 1>development of of science because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>like animals are primarily concerned </v>

49
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 1>with how to act rather than with what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact.</v>

50
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.153
<v Speaker 1>And if you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can answer some questions that </v>

51
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>otherwise remain somewhat mysterious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

52
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.660
<v Speaker 1>how do you know when you're right about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and a fundamental basis,</v>

53
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>you're never bragged about anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>because wherever you look,</v>

54
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of mysteries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least from the factions.</v>

55
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.293
<v Speaker 1>They tend not to disturb you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is the case that we have placed </v>

56
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.603
<v Speaker 1>implicit faith in the notion that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know things and that what we know is </v>

57
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:55.414
<v Speaker 1>sufficient even though we know that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know isn't sufficient in the final </v>

58
00:04:58.181 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only is it wrong,</v>

59
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's sufficiently wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that over the course of centuries and</v>

60
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>transformed itself into something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>often even unrecognizable but it,</v>

61
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.133
<v Speaker 1>but it still strikes us as knowledge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because I think we think we know </v>

62
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:13.564
<v Speaker 1>something when acting on that knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We produce results that we want and </v>

63
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:17.464
<v Speaker 1>that's sufficient.</v>

64
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>If you get from point a to point b using</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures,</v>

65
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:22.534
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're convinced that you're right </v>

66
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.233
<v Speaker 1>because that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right enough and that's our </v>

67
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 1>criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antonio Damacio for example,</v>

68
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>he just wrote a new book called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Descartes' error,</v>

69
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>big carts era being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think therefore I am.</v>

70
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.663
<v Speaker 1>It makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pointing out that people with </v>

71
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>damage to the prefrontal cortex start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose the ability to make decisions,</v>

72
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:46.921
<v Speaker 1>to decide between trivial things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>when or to decide to reveal things.</v>

73
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:47.974
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily just between like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw out old newspapers or which </v>

74
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:52.144
<v Speaker 1>restaurant to to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't sum total all the facts about </v>

75
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>given a given restaurant and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it and then contrast</v>

76
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>that restaurant with all conceivable </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants.</v>

77
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>When you go up to eat the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty automatic and amaze.</v>

78
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:08.370
<v Speaker 1>You aren't used it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do it by recourse to emotion.</v>

79
00:06:08.371 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>The frontal lobes help us determine what</v>
<v Speaker 1>our emotions are.</v>

80
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:11.624
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>define it.</v>

81
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can eliminate vast swaths of material</v>

82
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>that would just sort of clog up our </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive faculties otherwise.</v>

83
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:19.784
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

84
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.783
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

85
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 1>knowing a little bit about how stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

86
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.633
<v Speaker 1>how are we paused?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our ideal futures and how we move </v>

87
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:27.644
<v Speaker 1>towards them instantly gives you some </v>
<v Speaker 1>insight into how it is that we </v>

88
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:31.124
<v Speaker 1>determined that we actually know </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and when we say we know </v>

89
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:34.634
<v Speaker 1>something we basically need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our knowledge is sufficient to get us </v>

90
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>from point a to point b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's enough.</v>

91
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.260
<v Speaker 1>That's that that keeps us in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected role.</v>

92
00:06:43.261 --> 00:06:44.094
<v Speaker 1>It keeps our emotions regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that the purpose of </v>

93
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:47.024
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is to regulate emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you have at four so I mean </v>

94
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:55.580
<v Speaker 1>you're always engaged in the endeavor to</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>

95
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is right.</v>

96
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of a behaviorist way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it,</v>

97
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's sufficiently accurate so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's useful.</v>

98
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 1>You want to live in a world where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of hope for the future,</v>

99
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.513
<v Speaker 1>but where you're satisfied all in all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least you're working to maximize </v>

100
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:11.714
<v Speaker 1>your satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also want to avoid anxiety to the </v>

101
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:16.184
<v Speaker 1>degree that that's possible within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of maximizing hope and </v>

102
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also this same goes for pain.</v>

103
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.480
<v Speaker 1>They're always trying to regulate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

104
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:24.314
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason we modify the external world </v>

105
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.343
<v Speaker 1>is to regulate our emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tend to think that emotional </v>

106
00:07:30.231 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 1>regulation is actually a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes,</v>

107
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:33.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calm down,</v>

108
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.273
<v Speaker 1>bring your cell phone under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's only true in the most trivial of </v>

109
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:38.804
<v Speaker 1>circumstances almost all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do to regulate our emotions is </v>

110
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:47.741
<v Speaker 1>to change things around us with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior so that we're satisfied more or</v>

111
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 1>less with the manner in which our limbic</v>
<v Speaker 1>system is conducting itself,</v>

112
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>motivates our behavior.</v>

113
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.633
<v Speaker 1>It kind of knowledge that you have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>enables you to act so what you want </v>

114
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 1>appears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd call that.</v>

115
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.153
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're contrast on this </v>

116
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:09.490
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the domain of pathology,</v>

117
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.240
<v Speaker 1>that's how wisdom is transmitted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not factual knowledge.</v>

118
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Wisdom is how to act so that you get no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one only.</v>

119
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not really so that you get what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want it.</v>

120
00:08:18.191 --> 00:08:19.024
<v Speaker 1>That's a really simple way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and saw that your emotions remain </v>

121
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.530
<v Speaker 1>regulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable over time in a situation and it's</v>

122
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:29.560
<v Speaker 1>primarily composed of others who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the same thing.</v>

123
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who all have to act,</v>

124
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:33.724
<v Speaker 1>including you in a manner so that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable regulation is flexible enough so </v>

125
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:40.060
<v Speaker 1>that it can update itself wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily across time.</v>

126
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.103
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of constraints that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be satisfied in order for your </v>

127
00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:48.610
<v Speaker 1>solution to the regulation of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions to be considered optimal.</v>

128
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.160
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about how to act in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>given situation,</v>

129
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 2>it sounds as if I only think of social</v>

130
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.813
<v Speaker 1>situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about because most of our </v>

131
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:00.954
<v Speaker 1>environment is a social environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of what I consider my environment </v>

132
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 1>is is you and everyone else that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>offer.</v>

133
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 1>You want to know how to ask as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

134
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say look,</v>

135
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.820
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly reasonable question.</v>

136
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I would say wisdom is an abstraction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral low,</v>

137
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.843
<v Speaker 1>so I wouldn't say necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but knowing how to open up the box of </v>

138
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:32.064
<v Speaker 1>the computer and fix whatever particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic park happens to be followed </v>

139
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:38.160
<v Speaker 1>up constitutes wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that,</v>

140
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 1>but usually what happens if your </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer falls up is that you don't know</v>

141
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.404
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you do know is how to figure </v>

142
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:45.534
<v Speaker 1>out what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically what you do when you're </v>

143
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:47.574
<v Speaker 1>trying to fix a computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on the presumption that you can </v>

144
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:54.240
<v Speaker 1>fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like the presumption that leads</v>

145
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:59.241
<v Speaker 1>the whole behavior is to hold everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant and very one things,</v>

146
00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

147
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.630
<v Speaker 1>You engage in a process of trial and </v>
<v Speaker 1>error list.</v>

148
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the bonding towards solving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

149
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:04.434
<v Speaker 1>And I would say being able to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the maneuvers that allows you to </v>

150
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>generate the specific answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

151
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:12.710
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much akin to wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

152
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.703
<v Speaker 1>so I mean that's the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little different because the </v>

153
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:18.714
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the computer computer is a bit peculiar </v>

154
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>though because it's an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment in that it's it,</v>

155
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 1>it isn't something I've infinite to </v>
<v Speaker 1>flexibly in a sense,</v>

156
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 1>at least at the level at which you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to interact with it.</v>

157
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:32.814
<v Speaker 1>It's a finite domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a real standard set of problem </v>

158
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Speaker 1>solving techniques can be applied to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

159
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the computer,</v>

160
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.143
<v Speaker 1>while the computer is probably the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the University of actually who </v>

161
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 1>works exactly as you predicted would </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the scientific perspective.</v>

162
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.703
<v Speaker 1>So we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's not a lot of them remaining </v>

163
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 1>mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was just the mirror you freeze.</v>

164
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time.</v>

165
00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.913
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're doing something at </v>
<v Speaker 1>court and then you sort of fee then </v>

166
00:11:02.451 --> 00:11:06.540
<v Speaker 1>don't you need a strategy to allay your </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxieties,</v>

167
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 1>which is calling the help number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's recourse to authority.</v>

168
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a comfort mode and promise all.</v>

169
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.080
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

170
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.673
<v Speaker 1>I would say I would still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the process of </v>

171
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:25.950
<v Speaker 1>generating solutions is more akin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom than the actual,</v>

172
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.900
<v Speaker 1>their knowledge of any specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

173
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.243
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of without actually serves</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a good introduction to the internal </v>

174
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 1>things we want to talk about today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

175
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.960
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was,</v>

176
00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:35.794
<v Speaker 1>I was summing up reiterating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between the domain of myth </v>

177
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:44.370
<v Speaker 1>and the domain of science making the </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional point and that mythology is</v>

178
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.823
<v Speaker 1>both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the story we tell about our wisdom </v>

179
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:49.314
<v Speaker 1>and it's also our means of transmitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it basically in the same can be said </v>

180
00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:56.991
<v Speaker 1>about narratives in any sort of specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of more general myths.</v>

181
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:59.743
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

182
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then,</v>

183
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next question that pops up is before</v>

184
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 1>the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next question that pops up,</v>

185
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:10.490
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

186
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.323
<v Speaker 1>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can conceive of the world as a </v>

187
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 1>collection of objects and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

188
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 1>but we're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're conceiving of the world as a place</v>

189
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 1>to conduct action in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the next question is,</v>

190
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.640
<v Speaker 1>if you conceive of the world as a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which to act,</v>

191
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.043
<v Speaker 1>what's the structure of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's strikes me that you can </v>

192
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 1>determine the structure by contrast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>myths and seeing,</v>

193
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.073
<v Speaker 1>picking out their commonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit more to it than that </v>

194
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 1>because there are creationists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation myths explicitly statement.</v>

195
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 1>What you're dealing with is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of the genesis of the world.</v>

196
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's also a natural natural field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inquiry for mythologies.</v>

197
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.220
<v Speaker 1>And what I have been attempting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe,</v>

198
00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 1>it's my summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

199
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:04.321
<v Speaker 1>of these various myths and the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they portrayed and the mythological</v>

200
00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:07.600
<v Speaker 1>world has basically has three </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituent elements.</v>

201
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:08.434
<v Speaker 1>You could say four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the chaos that precedes the </v>

202
00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:11.554
<v Speaker 1>construction of anything and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative as their gross has the </v>

203
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:20.161
<v Speaker 1>dragon that eats its own tail as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winged serpent and the winged serpent is</v>

204
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:23.110
<v Speaker 1>similar [inaudible] a creature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit,</v>

205
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.100
<v Speaker 1>and that was the sky as the masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and a creature of matter.</v>

206
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the feminine world.</v>

207
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.393
<v Speaker 1>Masculine world has two aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is more akin to spirit speaking </v>

208
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:40.414
<v Speaker 1>traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other is more akin to the </v>

209
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.770
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal structure to the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

210
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.820
<v Speaker 1>The masculine world is both the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>by which knowledge is generated and that</v>

211
00:13:51.281 --> 00:13:52.870
<v Speaker 1>dual image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

212
00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:57.190
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Egyptian mythology that surrounds</v>

213
00:13:57.191 --> 00:13:58.024
<v Speaker 1>the Pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the live pharaoh is simultaneously </v>

214
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.440
<v Speaker 1>ocirus and horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

215
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 1>seriousness of Syrah stands for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state as a historical entity.</v>

216
00:14:09.311 --> 00:14:10.144
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Horace stands for the process by </v>

217
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:16.900
<v Speaker 1>which that state is updated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated and the live pharaoh in so far</v>

218
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:17.734
<v Speaker 1>as he's doing his job is both the dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>steak and the process by which the dead </v>

219
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:22.354
<v Speaker 1>state is regenerating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when horace goes to the </v>

220
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:24.934
<v Speaker 1>underworld to find his father was blind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and living a sort of a semi vegetative </v>

221
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After he,</v>

222
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.110
<v Speaker 1>after you become seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way he gives him,</v>

223
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.240
<v Speaker 1>he gives him his eye and that brings </v>
<v Speaker 1>them back up the surface,</v>

224
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:38.074
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

225
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you know what that story means.</v>

226
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:42.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a very common story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the myth of the rebirth.</v>

227
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.890
<v Speaker 1>That became basically part of the hero's</v>
<v Speaker 1>journey.</v>

228
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 1>He saw a little bit of that echoed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nokia.</v>

229
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Really kind of a peculiar place to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>those serious and chorus.</v>

230
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I think if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hard to figure out how that</v>

231
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:57.240
<v Speaker 1>might have come about unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to entertain them.</v>

232
00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.083
<v Speaker 1>Like one consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these images we're going to do </v>

233
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:03.560
<v Speaker 1>get saved and passed around and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of bizarre forums.</v>

234
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.580
<v Speaker 1>So Remember Pinocchio to be the true </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>

235
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 1>which meant to be real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant to be born again.</v>

236
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.493
<v Speaker 1>He no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he not only had to go into the belly of </v>

237
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 1>the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the unknown your boroughs,</v>

238
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:16.724
<v Speaker 1>but he had to save his father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't just abandon it and save </v>

239
00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:21.620
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to bring the culture along with.</v>

240
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.453
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really potent story if you </v>

241
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:24.854
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously true sincere culture </v>

242
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:33.221
<v Speaker 1>protects you to abandon it or to him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fail it when it needs help,</v>

243
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:36.074
<v Speaker 1>so to speak means to turn your back on </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely the thing that protects you </v>

244
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.503
<v Speaker 1>from things that you understand so </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly that you don't even know they're </v>

245
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:48.550
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I remember in the hall,</v>

246
00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:49.384
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't the Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very popping in the 60s I mean </v>

247
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:53.294
<v Speaker 1>it's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hobbit saw live in a kingdom that </v>

248
00:15:57.711 --> 00:16:01.820
<v Speaker 1>it's threatened by vague forces from </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

249
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.423
<v Speaker 1>Their little people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among them are large people who they </v>

250
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:09.884
<v Speaker 1>call the striders and the strategy has </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like vagabonds and they patrol </v>

251
00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:20.210
<v Speaker 1>the perimeter of the hobbits kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of unknown to the hobbits,</v>

252
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.233
<v Speaker 1>but they're the mythical ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the hobbits have a fair amount of </v>

253
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:28.460
<v Speaker 1>contempt for them actually thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as traps,</v>

254
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.670
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually the forces that </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the unknown.</v>

255
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 1>The vague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known at bay so thoroughly that the</v>

256
00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 1>hobbits don't even know that it's there </v>
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>

257
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:39.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the position that we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

258
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:42.460
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>convince you out,</v>

259
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the commerce of this class,</v>

260
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.310
<v Speaker 1>there's the remnants of the old kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

261
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.440
<v Speaker 1>And the remnants of the old kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

262
00:16:50.441 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 1>They're the ancestral powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of cultures worship their</v>

263
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:55.304
<v Speaker 1>ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>erect stone monuments to the for </v>

264
00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:01.880
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't forget all the ancestors.</v>

265
00:17:01.881 --> 00:17:04.550
<v Speaker 1>It's easy for ancestors as well to turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>into gods.</v>

266
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:05.683
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what ancestors do over time is </v>

267
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.290
<v Speaker 1>they turned into cost and we added </v>
<v Speaker 1>points out,</v>

268
00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:11.750
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that among our key people,</v>

269
00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:14.690
<v Speaker 1>and that in this context means people </v>
<v Speaker 1>without a written tradition,</v>

270
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:17.090
<v Speaker 1>when people who only transmit </v>
<v Speaker 1>information orally,</v>

271
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.193
<v Speaker 1>historical events get transformed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological events when they pass out </v>

272
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:25.004
<v Speaker 1>of living memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say when the last person </v>

273
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.740
<v Speaker 1>who's alive that remembers the event </v>
<v Speaker 1>dies,</v>

274
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.963
<v Speaker 1>then that event is immediately in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense remembered as an event that took </v>

275
00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:41.981
<v Speaker 1>place in the unspecified time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>preceded the construction of the world.</v>

276
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.333
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want to burden your </v>

277
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:46.874
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you want to remember is the things </v>

278
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:50.034
<v Speaker 1>that are important and we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about remembering things say over the </v>

279
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:52.554
<v Speaker 1>course of 25,000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the unnecessary information that </v>

280
00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:57.084
<v Speaker 1>gets burdened away and all that's left </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the core pattern of information that </v>

281
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:06.051
<v Speaker 1>any historical event worthy of note </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily contains when we consider an</v>

282
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:08.850
<v Speaker 1>event historical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is part of the reason why history,</v>

283
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:09.684
<v Speaker 1>so he sits on the boundary between </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology and science in a sense to </v>

284
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:17.241
<v Speaker 1>consider an event worthy of historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>note necessarily has to contain elements</v>

285
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:18.714
<v Speaker 1>of your own mythology because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it didn't contain an element of </v>

286
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 1>conquering the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

287
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.163
<v Speaker 1>we would never regarded as sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable to even relegate to the domain </v>

288
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:29.334
<v Speaker 1>of necessary fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is troublesome for history because </v>

289
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.830
<v Speaker 1>study of history is supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>formalized into Sam's.</v>

290
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.240
<v Speaker 1>This is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big problem in history of generals.</v>

291
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Historical stories are told from within </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural perspectives.</v>

292
00:18:46.641 --> 00:18:51.641
<v Speaker 1>It would be awesome example of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you conceive of Columbus if you're a</v>

293
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:53.094
<v Speaker 1>European side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Traditional York painting the standards </v>

294
00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:55.934
<v Speaker 1>story four years ago was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus was a hero conquered new </v>

295
00:18:59.341 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus.</v>

296
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:02.370
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a historical fact.</v>

297
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.593
<v Speaker 1>Columbus was in fact looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise when he went out on his </v>

298
00:19:06.961 --> 00:19:09.840
<v Speaker 1>missions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his express motivation.</v>

299
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.853
<v Speaker 1>He thought like many people of his time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the paradise described in the Old </v>

300
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:16.463
<v Speaker 1>Testament was an actual location on </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth that perhaps could still be found </v>

301
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:20.874
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus hypothesized that paradise </v>

302
00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 1>could be found in the domain of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

303
00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:28.230
<v Speaker 1>You never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medieval maps,</v>

304
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:29.064
<v Speaker 1>there's vaguely defined territory with </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible monsters surrounding and Love </v>

305
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:33.234
<v Speaker 1>Columbus presume that paradise could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>found in the domain of the unknown and </v>

306
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:36.774
<v Speaker 1>now anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflating a mythological viewpoint of </v>

307
00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:41.784
<v Speaker 1>the world with with the actual word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very peculiar because of </v>

308
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even from the perspective of pure fact,</v>

309
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:51.750
<v Speaker 1>even though we wouldn't regard that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>an accurate description,</v>

310
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.033
<v Speaker 1>it is the case from the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that paradise still does </v>

311
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:56.574
<v Speaker 1>reside out in the unknown because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only way you can ever get there is to </v>

312
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:02.730
<v Speaker 1>explore it and constantly regenerate new</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

313
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense he was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was also,</v>

314
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:06.443
<v Speaker 1>he was also right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on your framework </v>

315
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.130
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

316
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:11.964
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that reading of Columbus </v>
<v Speaker 1>is necessarily in contrast with the </v>

317
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 1>reading of Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

318
00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 1>that might appear more natural to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>North American Indians.</v>

319
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.363
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to figure out the appropriate </v>

320
00:20:26.731 --> 00:20:30.420
<v Speaker 1>historical perspective or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

321
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.910
<v Speaker 1>if you separate all the facts from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction so to speak,</v>

322
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.223
<v Speaker 1>the problem then becomes that the facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>are dead and you end up in the position </v>

323
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:47.570
<v Speaker 1>of having to memorize endless states and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lists of places that will learn,</v>

324
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:53.170
<v Speaker 1>embed themselves in your memory because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no significance for behavioral</v>

325
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:54.694
<v Speaker 1>output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what students need when they </v>

326
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:56.914
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it necessary for us to learn </v>

327
00:20:58.931 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this dude is then say,</v>

328
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this holds no intrinsic interest.</v>

329
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:04.743
<v Speaker 1>And they're saying because my limbic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is intelligent enough to </v>

330
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:07.894
<v Speaker 1>discriminate between information that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the potential to impact my behavior </v>

331
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 1>or the way I framed the world and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>which does not have that capacity.</v>

332
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.253
<v Speaker 1>And since I only have a limited time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably attend to what's </v>

333
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:20.524
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generally what we mean by what is </v>

334
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:27.211
<v Speaker 1>important is what will actually change </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we conduct ourselves if we learn</v>

335
00:21:27.231 --> 00:21:28.064
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that we seem to have </v>

336
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.483
<v Speaker 1>either never quite figured out or </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten or I think much of education </v>

337
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:34.983
<v Speaker 1>is that the purpose of education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of facts even is to aid the </v>

338
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:44.761
<v Speaker 1>generation of wisdom and if it fails to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce that end then it's useless.</v>

339
00:21:45.491 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than useless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

340
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.920
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

341
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 1>it's noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>

342
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.333
<v Speaker 1>So we don't have a formalized method for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transmission of wisdom and we've </v>

343
00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:03.001
<v Speaker 1>forgotten the domain in which it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted and we know a lot about fact</v>

344
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.440
<v Speaker 1>is that another person's worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare,</v>

345
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.823
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And different cultures share different </v>

346
00:22:13.481 --> 00:22:17.510
<v Speaker 1>stories to such an extent that like one </v>
<v Speaker 1>person can be seen as like</v>

347
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.770
<v Speaker 1>more cultures constantly at war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other every day has it.</v>

348
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.560
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing has become so did that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we all recognize like one basic,</v>

349
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.400
<v Speaker 1>well I guess it depends on what you mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>by everyday.</v>

350
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's been more than 150 wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the end of World War II.</v>

351
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's mean which we consider in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sentence the last war.</v>

352
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Well with certain exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Korea and Vietnam,</v>

353
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.153
<v Speaker 1>certainly large</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicts of the sword you described do </v>

354
00:22:52.501 --> 00:22:53.334
<v Speaker 1>occur all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that needs to be </v>

355
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:56.524
<v Speaker 1>taken into consideration is that wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be conducted at many levels of </v>

356
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:01.570
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the,</v>

357
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:02.703
<v Speaker 1>one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages to being able to abstract </v>

358
00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:11.581
<v Speaker 1>ideas is that we can have a war that </v>
<v Speaker 1>proceeds at the abstract,</v>

359
00:23:11.591 --> 00:23:16.420
<v Speaker 1>that domain without unnecessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily degenerating into physical</v>

360
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:17.254
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that there's at least the </v>

361
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:21.610
<v Speaker 1>possibility that if you hold one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>theological stamps,</v>

362
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.623
<v Speaker 1>which means that you ascribe one meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>to an object and I ascribe another </v>

363
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:30.571
<v Speaker 1>meeting that we can discuss it and fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and conduct the war in words.</v>

364
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence come to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement,</v>

365
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:34.744
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose might be considered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of annuity Ologie or doing </v>

366
00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:37.933
<v Speaker 1>the film without necessarily having to </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow the process to cascade back down </v>

367
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.750
<v Speaker 1>behavior where the we're forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>determines.</v>

368
00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is peace then?</v>

369
00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is like,</v>

370
00:23:51.641 --> 00:23:52.474
<v Speaker 1>it's just like a lack of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression like out now battling it out </v>

371
00:23:55.331 --> 00:23:56.164
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that like are just like just </v>

372
00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.373
<v Speaker 1>contending ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't speak verbally at each other's </v>

373
00:24:00.791 --> 00:24:02.680
<v Speaker 1>throats?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the best we can do?</v>

374
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.063
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>

375
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.990
<v Speaker 1>well that's a perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

376
00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:06.824
<v Speaker 1>I guess the question is what attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>most most essentially characterizes the </v>

377
00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:12.830
<v Speaker 1>attitude piece.</v>

378
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.303
<v Speaker 1>I saw one time when I was in Montreal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I saw a 19 year old guy standing on </v>

379
00:24:23.031 --> 00:24:26.030
<v Speaker 1>the street in an outdoor shopping mall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a big character,</v>

380
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.043
<v Speaker 1>tough luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a punk haircut and a leather </v>

381
00:24:29.811 --> 00:24:30.644
<v Speaker 1>jacket and he was standing on the corner</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding your pink shopping bag full of </v>

382
00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:38.540
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

383
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.740
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

384
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.573
<v Speaker 1>He looked somewhat in the RV and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspect that he thought he looked the </v>

385
00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:44.114
<v Speaker 1>same way holding this up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought you look at someone like </v>

386
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:50.384
<v Speaker 1>that will be aware of their capacity for</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression on the outside of their skin </v>

387
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.033
<v Speaker 1>where everyone can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no domain for its proper </v>

388
00:24:57.651 --> 00:24:58.484
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people in that situation ended up </v>

389
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 1>doing things that are essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>inserted,</v>

390
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:03.014
<v Speaker 1>like working in seven 11 for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up at quarter of a shopping </v>

391
00:25:06.801 --> 00:25:08.620
<v Speaker 1>mall to pink shopping bag in there.</v>

392
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.493
<v Speaker 1>Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the things that you might </v>

393
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.610
<v Speaker 1>wonder under those circumstances is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

394
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.270
<v Speaker 1>is there any way that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct an attitude towards peace that</v>

395
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:22.271
<v Speaker 1>was sufficiently difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive that it would satisfy someone</v>

396
00:25:22.641 --> 00:25:26.970
<v Speaker 1>who's in that particular position?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tend to think of on that</v>

397
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.653
<v Speaker 1>as a state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a default condition I suppose as the </v>

398
00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:38.050
<v Speaker 1>state then rains when nothing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily happening.</v>

399
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:39.883
<v Speaker 1>Strikes me that in order to make peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>and attractive proposition has to be </v>

400
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:44.834
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated incontrovertibly in a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's actually a more dangerous and </v>

401
00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:49.574
<v Speaker 1>interesting answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>War War I think I understand now </v>

402
00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.493
<v Speaker 1>different perceptions of wisdom meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>like different ways of regulating </v>

403
00:26:04.571 --> 00:26:05.404
<v Speaker 1>emotions and the fact that cultures </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate emotions know differently than </v>

404
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.330
<v Speaker 1>many of the societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

405
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Maintain order and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like the motions like I,</v>

406
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.970
<v Speaker 1>cause I was thinking about wisdom and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

407
00:26:18.971 --> 00:26:20.800
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of a subjective term.</v>

408
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Like you may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of your wisdom is dysfunctional,</v>

409
00:26:23.831 --> 00:26:26.050
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I think the mind is functioning,</v>

410
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.960
<v Speaker 1>handle things to regulate your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may not be the truth,</v>

411
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.843
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's an war being fought because of </v>

412
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:35.950
<v Speaker 1>different in those are placed here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

413
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

414
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

415
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.633
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can push the argument down a level </v>

416
00:26:41.401 --> 00:26:42.234
<v Speaker 1>of analysis even insane which basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point of this particular quote that </v>

417
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.820
<v Speaker 1>our maps determined in the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects in our,</v>

418
00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 1>in our spiritual field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

419
00:26:52.351 --> 00:26:53.184
<v Speaker 1>and wherever there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wherever you presume that this object </v>

420
00:26:57.031 --> 00:26:59.180
<v Speaker 1>has a different implication for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

421
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 1>what can I do or for our mutual </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

422
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:02.784
<v Speaker 1>love what's in its presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's an unknown right there and </v>

423
00:27:06.511 --> 00:27:11.511
<v Speaker 1>there's also instant room for conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can only do well.</v>

424
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.593
<v Speaker 1>This is not always the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's frequently the case that only </v>

425
00:27:14.851 --> 00:27:19.140
<v Speaker 1>one set of behavioral outputs can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested in any particular situation.</v>

426
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.060
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly the case for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

427
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.223
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why you have to solve your</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems is because you can't do two </v>

428
00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:27.690
<v Speaker 1>things at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only do one thing.</v>

429
00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:32.040
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going back only long ways.</v>

430
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to refer to the domain of methods,</v>

431
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.553
<v Speaker 1>the men that we have forgotten because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that if we were to know </v>

432
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:45.750
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were to know it now,</v>

433
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.630
<v Speaker 1>we would know it in a way that we never </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have known it before.</v>

434
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly,</v>

435
00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I forgotten there was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was now in a home.</v>

436
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.563
<v Speaker 1>It was the whole way in which we now </v>
<v Speaker 1>know was built out of that and that's </v>

437
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.193
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it didn't do it because I never know </v>

438
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.190
<v Speaker 1>how well I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a reasonable,</v>

439
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 1>but that's a perfectly reasonable way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it.</v>

440
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Except I would say that there's one more</v>
<v Speaker 1>twist to that,</v>

441
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that at a defined time in the past,</v>

442
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:17.520
<v Speaker 1>and I would say starting approximately </v>
<v Speaker 1>500 years ago,</v>

443
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.050
<v Speaker 1>when the scientific methodology really </v>
<v Speaker 1>came into its own,</v>

444
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.693
<v Speaker 1>we made the mis attribution that we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact understand what we had never </v>

445
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:28.224
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that we didn't understand </v>

446
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:31.704
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we understood it thoroughly enough </v>

447
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.473
<v Speaker 1>to know that it was no longer a valid </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of knowledge and that we could </v>

448
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:37.554
<v Speaker 1>safely discarded as superstition or as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a primitive form of science and move </v>

449
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:43.974
<v Speaker 1>into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me that there was never </v>

450
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:46.740
<v Speaker 1>a point at which we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

451
00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:50.250
<v Speaker 1>we said what we were doing and Ben was </v>
<v Speaker 1>silliness.</v>

452
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:52.290
<v Speaker 1>And what we were doing now is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the road,</v>

453
00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand that.</v>

454
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:56.860
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

455
00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Hagen</v>

456
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.440
<v Speaker 1>and I borrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>your class.</v>

457
00:29:11.441 --> 00:29:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

458
00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.073
<v Speaker 3>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see as soon as you mess with the </v>

459
00:29:16.631 --> 00:29:17.464
<v Speaker 3>object,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's mapped in accordance with </v>

460
00:29:20.051 --> 00:29:20.884
<v Speaker 3>this mythological structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you instantly start to wreak havoc on </v>

461
00:29:26.021 --> 00:29:29.080
<v Speaker 3>the whole structure that determines the </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate,</v>

462
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.093
<v Speaker 3>the appropriate behavior of books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know already what that structure </v>

463
00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.080
<v Speaker 3>inhibits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It inhibits,</v>

464
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.193
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that inhibits his </v>

465
00:29:36.911 --> 00:29:37.744
<v Speaker 3>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that you may have </v>

466
00:29:40.631 --> 00:29:43.300
<v Speaker 3>found doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

467
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.613
<v Speaker 3>when this unexpected occurrence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the roads was doing something that </v>

468
00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 3>children do when they don't know what to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

469
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.990
<v Speaker 3>which is called referencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

470
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.903
<v Speaker 3>if a child does something unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say it drops a glass of milk on the </v>

471
00:29:58.421 --> 00:29:59.254
<v Speaker 3>floor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing it will do is look at </v>

472
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:02.374
<v Speaker 3>its mother or whichever it all happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be present because the unexpected is </v>

473
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.204
<v Speaker 3>just revealed itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say that an event that </v>

474
00:30:10.571 --> 00:30:15.571
<v Speaker 3>occurred contrary to plan emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's indeterminate insignificance,</v>

475
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.910
<v Speaker 3>although it evokes anxiety.</v>

476
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:23.020
<v Speaker 3>The fastest way to get rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxieties to reference,</v>

477
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.273
<v Speaker 3>which is that you look at your parent </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you watch your parents actions and </v>

478
00:30:27.431 --> 00:30:31.270
<v Speaker 3>the parent's actions determined the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual significance of the event,</v>

479
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.570
<v Speaker 3>thus reducing its infinite significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to speak to a definable category.</v>

480
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 3>And what you have to understand for </v>
<v Speaker 3>children is,</v>

481
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.090
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is true anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if the parent is angry,</v>

482
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.710
<v Speaker 3>the definite anger is better than the in</v>
<v Speaker 3>determinant significance.</v>

483
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

484
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.723
<v Speaker 3>that's why children prefer order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos even if it's relatively straight </v>

485
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.980
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

486
00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>set of questions.</v>

487
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.050
<v Speaker 3>So you're dying dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

488
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

489
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.260
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

490
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:05.523
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

491
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.543
<v Speaker 3>the meaning of the projector to you as </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to the meaning of the projector </v>

492
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 3>to him that had a conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

493
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:12.243
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not only the meaning of the </v>

494
00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:16.390
<v Speaker 3>projectors so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everything that the,</v>

495
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:21.340
<v Speaker 3>the dispute implied say about relative </v>
<v Speaker 3>importance of pursuit.</v>

496
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Like in an institution like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's at least a,</v>

497
00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you say?</v>

498
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:31.890
<v Speaker 3>There's at least the theory of equality </v>
<v Speaker 3>of access to certain things at,</v>

499
00:31:32.211 --> 00:31:34.390
<v Speaker 3>at any number of levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like access to audio,</v>

500
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:35.610
<v Speaker 3>visual equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

501
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.260
<v Speaker 3>the fact that someone's been around here</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer than me,</v>

502
00:31:38.261 --> 00:31:39.094
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has no bearing in theory and in </v>

503
00:31:42.311 --> 00:31:46.990
<v Speaker 3>actuality under almost all conditions on</v>
<v Speaker 3>their access to things like audio,</v>

504
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:49.570
<v Speaker 3>visual equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when being comes in here and says,</v>

505
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:51.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite what you're doing and the fact </v>

506
00:31:53.741 --> 00:31:56.740
<v Speaker 3>that you followed the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's senior so to speak,</v>

507
00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.113
<v Speaker 3>wants this and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of information in that </v>

508
00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:02.854
<v Speaker 3>sort of interaction about relative </v>
<v Speaker 3>importance and not just relative </v>

509
00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:08.284
<v Speaker 3>importance off of that projector,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of the parties who were engaged in </v>

510
00:32:11.591 --> 00:32:15.310
<v Speaker 3>negotiation for the projector anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with regards to referencing,</v>

511
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:18.100
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering like you can think back </v>
<v Speaker 3>about your own reactions.</v>

512
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.253
<v Speaker 3>Do you look around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you look around when that was going </v>

513
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:25.120
<v Speaker 3>on to see how other people responded and</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's,</v>

514
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.013
<v Speaker 3>that's a way of coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a way of trying to instantly </v>

515
00:32:28.331 --> 00:32:29.950
<v Speaker 3>acquire consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>

516
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.350
<v Speaker 3>What the Hell's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

517
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some of these other people know </v>
<v Speaker 3>all look at them.</v>

518
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I can tell by their facial reactions are</v>
<v Speaker 3>their patterns of behavior,</v>

519
00:32:38.021 --> 00:32:41.660
<v Speaker 3>what this event might signify.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exploratory behavior.</v>

520
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 3>You're exploring the environment but the</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

521
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.880
<v Speaker 3>many cases is composed of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

522
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:47.714
<v Speaker 3>the most important part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment is composed of other people </v>

523
00:32:49.671 --> 00:32:50.504
<v Speaker 3>and when we have a map of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment who were mapping is other </v>

524
00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:56.660
<v Speaker 3>people in relationship to herself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>and vice versa.</v>

525
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:57.883
<v Speaker 3>So that's referencing you poached.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pushed him like you wouldn't back </v>

526
00:33:01.391 --> 00:33:01.940
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

527
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could have considered again </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the fight as well.</v>

528
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.963
<v Speaker 3>That seems like that's the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the other purpose or the </v>

529
00:33:09.401 --> 00:33:10.234
<v Speaker 3>demonstration is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I have a map and you have a map and </v>

530
00:33:14.231 --> 00:33:18.250
<v Speaker 3>they and they conflict with regards to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular object,</v>

531
00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:19.683
<v Speaker 3>then which happens very frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then one of the things that's </v>

532
00:33:22.931 --> 00:33:27.730
<v Speaker 3>interesting to do is to consider the </v>
<v Speaker 3>options for eliminating the conflict.</v>

533
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.660
<v Speaker 3>One option is to eliminate one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflicting parties.</v>

534
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's an option that's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful.</v>

535
00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:34.683
<v Speaker 3>Commonly held when you buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What people generally do is they start </v>

536
00:33:37.361 --> 00:33:41.590
<v Speaker 3>to negotiate verbally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically means that they're using</v>

537
00:33:41.591 --> 00:33:42.424
<v Speaker 3>their verbal behavior to put their plan </v>
<v Speaker 3>back into action to get what they want </v>

538
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.400
<v Speaker 3>and as that's blocked saying it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

539
00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:49.923
<v Speaker 3>more and more emotion builds up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>other strategies but are sort of lower </v>

540
00:33:54.821 --> 00:33:59.470
<v Speaker 3>on the access hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get thrown into play culminate possible.</v>

541
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I wanted to get dean to do,</v>

542
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:02.853
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a little bit nervous I think </v>

543
00:34:03.701 --> 00:34:05.680
<v Speaker 3>doing it because it's not part of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

544
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.790
<v Speaker 3>I wanted him to take the project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was given him,</v>

545
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:14.350
<v Speaker 3>hold it and see if I could get someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>to help me hold on the trait.</v>

546
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that we want to figure</v>

547
00:34:18.341 --> 00:34:19.174
<v Speaker 3>out is given the maps of meaning are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to conflict with regards to the </v>

548
00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.233
<v Speaker 3>importance of objects including in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>notion of object including ourself and </v>

549
00:34:30.181 --> 00:34:34.030
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the appropriate strategy to adopt</v>

550
00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.373
<v Speaker 3>in the process of negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very much related to your </v>

551
00:34:38.081 --> 00:34:39.100
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said,</v>

552
00:34:39.101 --> 00:34:43.750
<v Speaker 3>well what constitutes say the essential </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of peace?</v>

553
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.063
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the things you have to figure </v>

554
00:34:45.881 --> 00:34:46.714
<v Speaker 3>out is when you're in unknown territory </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'd be put there by someone else </v>

555
00:34:49.661 --> 00:34:53.110
<v Speaker 3>who's also there because of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>

556
00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:57.310
<v Speaker 3>How is it that you should act so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're acting optimally,</v>

557
00:34:57.311 --> 00:34:58.144
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to resolve the problem in the most </v>

558
00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:03.100
<v Speaker 3>positive of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most causative of conceivable weights,</v>

559
00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.173
<v Speaker 3>which is to say we need to figure out a </v>
<v Speaker 3>set of rules that everyone can agree on </v>

560
00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:12.160
<v Speaker 3>for operating in the domain where there </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't any rules.</v>

561
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.410
<v Speaker 3>We cook a black Melvin cause I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want on tape.</v>

562
00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

563
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.520
<v Speaker 3>So we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it's culture aid as this story.</v>

564
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:41.030
<v Speaker 3>Culture B has this story and they meet</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as they meet the members of both</v>

565
00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:45.564
<v Speaker 3>cultures are no longer in these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in some domain in between and </v>

566
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:54.840
<v Speaker 3>the rules that apply here and the rules </v>
<v Speaker 3>that apply here do not apply here.</v>

567
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:59.570
<v Speaker 3>So kind of course the question is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules apply here and well,</v>

568
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.370
<v Speaker 3>the other diagram that I'll keep showing</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

569
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.330
<v Speaker 3>somebody described it as the bouncing </v>
<v Speaker 3>ball,</v>

570
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:05.190
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of a good way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>describing it.</v>

571
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.290
<v Speaker 3>The rules that apply outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>domain.</v>

572
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Here are the rules and that constituted </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that's the hero's path.</v>

573
00:36:14.921 --> 00:36:18.030
<v Speaker 3>So you would say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hero,</v>

574
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:19.143
<v Speaker 3>this is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why you get archetipal hero </v>

575
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:22.734
<v Speaker 3>figures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was really the ideal figures for </v>

576
00:36:24.421 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 3>culture and they're also as a general </v>
<v Speaker 3>rule,</v>

577
00:36:26.431 --> 00:36:28.940
<v Speaker 3>representatives of peace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

578
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.950
<v Speaker 3>this is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very common food.</v>

579
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:31.783
<v Speaker 3>If for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of the embodiment of pace and </v>

580
00:36:33.631 --> 00:36:37.500
<v Speaker 3>the same thing is true for Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because they are those,</v>

581
00:36:37.501 --> 00:36:42.501
<v Speaker 3>their patterns of behavior characterized</v>
<v Speaker 3>the optimal form of action that is to be</v>

582
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:45.600
<v Speaker 3>undertaken in the domain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This between two specified domains.</v>

583
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:46.913
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess he came into our territory and </v>

584
00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.730
<v Speaker 3>were part of your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of that done.</v>

585
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I was just wondering in</v>
<v Speaker 3>general meeting,</v>

586
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.140
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think,</v>

587
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:06.550
<v Speaker 3>what would happen if instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 3>your map again,</v>

588
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.760
<v Speaker 3>pin on all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

589
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.653
<v Speaker 3>the police stated a crucial meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Danielle did a toss an insult </v>

590
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:23.060
<v Speaker 3>adding mousy lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is something that you like,</v>

591
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.333
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how thoroughly you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking in by this particular </v>

592
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:30.114
<v Speaker 3>demonstration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that you have to </v>

593
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.060
<v Speaker 3>try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

594
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.030
<v Speaker 3>appreciate is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

595
00:37:36.031 --> 00:37:37.590
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as clearly as you can,</v>

596
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.300
<v Speaker 3>is just what were your responses during </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

597
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.353
<v Speaker 3>during the interruption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this was the entrance of the </v>

598
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 3>stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

599
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.390
<v Speaker 3>to hostile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange.</v>

600
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had his own agenda.</v>

601
00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:53.070
<v Speaker 3>They weren't actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't really his agenda.</v>

602
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.800
<v Speaker 3>It was an agenda that he was acting out </v>
<v Speaker 3>for someone else.</v>

603
00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:58.860
<v Speaker 3>So he's kind of in a sense just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emissary of bad news.</v>

604
00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:00.183
<v Speaker 3>But this is a PC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a pretty minor example of </v>

605
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.760
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you think,</v>

606
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had it mean real.</v>

607
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.890
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

608
00:38:10.891 --> 00:38:13.530
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I was told before</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came to Harvard was it,</v>

609
00:38:13.531 --> 00:38:14.364
<v Speaker 3>there was a certain amount of tension </v>
<v Speaker 3>between junior and senior faculty </v>

610
00:38:16.591 --> 00:38:17.424
<v Speaker 3>members.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not nearly as true as I was led </v>

611
00:38:19.741 --> 00:38:20.574
<v Speaker 3>to believe before I got here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And much of the distance that exists is </v>

612
00:38:24.061 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 3>a function of age and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and well in large part anyways,</v>

613
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:30.143
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>disruption would do the me if it really </v>

614
00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:34.704
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be to undermine my confidence in </v>

615
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:39.754
<v Speaker 3>my position here and since I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>devoted a lot of my life to attaining </v>

616
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 3>this particular position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least that's how it's worked out,</v>

617
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:52.020
<v Speaker 3>that sort of objectively minor </v>
<v Speaker 3>intervention could have,</v>

618
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of highly negative </v>

619
00:38:55.781 --> 00:38:56.614
<v Speaker 3>consequences in this case though </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't really have such consequences </v>

620
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:04.720
<v Speaker 3>because of what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what really made me think that this must</v>

621
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:05.554
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this must be stage taking it to </v>

622
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:08.283
<v Speaker 3>borehole.</v>

623
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's okay.</v>

624
00:39:10.621 --> 00:39:11.381
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good,</v>

625
00:39:11.381 --> 00:39:13.720
<v Speaker 3>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of it because I didn't,</v>

626
00:39:13.721 --> 00:39:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Dean wasn't as forceful as I would've </v>
<v Speaker 3>liked to have been on.</v>

627
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:21.610
<v Speaker 3>I actually asked him to come in here </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he has natural politeness,</v>

628
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 3>overcame his acting ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>

629
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 3>I wanted him to come in here and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me what was happening,</v>

630
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more or less abruptly and just take it.</v>

631
00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.690
<v Speaker 3>I was certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had made it,</v>

632
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.030
<v Speaker 3>made it fairly believable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's true.</v>

633
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:37.480
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

634
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.433
<v Speaker 3>We were all anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're not anxious anymore because </v>

635
00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:42.010
<v Speaker 3>we've redefined what it means now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've right.</v>

636
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:45.260
<v Speaker 3>And even before it was clear to everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the room that it was staged.</v>

637
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Like as soon as he left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

638
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.293
<v Speaker 3>as soon as he left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we started talking about it as an </v>

639
00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:53.520
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now everyone got what they wanted it.</v>

640
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:58.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean going with his story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got the projector and we took the,</v>

641
00:39:58.001 --> 00:40:01.000
<v Speaker 3>the event of having the projectors taken</v>
<v Speaker 3>from us to mean,</v>

642
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.460
<v Speaker 3>well great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we have an example to talk about for</v>

643
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:04.294
<v Speaker 3>a mile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So kind of thing was a change card sort </v>

644
00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:11.170
<v Speaker 3>of rec revisionist history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even before I realized that,</v>

645
00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.570
<v Speaker 3>we said as we started talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a perfect example.</v>

646
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty sure it was stage because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it would be highly inappropriate</v>

647
00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:23.590
<v Speaker 3>for him to come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

648
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

649
00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:35.080
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] was the real situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That professor was in the lecture of 300</v>

650
00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:38.110
<v Speaker 3>people and had to have this machine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the only one.</v>

651
00:40:38.111 --> 00:40:38.944
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wouldn't be an unreasonable </v>

652
00:40:40.181 --> 00:40:41.470
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

653
00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.690
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the what is the more appropriate,</v>

654
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.520
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly right.</v>

655
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:51.360
<v Speaker 3>He should have asked me brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the room or equipment.</v>

656
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Speaker 3>What does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interest.</v>

657
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think it took you such a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>

658
00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

659
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.380
<v Speaker 3>I probably do a piece together so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

660
00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.570
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody else again.</v>

661
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:11.403
<v Speaker 3>Tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think it took you such a long time </v>

662
00:41:12.311 --> 00:41:15.010
<v Speaker 3>to la first?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The issue was you needed,</v>

663
00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.090
<v Speaker 3>well that was at least that was my cover</v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

664
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.043
<v Speaker 3>I mean the real issue is what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>are you doing barging in here in front </v>

665
00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:23.284
<v Speaker 3>of my whole class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking this dam project or make me look </v>

666
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:26.524
<v Speaker 3>like an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the cover story is I need this </v>

667
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:31.990
<v Speaker 3>projector to finish my class</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>

668
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.790
<v Speaker 3>That's how it work out in reality I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

669
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.883
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

670
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.510
<v Speaker 3>We come back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

671
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 3>I'll just call and tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

672
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:48.720
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this hoax day.</v>

673
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.840
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

674
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:54.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I don't remember.</v>

675
00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:58.500
<v Speaker 3>When did you leave?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Immediately afternoon.</v>

676
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:03.130
<v Speaker 3>That was a stage that was staged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

677
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:04.523
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerry Kagan and the basement using the </v>

678
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:10.970
<v Speaker 3>overhead projector</v>
<v Speaker 3>to lecture class.</v>

679
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I asked him to come in here.</v>

680
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a dispute with me about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning of an origin?</v>

681
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.160
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>unimportant</v>

682
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:31.900
<v Speaker 3>I stage [inaudible] classic example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

683
00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.510
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

684
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.363
<v Speaker 3>Back to the most appropriate fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the fantasy being an alternative </v>

685
00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:49.844
<v Speaker 3>story where the motivational </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance of things is the way that </v>

686
00:42:51.921 --> 00:42:56.921
<v Speaker 3>you wish they would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertained by it.</v>

687
00:42:56.961 --> 00:43:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Because I was actually seeing if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would ask the same with,</v>

688
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've been telling us</v>

689
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.100
<v Speaker 3>and seeing if you would actually go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through like it was cool to see,</v>

690
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:12.830
<v Speaker 3>like</v>
<v Speaker 3>in real life you would have had,</v>

691
00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:28.350
<v Speaker 3>it</v>
<v Speaker 3>depends how you're approached the,</v>

692
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.680
<v Speaker 3>if the cover story is plausible and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emergency seems to justify,</v>

693
00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:43.573
<v Speaker 3>well that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the things I've been </v>

694
00:43:44.721 --> 00:43:49.721
<v Speaker 3>trying to point out to the meaning of an</v>
<v Speaker 3>event depends on the behavioral strategy</v>

695
00:43:49.911 --> 00:43:51.950
<v Speaker 3>that you using the presence of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>

696
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.170
<v Speaker 3>So even with Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

697
00:43:54.171 --> 00:43:58.730
<v Speaker 3>in his intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the strategies that he used to,</v>

698
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:00.103
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to offer me the anomalous information </v>

699
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:07.210
<v Speaker 3>aren't going to determine the phenomenon</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I am in that particular context.</v>

700
00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.293
<v Speaker 3>So if he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if he would've called me outside </v>

701
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:10.221
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

702
00:44:10.221 --> 00:44:11.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

703
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:16.520
<v Speaker 3>but here's the situation and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>large context situation.</v>

704
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:17.443
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like let's say Kagan needed the </v>

705
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:19.334
<v Speaker 3>projector because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was involved at some major </v>

706
00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:23.894
<v Speaker 3>fundraising episode for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the department and it had broken </v>

707
00:44:26.841 --> 00:44:28.070
<v Speaker 3>down suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

708
00:44:28.071 --> 00:44:28.904
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then I'll basically what you're </v>

709
00:44:30.051 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 3>doing under those is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can erase this now is</v>

710
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.440
<v Speaker 3>this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

711
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.600
<v Speaker 3>little stories inside this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy by the way.</v>

712
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.720
<v Speaker 3>He thinks a lot.</v>

713
00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:02.830
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

714
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:09.223
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what gene would have to do in order </v>

715
00:45:11.581 --> 00:45:12.414
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well dean would have to do in order to </v>

716
00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:19.980
<v Speaker 3>convince me that his intrusion into my </v>
<v Speaker 3>story was justified.</v>

717
00:45:19.981 --> 00:45:20.814
<v Speaker 3>Say My story of being at this level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis cause to make would be to make </v>

718
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:24.654
<v Speaker 3>reference to a larger story of which I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was also a part that I considered as </v>

719
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:33.090
<v Speaker 3>well as him super ordinate to the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were going on now.</v>

720
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.860
<v Speaker 3>So he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

721
00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:35.694
<v Speaker 3>I know that this event has meaning a </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the frame of reference of this </v>

722
00:45:41.191 --> 00:45:44.040
<v Speaker 3>ongoing class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But from frame of Reference v,</v>

723
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:44.874
<v Speaker 3>which you also share,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has this alternative meaning we'll </v>

724
00:45:47.491 --> 00:45:50.700
<v Speaker 3>contrast the meanings and come to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of agreement about them.</v>

725
00:45:50.701 --> 00:45:51.391
<v Speaker 3>And I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

726
00:45:51.391 --> 00:45:53.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I found his story convincing,</v>

727
00:45:53.491 --> 00:45:54.324
<v Speaker 3>I'm subordinate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd altered this story because it would </v>

728
00:45:56.851 --> 00:45:57.684
<v Speaker 3>be less motivationally challenging then </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me to be engaged in altering the </v>

729
00:46:01.921 --> 00:46:03.860
<v Speaker 3>superman story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assuming they're shared.</v>

730
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.273
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the kind of decisions you're </v>

731
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.850
<v Speaker 3>always making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're negotiating with someone,</v>

732
00:46:08.851 --> 00:46:10.200
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do the same thing.</v>

733
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:11.063
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if I want something from you that </v>

734
00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:15.570
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to give me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to offer something to you that,</v>

735
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:16.973
<v Speaker 3>that is sufficiently important to </v>
<v Speaker 3>counterbalance your laws or offer you </v>

736
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:25.470
<v Speaker 3>the possibility of that in the future or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>

737
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:28.520
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

738
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:30.143
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were two things right after he </v>

739
00:46:32.341 --> 00:46:33.174
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

740
00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.260
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turning the [inaudible] into,</v>

741
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to beginning to talk about it as</v>

742
00:46:37.931 --> 00:46:41.620
<v Speaker 4>an experiment or it changed the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>valence of the thing,</v>

743
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.360
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right away.</v>

744
00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.820
<v Speaker 4>And the humor was also a part of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

745
00:46:45.821 --> 00:46:47.860
<v Speaker 4>It became a source of humor at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

746
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:52.870
<v Speaker 4>And it was just interesting to watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether everyone immediately saw that it</v>

747
00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:53.913
<v Speaker 4>had been a hoax or not treating it as if</v>
<v Speaker 4>it had been treating it as an </v>

748
00:46:59.501 --> 00:47:00.334
<v Speaker 4>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took away all the anxiety and the </v>

749
00:47:02.501 --> 00:47:03.334
<v Speaker 4>negative energy attached to it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>neutralize it and put it in this new </v>

750
00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:06.853
<v Speaker 4>site.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

751
00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.580
<v Speaker 3>that is the instant provision of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

752
00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

753
00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:11.871
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

754
00:47:11.871 --> 00:47:12.970
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

755
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:13.873
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the classic demonstration of the </v>

756
00:47:16.371 --> 00:47:17.204
<v Speaker 3>fact that the story is in fact what </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes your emotions and you're always </v>

757
00:47:21.891 --> 00:47:24.260
<v Speaker 3>trying to regulate your emotions in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face of the unknown,</v>

758
00:47:24.261 --> 00:47:26.600
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

759
00:47:26.601 --> 00:47:28.790
<v Speaker 3>the notion of the humor is interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

760
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:33.250
<v Speaker 3>One of the mythological precursors of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the figure of the,</v>

761
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.173
<v Speaker 3>of the savior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is sort of the archetype of the </v>

762
00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:38.260
<v Speaker 3>hero is the trickster shrinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

763
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:38.981
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

764
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:41.410
<v Speaker 3>The trickster is but bugs bunny for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

765
00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:44.020
<v Speaker 3>that's his classic rule in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Warner brothers cartoons.</v>

766
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.120
<v Speaker 3>He always has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

767
00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:50.140
<v Speaker 3>he always gives the events at twist </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative events of twists that make them</v>

768
00:47:50.141 --> 00:47:50.974
<v Speaker 3>turn out right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the twist may not look exactly on </v>

769
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:55.720
<v Speaker 3>the straight and narrow window occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as the story unfolds,</v>

770
00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:57.190
<v Speaker 3>it appears to be the right thing.</v>

771
00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:00.700
<v Speaker 3>And trickster figures are very common </v>
<v Speaker 3>figures in mythology,</v>

772
00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Speaker 3>especially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

773
00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:02.993
<v Speaker 3>Apparently at the stage of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>development where the thicker of the </v>

774
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:10.000
<v Speaker 3>hero is really being elaborated up into </v>
<v Speaker 3>something identifiable.</v>

775
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:12.550
<v Speaker 3>So he's sort of a transition figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An adolescent,</v>

776
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.350
<v Speaker 3>you might say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a sense.</v>

777
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:19.860
<v Speaker 3>So the irony is to see that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ironic distance,</v>

778
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm in,</v>

779
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 3>the humor is in a kind of an ironic </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance,</v>

780
00:48:25.421 --> 00:48:27.210
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

781
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.830
<v Speaker 3>is it something that turns out to be not</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it seemed to be,</v>

782
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:30.783
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean cause the trickster seems to be </v>

783
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.040
<v Speaker 3>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns out it's that.</v>

784
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:36.040
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a kind of double meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why,</v>

785
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:38.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we also find things humorous.</v>

786
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:43.060
<v Speaker 3>When did we become spontaneously aware </v>
<v Speaker 3>that once again,</v>

787
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:46.420
<v Speaker 3>we've transcended a set of arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 3>limitations.</v>

788
00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.523
<v Speaker 3>So I think keywill occurs at least in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some instances when you move from a </v>

789
00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:56.080
<v Speaker 3>bounded domain to outside the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that back and do another one because you</v>

790
00:48:56.081 --> 00:48:56.914
<v Speaker 3>have a fleeting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a fleeting moment there where </v>

791
00:48:58.721 --> 00:49:00.430
<v Speaker 3>you recognize your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are,</v>

792
00:49:00.431 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 3>you recognized yourself as sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent figure and people find out,</v>

793
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.130
<v Speaker 3>well hey find that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

794
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.160
<v Speaker 3>the word empowering springs to mind.</v>

795
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.970
<v Speaker 3>It's a word I particularly hate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

796
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:17.520
<v Speaker 1>what I don't really understand is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>my feeling in the sea,</v>

797
00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:19.740
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't realize until the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage,</v>

798
00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.420
<v Speaker 1>which is great embarrassment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

799
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:23.970
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why were you bear?</v>

800
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why were you embarrassed for me?</v>

801
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:27.043
<v Speaker 3>See that's thoughts.</v>

802
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:28.443
<v Speaker 1>I think similar to what she said was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that instead of like we sit here and we </v>

803
00:49:32.361 --> 00:49:33.194
<v Speaker 1>listen to you as a professor and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>then placed in the position of a </v>

804
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.300
<v Speaker 1>bickering of a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

805
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.313
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just be like your credibility with </v>

806
00:49:40.571 --> 00:49:42.110
<v Speaker 1>seriously on the ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

807
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:44.230
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was Kinda like,</v>

808
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:45.970
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see that,</v>

809
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:46.803
<v Speaker 3>like the phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the phenomena of embarrassment </v>

810
00:49:48.531 --> 00:49:50.720
<v Speaker 3>is one of those things that all curves </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

811
00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.380
<v Speaker 3>when you watch rabid movement down a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy,</v>

812
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.870
<v Speaker 3>like you sometimes in your own case for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

813
00:49:56.871 --> 00:49:59.930
<v Speaker 3>if you feel ashamed about something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say you turned back,</v>

814
00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:00.773
<v Speaker 3>well that's because you've just </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifested a behavior which you know </v>

815
00:50:03.861 --> 00:50:04.694
<v Speaker 3>full well is in very poor record with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you conceptualize your position </v>

816
00:50:08.631 --> 00:50:09.770
<v Speaker 3>in a given Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

817
00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:10.683
<v Speaker 3>which basically means that you backed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and blow yourself and that makes you </v>

818
00:50:13.491 --> 00:50:17.870
<v Speaker 3>self conscious and also puts you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that happens under those</v>

819
00:50:17.871 --> 00:50:22.871
<v Speaker 3>circumstances is that like if you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>adopted a story and it protects you,</v>

820
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:27.500
<v Speaker 3>the story has certain rules that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to fall right.</v>

821
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:29.413
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't follow the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you immediately forfeit the </v>

822
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 3>protection of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're like high up in the story,</v>

823
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:36.164
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing up the dominance hierarchy </v>

824
00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 3>that's associated with a particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>story and you pull off of behavior,</v>

825
00:50:40.581 --> 00:50:41.361
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

826
00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:43.070
<v Speaker 3>it's tricky and it works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really,</v>

827
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:43.933
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's immoral from your own perspective </v>

828
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:47.413
<v Speaker 3>and you get self conscious and you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>also exposed yourself to the unknown </v>

829
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:52.250
<v Speaker 3>there in a big way because you've just </v>
<v Speaker 3>broken your own rules.</v>

830
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.473
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with writing your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules is your rules are what protect </v>

831
00:50:55.881 --> 00:50:57.790
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's easy to,</v>

832
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 3>if that's a good trick of cell cells </v>
<v Speaker 3>from others and from,</v>

833
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:02.760
<v Speaker 3>from the unknown in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

834
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.090
<v Speaker 3>no matter where it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it manifests itself,</v>

835
00:51:05.091 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including inside,</v>

836
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:07.190
<v Speaker 3>inside yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

837
00:51:07.191 --> 00:51:08.024
<v Speaker 3>Because the story that you act out is </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you ensure that you remain </v>

838
00:51:11.721 --> 00:51:12.554
<v Speaker 3>predictable to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which that's another thing that you </v>

839
00:51:14.451 --> 00:51:16.600
<v Speaker 3>don't want to underestimate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance of this.</v>

840
00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:17.443
<v Speaker 3>That what are the reasons for the shared</v>
<v Speaker 3>story is so that we don't have to have </v>

841
00:51:21.741 --> 00:51:22.574
<v Speaker 3>fights about the projector and we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is dominance are determined by </v>

842
00:51:27.411 --> 00:51:29.150
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

843
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:30.793
<v Speaker 3>it's also so that we don't reveal any of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our own mysteries to ourselves </v>

844
00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:35.144
<v Speaker 3>unexpectedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just to keep other people in </v>

845
00:51:37.131 --> 00:51:38.930
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also so that,</v>

846
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:40.783
<v Speaker 3>so that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so we can tolerate looking at </v>

847
00:51:42.051 --> 00:51:43.010
<v Speaker 3>ourselves in the mirror.</v>

848
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in any sort of horrific sense,</v>

849
00:51:45.111 --> 00:51:45.944
<v Speaker 3>but just as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's comforting to consider yourself </v>

850
00:51:49.101 --> 00:51:51.320
<v Speaker 3>with predictable entity even when in </v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

851
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:52.663
<v Speaker 3>in many ways that's an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's because there's way more to you </v>

852
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:56.354
<v Speaker 3>than you know about and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exhaust your possibilities when you're </v>

853
00:51:59.421 --> 00:52:00.254
<v Speaker 3>participating in most stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's why if the context shifts </v>

854
00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the context shifts,</v>

855
00:52:06.501 --> 00:52:09.780
<v Speaker 3>your personality shifts because much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you consider your personalities,</v>

856
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 3>the story you acting out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it said like if things really fall apart</v>

857
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.073
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned the small possibility for </v>

858
00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:19.124
<v Speaker 3>physical altercation here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could say I would develop an </v>

859
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:25.190
<v Speaker 3>argument and then there'd be a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical dispute,</v>

860
00:52:25.191 --> 00:52:30.191
<v Speaker 3>maybe hydrive with the projector and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>dean pull it and that would embarrass me</v>

861
00:52:30.441 --> 00:52:31.274
<v Speaker 3>more and that would make me angry and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'd give it a push and he fall </v>

862
00:52:34.971 --> 00:52:35.900
<v Speaker 3>over by accident.</v>

863
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:38.330
<v Speaker 3>And that would hurt them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

864
00:52:38.331 --> 00:52:39.164
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like the whole system spirals </v>

865
00:52:41.181 --> 00:52:43.410
<v Speaker 3>out of control because of this one entry</v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

866
00:52:43.411 --> 00:52:44.244
<v Speaker 3>And so then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you have grounds for the beginning </v>

867
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:48.890
<v Speaker 3>of a small war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is,</v>

868
00:52:48.891 --> 00:52:49.724
<v Speaker 3>is that as soon as you're outside that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bounded domain where your emotions </v>

869
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:54.434
<v Speaker 3>are regulated and controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're literally in the grip of forces </v>

870
00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:01.040
<v Speaker 3>that you poorly understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This regulates your aggression,</v>

871
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:03.290
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and predict predictability.</v>

872
00:53:03.291 --> 00:53:04.124
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's implicit in shared participation </v>

873
00:53:06.661 --> 00:53:08.810
<v Speaker 3>in historic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you step out here,</v>

874
00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:12.230
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's all the gods of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unknown in a sense are waiting for you.</v>

875
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:15.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like you are now controlled by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by anxiety.</v>

876
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:20.750
<v Speaker 3>To what degree depends on how much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your story has been disrupted.</v>

877
00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:21.883
<v Speaker 3>The same thing goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes for regression and emotions under </v>

878
00:53:25.561 --> 00:53:26.394
<v Speaker 3>normal circumstances you don't feel you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have a personality built up for </v>

879
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.983
<v Speaker 3>because they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not part of your environment </v>

880
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.120
<v Speaker 3>even though they're part of you.</v>

881
00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:34.461
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

882
00:53:34.461 --> 00:53:38.330
<v Speaker 5>So the goal I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of all our adaptation is to,</v>

883
00:53:38.331 --> 00:53:40.010
<v Speaker 5>to have our emotions regulated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

884
00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.610
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that gets disrupted by when,</v>

885
00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:45.140
<v Speaker 5>when something anomalous comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's always something anomalous.</v>

886
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:46.243
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like should we exist until the </v>

887
00:53:50.061 --> 00:53:50.894
<v Speaker 5>anomalous information comes in and hits </v>
<v Speaker 5>us or because I sometimes feel myself </v>

888
00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:56.053
<v Speaker 5>just going for things that I'm afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 5>just because I want like the thrill of </v>

889
00:53:58.781 --> 00:54:03.070
<v Speaker 5>whatever and but that is my searching </v>
<v Speaker 5>for it and,</v>

890
00:54:03.071 --> 00:54:04.670
<v Speaker 5>and dysregulating my emotions.</v>

891
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.553
<v Speaker 3>What are the things that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicates the idea that novelty is </v>

892
00:54:09.261 --> 00:54:11.900
<v Speaker 3>threatening on first exposure is </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnitude.</v>

893
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:13.123
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it's not always true is that </v>

894
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.730
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an optimal level of novelty.</v>

895
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Where are the magnitude of the event is </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently small.</v>

896
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:26.330
<v Speaker 3>So that once activated primarily is your</v>
<v Speaker 3>incentive reward systems.</v>

897
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:29.360
<v Speaker 3>And that's the sort of thing that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

898
00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:31.520
<v Speaker 3>if you're operating optimally so to </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak,</v>

899
00:54:31.521 --> 00:54:32.354
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're consuming novelty at the rate </v>

900
00:54:35.001 --> 00:54:37.760
<v Speaker 3>that's precisely appropriate for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular temperament.</v>

901
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.760
<v Speaker 3>That's interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when people say,</v>

902
00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm following my interest or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in this,</v>

903
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:48.350
<v Speaker 3>what they mean is there's an appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of novelty in this,</v>

904
00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:52.970
<v Speaker 3>in this area of my experiential field </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm feasting on it,</v>

905
00:54:52.971 --> 00:54:54.410
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at my own rate.</v>

906
00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:59.730
<v Speaker 3>But then you're aroused and while you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>optimally adapted at that point the same</v>

907
00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:00.583
<v Speaker 3>because you're updating your models </v>
<v Speaker 3>about adaptation and perhaps everyone </v>

908
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:04.490
<v Speaker 3>else's as well.</v>

909
00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Well at the same time remaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively secure.</v>

910
00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:09.770
<v Speaker 3>C One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one foot.</v>

911
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Remember that I'll get you written.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

912
00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:13.183
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember this diagram that's down the </v>

913
00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.770
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cosmos,</v>

914
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:23.800
<v Speaker 3>it's constructed of chaos</v>
<v Speaker 3>and order.</v>

915
00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Too much of either is debney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your place is right here on the line.</v>

916
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.810
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the razor's edge,</v>

917
00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:34.730
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very narrow line,</v>

918
00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:35.773
<v Speaker 3>halfway between chaos and order where </v>
<v Speaker 3>one is being transformed into the other </v>

919
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:42.910
<v Speaker 3>but neither predominates and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two translations for downs.</v>

920
00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:43.993
<v Speaker 3>One is the way which is the path of life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ask the bouncing ball diagram and </v>

921
00:55:47.421 --> 00:55:51.260
<v Speaker 3>the other is meaning and that's because </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're on the path,</v>

922
00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:55.730
<v Speaker 3>then your life has meaning and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning is contact with novelty.</v>

923
00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:59.570
<v Speaker 3>At the appropriate rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's something you feed on that's the</v>

924
00:55:59.571 --> 00:56:02.300
<v Speaker 3>source of the US,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that spiritual bread.</v>

925
00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:03.253
<v Speaker 3>That's what that is.</v>

926
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:05.263
<v Speaker 5>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just thinking about this kind of </v>

927
00:56:06.141 --> 00:56:07.640
<v Speaker 5>thing the other day and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

928
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.860
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew exactly what contexts,</v>

929
00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:10.993
<v Speaker 5>contexts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it seems that they're all there </v>

930
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.030
<v Speaker 5>instances all over our lives where there</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

931
00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.640
<v Speaker 5>where we encountered islands here were a</v>
<v Speaker 5>novelty.</v>

932
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:18.990
<v Speaker 5>Novelty is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

933
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:21.260
<v Speaker 5>actually a predictable part of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>lives.</v>

934
00:56:21.261 --> 00:56:24.020
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what I just thought was that the</v>

935
00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.900
<v Speaker 3>part of the administrator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about,</v>

936
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:28.720
<v Speaker 3>chaos there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's there can be a bounded region of</v>

937
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:29.620
<v Speaker 3>unpredictability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

938
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

939
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:31.504
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in it so that everything in </v>

940
00:56:32.441 --> 00:56:33.274
<v Speaker 3>there is unpredictable and number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lesson has very well defined </v>

941
00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:36.590
<v Speaker 3>boundaries so that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

942
00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:37.480
<v Speaker 3>they're whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all,</v>

943
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.373
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are whole classes of phenomenon </v>

944
00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.500
<v Speaker 3>that are completely unpredictable in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>of themselves.</v>

945
00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:43.010
<v Speaker 3>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

946
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But nonetheless,</v>

947
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:46.540
<v Speaker 3>you know what their effects can be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

948
00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:47.374
<v Speaker 3>You cannot be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody wrote in the essay in this </v>

949
00:56:51.281 --> 00:56:52.114
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe this title in Games and Games </v>

950
00:56:53.771 --> 00:56:55.180
<v Speaker 3>are new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Example of exactly that.</v>

951
00:56:55.490 --> 00:57:00.490
<v Speaker 3>They're bounded domain in which novel </v>
<v Speaker 3>events can nonetheless take place.</v>

952
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:01.773
<v Speaker 3>So if you mean when your emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>response to novelty depends on a number </v>

953
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:06.244
<v Speaker 3>of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

954
00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily terror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay priority.</v>

955
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:11.830
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that hero myths tend </v>
<v Speaker 3>to point out,</v>

956
00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.700
<v Speaker 3>cause there's sort of two classes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>romance.</v>

957
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.613
<v Speaker 3>There's a pyramid that describes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful here and there's the hero </v>

958
00:57:17.951 --> 00:57:20.510
<v Speaker 3>myth that describes the unsuccessful </v>
<v Speaker 3>heroes like vehicle man.</v>

959
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:25.540
<v Speaker 3>And the unsuccessful hero is someone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>encounters the unknown accidentally.</v>

960
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:29.300
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that transforms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

961
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.450
<v Speaker 3>and he's the one who gets devoured and </v>
<v Speaker 3>never comes back.</v>

962
00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:35.770
<v Speaker 3>So that's what md did this by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he accidentally slept with his mother,</v>

963
00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:38.080
<v Speaker 3>his mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's the great mother</v>

964
00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:41.770
<v Speaker 3>that seems incest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the incest motif.</v>

965
00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:42.604
<v Speaker 3>Now Freud read that sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really let the incest motif refers </v>

966
00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:48.880
<v Speaker 3>to is the possibility of creative union </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the hero and the great mother,</v>

967
00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 3>which is between the explorer and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>source of all new information.</v>

968
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is if it's accidental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then it might kill you and eat it.</v>

969
00:57:56.021 --> 00:57:57.400
<v Speaker 3>This blinds himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

970
00:57:57.401 --> 00:58:01.440
<v Speaker 3>His consciousness is destroyed because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this accidental encounter.</v>

971
00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:03.690
<v Speaker 3>And Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freud thought that was the,</v>

972
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:06.730
<v Speaker 3>like the core story that underlied the </v>
<v Speaker 3>development of humanity.</v>

973
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

974
00:58:08.501 --> 00:58:11.800
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depends on the level of analysis,</v>

975
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 3>but if you know what that story means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

976
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:17.170
<v Speaker 3>very pessimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it's a failed hero myth.</v>

977
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:22.870
<v Speaker 3>If you think of Freud Friday in </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalysis as a form of religion,</v>

978
00:58:22.871 --> 00:58:23.704
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a perfectly reasonable </v>

979
00:58:25.241 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 3>supposition because Freud tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>provide people with a map of meaning was</v>

980
00:58:28.961 --> 00:58:29.794
<v Speaker 3>one of the few religions that I know of </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the central hero is a failure nor </v>

981
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:34.803
<v Speaker 3>success because almost all religions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religions organized themselves around </v>

982
00:58:42.011 --> 00:58:43.450
<v Speaker 3>successful heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

983
00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:48.480
<v Speaker 3>that's why they were useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Substituting ordinary misery first.</v>

984
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also the case that Freud,</v>

985
00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Freud explicitly presume that the domain</v>
<v Speaker 3>of culture associated with religion,</v>

986
00:59:00.971 --> 00:59:01.804
<v Speaker 3>which is a broad domain and for which </v>
<v Speaker 3>for Freud also included literature and </v>

987
00:59:04.751 --> 00:59:05.584
<v Speaker 3>art was a defense mechanism and illusion</v>
<v Speaker 3>that defense mechanism erected against </v>

988
00:59:10.661 --> 00:59:12.640
<v Speaker 3>death anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an illusion.</v>

989
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:13.923
<v Speaker 3>One way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

990
00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be true,</v>

991
00:59:15.341 --> 00:59:16.174
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have to be true dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true that no one serves to protect </v>

992
00:59:19.901 --> 00:59:21.100
<v Speaker 3>you from the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

993
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:22.003
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing trivial about Freud's </v>

994
00:59:23.391 --> 00:59:24.224
<v Speaker 3>objection and it's also the case that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people hide inside Reggie dv Ologies </v>

995
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:31.220
<v Speaker 3>precisely in order to protect themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>from not just death,</v>

996
00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:33.950
<v Speaker 3>but from the all those things they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

997
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.993
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that something can be true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't necessarily mean that it is </v>

998
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 3>true or that it's true in all cases.</v>

999
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.333
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>last week you had mentioned positive </v>

1000
00:59:43.261 --> 00:59:48.261
<v Speaker 6>delusion and how there was a literature </v>
<v Speaker 6>that that implies healthy to have some,</v>

1001
00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.073
<v Speaker 3>was the illusion</v>

1002
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.960
<v Speaker 6>that is being debunked at this time?</v>

1003
00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:52.791
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1004
00:59:52.791 --> 00:59:54.050
<v Speaker 3>there's a big debate about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1005
00:59:54.051 --> 00:59:54.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1006
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:55.040
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well just,</v>

1007
00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:58.100
<v Speaker 6>just thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1008
00:59:58.101 --> 01:00:00.050
<v Speaker 6>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what if your way,</v>

1009
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:02.930
<v Speaker 6>what if your path to get from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1010
01:00:02.931 --> 01:00:07.190
<v Speaker 6>the unbearable present to your future </v>
<v Speaker 6>goal included?</v>

1011
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking of the unknown or </v>
<v Speaker 6>intrusions from the unknown as lessons.</v>

1012
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.983
<v Speaker 6>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you were looking at them as a positive </v>

1013
01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:18.470
<v Speaker 6>every,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every time.</v>

1014
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:20.510
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anomalous information came to you.</v>

1015
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.553
<v Speaker 6>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this has been brought to me to teach me </v>

1016
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:24.510
<v Speaker 6>a lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1017
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:25.363
<v Speaker 6>We'll learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that would take the anxiety away </v>

1018
01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:28.124
<v Speaker 6>from it?</v>

1019
01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1020
01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:32.430
<v Speaker 3>this yeses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1021
01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:36.600
<v Speaker 3>That's a perfectly interesting argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last part of it,</v>

1022
01:00:36.601 --> 01:00:37.434
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you have to classify that </v>

1023
01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.310
<v Speaker 3>as a positive allusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1024
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:44.790
<v Speaker 3>I think that the transition in western </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture from Old Testament,</v>

1025
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.033
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>morality to do testament reality is a </v>

1026
01:00:48.241 --> 01:00:51.210
<v Speaker 3>transition of exactly that sort because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the message,</v>

1027
01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.250
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of implicit in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 3>Testament.</v>

1028
01:00:53.251 --> 01:00:55.140
<v Speaker 3>God is a pretty horrible figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1029
01:00:55.141 --> 01:00:56.870
<v Speaker 3>very powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but quite frightening.</v>

1030
01:00:56.970 --> 01:01:00.360
<v Speaker 3>And how's it and 10 constantly displayed</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that manner.</v>

1031
01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.370
<v Speaker 3>And God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's new testament.</v>

1032
01:01:02.371 --> 01:01:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Just theoretically God love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least that's the attitude that you're</v>

1033
01:01:05.971 --> 01:01:08.190
<v Speaker 3>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How and why is that?</v>

1034
01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.473
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's for the reasons that you just </v>

1035
01:01:10.171 --> 01:01:13.380
<v Speaker 3>pointed out is the content of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one is inevitable.</v>

1036
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.090
<v Speaker 3>The only thing you can do about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just change your attitude to it.</v>

1037
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:23.070
<v Speaker 3>The hero myth 10 to point out that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you approach it voluntarily,</v>

1038
01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.870
<v Speaker 3>it's the source of new information.</v>

1039
01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.730
<v Speaker 3>If you run from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kills you.</v>

1040
01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are your options.</v>

1041
01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Your option isn't too to not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If things didn't change,</v>

1042
01:01:32.161 --> 01:01:32.994
<v Speaker 3>there wouldn't be any light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do have the option of how to </v>

1043
01:01:35.401 --> 01:01:36.234
<v Speaker 3>face it and it does work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're in getting engaged in </v>

1044
01:01:38.551 --> 01:01:39.384
<v Speaker 3>an argument with somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like somebody that you have to argue </v>

1045
01:01:41.791 --> 01:01:43.710
<v Speaker 3>with and that you have to come to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution with,</v>

1046
01:01:43.711 --> 01:01:46.080
<v Speaker 3>say someone you're married to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone in your family,</v>

1047
01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:48.770
<v Speaker 3>it's like you have to solve the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>or an or not.</v>

1048
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.580
<v Speaker 3>You can just fight about it for the rest</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your life.</v>

1049
01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:51.414
<v Speaker 3>That's the other option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fighting about it a few times in the </v>

1050
01:01:53.011 --> 01:01:55.590
<v Speaker 3>rest of your life if you actually have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to address it.</v>

1051
01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.060
<v Speaker 3>Then when they present you with </v>
<v Speaker 3>anomalous information,</v>

1052
01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:02.370
<v Speaker 3>which is essentially like a poison </v>
<v Speaker 3>apple,</v>

1053
01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:05.610
<v Speaker 3>something that's an adjustable in its </v>
<v Speaker 3>present form,</v>

1054
01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:06.653
<v Speaker 3>your only option is to sit and think </v>
<v Speaker 3>what is there in this that I can </v>

1055
01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.230
<v Speaker 3>actually constitutes usable information </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

1056
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:16.770
<v Speaker 3>So you might say someone's objecting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you conduct yourself.</v>

1057
01:02:16.771 --> 01:02:17.604
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that they're being hostile </v>
<v Speaker 3>and unfair but laid down some ground </v>

1058
01:02:20.071 --> 01:02:21.720
<v Speaker 3>rules so you more or less trust each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other?</v>

1059
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:22.883
<v Speaker 3>You're only option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no circumstance cause is to </v>

1060
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 3>remove yourself from the argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolically Europe or in actuality,</v>

1061
01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:33.430
<v Speaker 3>is there any truth in the information </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting Andy?</v>

1062
01:02:33.431 --> 01:02:36.060
<v Speaker 3>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how?</v>

1063
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.710
<v Speaker 3>How do I have to adjust my behavior or </v>
<v Speaker 3>my scheme of interpretation to take that</v>

1064
01:02:40.711 --> 01:02:44.400
<v Speaker 3>information into account?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's presuming that what you want from</v>

1065
01:02:44.401 --> 01:02:45.234
<v Speaker 3>the argument is the reestablishment of </v>
<v Speaker 3>harmony and the capacity to continue to </v>

1066
01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:51.320
<v Speaker 3>move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that is the attitude that you,</v>

1067
01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's a positive allusion</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all because</v>

1068
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:55.853
<v Speaker 3>the way things manifest themselves is </v>
<v Speaker 3>dependent on your attitude towards them </v>

1069
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:02.100
<v Speaker 3>in a nontrivial way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you in in a,</v>

1070
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:06.820
<v Speaker 3>in a major way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You determined the Valence of phenomenal</v>

1071
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.590
<v Speaker 3>by your approach to them and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know the limits of that.</v>

1072
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:11.783
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you're saying basically then before </v>

1073
01:03:13.561 --> 01:03:15.600
<v Speaker 6>the hero can venture out into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>unknown,</v>

1074
01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:16.523
<v Speaker 6>he has to take care of the anxiety right</v>
<v Speaker 6>before he can do the exploratory </v>

1075
01:03:19.771 --> 01:03:20.260
<v Speaker 6>behavior?</v>

1076
01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:20.711
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1077
01:03:20.711 --> 01:03:22.550
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

1078
01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.393
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say that because the anxiety </v>

1079
01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.540
<v Speaker 3>might accompany the exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

1080
01:03:26.541 --> 01:03:28.380
<v Speaker 3>It often does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just say what,</v>

1081
01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:32.470
<v Speaker 3>what the hero posits this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This goes back to your point about,</v>

1082
01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:37.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last week about how the transference and</v>

1083
01:03:38.111 --> 01:03:38.944
<v Speaker 3>union psychoanalysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hero has to do implicitly or </v>

1084
01:03:42.311 --> 01:03:46.510
<v Speaker 3>explicitly is pause at his site or what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the individual has to be.</v>

1085
01:03:46.511 --> 01:03:47.344
<v Speaker 3>We implicitly or explicitly is positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His identity with the hero as a </v>

1086
01:03:50.501 --> 01:03:51.334
<v Speaker 3>potential fat who's validity can only be</v>
<v Speaker 3>tested as a consequence of actual </v>

1087
01:03:56.471 --> 01:03:59.470
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say you have a Schema.</v>

1088
01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:02.170
<v Speaker 3>Some anomalous information comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a choice,</v>

1089
01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:06.670
<v Speaker 3>act on it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you decide to act on what you've done</v>

1090
01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.540
<v Speaker 3>implicitly is identify with the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's an act of faith.</v>

1091
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.573
<v Speaker 3>And that act of faith is that despite </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the anomalous information </v>

1092
01:04:15.581 --> 01:04:19.900
<v Speaker 3>appears and it's destructive context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something within me that I don't</v>

1093
01:04:19.901 --> 01:04:23.440
<v Speaker 3>know about that will enable me to cope </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it if I make the effort.</v>

1094
01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.190
<v Speaker 3>It has to be faint because?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's enormous.</v>

1095
01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:29.910
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't know low.</v>

1096
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you made,</v>

1097
01:04:31.931 --> 01:04:32.830
<v Speaker 3>you made a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1098
01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:33.843
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you talked about the rate of a </v>

1099
01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:38.630
<v Speaker 3>known being related to temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1100
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:39.503
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1101
01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.353
<v Speaker 3>what do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what temperament do you think the ideal </v>

1102
01:04:41.591 --> 01:04:42.424
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would happen?</v>

1103
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

1104
01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.830
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a subjective phenomenon.</v>

1105
01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:50.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same with intelligence.</v>

1106
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:54.220
<v Speaker 3>You could say for someone who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>profoundly retarded,</v>

1107
01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:59.680
<v Speaker 3>learning how to tie their shoes might be</v>
<v Speaker 3>regarded as a heroic act and justly soul</v>

1108
01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:00.603
<v Speaker 3>from the perspective of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because they had to overcome what </v>

1109
01:05:03.911 --> 01:05:08.070
<v Speaker 3>were innumerable subjective obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So timber bent or intelligence or native</v>

1110
01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.420
<v Speaker 3>ability does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a level playing field.</v>

1111
01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:11.283
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't demand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't determine that that a person </v>

1112
01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:14.920
<v Speaker 3>can be a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

1113
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:16.870
<v Speaker 3>you might say that there are different </v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of heroes.</v>

1114
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:20.140
<v Speaker 3>There's there could be here with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ties his shoes or the hero that brings,</v>

1115
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:21.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1116
01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:22.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1117
01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:26.470
<v Speaker 3>that takes America to a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the Mesoamericans do,</v>

1118
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.940
<v Speaker 3>leave that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Schamens,</v>

1119
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had stronger temperaments and they were,</v>

1120
01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:34.090
<v Speaker 3>they were seen as basically the heroes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1121
01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.710
<v Speaker 3>they could go into there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1122
01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:36.260
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1123
01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.770
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were more passionate and that.</v>

1124
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.940
<v Speaker 3>So it seems to me that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between,</v>

1125
01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:43.350
<v Speaker 3>I want to read you something just to </v>
<v Speaker 3>move because it's such a good design.</v>

1126
01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:44.613
<v Speaker 3>This is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very relevant to your question </v>

1127
01:05:46.721 --> 01:05:49.540
<v Speaker 3>about levels of heroism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

1128
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an Indian doctor,</v>

1129
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:55.330
<v Speaker 3>doctors of cosmic cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1130
01:05:55.331 --> 01:05:57.910
<v Speaker 3>I want you to think about with regards </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this,</v>

1131
01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.313
<v Speaker 3>to this diag riffle right now we know </v>
<v Speaker 3>already that this is a kind of a </v>

1132
01:06:06.161 --> 01:06:06.994
<v Speaker 3>schematic representation of a story with</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these other stories embedded within </v>

1133
01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.600
<v Speaker 3>it and they organize themselves over </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1134
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:17.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a dominance hierarchy because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most dominant story,</v>

1135
01:06:17.531 --> 01:06:20.260
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>occupies superordinate territory.</v>

1136
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.513
<v Speaker 3>So if you're in a dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most powerful person determines the </v>

1137
01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:28.210
<v Speaker 3>story that has the greatest domain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is the case.</v>

1138
01:06:28.211 --> 01:06:29.920
<v Speaker 3>I'll read you some examples of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>suit.</v>

1139
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:31.023
<v Speaker 3>That time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The story of dominance disputes between </v>

1140
01:06:34.001 --> 01:06:36.070
<v Speaker 3>the gods are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very common,</v>

1141
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:36.933
<v Speaker 3>mythological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological tales about talk about the </v>

1142
01:06:40.481 --> 01:06:42.370
<v Speaker 3>movement towards monotheism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example.</v>

1143
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.713
<v Speaker 3>The guards are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are very often portrayed as at war and </v>

1144
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.340
<v Speaker 3>it's the victorious God that becomes the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Supreme God.</v>

1145
01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:51.423
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation of the fact that those </v>

1146
01:06:55.181 --> 01:06:57.460
<v Speaker 3>processes actually occur in time on </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

1147
01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:59.020
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we dispute,</v>

1148
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:01.660
<v Speaker 3>we dispute constantly the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1149
01:07:01.661 --> 01:07:03.700
<v Speaker 3>relative meaning of things and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1150
01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.780
<v Speaker 3>at least within cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we come to agreement about that.</v>

1151
01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.790
<v Speaker 3>That means that some positions when </v>
<v Speaker 3>another positions lose it.</v>

1152
01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:14.320
<v Speaker 3>That's a Darwinian competition of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although sometimes it's cooperatively,</v>

1153
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:16.720
<v Speaker 3>cooperatively induced as well.</v>

1154
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:18.580
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are stories.</v>

1155
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:23.260
<v Speaker 3>We know that stories too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when they transformed themselves,</v>

1156
01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:26.230
<v Speaker 3>they go through this cycle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissolution and reconstruction.</v>

1157
01:07:26.231 --> 01:07:31.231
<v Speaker 3>So you could say that if this is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrangement of stories at every level of</v>

1158
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:33.844
<v Speaker 3>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of these separate stories is </v>

1159
01:07:35.621 --> 01:07:38.980
<v Speaker 3>constantly undergoing dissolution and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconstruction.</v>

1160
01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:41.680
<v Speaker 3>So that's happening all the way up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chain.</v>

1161
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:43.870
<v Speaker 3>I listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really interesting.</v>

1162
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.740
<v Speaker 3>The doctrine of cosmic cycles from </v>
<v Speaker 3>India.</v>

1163
01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:51.610
<v Speaker 3>A complete cycle you got comprises </v>
<v Speaker 3>12,000 years.</v>

1164
01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.070
<v Speaker 3>It ends with the disillusion of her </v>
<v Speaker 3>mayor,</v>

1165
01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:55.143
<v Speaker 3>which is repeated more drastically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt have per layer the great </v>

1166
01:07:57.611 --> 01:08:02.611
<v Speaker 3>disillusion at the end of the thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle for the paradigmatic Schema,</v>

1167
01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:04.540
<v Speaker 3>creation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction,</v>

1168
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:07.550
<v Speaker 3>creation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc. Is reproduced an infinitive.</v>

1169
01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:09.453
<v Speaker 3>The 12,000 years of the Bahai Yoga were </v>
<v Speaker 3>regarded as divine years each with a </v>

1170
01:08:12.491 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 3>duration of 360 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which gives a total of 4 million,</v>

1171
01:08:16.281 --> 01:08:20.980
<v Speaker 3>320,000 years for a single cosmic cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>1,000 such Matt,</v>

1172
01:08:20.981 --> 01:08:21.230
<v Speaker 3>how are you?</v>

1173
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:24.740
<v Speaker 3>This makes up a KALPA 14 culpas makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a man,</v>

1174
01:08:24.741 --> 01:08:25.574
<v Speaker 3>Vera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then Tara so named because each </v>

1175
01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:28.754
<v Speaker 3>Manvantara,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to be ruled by man who's </v>

1176
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:33.710
<v Speaker 3>the mythical ancestor king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1177
01:08:33.711 --> 01:08:38.140
<v Speaker 3>so one of the implications of this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the cyclical or that</v>

1178
01:08:40.690 --> 01:08:44.630
<v Speaker 3>if you pick a domain of this cyclical </v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

1179
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.340
<v Speaker 3>you can ascribe its establishment to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mythical ancestor king.</v>

1180
01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kaaba is equivalent to a day in the life</v>

1181
01:08:53.871 --> 01:08:56.180
<v Speaker 3>of Brahma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a second cup or two a night,</v>

1182
01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:58.940
<v Speaker 3>a hundred of these years of Brahma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

1183
01:08:58.941 --> 01:08:59.774
<v Speaker 3>311 millions of human 311,000 millions </v>
<v Speaker 3>of human years constitutes the life of </v>

1184
01:09:04.761 --> 01:09:05.594
<v Speaker 3>Brahma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even this duration of the God's </v>

1185
01:09:07.311 --> 01:09:09.120
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not exhaust time.</v>

1186
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:10.483
<v Speaker 3>The guards are not eternal on the cosmic</v>
<v Speaker 3>creations and destruction succeed each </v>

1187
01:09:13.791 --> 01:09:14.624
<v Speaker 3>other forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Indian notion is that this is </v>

1188
01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:20.960
<v Speaker 3>kind of an infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing is infinite and structure all</v>

1189
01:09:20.961 --> 01:09:23.570
<v Speaker 3>the way up as far as you can go in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way down as far as you can go in.</v>

1190
01:09:23.571 --> 01:09:24.404
<v Speaker 3>And every level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's these constant cycles of </v>

1191
01:09:26.601 --> 01:09:30.620
<v Speaker 3>creation and destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds almost like alchemy.</v>

1192
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:31.454
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's sort of a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a way of playing messiah with the </v>

1193
01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:37.470
<v Speaker 3>symbols and the way that scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>sounding way.</v>

1194
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1195
01:09:38.451 --> 01:09:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Well they know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1196
01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:44.720
<v Speaker 3>people had scientific intuitions prior </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

1197
01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:46.003
<v Speaker 3>to the onset of science as a formal </v>
<v Speaker 3>enterprise as well as mythological </v>

1198
01:09:48.801 --> 01:09:50.490
<v Speaker 3>intuitions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1199
01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:51.171
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1200
01:09:51.171 --> 01:09:52.004
<v Speaker 3>this dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turn this off I think is obviously </v>

1201
01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:56.450
<v Speaker 3>representing something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1202
01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1203
01:09:58.940 --> 01:09:59.773
<v Speaker 5>you mentioned earlier that the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchies are this way and for some </v>

1204
01:10:03.591 --> 01:10:05.090
<v Speaker 5>reason that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't make sense.</v>

1205
01:10:05.091 --> 01:10:05.870
<v Speaker 5>In my head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1206
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:06.561
<v Speaker 5>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1207
01:10:06.561 --> 01:10:08.720
<v Speaker 5>he would seem to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they'd go,</v>

1208
01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:10.640
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of going up there,</v>

1209
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 5>they are within each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if,</v>

1210
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:13.543
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if Sean came in and say you have one of </v>

1211
01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.280
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the three right there,</v>

1212
01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:17.360
<v Speaker 5>the little ones right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1213
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:18.860
<v Speaker 5>you both had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1214
01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:19.800
<v Speaker 5>a story there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

1215
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.610
<v Speaker 5>he gave you a bigger story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1216
01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:22.693
<v Speaker 5>Then that would change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would change yours instead of </v>

1217
01:10:24.441 --> 01:10:25.274
<v Speaker 5>looking at it as going up there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would look at it as judged as being </v>

1218
01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:29.920
<v Speaker 5>different and he has to give you one </v>
<v Speaker 5>that incumbent.</v>

1219
01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1220
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:32.670
<v Speaker 3>but I would say that's a more dominant </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1221
01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.820
<v Speaker 3>It contains more territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It rules more territory.</v>

1222
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:36.930
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the notion.</v>

1223
01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:37.853
<v Speaker 3>Literally it rules more territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'd be willing to subordinate my </v>

1224
01:10:40.621 --> 01:10:43.440
<v Speaker 3>story to this large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the largest story,</v>

1225
01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.900
<v Speaker 3>say for the Mesopotamians that's ruled </v>
<v Speaker 3>by Martech.</v>

1226
01:10:45.930 --> 01:10:47.640
<v Speaker 3>So you see there's a real neat twist in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1227
01:10:47.641 --> 01:10:48.474
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like you have a real paradox is </v>

1228
01:10:51.151 --> 01:10:55.980
<v Speaker 3>that you need known territory to protect</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself from chaos.</v>

1229
01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.560
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that is known </v>
<v Speaker 3>territory has,</v>

1230
01:10:58.561 --> 01:10:59.910
<v Speaker 3>it has real disadvantages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1231
01:10:59.911 --> 01:11:01.560
<v Speaker 3>It gets rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing.</v>

1232
01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.633
<v Speaker 3>And it makes you have conflicts with </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people who have no territories </v>

1233
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:07.480
<v Speaker 3>that are different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different way the Mesopotamians solve.</v>

1234
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:11.940
<v Speaker 3>This was by saying that the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes the superordinate story,</v>

1235
01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.133
<v Speaker 3>which is Marta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually the process that transforms </v>

1236
01:11:15.451 --> 01:11:16.830
<v Speaker 3>all stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1237
01:11:16.831 --> 01:11:21.831
<v Speaker 3>So they put a paradoxical loop into this</v>
<v Speaker 3>process I suppose.</v>

1238
01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>

1239
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:24.781
<v Speaker 3>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1240
01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:25.614
<v Speaker 3>all your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all your conditional stories have to be </v>

1241
01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:28.554
<v Speaker 3>dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to always remain dependent on your </v>

1242
01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:34.530
<v Speaker 3>ultimate subordination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the process by which all conditionals</v>

1243
01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:38.160
<v Speaker 3>towards from generate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's an amazing idea.</v>

1244
01:11:38.710 --> 01:11:39.780
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>

1245
01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:41.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand how can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1246
01:11:41.441 --> 01:11:42.740
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I understand that,</v>

1247
01:11:42.741 --> 01:11:44.890
<v Speaker 5>that the bigger the territory that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>more topical the story,</v>

1248
01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:45.993
<v Speaker 5>but how can on on the level where they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they don't come from the same </v>

1249
01:11:47.801 --> 01:11:48.634
<v Speaker 5>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how can one be above another graphic </v>

1250
01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:52.120
<v Speaker 5>way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not obvious up in terms of power.</v>

1251
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:55.510
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about an abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1252
01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:58.670
<v Speaker 5>So is it power?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like the bottom one is,</v>

1253
01:11:58.671 --> 01:12:01.090
<v Speaker 5>is lower and louder than the top line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1254
01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:06.220
<v Speaker 5>The middle one is lower in power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the outside one it goes from,</v>

1255
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:08.930
<v Speaker 5>it goes from in to out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1256
01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1257
01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:14.010
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know when we were talking about,</v>

1258
01:12:14.710 --> 01:12:16.990
<v Speaker 3>here's an example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're working for a corporation.</v>

1259
01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.620
<v Speaker 3>You're not the chief executive officer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a vice president.</v>

1260
01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is your store.</v>

1261
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:26.690
<v Speaker 3>There's three vice presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one chief executive officer.</v>

1262
01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be concerned.</v>

1263
01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:29.973
<v Speaker 3>One of your domains of concern is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>viability of your position and </v>

1264
01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:34.953
<v Speaker 3>everything that it's like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you're also the head of a whole </v>

1265
01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.720
<v Speaker 3>whole set of other subordinates who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneath you,</v>

1266
01:12:40.721 --> 01:12:41.554
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's your particular domain of </v>

1267
01:12:43.601 --> 01:12:45.730
<v Speaker 3>concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it would be rational,</v>

1268
01:12:45.731 --> 01:12:46.564
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under most conditions to subordinate </v>

1269
01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:50.883
<v Speaker 3>your desire to maintain this territory </v>
<v Speaker 3>in favor of maintaining the entire </v>

1270
01:12:55.481 --> 01:12:56.470
<v Speaker 3>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1271
01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:57.603
<v Speaker 3>Whenever there's a conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean generally speaking you could </v>

1272
01:13:00.121 --> 01:13:02.500
<v Speaker 3>envision perhaps some cases where that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be,</v>

1273
01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:04.120
<v Speaker 5>Hey John ain't sure I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1274
01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:07.600
<v Speaker 5>So my question is really do the vibe and</v>
<v Speaker 5>do the vice presidents,</v>

1275
01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:09.790
<v Speaker 5>is there a hierarchy amongst amongst </v>
<v Speaker 5>them?</v>

1276
01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.550
<v Speaker 5>You mean this way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1277
01:13:11.551 --> 01:13:12.640
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm asking.</v>

1278
01:13:12.641 --> 01:13:13.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm asking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1279
01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:15.003
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1280
01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:17.190
<v Speaker 3>well there would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there</v>

1281
01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:22.300
<v Speaker 3>isn't that there would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were ever engaged in a task that</v>

1282
01:13:22.301 --> 01:13:24.370
<v Speaker 3>would require them to arrange </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

1283
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

1284
01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:26.734
<v Speaker 3>I'm not reading this and this isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fixed picture of like there's not </v>

1285
01:13:30.581 --> 01:13:34.330
<v Speaker 3>necessarily three of these subs subs if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you place in that way.</v>

1286
01:13:34.331 --> 01:13:38.640
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean that it's possible in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominant is hard for them to be relative</v>

1287
01:13:38.641 --> 01:13:40.700
<v Speaker 3>to quality of position?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1288
01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.410
<v Speaker 3>although that I think that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily break down those,</v>

1289
01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:47.200
<v Speaker 3>say if there's three vice presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to organize themselves to do a</v>

1290
01:13:47.201 --> 01:13:48.570
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be a,</v>

1291
01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:49.743
<v Speaker 3>a dominance hierarchy that actually is </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchical emerge in the course of </v>

1292
01:13:54.431 --> 01:13:57.910
<v Speaker 3>their cooperation or another story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1293
01:13:57.930 --> 01:13:59.230
<v Speaker 3>They no tied into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not your story.</v>

1294
01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.560
<v Speaker 3>It's also the case that like your </v>
<v Speaker 3>position in the dormant attire,</v>

1295
01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.990
<v Speaker 3>he shifts across stories.</v>

1296
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:06.303
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1297
01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:08.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be a senior at Harvard and you</v>

1298
01:14:08.561 --> 01:14:09.750
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that you're at the top of,</v>

1299
01:14:09.751 --> 01:14:11.860
<v Speaker 3>of at least one part of dog's hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1300
01:14:11.861 --> 01:14:14.190
<v Speaker 3>But then when you go on the workforce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like whack.</v>

1301
01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:15.053
<v Speaker 3>You're at the bottom of another </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy or you can just </v>

1302
01:14:17.201 --> 01:14:18.034
<v Speaker 3>shift in and out of them during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly because we've been </v>

1303
01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:24.580
<v Speaker 3>able to abstract or dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies up to such a degree that you</v>

1304
01:14:24.581 --> 01:14:29.581
<v Speaker 3>could participate in and innumerable </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them even a symbolic coming,</v>

1305
01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.593
<v Speaker 3>you can change the valence of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomena just by shifting your </v>

1306
01:14:33.851 --> 01:14:34.850
<v Speaker 3>reference point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1307
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 3>Say It depends on what you contrast it </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1308
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:39.190
<v Speaker 3>I can say in the big picture of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1309
01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:40.900
<v Speaker 3>That's the big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1310
01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Take the big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something terrible happens to you.</v>

1311
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:45.700
<v Speaker 3>I take the big picture so the picture is</v>
<v Speaker 3>too big,</v>

1312
01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:46.990
<v Speaker 3>then everything becomes worthless.</v>

1313
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:51.220
<v Speaker 4>What's the button?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This goes back a little ways to what you</v>

1314
01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:52.310
<v Speaker 4>said about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1315
01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:56.750
<v Speaker 4>when anomalous information is promising </v>
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to threat.</v>

1316
01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:57.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1317
01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it sounded like you were saying that</v>

1318
01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:06.650
<v Speaker 4>it relates to the feelings of advocacy </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the hero or of the confront her.</v>

1319
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:07.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1320
01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:09.760
<v Speaker 4>would you describe it as an act of </v>
<v Speaker 4>faith?</v>

1321
01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just curious about that.</v>

1322
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:14.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1323
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:17.583
<v Speaker 4>what creates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean is that what you did you mean to </v>

1324
01:15:20.681 --> 01:15:23.930
<v Speaker 4>say feelings of personal efficacy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1325
01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.320
<v Speaker 3>You mean instead of an act of faith?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well or how,</v>

1326
01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:29.790
<v Speaker 3>how would you relate that to I guess </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm trying to say that if you,</v>

1327
01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:30.624
<v Speaker 3>if you undertake to voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you undertake to voluntarily expose </v>

1328
01:15:36.361 --> 01:15:40.830
<v Speaker 3>yourself to an aspect of the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is an act of faith.</v>

1329
01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:45.920
<v Speaker 3>And whether you know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are emulating this heroic model.</v>

1330
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:47.403
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that young </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempted to point out was that since </v>

1331
01:15:50.161 --> 01:15:50.994
<v Speaker 3>you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might as well know it because as </v>

1332
01:15:52.861 --> 01:15:53.694
<v Speaker 3>soon as you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have access to this incredible </v>

1333
01:15:55.381 --> 01:15:56.214
<v Speaker 3>wealth of information but sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>details the structure of that process </v>

1334
01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:00.493
<v Speaker 3>and that it can provide you with more </v>
<v Speaker 3>explicit knowledge about what it might </v>

1335
01:16:02.941 --> 01:16:05.220
<v Speaker 3>mean saying cause you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you say,</v>

1336
01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:06.600
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote down,</v>

1337
01:16:06.601 --> 01:16:11.601
<v Speaker 3>when I think of the history as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>historical historical a hypothesis.</v>

1338
01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Let me see if I can find,</v>

1339
01:16:20.210 --> 01:16:23.870
<v Speaker 3>can we ask revolutions in procedure </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring about revolutions and experience.</v>

1340
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:27.560
<v Speaker 3>That's the hypothesis of historical man </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally.</v>

1341
01:16:27.561 --> 01:16:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Which is to say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pause it,</v>

1342
01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:34.070
<v Speaker 3>that through your actions you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>transform your environment.</v>

1343
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:35.083
<v Speaker 3>That's an act of faith and it's the act </v>
<v Speaker 3>of faith that precedes the construction </v>

1344
01:16:37.491 --> 01:16:39.350
<v Speaker 3>of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because by doing that,</v>

1345
01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:42.440
<v Speaker 3>what you are saying is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>

1346
01:16:42.650 --> 01:16:43.483
<v Speaker 3>despite the immense power of balance </v>
<v Speaker 3>that appears between the individual and </v>

1347
01:16:46.281 --> 01:16:50.390
<v Speaker 3>not knowing the individual is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the process.</v>

1348
01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:53.270
<v Speaker 3>It's of equal magnitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Equal side.</v>

1349
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:54.980
<v Speaker 3>Remember I showed you these pictures?</v>

1350
01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

1351
01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a good one.</v>

1352
01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:08.693
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>

1353
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:23.860
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1354
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:25.510
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sweet.</v>

1355
01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.390
<v Speaker 7>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1356
01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.070
<v Speaker 7>I would regard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is pre Columbian.</v>

1357
01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.150
<v Speaker 7>I would return this as an image </v>
<v Speaker 7>constrict constructed by the member of a</v>

1358
01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:35.984
<v Speaker 7>culture for whom the hypothesis that the</v>
<v Speaker 7>individual was equivalent potency in </v>

1359
01:17:41.361 --> 01:17:42.194
<v Speaker 7>comparison with the great mother or as </v>
<v Speaker 7>as not true or just barely dawning on </v>

1360
01:17:47.031 --> 01:17:47.864
<v Speaker 7>consciousness is there as the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's a huge difference in </v>

1361
01:17:53.031 --> 01:17:56.210
<v Speaker 7>terms of perceived relative power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then you see,</v>

1362
01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.360
<v Speaker 7>well here this is a much more modern </v>
<v Speaker 7>issue.</v>

1363
01:17:59.361 --> 01:18:02.010
<v Speaker 7>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's much more uh,</v>

1364
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:07.340
<v Speaker 7>indication of equality by this point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1365
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:12.440
<v Speaker 7>So the notion of the divine individual </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that's,</v>

1366
01:18:12.441 --> 01:18:14.000
<v Speaker 7>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what I think.</v>

1367
01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:14.834
<v Speaker 7>I think that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's mythological idea cause it has to </v>

1368
01:18:16.551 --> 01:18:17.384
<v Speaker 7>do with meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's at the core of the democratic </v>

1369
01:18:19.221 --> 01:18:21.230
<v Speaker 7>notion that everybody is equal before </v>
<v Speaker 7>the law,</v>

1370
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.500
<v Speaker 7>which is has its roots in the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone is equal before God,</v>

1371
01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.260
<v Speaker 7>but what that means by,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well by equal,</v>

1372
01:18:27.261 --> 01:18:32.180
<v Speaker 7>what equal means is that</v>
<v Speaker 7>your capacity for heroism is not limited</v>

1373
01:18:32.181 --> 01:18:33.014
<v Speaker 7>by your native abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I think is really interesting </v>

1374
01:18:35.301 --> 01:18:36.134
<v Speaker 7>because it's very difficult for us to </v>
<v Speaker 7>think of anything that you can do for </v>

1375
01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:40.100
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1376
01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.180
<v Speaker 7>There really is an equal playing field </v>
<v Speaker 7>for it.</v>

1377
01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:45.800
<v Speaker 7>Like most things are dependent say on </v>
<v Speaker 7>your intelligence that's heritable to at</v>

1378
01:18:45.801 --> 01:18:48.680
<v Speaker 7>least a substantial degree or your </v>
<v Speaker 7>physical ability or your gender,</v>

1379
01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:51.020
<v Speaker 7>your race or these things that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>really built in,</v>

1380
01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:55.220
<v Speaker 7>but your capacity to face things that </v>
<v Speaker 7>are anomalous,</v>

1381
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:57.980
<v Speaker 7>that's really a part of your character.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's,</v>

1382
01:18:57.981 --> 01:18:58.814
<v Speaker 7>that's above,</v>
<v Speaker 7>above those biological constraints in a </v>

1383
01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:02.324
<v Speaker 7>way because what's anomalous to you is </v>
<v Speaker 7>very much dependent on your personal </v>

1384
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:08.630
<v Speaker 7>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you get the,</v>

1385
01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:11.480
<v Speaker 7>you get problems that are exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 7>same size that you are.</v>

1386
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:12.913
<v Speaker 7>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's another part of the reason why </v>

1387
01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:16.730
<v Speaker 7>you get this weird notion of equality </v>
<v Speaker 7>before God.</v>

1388
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:17.803
<v Speaker 7>I wrote a story about that later in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>manuscript to try to make that clear in </v>

1389
01:19:20.311 --> 01:19:21.144
<v Speaker 7>this story.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I met this woman when I was a behavior </v>

1390
01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:25.430
<v Speaker 7>therapist and this was a devastated </v>
<v Speaker 7>woman.</v>

1391
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:26.323
<v Speaker 7>I mean she had every problem that you </v>
<v Speaker 7>could imagine essentially and then a </v>

1392
01:19:29.451 --> 01:19:30.980
<v Speaker 7>bunch more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She,</v>

1393
01:19:30.981 --> 01:19:33.590
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she was so pathologically shy,</v>

1394
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:37.340
<v Speaker 7>but she could not look at anybody that </v>
<v Speaker 7>she thought was up higher.</v>

1395
01:19:37.341 --> 01:19:39.920
<v Speaker 7>The dominants are not meant anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1396
01:19:39.921 --> 01:19:43.490
<v Speaker 7>literally she was at the block and when </v>
<v Speaker 7>she approached people say,</v>

1397
01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:45.830
<v Speaker 7>who are doing therapy in this one unit?</v>
<v Speaker 7>She'd go like this,</v>

1398
01:19:45.831 --> 01:19:49.700
<v Speaker 7>just like in just like an arcade figure </v>
<v Speaker 7>approaching an amperage.</v>

1399
01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:54.730
<v Speaker 7>She couldn't bear to look at the person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And part of the behavioral treatment was</v>

1400
01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.470
<v Speaker 7>to help her stop doing this because we </v>
<v Speaker 7>should do it in public as well.</v>

1401
01:19:58.471 --> 01:19:59.304
<v Speaker 7>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people who act oddly in public tend to </v>

1402
01:20:02.091 --> 01:20:02.924
<v Speaker 7>have a log social troubles.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we were hoping to get rid of this </v>

1403
01:20:05.271 --> 01:20:07.230
<v Speaker 7>particular symptom,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but she was also,</v>

1404
01:20:07.231 --> 01:20:08.460
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she,</v>

1405
01:20:08.461 --> 01:20:11.460
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she was not an intelligent person by any</v>

1406
01:20:11.461 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 7>stretch of the imagination.</v>

1407
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:15.390
<v Speaker 7>She probably had an Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we're in the neighborhood of 70,</v>

1408
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.433
<v Speaker 7>which is about two standard deviations </v>
<v Speaker 7>below the mean or about four standard </v>

1409
01:20:18.781 --> 01:20:20.670
<v Speaker 7>deviations below the average in this </v>
<v Speaker 7>route.</v>

1410
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:21.504
<v Speaker 7>So like she,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she's not a smart person unless you've </v>

1411
01:20:23.851 --> 01:20:24.684
<v Speaker 7>tested people with Iq tests,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you really have no idea how much </v>

1412
01:20:26.761 --> 01:20:27.594
<v Speaker 7>difference there is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how much difference four standard </v>

1413
01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:30.750
<v Speaker 7>deviations means.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It means a lot.</v>

1414
01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.053
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she had very poor personal hygiene and </v>

1415
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:37.980
<v Speaker 7>because I think probably because she was</v>
<v Speaker 7>raised as badly as you could possibly be</v>

1416
01:20:37.981 --> 01:20:39.330
<v Speaker 7>raised.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1417
01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.193
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she wasn't particularly attractive as a </v>

1418
01:20:43.651 --> 01:20:44.640
<v Speaker 7>person either.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She was,</v>

1419
01:20:44.641 --> 01:20:45.474
<v Speaker 7>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1420
01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.220
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

1421
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.300
<v Speaker 7>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1422
01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:49.493
<v Speaker 7>her boyfriend was at schizophrenia and </v>
<v Speaker 7>he was also an alcoholic and he was </v>

1423
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:55.380
<v Speaker 7>violent and he is to accuse her of being</v>
<v Speaker 7>possessed by the devil.</v>

1424
01:20:55.381 --> 01:20:56.214
<v Speaker 7>And he theater.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She lived with her mother who was like </v>

1425
01:20:59.071 --> 01:20:59.904
<v Speaker 7>old and sick and an aunt who was </v>
<v Speaker 7>bedridden and they were on welfare and </v>

1426
01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 7>she had no education to speak.</v>

1427
01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:07.410
<v Speaker 7>I've been really no hope for a job.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like when I saw her,</v>

1428
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:09.500
<v Speaker 7>she's probably close to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1429
01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:11.310
<v Speaker 7>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like this woman,</v>

1430
01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.990
<v Speaker 7>the cards were stacked against her,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1431
01:21:12.991 --> 01:21:16.020
<v Speaker 7>in every way you could possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what her primary,</v>

1432
01:21:16.290 --> 01:21:17.450
<v Speaker 7>this was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They will,</v>

1433
01:21:17.451 --> 01:21:22.451
<v Speaker 7>her primary concern in therapy was not </v>
<v Speaker 7>really what could be done for her.</v>

1434
01:21:22.531 --> 01:21:24.900
<v Speaker 7>Like she'd gone through behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 7>treatment kind of work temporarily,</v>

1435
01:21:24.901 --> 01:21:27.060
<v Speaker 7>but she reverted to her old habits very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very,</v>

1436
01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:28.463
<v Speaker 7>very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What she really wanted from me was to </v>

1437
01:21:31.381 --> 01:21:32.214
<v Speaker 7>help her sort of make a dent in the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she was an outpatient in the hospital </v>

1438
01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:35.724
<v Speaker 7>administration so that she could find an</v>
<v Speaker 7>inpatient and these like the inpatients </v>

1439
01:21:39.451 --> 01:21:40.284
<v Speaker 7>that are left in mental hospitals now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these people are seriously troubled </v>

1440
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:46.200
<v Speaker 7>because anybody that could possibly be </v>
<v Speaker 7>let out has been let out.</v>

1441
01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:47.034
<v Speaker 7>So like I used to go into the basement </v>
<v Speaker 7>at the Douglas Hospital in Montreal and </v>

1442
01:21:49.351 --> 01:21:50.184
<v Speaker 7>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was like something out of Dante's </v>

1443
01:21:51.691 --> 01:21:52.200
<v Speaker 7>inferno.</v>

1444
01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.033
<v Speaker 7>It was an old building and the people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like there was a coke room in the </v>

1445
01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:57.870
<v Speaker 7>basement and the people that were in </v>
<v Speaker 7>there were just,</v>

1446
01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:00.870
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know those mini,</v>

1447
01:22:00.871 --> 01:22:02.400
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the medieval paintings of,</v>

1448
01:22:02.401 --> 01:22:04.330
<v Speaker 7>of disfigured people that were in </v>
<v Speaker 7>common.</v>

1449
01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.760
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what it was like down there.</v>

1450
01:22:05.761 --> 01:22:07.200
<v Speaker 7>And that's what most of the inpatients </v>
<v Speaker 7>were like.</v>

1451
01:22:07.201 --> 01:22:09.870
<v Speaker 7>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were just totally destroyed.</v>

1452
01:22:09.871 --> 01:22:11.910
<v Speaker 7>And some of them had been that way for </v>
<v Speaker 7>like 30 years.</v>

1453
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:15.360
<v Speaker 7>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what she wanted was not help for her.</v>

1454
01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:17.580
<v Speaker 7>And she didn't come in to complain about</v>
<v Speaker 7>her situation,</v>

1455
01:22:17.581 --> 01:22:19.130
<v Speaker 7>even though there was lots of reasoning </v>
<v Speaker 7>can play about,</v>

1456
01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:22.620
<v Speaker 7>she wanted to find somebody in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>hospital grounds that she could take out</v>

1457
01:22:22.621 --> 01:22:25.470
<v Speaker 7>for walks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So yeah.</v>

1458
01:22:25.471 --> 01:22:27.120
<v Speaker 7>And she had dog that she used to take </v>
<v Speaker 7>care of,</v>

1459
01:22:27.121 --> 01:22:28.110
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it out for walks.</v>

1460
01:22:28.111 --> 01:22:28.944
<v Speaker 7>And she was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought she was remarkable this </v>

1461
01:22:30.181 --> 01:22:31.014
<v Speaker 7>person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because</v>

1462
01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:36.150
<v Speaker 7>from the deterministic standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so to speak,</v>

1463
01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.193
<v Speaker 7>there's no reason at all that she should</v>
<v Speaker 7>have been anything but the hostile and </v>

1464
01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:40.533
<v Speaker 7>bidder.</v>

1465
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.280
<v Speaker 7>But her problems for whatever reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're not,</v>

1466
01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:48.200
<v Speaker 7>we're not her primary focus of concern.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1467
01:22:48.201 --> 01:22:49.034
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well I thought that was just a good </v>

1468
01:22:50.251 --> 01:22:52.440
<v Speaker 7>example of how,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1469
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:55.080
<v Speaker 7>regardless of your particular </v>
<v Speaker 7>circumstances,</v>

1470
01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.020
<v Speaker 7>it is possible that you might make the </v>
<v Speaker 7>right choices.</v>

1471
01:22:58.650 --> 01:22:59.483
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that that's maybe not dependent on </v>

1472
01:23:01.441 --> 01:23:04.230
<v Speaker 7>things that you might consider </v>
<v Speaker 7>biological givens.</v>

1473
01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:05.603
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then I do think it's true that the </v>

1474
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.150
<v Speaker 7>burrata your talents,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the bigger your responsibility.</v>

1475
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:16.470
<v Speaker 7>So that's how things work out just </v>
<v Speaker 7>because,</v>

1476
01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:18.460
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's one way you can make sense of the</v>

1477
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:21.430
<v Speaker 7>theoretical lead unequal distribution of</v>
<v Speaker 7>talents.</v>

1478
01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:27.060
<v Speaker 7>The more talent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the more responsibility simplest still.</v>

1479
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:29.443
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I asked that because really </v>

1480
01:23:30.251 --> 01:23:31.750
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounded as if we were describing,</v>

1481
01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:34.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the non threat,</v>

1482
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:38.670
<v Speaker 4>the promising anomalous as occurring </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of within a space that was,</v>

1483
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:42.700
<v Speaker 4>you could define a space within which </v>
<v Speaker 4>like in a game of space within which the</v>

1484
01:23:42.701 --> 01:23:45.250
<v Speaker 4>anomalous occurs and it's safe.</v>

1485
01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:46.260
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well we do,</v>

1486
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:52.290
<v Speaker 7>but this is an account in which it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>more in the self,</v>

1487
01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:53.650
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1488
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:56.980
<v Speaker 7>that was able to deal with the anomalous</v>
<v Speaker 7>wherever it occurred.</v>

1489
01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.410
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

1490
01:23:58.890 --> 01:23:59.310
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1491
01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:01.180
<v Speaker 7>that's a perfectly reasonable contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1492
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:04.450
<v Speaker 7>when we play,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that is what we're doing.</v>

1493
01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.420
<v Speaker 7>The first thing you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're carving out a defined space.</v>

1494
01:24:07.421 --> 01:24:08.230
<v Speaker 7>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

1495
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:09.063
<v Speaker 7>here's the actual borders within this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we will allow a certain amount of </v>

1496
01:24:12.551 --> 01:24:16.480
<v Speaker 7>anomaly to occur so that we can practice</v>
<v Speaker 7>coping with the anomaly.</v>

1497
01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.700
<v Speaker 7>People like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They like watching games for example.</v>

1498
01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:19.310
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

1499
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:22.360
<v Speaker 7>that's why kids play games as well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like kids,</v>

1500
01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:23.171
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you watch them,</v>

1501
01:24:23.171 --> 01:24:25.120
<v Speaker 7>if they're eight or nine years old to </v>
<v Speaker 7>get together in the playground,</v>

1502
01:24:25.121 --> 01:24:25.481
<v Speaker 7>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1503
01:24:25.481 --> 01:24:26.730
<v Speaker 7>here's the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Black,</v>

1504
01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.870
<v Speaker 7>black lab that defines the territory's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

1505
01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.153
<v Speaker 7>Well the rules are just enough to get to</v>
<v Speaker 7>get something going so that someone </v>

1506
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:36.020
<v Speaker 7>normally can occur at formal games are </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that evening.</v>

1507
01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:37.533
<v Speaker 7>And it is often difficult to distinguish</v>
<v Speaker 7>when it is that you're not playing a </v>

1508
01:24:39.911 --> 01:24:41.440
<v Speaker 7>game anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1509
01:24:41.441 --> 01:24:43.390
<v Speaker 7>some people play games their whole lives</v>
<v Speaker 7>formally.</v>

1510
01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.160
<v Speaker 7>A lot of the things we do as academics </v>
<v Speaker 7>ideologically are abstracted games,</v>

1511
01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:49.443
<v Speaker 7>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But there is a difference between that </v>

1512
01:24:50.981 --> 01:24:53.260
<v Speaker 7>and the general sense that if a normally</v>
<v Speaker 7>arises,</v>

1513
01:24:53.261 --> 01:24:54.610
<v Speaker 7>I incapable of dealing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1514
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:56.050
<v Speaker 7>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the more,</v>

1515
01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.240
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're both,</v>

1516
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.720
<v Speaker 7>they're both hero types.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean sports heroes or heroes,</v>

1517
01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:03.550
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The ritual models for emulation,</v>

1518
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.920
<v Speaker 7>they deal with anomaly and bounded </v>
<v Speaker 7>circumstances.</v>

1519
01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:09.460
<v Speaker 7>I would say there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there paragons of normal adaptation.</v>

1520
01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:12.640
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They master a bounded domain.</v>

1521
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:16.450
<v Speaker 7>They're not necessarily mastery.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The transition between domains,</v>

1522
01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.190
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a different type of heroism</v>

1523
01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:21.610
<v Speaker 7>but it's still a form of heroes.</v>

1524
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:28.810
<v Speaker 6>Are you saying that the greater your </v>
<v Speaker 6>biological gift,</v>

1525
01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.393
<v Speaker 6>you say the bigger your responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you mean the bigger your </v>

1526
01:25:33.011 --> 01:25:35.230
<v Speaker 6>responsibility to go out and encounter</v>

1527
01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.290
<v Speaker 7>and bring it back?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would say</v>

1528
01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:39.960
<v Speaker 7>well there's more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>

1529
01:25:39.961 --> 01:25:41.370
<v Speaker 7>That's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right off the backs.</v>

1530
01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:46.050
<v Speaker 7>Like what you don't know is differing in</v>
<v Speaker 7>contrast to what you know.</v>

1531
01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:49.350
<v Speaker 7>So the structure of what you know and </v>
<v Speaker 7>its and its size,</v>

1532
01:25:49.351 --> 01:25:53.190
<v Speaker 7>so to speak is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is a proportionate innocence to the kind</v>

1533
01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:55.740
<v Speaker 7>of unknowns that you'll encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like in a sense</v>

1534
01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.193
<v Speaker 7>I read it say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't remember where that one of the </v>

1535
01:25:59.731 --> 01:26:03.060
<v Speaker 7>hallmarks of genius is the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 7>see mystery where others only see.</v>

1536
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:05.203
<v Speaker 7>So you won't even see the same things</v>
<v Speaker 7>with variance and capacity comes very </v>

1537
01:26:10.491 --> 01:26:12.410
<v Speaker 7>innocent perception.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1538
01:26:12.411 --> 01:26:13.990
<v Speaker 7>and then I would say adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is it?</v>

1539
01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:14.983
<v Speaker 7>So like</v>
<v Speaker 7>coping with coping with the stresses of </v>

1540
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:25.470
<v Speaker 7>a about well-run household might be </v>
<v Speaker 7>sufficient challenge for a given person.</v>

1541
01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.490
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in reality,</v>

1542
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.353
<v Speaker 7>I mean they may do a very good job of </v>
<v Speaker 7>that and that's at the limits of their </v>

1543
01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:32.210
<v Speaker 7>ability.</v>

1544
01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:33.043
<v Speaker 7>And when you meet someone like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you regard them as admirable sort of </v>

1545
01:26:36.861 --> 01:26:40.820
<v Speaker 7>intrinsically for someone whose talents </v>
<v Speaker 7>are greater,</v>

1546
01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:44.420
<v Speaker 7>their field of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of conflict has to be greater,</v>

1547
01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:45.733
<v Speaker 7>otherwise they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're putting artificial limitations </v>

1548
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:51.450
<v Speaker 7>on their,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on their development and all that unused</v>

1549
01:26:51.490 --> 01:26:52.880
<v Speaker 7>talent down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just work against them.</v>

1550
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:54.263
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's nothing worse than a neurotic </v>

1551
01:26:55.161 --> 01:26:57.740
<v Speaker 7>intellectual cause.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The neurotic intellectual is,</v>

1552
01:26:57.850 --> 01:27:01.250
<v Speaker 7>it's incredibly devious even to </v>
<v Speaker 7>themselves.</v>

1553
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:02.293
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're dealing with someone in </v>

1554
01:27:02.941 --> 01:27:05.180
<v Speaker 7>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an Iq of 130 say,</v>

1555
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:09.260
<v Speaker 7>and they'd be telling themselves lies </v>
<v Speaker 7>for 25 years and these lies are,</v>

1556
01:27:09.261 --> 01:27:10.094
<v Speaker 7>are unbelievably coherent and convincing</v>
<v Speaker 7>because they've used all that </v>

1557
01:27:13.251 --> 01:27:14.084
<v Speaker 7>intellectual talent too to erect this </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing that's really going to devour </v>

1558
01:27:17.421 --> 01:27:17.930
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>

1559
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:19.800
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so then you've made a,</v>

1560
01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.480
<v Speaker 5>you separated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1561
01:27:21.481 --> 01:27:22.314
<v Speaker 5>So there's a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's from the right hemisphere and the </v>

1562
01:27:23.151 --> 01:27:26.020
<v Speaker 5>left hemisphere is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>produces the,</v>

1563
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:28.650
<v Speaker 5>the pleasing sensations in the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Right Hemisphere,</v>

1564
01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.260
<v Speaker 5>the fearful lens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1565
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:32.260
<v Speaker 5>you've also separately the dimension of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1566
01:27:32.610 --> 01:27:35.430
<v Speaker 5>it's not related to in the left </v>
<v Speaker 5>hemisphere of the ability to organize,</v>

1567
01:27:35.431 --> 01:27:36.960
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the in the right hemisphere.</v>

1568
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:39.320
<v Speaker 7>Can you tell there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think there's a certain amount of,</v>

1569
01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:42.000
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know exactly how it</v>

1570
01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:43.960
<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Social personalities have,</v>

1571
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:45.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you know,</v>

1572
01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:50.730
<v Speaker 5>people who are in prisons or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have generally low intelligence and</v>

1573
01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:53.260
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also,</v>

1574
01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:56.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stimulated very easily by,</v>

1575
01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:56.790
<v Speaker 5>by thing.</v>

1576
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:57.481
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's one,</v>

1577
01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:59.220
<v Speaker 7>that's one line of theorizing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1578
01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:00.083
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's more to the story than like </v>

1579
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:02.783
<v Speaker 7>Tamar men alone doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think temperament alone is </v>

1580
01:28:04.561 --> 01:28:06.870
<v Speaker 7>enough to make you conduct disorder anti</v>
<v Speaker 7>social.</v>

1581
01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:07.763
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would say that among like every </v>

1582
01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:10.403
<v Speaker 7>temperamental tight has its own,</v>
<v Speaker 7>has the kind of pathology gets most </v>

1583
01:28:14.101 --> 01:28:16.200
<v Speaker 7>prone to like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're really inhibited,</v>

1584
01:28:16.201 --> 01:28:17.840
<v Speaker 7>you'd likely to develop anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 7>disorders.</v>

1585
01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:22.850
<v Speaker 7>Like that's your sphere of weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like everybody has the sin towards which</v>

1586
01:28:22.891 --> 01:28:23.780
<v Speaker 7>they're most,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1587
01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.013
<v Speaker 7>they're most attracted so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think under very few </v>

1588
01:28:28.681 --> 01:28:29.514
<v Speaker 7>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 7>could you say that temperament was </v>

1589
01:28:31.591 --> 01:28:35.670
<v Speaker 7>destiny and even then if temperament is </v>
<v Speaker 7>destiny,</v>

1590
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:36.583
<v Speaker 7>can you say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1591
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:37.583
<v Speaker 7>the story that someone's participating </v>
<v Speaker 7>in you isn't going sequence of </v>

1592
01:28:40.021 --> 01:28:40.854
<v Speaker 7>biological forces.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would say then that the morality of </v>

1593
01:28:43.291 --> 01:28:44.124
<v Speaker 7>that person is still can only be </v>
<v Speaker 7>calculated by looking at how they dealt </v>

1594
01:28:46.951 --> 01:28:49.890
<v Speaker 7>with what they were particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>particularly given.</v>

1595
01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.690
<v Speaker 7>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had a friend for example,</v>

1596
01:28:51.691 --> 01:28:54.990
<v Speaker 7>when I grew up who had an extensive </v>
<v Speaker 7>family history of alcoholism.</v>

1597
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:56.083
<v Speaker 7>It's like went back at least three </v>
<v Speaker 7>generations are affected a lot of his </v>

1598
01:28:58.381 --> 01:29:03.120
<v Speaker 7>male relatives and by the time he was 14</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was alcoholic and I would say,</v>

1599
01:29:03.121 --> 01:29:05.040
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how do you judge someone like that?</v>

1600
01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:05.903
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean you want you say is that there </v>

1601
01:29:07.651 --> 01:29:11.880
<v Speaker 7>was much more temptation there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so how he dealt with it,</v>

1602
01:29:11.881 --> 01:29:14.640
<v Speaker 7>that was his particular province and it </v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't work out very well for him.</v>

1603
01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:17.680
<v Speaker 7>But I guess what I'm trying to say is </v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1604
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:23.100
<v Speaker 7>well it's the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Same thing I was trying to say with that</v>

1605
01:29:23.101 --> 01:29:25.020
<v Speaker 7>story about the woman at the hospital is</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1606
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:26.840
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're handed up your hand,</v>

1607
01:29:26.841 --> 01:29:29.400
<v Speaker 7>didn't know rang of problems that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>unique.</v>

1608
01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:31.860
<v Speaker 7>Some of those problems are biologically </v>
<v Speaker 7>determined.</v>

1609
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:33.083
<v Speaker 7>The manner in which you approached them </v>
<v Speaker 7>determines the integrity of your </v>

1610
01:29:35.551 --> 01:29:36.384
<v Speaker 7>character.</v>

1611
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:38.183
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to judge that from outside.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think that's another reason why </v>

1612
01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:42.080
<v Speaker 7>in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in,</v>

1613
01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:42.913
<v Speaker 7>in various religious traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's the notion that the only </v>

1614
01:29:45.931 --> 01:29:48.060
<v Speaker 7>accurate judgment can come after your </v>
<v Speaker 7>death,</v>

1615
01:29:48.061 --> 01:29:49.020
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you know,</v>

1616
01:29:49.021 --> 01:29:52.770
<v Speaker 7>you have to be judged by a trans,</v>
<v Speaker 7>something of transcend the door edge and</v>

1617
01:29:52.771 --> 01:29:54.780
<v Speaker 7>for it to be accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1618
01:29:55.260 --> 01:30:00.260
<v Speaker 7>but it would seem like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of of his person and the 70 at Yosemite,</v>

1619
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:05.000
<v Speaker 7>that intelligence could help them to </v>
<v Speaker 7>face,</v>

1620
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:07.800
<v Speaker 7>to develop a better story.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1621
01:30:07.801 --> 01:30:09.330
<v Speaker 7>consider it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It depends on your,</v>

1622
01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:13.680
<v Speaker 7>it depends on what you mean by better.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's the,</v>

1623
01:30:13.681 --> 01:30:15.290
<v Speaker 7>that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 7>More debt.</v>

1624
01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.910
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1625
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:19.440
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like if you,</v>

1626
01:30:19.441 --> 01:30:20.274
<v Speaker 7>if you're a smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have bigger problems there could've </v>

1627
01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:22.740
<v Speaker 7>just made it more bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1628
01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:24.510
<v Speaker 7>she was at this dad's postures at this </v>
<v Speaker 7>point,</v>

1629
01:30:24.511 --> 01:30:25.344
<v Speaker 7>willing to satisfy herself just by </v>
<v Speaker 7>helping someone who was lower down the </v>

1630
01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:28.520
<v Speaker 7>issue.</v>

1631
01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.210
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But she was more intelligent.</v>

1632
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:31.143
<v Speaker 7>It might have just met her.</v>
<v Speaker 7>At least it's conceivable that would be </v>

1633
01:30:33.841 --> 01:30:35.220
<v Speaker 7>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean for you,</v>

1634
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:37.990
<v Speaker 7>I mean you could look at this on a </v>
<v Speaker 7>broader evolutionary scale and say,</v>

1635
01:30:37.991 --> 01:30:39.930
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like our intelligence,</v>

1636
01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.050
<v Speaker 7>does that make our life better?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1637
01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:43.973
<v Speaker 7>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well it's a toss up because on the one </v>

1638
01:30:46.261 --> 01:30:47.094
<v Speaker 7>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well here we sit and everything's </v>

1639
01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:49.553
<v Speaker 7>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>On the other hand we've invented the </v>

1640
01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:55.611
<v Speaker 7>atom bomb and like it's only been 40 </v>
<v Speaker 7>years and we don't know whether the fact</v>

1641
01:30:55.861 --> 01:30:56.694
<v Speaker 7>that here we sit and everything's </v>
<v Speaker 7>wonderful is sufficient to </v>

1642
01:30:58.681 --> 01:31:01.170
<v Speaker 7>counterbalance the fact that using the </v>
<v Speaker 7>same intelligence,</v>

1643
01:31:01.171 --> 01:31:04.080
<v Speaker 7>we've also created this massive </v>
<v Speaker 7>weaponry,</v>

1644
01:31:04.081 --> 01:31:07.890
<v Speaker 7>which,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is still around and will always be</v>

1645
01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:10.050
<v Speaker 7>around to pretty much bring things to an</v>
<v Speaker 7>end.</v>

1646
01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.540
<v Speaker 7>So intelligence is a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's my,</v>

1647
01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:14.640
<v Speaker 7>that's my take lines.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you can,</v>

1648
01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:19.970
<v Speaker 7>you can use it one way or another and it</v>
<v Speaker 7>broadens your domain of action,</v>

1649
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:23.460
<v Speaker 7>but there's nothing intrinsically good </v>
<v Speaker 7>about it.</v>

1650
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:25.540
<v Speaker 7>It's a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's not related to temporary.</v>

1651
01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.650
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it's related temperament</v>

1652
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:32.240
<v Speaker 7>or no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Does this relate to like the dualism and</v>

1653
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:33.143
<v Speaker 7>the bureau move to the hero has a divine</v>
<v Speaker 7>parents with the hero also comes from </v>

1654
01:31:37.471 --> 01:31:38.460
<v Speaker 7>humble?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1655
01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:43.050
<v Speaker 7>Often.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sort of like from unexpected places.</v>

1656
01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:44.213
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the same idea and it's the same </v>

1657
01:31:45.961 --> 01:31:46.794
<v Speaker 7>notion that couldn't give Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's the notion of an eternal Christ </v>

1658
01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.220
<v Speaker 7>and Christ that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it has a historical moment and what that</v>

1659
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:54.203
<v Speaker 7>idea is trying to portray is the notion </v>
<v Speaker 7>that the hero is that transpersonal </v>

1660
01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 7>force,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so to speak.</v>

1661
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:02.170
<v Speaker 7>It's a constituent element of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>psyche.</v>

1662
01:32:02.410 --> 01:32:04.570
<v Speaker 7>It's eternal because it's always </v>
<v Speaker 7>regenerated,</v>

1663
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:08.920
<v Speaker 7>but at the same time it's perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 7>reasonable to view that eternal thing as</v>

1664
01:32:08.921 --> 01:32:13.210
<v Speaker 7>something that's also necessarily exist </v>
<v Speaker 7>within a specific set of constraints.</v>

1665
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:17.860
<v Speaker 7>And I would say that could not exist </v>
<v Speaker 7>without that set of constraints,</v>

1666
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:18.783
<v Speaker 7>which is something that will also deal </v>
<v Speaker 7>with more of the latter half of the man </v>

1667
01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:22.570
<v Speaker 7>of the chorus,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the manuscripts,</v>

1668
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:26.380
<v Speaker 7>the constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not only our constraints,</v>

1669
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:29.530
<v Speaker 7>but they define the capability for </v>
<v Speaker 7>action.</v>

1670
01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.260
<v Speaker 7>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was talking with someone the other day</v>

1671
01:32:32.261 --> 01:32:33.094
<v Speaker 7>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1672
01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:35.560
<v Speaker 7>if everything was orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there'd be nothing left to do.</v>

1673
01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:37.083
<v Speaker 7>And that's well that's the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 7>notion that Dostoyevsky describes when </v>

1674
01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:41.494
<v Speaker 7>he points out that if we established a </v>
<v Speaker 7>political utopia where everything was </v>

1675
01:32:45.281 --> 01:32:46.114
<v Speaker 7>predictable basically in perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the first thing that people would do </v>

1676
01:32:48.011 --> 01:32:48.844
<v Speaker 7>would be to drive themselves crazy just </v>
<v Speaker 7>so that something unexpected could </v>

1677
01:32:51.161 --> 01:32:51.994
<v Speaker 7>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so in literal truth that life could </v>

1678
01:32:53.951 --> 01:32:57.070
<v Speaker 7>go on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So anyways,</v>

1679
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:58.263
<v Speaker 7>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is something that's really useful </v>

1680
01:32:59.471 --> 01:33:02.950
<v Speaker 7>to consider and we will get into it </v>
<v Speaker 7>because one of the questions that people</v>

1681
01:33:02.951 --> 01:33:06.340
<v Speaker 7>always pose is why is it the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 7>things have to happen?</v>

1682
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.943
<v Speaker 7>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what the myth basically </v>

1683
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:14.400
<v Speaker 7>suggests that well</v>
<v Speaker 7>for there to be something,</v>

1684
01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:18.880
<v Speaker 7>there has to be a division between the </v>
<v Speaker 7>limited domain in an unlimited demand.</v>

1685
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.490
<v Speaker 7>There has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a precondition for existence.</v>

1686
01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:22.563
<v Speaker 7>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if the existence of limitation is a </v>

1687
01:33:25.421 --> 01:33:29.200
<v Speaker 7>necessary precondition for existence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is it justifiable?</v>

1688
01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:30.610
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the big question.</v>

1689
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:32.343
<v Speaker 7>Ask The big question</v>
<v Speaker 7>if limitation is a precondition for </v>

1690
01:33:35.801 --> 01:33:36.634
<v Speaker 7>experience is limitation justify.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I would say what these mythological </v>

1691
01:33:39.701 --> 01:33:40.534
<v Speaker 7>stories are trying to do is to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 7>the story about how it could be that </v>

1692
01:33:44.651 --> 01:33:46.960
<v Speaker 7>limitation might be rendered bearable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If it's,</v>

1693
01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:51.310
<v Speaker 7>say it's a precondition for experience.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well this is like for me,</v>

1694
01:33:51.311 --> 01:33:52.144
<v Speaker 7>this is something really worth knowing </v>
<v Speaker 7>because that's a big question for </v>

1695
01:33:54.491 --> 01:33:55.324
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially when something really </v>

1696
01:33:55.931 --> 01:33:56.980
<v Speaker 7>traumatic happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1697
01:33:56.981 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 7>why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How can I make sense out of this?</v>

1698
01:33:59.650 --> 01:34:00.483
<v Speaker 7>Or isn't this event so terrible that it </v>
<v Speaker 7>undermines the utility of any possible </v>

1699
01:34:04.541 --> 01:34:06.730
<v Speaker 7>story I could tell myself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1700
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:09.160
<v Speaker 7>that's what happens when someone close </v>
<v Speaker 7>to you dies.</v>

1701
01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:10.580
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is such a,</v>

1702
01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:13.840
<v Speaker 7>this is such a catastrophe that </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything in,</v>

1703
01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.110
<v Speaker 7>in the line of this is evidently few </v>
<v Speaker 7>tile.</v>

1704
01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:17.800
<v Speaker 7>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1705
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:19.870
<v Speaker 7>that's sort of the bottom line of </v>
<v Speaker 7>questions.</v>

1706
01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:21.790
<v Speaker 7>Can you make sense out of that?</v>

1707
01:34:23.150 --> 01:34:23.983
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1708
01:34:27.810 --> 01:34:28.920
<v Speaker 7>other questions?</v>

1709
01:34:32.130 --> 01:34:32.963
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1710
01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:35.443
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's probably good enough for </v>

1711
01:34:36.351 --> 01:34:37.010
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1712
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:40.280
<v Speaker 7>I will put your papers outside my office</v>
<v Speaker 7>on,</v>

1713
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:42.170
<v Speaker 7>there's a little black bench there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1714
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:46.250
<v Speaker 7>every paper will have a sheet attached </v>
<v Speaker 7>to it that has detailed comments and the</v>

1715
01:34:46.251 --> 01:34:47.084
<v Speaker 7>grade and I hope it will be there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't come until Friday morning to see </v>

1716
01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:52.820
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It'll be there Friday.</v>

1717
01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:56.873
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
