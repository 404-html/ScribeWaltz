1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Hello everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Angelo and I am your Mc for </v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.360
<v Speaker 1>the evening and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on behalf of the UBC free speech club,</v>

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.553
<v Speaker 1>we would like to welcome you and thank </v>
<v Speaker 1>you for attending our third Dr Jordan b </v>

4
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:12.174
<v Speaker 1>Peterson event.</v>

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I know you were all very excited to hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man,</v>

7
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:24.980
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to keep these opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarks very short.</v>

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.413
<v Speaker 1>The UBC free speech club is devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sanctity of liberty in our society </v>

9
00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:34.130
<v Speaker 1>and the necessity to keep liberty safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>from those who want to destroy it within</v>

10
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:34.964
<v Speaker 1>just the York club has grown to over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand members and is now in the </v>

11
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:37.784
<v Speaker 1>process of incorporation so that we may </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to bring speakers and host </v>

12
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:42.044
<v Speaker 1>events such as this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that would be possible without </v>

13
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson who has inspired countless </v>
<v Speaker 1>students all over North America to start</v>

14
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>speaking up on their campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact this club's sprung up around</v>

15
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>the same time when Dr Peterson publicly </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out against bill.</v>

16
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:03.041
<v Speaker 1>See 16</v>
<v Speaker 1>now is just over a year ago.</v>

17
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 1>And since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his philosophy of cleaning your room and</v>

18
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:07.304
<v Speaker 1>sorting yourself out has a better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced the lives of countless </v>

19
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an accomplished psychologist,</v>

20
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.843
<v Speaker 1>professor and author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His book maps of meaning is an </v>

21
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>analytical window into the myths and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures of humankind.</v>

22
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>And now he's written a new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called 12 rules for life and had to</v>

23
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:23.834
<v Speaker 1>go to chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's available for preorder on </v>

24
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Amazon with the release date of January </v>
<v Speaker 1>23rd 2018.</v>

25
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And on that note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>on behalf of the UBC free speech club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would like to introduce you all to Dr</v>

27
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.623
<v Speaker 1>Jordan b Peterson.</v>

28
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much for that.</v>

29
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's quite something.</v>

30
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.493
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

31
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.001
<v Speaker 3>there's a house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

32
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need this one.</v>

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

34
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.513
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then let's just move it out of the </v>

35
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

36
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.853
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to talk to you tonight </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the ideological nexus of </v>

37
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:21.764
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism and Marxism and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get into it fairly deeply so you can </v>

38
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 3>have a thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughtful,</v>

39
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.153
<v Speaker 3>a talk and then discussion afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a confusing topic because it's </v>

40
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 3>not obvious by any stretch of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>

41
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Why postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and neo Marxism,</v>

42
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Marxism proper would be aligned because </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism is an anti grand narrative</v>

43
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:47.774
<v Speaker 3>philosophical movement and Marxism is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>grand narrative and so the fact that </v>

44
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:52.694
<v Speaker 3>those two things seem to coexist in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same space needs definitely needs some </v>

45
00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 3>explanation and it's a very tricky thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get to the bottom of</v>

46
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.803
<v Speaker 3>so we won't get to the bottom of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we'll get farther to the bottom of </v>

47
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:06.574
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I've got before and hopefully </v>

48
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 3>farther than many of you have got </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

49
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 3>So let's see what we can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

50
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.560
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to start with some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some definitions all returned to them as</v>

51
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.690
<v Speaker 3>we continue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

52
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.533
<v Speaker 3>with philosophical movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are often not named by the major </v>

53
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 3>thinkers in the movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sort of named afterwards.</v>

54
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.580
<v Speaker 3>The name covers a very large range of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas and actions and perceptions.</v>

55
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People talk about existentialism,</v>

56
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that easy to come up with a one</v>

57
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 3>paragraph summary of what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>existentialism.</v>

58
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.450
<v Speaker 3>My sense for the existentialists is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

59
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fundamentally a movement.</v>

60
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 3>It's predicated on the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in,</v>

61
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.890
<v Speaker 3>in the psychological sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

62
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.093
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freud tended to attribute human </v>

63
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 3>suffering and mental disorder to </v>
<v Speaker 3>childhood trauma.</v>

64
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more complex than that,</v>

65
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 3>but that'll do for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a quick overview,</v>

66
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:03.664
<v Speaker 3>but the existentialists thought that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was enough suffering intrinsic in </v>

67
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 3>life so that it wasn't insanity.</v>

68
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 3>That was the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was sanity.</v>

69
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.270
<v Speaker 3>It was how it was possible for people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be saying and,</v>

70
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.393
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

71
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 3>and let's say normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word,</v>

72
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 3>given that there was brutality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence intrinsic in life,</v>

73
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that you had to rise up as </v>
<v Speaker 3>an individual and,</v>

74
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.633
<v Speaker 3>and stand in relation to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to that is part and parcel </v>

75
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:33.454
<v Speaker 3>of what constitutes existentialism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's all sorts of different </v>

76
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 3>people who were thinkers who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>existentialist.</v>

77
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.273
<v Speaker 3>Some of them atheistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them deeply religious like </v>

78
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so it's not.</v>

79
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.753
<v Speaker 3>I'm using that as an example to show you</v>
<v Speaker 3>how difficult it is to bring a set of </v>

80
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:53.120
<v Speaker 3>thinkers under one umbrella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're bound to over simplify,</v>

81
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.983
<v Speaker 3>but</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll go ahead and oversimplify </v>

82
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can think about it as an attitude of</v>

83
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:00.694
<v Speaker 3>skepticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>irony towards and rejection of grand </v>

84
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 3>narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologies and universalism,</v>

85
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 3>including the idea of the objective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>notions of reason.</v>

86
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human Nature.</v>

87
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Social Progress,</v>

88
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 3>absolute truth in objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those things being questioned.</v>

89
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.063
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kinda think of the head joker at the </v>

90
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 3>top of the postmodern hierarchy as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Derrida.</v>

91
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 3>Foucault is often mentioned as are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of other people.</v>

92
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.253
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's some other attributes of </v>

93
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:34.714
<v Speaker 3>postmodern thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a recognition of the existence </v>

94
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 3>of hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

95
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 3>And there's an echo of that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the recognition of hierarchy in the term</v>

96
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy because of course patriarchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a recognition of hierarchy.</v>

97
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a very particular kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognition,</v>

98
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.903
<v Speaker 3>but the postmodernists also tend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>define hierarchy as a consequence of </v>

99
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 3>power differential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the world day envisioned,</v>

100
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something like a,</v>

101
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 3>it's a sociologically hobbsy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>nightmare.</v>

102
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 3>So hobbes thought of the philosopher </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Hobbes,</v>

103
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:10.064
<v Speaker 3>thought of the natural state of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings as every individual in some </v>

104
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:14.804
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the throat of every other individual </v>

105
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.310
<v Speaker 3>so that the basic state of man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mankind,</v>

106
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.603
<v Speaker 3>unlike the Rousseau's state of say </v>
<v Speaker 3>virgin innocence and the Primitive </v>

107
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:32.021
<v Speaker 3>Garden of paradise was an all out war of</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone against everyone else and that,</v>

108
00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 3>that required the imposition of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>social order to keep peace essentially.</v>

109
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.200
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fairly dark view of,</v>

110
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 3>of humankind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russo on the other hand,</v>

111
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.074
<v Speaker 3>we think of people as intrinsically good</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the social order as intrinsically </v>

112
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:45.824
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can actually think about hobbes and </v>

113
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Rousseau in some sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

114
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.833
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as opposites that need to be paired </v>

115
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 3>together in order to get a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehensive view of human nature.</v>

116
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.463
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the postmodern view is like the hobbs </v>

117
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.993
<v Speaker 3>and view in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except you want to replace the </v>

118
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:04.590
<v Speaker 3>individual with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

119
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 3>with pyramids of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of social organization.</v>

120
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 3>So hierarchies of social organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are based on group identity,</v>

121
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.053
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that the landscape in which those </v>

122
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:20.951
<v Speaker 3>pyramids exists is one of unbroken </v>
<v Speaker 3>enmity and inability to communicate.</v>

123
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.120
<v Speaker 3>So it's a very dark view as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned and I.</v>

124
00:07:24.121 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fundamentally wrong in many</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

125
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:27.914
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right in that there are groups of </v>

126
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:30.524
<v Speaker 3>people and there is some difficulty in </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication between them and that </v>

127
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 3>power is an element in the formation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies,</v>

128
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.500
<v Speaker 3>but you can't reduce hierarchy or group </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to those premises.</v>

129
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 3>It's too simplified because people also </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperate.</v>

130
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 3>We're also not groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men,</v>

131
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of us belong to many groups,</v>

132
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.780
<v Speaker 3>so it's to the actual situation is far </v>
<v Speaker 3>too complex to reduce it to that degree,</v>

133
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.693
<v Speaker 3>to reduce it to that degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though you can come up with a good </v>

134
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:04.514
<v Speaker 3>explanatory story if you do so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't capture the nuances and </v>

135
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 3>they're not just nuances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't capture the essence.</v>

136
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.273
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is is that when you make the </v>

137
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 3>presupposition that the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies exist is because of power,</v>

138
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 3>then essentially what you do is turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>every hierarchy into a tyranny.</v>

139
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 3>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there is a hierarchy,</v>

140
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 3>then you assume it's a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

141
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:26.324
<v Speaker 3>that's really the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Patriarchy is hierarchy assumed as </v>

142
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:29.804
<v Speaker 3>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's also just not true except in </v>

143
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 3>pathological hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

144
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.853
<v Speaker 3>we know from the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature that the best predictors of </v>

145
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:40.094
<v Speaker 3>longterm life success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our intelligence and conscientiousness </v>

146
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 3>in in western countries at least.</v>

147
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you'd hope for,</v>

148
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>More or less,</v>

149
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.013
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted even just set up a </v>

150
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:50.414
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you weren't particularly smart </v>

151
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 3>or hard working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might want to set up a society where</v>

152
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.473
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are good predictors of success </v>

153
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 3>because then the people who were smart </v>
<v Speaker 3>and hardworking would produce a bunch of</v>

154
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 3>things that you could have if you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>trade for them.</v>

155
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 3>And of course that is actually the </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation that most of us are in.</v>

156
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course,</v>

157
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.353
<v Speaker 3>the other thing about people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>believed that hierarchies in the West </v>

158
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:15.324
<v Speaker 3>are only composed of power and tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that their own actions belie that </v>

159
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:24.090
<v Speaker 3>because whenever they make a decision to</v>
<v Speaker 3>interact with that hierarchy,</v>

160
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 3>they attempt or to make a purchase or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to make a trade,</v>

161
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.250
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to obtain a service,</v>

162
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 3>a service of any importance.</v>

163
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.833
<v Speaker 3>Let's say a medical service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are going to definitely act as if </v>

164
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.023
<v Speaker 3>there are less and more competent people</v>
<v Speaker 3>within that hierarchy and seek out the </v>

165
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:45.430
<v Speaker 3>ones that are more competent obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't do if the,</v>

166
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 3>if the hierarchy is only composed of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyranny and power,</v>

167
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 3>there's no point looking for competence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

168
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 3>in the west and in functioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies,</v>

169
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.210
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies are basically predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 3>competence and not power.</v>

170
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you might say,</v>

171
00:09:58.441 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 3>well that's pretty naive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

172
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually it's not very naive.</v>

173
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying at all that inappropriate</v>

174
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:05.934
<v Speaker 3>powerplays don't play a role in </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupting hierarchies of competence </v>

175
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.253
<v Speaker 3>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But generally what happens is if the </v>

176
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies of competence get corrupted </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough by power,</v>

177
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 3>then they crumble because they can no </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer function.</v>

178
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

179
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:22.140
<v Speaker 3>the evidence that are hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>competence.</v>

180
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 3>Work is everywhere because everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>around us works all the time.</v>

181
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.163
<v Speaker 3>Ion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the elite tells to two </v>

182
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 3>interesting stories in her book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>infidel,</v>

183
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 3>which is a great book by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

184
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 3>she came from Africa and from a country </v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't very functional.</v>

185
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:36.684
<v Speaker 3>And when she came to Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said there were two things that </v>

186
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:40.090
<v Speaker 3>really amazed her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

187
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 3>and this really struck me because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

188
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:43.014
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you get lucky and you can see </v>

189
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.490
<v Speaker 3>the world you live in from an outsider's</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

190
00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:48.324
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get to see through someone else's </v>

191
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

192
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.323
<v Speaker 3>she said the first thing that knocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>her off her feet was waiting for a bus </v>

193
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Amsterdam,</v>

194
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 3>and on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

195
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 3>she's standing at the bus stop and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a pole there and there's digital</v>

196
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:02.514
<v Speaker 3>sign on the pole and the digital science</v>
<v Speaker 3>says when the next bus is going to come </v>

197
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 3>and counts down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when it hits zero,</v>

198
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 3>the bus appears and she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just,</v>

199
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:11.034
<v Speaker 3>she just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she absolutely could not believe that </v>

200
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 3>that would happen.</v>

201
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.423
<v Speaker 3>That there could be a sign that told you</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the bus would come and that it </v>

202
00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:20.520
<v Speaker 3>would change and the bus would actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>appear.</v>

203
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.690
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

204
00:11:21.691 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

205
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:25.260
<v Speaker 3>that's a miracle man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an absolute miracle.</v>

206
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.280
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

207
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 3>You got to think that through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

208
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:32.400
<v Speaker 3>the amount of timing and organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>and and and and reliability,</v>

209
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.520
<v Speaker 3>mechanical reliability and sociological </v>
<v Speaker 3>or social organization and dedication on</v>

210
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:38.934
<v Speaker 3>the part of the bus drivers in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire company and the organization if </v>

211
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:41.754
<v Speaker 3>the whole city and the state to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>that possible is absolutely beyond </v>

212
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:46.710
<v Speaker 3>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's time to,</v>

213
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 3>well perhaps not the second but to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds or something like that.</v>

214
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.720
<v Speaker 3>That is absolutely beyond belief and her</v>
<v Speaker 3>inability to comprehend.</v>

215
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:59.740
<v Speaker 3>That was the correct response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other things she was amazed</v>

216
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:03.280
<v Speaker 3>by was that you could go talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>policemen and they would help you.</v>

217
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.623
<v Speaker 3>That was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was just a no go for her because </v>

218
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.613
<v Speaker 3>for her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her experience was policemen were there </v>

219
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 3>to shake you down and hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you think,</v>

220
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:15.274
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

221
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't.</v>

222
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.140
<v Speaker 3>I won't dwell on that point any longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is,</v>

223
00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:21.974
<v Speaker 3>is that it's absolutely ridiculous blind</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make the assumption that the </v>

224
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:34.861
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies in functioning Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracies are fundamentally predicated</v>

225
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:36.900
<v Speaker 3>on power and tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

226
00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can use a biological example too,</v>

227
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 3>which would place me outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodern realm of argument because the</v>

228
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists don't believe in biology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

229
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.070
<v Speaker 3>but they act like they do because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>all die.</v>

230
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.113
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

231
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

232
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.520
<v Speaker 3>this primatologist named.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

233
00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you two stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

234
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Because these are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are really useful.</v>

235
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:04.174
<v Speaker 3>So the ones about rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got this story from Jaak Panksepp </v>

236
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:07.803
<v Speaker 3>who is a great neuroscientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a book called affective </v>

237
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:10.594
<v Speaker 3>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way is on my reading list </v>

238
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.813
<v Speaker 3>that's on my website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good book affect of </v>

239
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 3>neuroscience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great scientist.</v>

240
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the people who he learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he learned that rats laugh.</v>

241
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:21.933
<v Speaker 3>They laugh out ultrasonically like bat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're gonna you take a look with </v>

242
00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 3>a pencil eraser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they laugh,</v>

243
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.243
<v Speaker 3>but you have to record it and then slow </v>
<v Speaker 3>it down and then you can hear them and </v>

244
00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:31.090
<v Speaker 3>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

245
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 3>rats laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

246
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.970
<v Speaker 3>who wants to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get a grant for that.</v>

247
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 3>What kind of idiocy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

248
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:35.981
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

249
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:36.761
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just don't,</v>

250
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:38.770
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get ahead of yourself here,</v>

251
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was showing that,</v>

252
00:13:40.711 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 3>that that capacity for social </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction,</v>

253
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.913
<v Speaker 3>for social interaction that was mediated</v>
<v Speaker 3>by physiological touch activated the </v>

254
00:13:50.541 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

255
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.753
<v Speaker 3>activated the same circuits in rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it doesn't people and that those </v>

256
00:13:58.331 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 3>are actual biological circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we share them even with rats.</v>

257
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rats are quite similar to human beings.</v>

258
00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:09.010
<v Speaker 3>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could say especially postmodernists,</v>

259
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:09.844
<v Speaker 3>but I won't.</v>

260
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.670
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

261
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.490
<v Speaker 3>and so the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

262
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.353
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little rats giggle when you tickle </v>

263
00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 3>them is actually extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

264
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.260
<v Speaker 3>He also identified</v>
<v Speaker 3>surprising.</v>

265
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:26.674
<v Speaker 3>I've been talking too much lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He also identified the primary place </v>

266
00:14:31.381 --> 00:14:32.214
<v Speaker 3>circuit and mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a big deal too from a </v>

267
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.850
<v Speaker 3>scientific perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like discovering a new continent,</v>

268
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.180
<v Speaker 3>like discovering a whole brain system </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people really didn't know existed.</v>

269
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 3>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's a little story about rats.</v>

270
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.300
<v Speaker 3>Young rats like to engage in rough and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tumble play,</v>

271
00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:49.690
<v Speaker 3>especially juvenile males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also the case for puppies.</v>

272
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>If you've ever had a puppy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dogs are like that.</v>

273
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:52.844
<v Speaker 3>They liked to wrestle and it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that male human beings tend </v>

274
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:58.040
<v Speaker 3>to do with their offspring and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

275
00:14:58.041 --> 00:14:58.874
<v Speaker 3>really good thing like rough and tumble </v>
<v Speaker 3>play with children really helps </v>

276
00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:02.434
<v Speaker 3>socialize them because it helps them </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out the difference between touch </v>

277
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.323
<v Speaker 3>and even rough touch and pain because </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you're doing when </v>

278
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:13.010
<v Speaker 3>you're rough and tumble playing with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>little kid is you know,</v>

279
00:15:13.011 --> 00:15:14.810
<v Speaker 3>you throw them up in the air and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling around.</v>

280
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.883
<v Speaker 3>I built my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had two couches when my kids were </v>

281
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:18.374
<v Speaker 3>little that were sort of face to face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we built this little wrestling ring </v>

282
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 3>and I used to go in there and pound them</v>
<v Speaker 3>half to death every night.</v>

283
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they love that.</v>

284
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:28.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean they get so excited about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love that so much.</v>

285
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:29.564
<v Speaker 3>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reason for that is like you're </v>

286
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:32.234
<v Speaker 3>stretching out their bodies and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing them that they can't put their </v>

287
00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:37.900
<v Speaker 3>thumb in your eye and you're teaching </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to be graceful and,</v>

288
00:15:37.901 --> 00:15:38.734
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're teaching them the difference </v>

289
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 3>between something new that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the body and something painful.</v>

290
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.043
<v Speaker 3>You're really teaching them to dance and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this really complicated </v>

291
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:48.794
<v Speaker 3>physiological dance that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is indicative of a socialized </v>

292
00:15:51.981 --> 00:15:54.650
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's partly why women like men who can</v>

293
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:55.900
<v Speaker 3>dance by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

294
00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.090
<v Speaker 3>because it shows that you can pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to someone else first of all,</v>

295
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.933
<v Speaker 3>that you're coordinated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even more importantly that you can </v>

296
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:03.404
<v Speaker 3>take the fact of your coordination and </v>
<v Speaker 3>coordinate that with someone else's </v>

297
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:07.634
<v Speaker 3>coordination.</v>

298
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.953
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's very primal and </v>

299
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:10.604
<v Speaker 3>physiological.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's built right into your body and </v>

300
00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:14.600
<v Speaker 3>rough and tumble play helps without a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

301
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rats also like too rough and tumble play</v>

302
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:22.730
<v Speaker 3>for much the same reasons and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of pretty much all social mammals.</v>

303
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.773
<v Speaker 3>So you can tell that rats like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See how do you know if a rat likes </v>

304
00:16:26.711 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

305
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.243
<v Speaker 3>he'll work for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ways you can figure out </v>

306
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:31.880
<v Speaker 3>if a rat wants to work for something is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

307
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get them in a state where maybe he's</v>

308
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.953
<v Speaker 3>desperate for whatever he's working for </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can put a little spring on them </v>

309
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 3>and figure out how hardy poles to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

310
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:41.594
<v Speaker 3>He knows where he's going to get that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you can measure the force that </v>

311
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:44.624
<v Speaker 3>he's willing to apply and that gives you</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rough estimate of his motivation or </v>

312
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Speaker 3>maybe ask the bar press like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

313
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:50.504
<v Speaker 3>like a cocaine addicted rats to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to receive the reward and you can count </v>

314
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:55.484
<v Speaker 3>rate of bar pressing and you can get an </v>
<v Speaker 3>estimate of how excited the route is to </v>

315
00:16:58.041 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 3>go do whatever it is the rats going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

316
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.583
<v Speaker 3>And so panksepp used to put rats in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pair them one riot against the other in </v>

317
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:09.980
<v Speaker 3>kind of a play arena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a very big thing and uh,</v>

318
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.000
<v Speaker 3>and the juvenile males and they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>work to do that.</v>

319
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:15.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they liked it.</v>

320
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.950
<v Speaker 3>And then maybe one rat was 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger than the other.</v>

321
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.053
<v Speaker 3>And then when you paired them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big rat would beat the little rat </v>

322
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:25.880
<v Speaker 3>because 10 percent weight advantage was </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to make the bigger rep dominant.</v>

323
00:17:25.881 --> 00:17:26.714
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then they established basically </v>

324
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:28.484
<v Speaker 3>dominance and submission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might think about that as a power </v>

325
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to some degree it is,</v>

326
00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is very important.</v>

327
00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:40.241
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the rats play together once and the a</v>

328
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.930
<v Speaker 3>big route pins the little rat really </v>
<v Speaker 3>very much like wrestling,</v>

329
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.360
<v Speaker 3>like rats wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like people wrestle 'em.</v>

330
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.020
<v Speaker 3>And if you pair them together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the big rat campaign,</v>

331
00:17:53.021 --> 00:17:53.801
<v Speaker 3>the little rat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

332
00:17:53.801 --> 00:17:56.740
<v Speaker 3>So now you got dominant rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>subordinate rat,</v>

333
00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.720
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

334
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.920
<v Speaker 3>but then you see if you stop the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment there you'd think,</v>

335
00:18:02.921 --> 00:18:05.320
<v Speaker 3>well the rats play to establish </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance and submission.</v>

336
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.530
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is is that rats don't just</v>
<v Speaker 3>play once,</v>

337
00:18:08.531 --> 00:18:09.370
<v Speaker 3>they played many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

338
00:18:09.371 --> 00:18:10.204
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's also the case with human </v>

339
00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:15.430
<v Speaker 3>beings is that you don't just play once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you play many,</v>

340
00:18:15.431 --> 00:18:16.264
<v Speaker 3>many times and there is a difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the rules of a game and the </v>

341
00:18:19.691 --> 00:18:23.620
<v Speaker 3>rules of a set of games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's so unbelievably important.</v>

342
00:18:23.621 --> 00:18:25.450
<v Speaker 3>So you keep that in mind because we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>return to that.</v>

343
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.660
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next time the two rats get together,</v>

344
00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.230
<v Speaker 3>the little rat house to ask the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>route to play because the rule basically</v>

345
00:18:32.231 --> 00:18:35.560
<v Speaker 3>is subordinate entity asks dominant </v>
<v Speaker 3>entity to play.</v>

346
00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.870
<v Speaker 3>And so the little rat does what mammals </v>
<v Speaker 3>do to play,</v>

347
00:18:40.871 --> 00:18:42.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of put their paws down and put</v>

348
00:18:42.851 --> 00:18:44.980
<v Speaker 3>the rear end up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit up in the air.</v>

349
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.680
<v Speaker 3>You see dogs do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And unless you're completely clueless,</v>

350
00:18:47.681 --> 00:18:48.514
<v Speaker 3>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean he's going for your </v>

351
00:18:49.751 --> 00:18:50.584
<v Speaker 3>throat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>means he wants you to whack them on the </v>

352
00:18:52.271 --> 00:18:54.670
<v Speaker 3>side of the head so he can sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretend to bite you.</v>

353
00:18:54.671 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

354
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.750
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty obvious if you've played </v>
<v Speaker 3>with dogs and children.</v>

355
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.550
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

356
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.733
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I make that comparison because dogs </v>

357
00:19:02.711 --> 00:19:04.330
<v Speaker 3>and children understand each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

358
00:19:04.331 --> 00:19:07.180
<v Speaker 3>They're pack animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they followed the same basic rules.</v>

359
00:19:07.181 --> 00:19:09.070
<v Speaker 3>They know how to play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can become friends,</v>

360
00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.750
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you wouldn't have them as </v>
<v Speaker 3>pets.</v>

361
00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean the dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the children.</v>

362
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>

363
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.620
<v Speaker 3>the little rat asks the big role to play</v>
<v Speaker 3>in big rep thing.</v>

364
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.211
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

365
00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they will play,</v>

366
00:19:20.211 --> 00:19:22.840
<v Speaker 3>they wrestle and you pair them multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

367
00:19:22.841 --> 00:19:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you compare them multiple times,</v>

368
00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:27.030
<v Speaker 3>what you find is the less the big rat </v>
<v Speaker 3>lets the little rat win,</v>

369
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.873
<v Speaker 3>30 percent of the time the little rat </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't ask the big rat to play anymore </v>

370
00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.080
<v Speaker 3>and that you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

371
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.120
<v Speaker 3>who cares what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why is that important?</v>

372
00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:35.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really important.</v>

373
00:19:35.771 --> 00:19:39.270
<v Speaker 3>That's a really important discovery </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it shows you that the,</v>

374
00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.293
<v Speaker 3>that even rats have a set set a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair play that emerges across iterated </v>

375
00:19:44.441 --> 00:19:45.640
<v Speaker 3>games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

376
00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.563
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's inevitable.</v>

377
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.230
<v Speaker 3>It's evidence for the biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantiation of a social morality.</v>

378
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

379
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.010
<v Speaker 3>That's a big discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

380
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.710
<v Speaker 3>and it shows you that even at the level </v>
<v Speaker 3>of rats,</v>

381
00:19:56.711 --> 00:19:59.210
<v Speaker 3>they're very social animals by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

382
00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.173
<v Speaker 3>the interactions between rats are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are mediated by something like a sense </v>

383
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:06.220
<v Speaker 3>of fairness or justice.</v>

384
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.480
<v Speaker 3>And so that's extremely cool because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

385
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.383
<v Speaker 3>we tend to think of animals as having </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchies and that's </v>

386
00:20:12.521 --> 00:20:14.380
<v Speaker 3>predicated on power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that idea,</v>

387
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.380
<v Speaker 3>even though the bloody postmodernists </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't believe in biology,</v>

388
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.900
<v Speaker 3>they extend that analogy up to human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

389
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.390
<v Speaker 3>It's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

390
00:20:22.391 --> 00:20:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>

391
00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.120
<v Speaker 3>turns out to be true with chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Frans de Waal,</v>

392
00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.720
<v Speaker 3>who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Dutch primatologist,</v>

393
00:20:28.721 --> 00:20:29.554
<v Speaker 3>a very smart one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been interested in the biological </v>

394
00:20:31.451 --> 00:20:33.380
<v Speaker 3>basis of morality as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

395
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.380
<v Speaker 3>and he really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's written a lot of good books on,</v>

396
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.820
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on primate behavior.</v>

397
00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Chimps in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chimps are brutal creatures,</v>

398
00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.180
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they go to war a.</v>

399
00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:45.250
<v Speaker 3>and so if you have a chimp territory out</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the jungle,</v>

400
00:20:45.251 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 3>then the juveniles will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the males in particular,</v>

401
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 3>the band together in groups of four or </v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

402
00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.440
<v Speaker 3>There's often but not always a female or</v>
<v Speaker 3>two with them.</v>

403
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.693
<v Speaker 3>And if they come across chimps from </v>
<v Speaker 3>another troupe that aren't within their </v>

404
00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:00.790
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say they will,</v>

405
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 3>if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they outnumber them because they,</v>

406
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:03.334
<v Speaker 3>they can't really count,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can estimate magnitude </v>

407
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:07.270
<v Speaker 3>visually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same as counting.</v>

408
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they outnumber them,</v>

409
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:10.144
<v Speaker 3>they will tear them to pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And chimps serve at least twice as </v>

410
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 3>strong as a really well developed human </v>
<v Speaker 3>male.</v>

411
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.600
<v Speaker 3>And so they can tear you up pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And chimps are perfectly capable.</v>

412
00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:23.080
<v Speaker 3>They hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're carnivorous like human beings.</v>

413
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.270
<v Speaker 3>And they hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hunt colobus monkeys,</v>

414
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:26.104
<v Speaker 3>often they weigh about 40 pounds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll basically eat them alive at the </v>

415
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.460
<v Speaker 3>monkey screaming away like mad because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it's in pain because it's being</v>

416
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 3>eaten and that doesn't slow the chimps </v>
<v Speaker 3>down a bit.</v>

417
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.810
<v Speaker 3>There's no cross species empathy </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopping them from having their snack.</v>

418
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.213
<v Speaker 3>And so chimps are very brutal creatures </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it isn't obvious they have a lot of </v>

419
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:49.420
<v Speaker 3>internal inhibition of the regression at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

420
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Most of the inhibition is sociological.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's out in the hierarchy.</v>

421
00:21:53.531 --> 00:21:54.364
<v Speaker 3>And so the reason chimps aren't always </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive with one another is because </v>

422
00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:57.993
<v Speaker 3>they know who can pound them and and who</v>
<v Speaker 3>will gang up on them and who won't be </v>

423
00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:04.660
<v Speaker 3>established their hierarchy anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

424
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.290
<v Speaker 3>you think about a champ hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a fairly strong and</v>

425
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.630
<v Speaker 3>aggressive creature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might think it's biggest,</v>

426
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.220
<v Speaker 3>ugliest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meanest,</v>

427
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 3>most vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>irritable,</v>

428
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 3>unpleasant chimp that rises to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But all that's kind of the postmodernist</v>

429
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:22.540
<v Speaker 3>view of human society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not the case.</v>

430
00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:23.374
<v Speaker 3>It happens sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what happens in has documented this </v>

431
00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:27.154
<v Speaker 3>quite nicely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that tyron chimps lead unstable </v>

432
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:32.050
<v Speaker 3>regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

433
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might sound familiar because the </v>

434
00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:38.020
<v Speaker 3>same thing of course is true human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings and why is that?</v>

435
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:39.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because you know,</v>

436
00:22:39.281 --> 00:22:40.114
<v Speaker 3>people don't like tyrants and chimps </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like them that much either and </v>

437
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.740
<v Speaker 3>chimps are actually quite reciprocal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>their social interaction,</v>

438
00:22:45.741 --> 00:22:47.500
<v Speaker 3>so they don't just dominate each other.</v>

439
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.570
<v Speaker 3>They groom each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have friendships,</v>

440
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.493
<v Speaker 3>they can track social relationships over</v>
<v Speaker 3>very long periods of time now and they </v>

441
00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:58.870
<v Speaker 3>do that and so they engage in reciprocal</v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions,</v>

442
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 3>let's say prosocial reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions and you might think,</v>

443
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 3>well what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the weak point of the biggest,</v>

444
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:08.950
<v Speaker 3>ugliest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toughest chimp in the troop?</v>

445
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 3>And that is he doesn't have any friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

446
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:12.934
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe as a bad day he's a little hung </v>

447
00:23:15.281 --> 00:23:19.840
<v Speaker 3>over or whatever for meeting fermented </v>
<v Speaker 3>bananas or whatever is partying with and</v>

448
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.650
<v Speaker 3>to have the slightly less ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly less mean.</v>

449
00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:24.484
<v Speaker 3>Chimps decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is a good time to take them </v>

450
00:23:25.991 --> 00:23:26.824
<v Speaker 3>out and they tear them to pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things do all his </v>

451
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:31.444
<v Speaker 3>pointed out quite nicely is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to have a stable chimp dominance </v>

452
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.790
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's call it a regime,</v>

453
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.070
<v Speaker 3>the stable ones aren't ruled by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrants tyrants get taken out by,</v>

454
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.970
<v Speaker 3>by paired up friendship dyad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

455
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:48.950
<v Speaker 3>So that's really worth thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

456
00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:50.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because</v>

457
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:55.463
<v Speaker 3>because it indicates that even in </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures that have less complex </v>

458
00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.633
<v Speaker 3>sociological orders and they do because </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that predicts how </v>

459
00:24:03.841 --> 00:24:04.674
<v Speaker 3>complex your social order is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how big your brain is compared to your </v>

460
00:24:07.051 --> 00:24:09.300
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's encephalization essentially.</v>

461
00:24:09.301 --> 00:24:10.134
<v Speaker 3>And the more encephalitis creature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the larger the social groups that </v>

462
00:24:12.901 --> 00:24:13.734
<v Speaker 3>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course human beings are very </v>

463
00:24:14.731 --> 00:24:17.220
<v Speaker 3>highly encephalitis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have quite complicated group,</v>

464
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.273
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have quite complicated group </v>

465
00:24:19.951 --> 00:24:20.784
<v Speaker 3>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even in simpler group organizations </v>

466
00:24:23.311 --> 00:24:27.190
<v Speaker 3>like the chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't the tyrant who rule stable.</v>

467
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.900
<v Speaker 3>And that turns out to be also incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

468
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:32.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

469
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:33.973
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much for the idea that power is the </v>

470
00:24:35.851 --> 00:24:37.650
<v Speaker 3>only game in town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you got to ask.</v>

471
00:24:37.651 --> 00:24:39.240
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

472
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.750
<v Speaker 3>this is actually a postmodern question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

473
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.823
<v Speaker 3>one of the things Derek just said that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the main postmodern joker is that by </v>

474
00:24:47.821 --> 00:24:50.080
<v Speaker 3>categorizing you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

475
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.943
<v Speaker 3>you privilege one concept and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you force other concepts out to the </v>

476
00:24:54.241 --> 00:24:55.074
<v Speaker 3>margins.</v>

477
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.160
<v Speaker 3>And so he believed that when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructed a hierarchy of power,</v>

478
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.770
<v Speaker 3>that the hierarchy of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>privilege,</v>

479
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.040
<v Speaker 3>certain people and marginalized others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

480
00:25:05.041 --> 00:25:09.060
<v Speaker 3>that's really not that brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 3>observation as far as I'm concerned.</v>

481
00:25:09.061 --> 00:25:12.300
<v Speaker 3>It's rather commonplace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All it means is that when you categorize</v>

482
00:25:12.301 --> 00:25:13.134
<v Speaker 3>something that there are things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the category and whole bunch of </v>

483
00:25:15.301 --> 00:25:16.134
<v Speaker 3>things that aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you actually can't categorize </v>

484
00:25:18.121 --> 00:25:20.250
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means you can't perceive anything,</v>

485
00:25:20.251 --> 00:25:21.084
<v Speaker 3>which means you can't think or live </v>
<v Speaker 3>without making some things in the </v>

486
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.910
<v Speaker 3>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everything else on the outside.</v>

487
00:25:26.911 --> 00:25:27.744
<v Speaker 3>It's part of categorization itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe the postmodernist would go </v>

488
00:25:31.531 --> 00:25:34.890
<v Speaker 3>far enough to question the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 3>categorization itself.</v>

489
00:25:34.891 --> 00:25:37.050
<v Speaker 3>And I think to some degree they do do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

490
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.153
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

491
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.330
<v Speaker 3>the point here is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

492
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.120
<v Speaker 3>you have to ask why it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

493
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.013
<v Speaker 3>if you were a postmodernist yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why it is that you would privilege the </v>

494
00:25:56.351 --> 00:25:57.184
<v Speaker 3>idea of power above all else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly what is it that you're </v>

495
00:25:59.651 --> 00:26:03.190
<v Speaker 3>pushing to the margin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's something that we're going</v>

496
00:26:03.191 --> 00:26:04.210
<v Speaker 3>to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

497
00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.220
<v Speaker 3>here's one thing you might push to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>margin.</v>

498
00:26:06.221 --> 00:26:11.221
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that you believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies are a consequence of power.</v>

499
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:13.263
<v Speaker 3>Well then you push competence to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>margin and then applying the postmodern </v>

500
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.340
<v Speaker 3>mark modernist logic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>

501
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.353
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason you're privileging power is </v>

502
00:26:20.651 --> 00:26:24.250
<v Speaker 3>so that you can produce so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>push competence to the margin.</v>

503
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.490
<v Speaker 3>And so you want to keep that in mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

504
00:26:27.491 --> 00:26:30.760
<v Speaker 3>because that's going to become important</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we discussed the relationship between</v>

505
00:26:30.761 --> 00:26:31.594
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism and Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're after the destruction of </v>

506
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:36.190
<v Speaker 3>the idea of competence itself.</v>

507
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.090
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so postmoderns,</v>

508
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.610
<v Speaker 3>and we talked about it a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll return to it.</v>

509
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.500
<v Speaker 3>Now we're going to talk a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Marxism.</v>

510
00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.020
<v Speaker 3>I've got a quote here from mark's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The proletarians have nothing to lose,</v>

511
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:54.400
<v Speaker 3>but they're changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

512
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.040
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty good for like 18,</v>

513
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 3>80 or 80,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 or whenever it was.</v>

514
00:26:57.811 --> 00:26:58.644
<v Speaker 3>He wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere around that period of time it </v>

515
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:00.613
<v Speaker 3>turned out the proletarians had a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>more to lose the interchange they had </v>

516
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:04.644
<v Speaker 3>their lives and their families to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was demonstrated amply as a </v>

517
00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:10.980
<v Speaker 3>consequence of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it,</v>

518
00:27:10.981 --> 00:27:11.814
<v Speaker 3>the sociological movements that were put</v>
<v Speaker 3>into place when the Marxist </v>

519
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions began to govern </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies like the Soviet Union.</v>

520
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.270
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

521
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.690
<v Speaker 3>so let's take the same postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach.</v>

522
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:30.470
<v Speaker 3>So here's some basic tenants of Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Berge Lousy against proletariat.</v>

523
00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 3>The bridge was the year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the capitalists,</v>

524
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.680
<v Speaker 3>the property owners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those sorts of people,</v>

525
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.630
<v Speaker 3>the proletariat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the working class,</v>

526
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.520
<v Speaker 3>for all intents and purposes.</v>

527
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:43.230
<v Speaker 3>The basic idea is that history itself is</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing but the,</v>

528
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.010
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The documentation of the struggle of one</v>

529
00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:50.490
<v Speaker 3>class against the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

530
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.430
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong,</v>

531
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Speaker 3>but it's okay because it's too simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

532
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.013
<v Speaker 3>It's obviously too simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of motivations that </v>

533
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:02.590
<v Speaker 3>people have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are economic,</v>

534
00:28:02.591 --> 00:28:07.140
<v Speaker 3>some of them are associated with power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's okay.</v>

535
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.993
<v Speaker 3>We will leave that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's let's give the devil his due and </v>

536
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:09.841
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

537
00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:10.591
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

538
00:28:10.591 --> 00:28:13.620
<v Speaker 3>There is still a fair bit of tension </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the haves and the haves and have</v>

539
00:28:13.621 --> 00:28:17.400
<v Speaker 3>nots and maybe that was even more </v>
<v Speaker 3>intense in previous societies than it is</v>

540
00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:18.390
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's no,</v>

541
00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:20.760
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt that economics plays a </v>
<v Speaker 3>role in,</v>

542
00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 3>in virtually everything that human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings do in a fairly significant role.</v>

543
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:25.164
<v Speaker 3>So let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

544
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.380
<v Speaker 3>let's accept that as a potential theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

545
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 3>it's simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it's practically useful.</v>

546
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.090
<v Speaker 3>And then there's kind of an offshoot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that theory,</v>

547
00:28:33.091 --> 00:28:34.110
<v Speaker 3>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

548
00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:34.944
<v Speaker 3>if you're a Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means you have sympathy for the </v>

549
00:28:36.451 --> 00:28:37.350
<v Speaker 3>working class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

550
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what you're saying all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

551
00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:39.781
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

552
00:28:39.781 --> 00:28:41.670
<v Speaker 3>the poor working class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all oppressed.</v>

553
00:28:41.671 --> 00:28:43.800
<v Speaker 3>The poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor proletariat,</v>

554
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're also saying,</v>

555
00:28:45.901 --> 00:28:46.734
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're the good guys because we're </v>

556
00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:48.654
<v Speaker 3>standing on the side of the oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then you might also ask what </v>

557
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:54.450
<v Speaker 3>you're marginalizing when you claim that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the good guys,</v>

558
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:55.284
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things that you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be marginalizing is all of the ways in </v>

559
00:28:57.721 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 3>which you're not the good guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can leave that aside for a moment</v>

560
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:02.430
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

561
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:05.060
<v Speaker 3>but there's the claims is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

562
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.680
<v Speaker 3>there's the working class against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ruling class.</v>

563
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.523
<v Speaker 3>Another claim is the ruling class is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ruined class because they exploit the </v>

564
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.200
<v Speaker 3>working class basically stealing their </v>
<v Speaker 3>excess labor from them.</v>

565
00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another very,</v>

566
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:18.990
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

567
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.160
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

568
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.800
<v Speaker 3>surfacely attractive claim that lacks </v>
<v Speaker 3>any reasonable justification,</v>

569
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:30.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's predicated on the idea of </v>

570
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:32.874
<v Speaker 3>the world as a zero sum game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And clearly the world is not a zero sum </v>

571
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:38.070
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when someone creates wealth,</v>

572
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.470
<v Speaker 3>when someone is wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be at least at times because they</v>

573
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:42.304
<v Speaker 3>created it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not because they swiped it from someone </v>

574
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:44.680
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

575
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:46.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think of someone like Bill Gates</v>

576
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:50.190
<v Speaker 3>or Steve Jobs is a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

577
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:51.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

578
00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:56.671
<v Speaker 3>they're what they produced pad to value </v>
<v Speaker 3>that far exceeded what they garnered.</v>

579
00:29:56.921 --> 00:29:57.754
<v Speaker 3>As a consequence of their production,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though what they garnered was </v>

580
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.990
<v Speaker 3>fairly substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

581
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:03.100
<v Speaker 3>but we'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

582
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.840
<v Speaker 3>we're going to give the devil his due.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

583
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:05.674
<v Speaker 3>It's the bourgeoisie against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proletariat will accept that it's class </v>

584
00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:11.290
<v Speaker 3>warfare is the primary historical mover.</v>

585
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.153
<v Speaker 3>No problem now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's what I'm not willing to give </v>

586
00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:16.810
<v Speaker 3>away so easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

587
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.033
<v Speaker 3>we have sympathy for the working class </v>
<v Speaker 3>primarily and we're good because of </v>

588
00:30:22.181 --> 00:30:23.530
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm not gonna.</v>

589
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Just give that away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So simply.</v>

590
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:27.243
<v Speaker 3>So let's investigate that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if we can actually figure it </v>

591
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.160
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's true.</v>

592
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:35.670
<v Speaker 3>We'll say a use a pragmatic approach </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a pragmatist in that William</v>

593
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:37.923
<v Speaker 3>James,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sansa,</v>

594
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

595
00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.720
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you can think about even more </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply in anciently.</v>

596
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:44.554
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a statement in the New </v>

597
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's by their fruits,</v>

598
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:51.160
<v Speaker 3>you shall know the fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to walk down that road</v>

599
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.493
<v Speaker 3>before we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now that's another thing you have to </v>

600
00:30:54.851 --> 00:30:56.230
<v Speaker 3>keep in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before we do that,</v>

601
00:30:56.231 --> 00:30:58.930
<v Speaker 3>I want to make one more detour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

602
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 3>So I like making detours and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>tangling the oil back together,</v>

603
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.183
<v Speaker 3>so I want to give you a bit of a history</v>
<v Speaker 3>of theories of suffering and I'm going </v>

604
00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:08.524
<v Speaker 3>to compare the Marxist theory of </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering to the Judeo Christian theory </v>

605
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:14.370
<v Speaker 3>of suffering and the Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be.</v>

606
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.203
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I'm doing that is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the Judeo Christian theory of </v>

607
00:31:17.651 --> 00:31:21.610
<v Speaker 3>suffering is actually one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>foundation stones of our entire culture.</v>

608
00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:25.180
<v Speaker 3>And so it actually matters why you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're suffering.</v>

609
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:30.310
<v Speaker 3>And so the story that describes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entry of suffering into the world,</v>

610
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.160
<v Speaker 3>that mythological story is the story in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Genesis,</v>

611
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:33.994
<v Speaker 3>the story of Adam and eve and basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens in the story of Adam and </v>

612
00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:37.384
<v Speaker 3>Eve as Adam and Eve are unconscious to </v>
<v Speaker 3>begin with and they're sort of in this </v>

613
00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:44.020
<v Speaker 3>paradise will state there's no death or </v>
<v Speaker 3>at least there's no knowledge of death.</v>

614
00:31:44.021 --> 00:31:48.970
<v Speaker 3>There's also no knowledge of self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then eats the apple that the serpent</v>

615
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:53.971
<v Speaker 3>gives her and the scales fall from her </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes and she gives the apple to Adam and</v>

616
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:57.910
<v Speaker 3>he eats it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she makes him self conscious.</v>

617
00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:58.893
<v Speaker 3>They both wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing that happens is they </v>

618
00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:03.760
<v Speaker 3>realize that they're naked and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover themselves up,</v>

619
00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:04.594
<v Speaker 3>and the second thing that happens as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of that realization is that </v>

620
00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:07.804
<v Speaker 3>they come to know the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>good and evil and I mean that's an </v>

621
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:11.973
<v Speaker 3>insanely complicated story that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with a re absolutely in </v>

622
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:20.380
<v Speaker 3>comprehensible number of complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomena simultaneously,</v>

623
00:32:20.381 --> 00:32:21.214
<v Speaker 3>but it basically goes something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is that to be aware that you're </v>

624
00:32:26.051 --> 00:32:26.884
<v Speaker 3>naked is to be aware of your fragility </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your mortality when when you have a </v>

625
00:32:32.381 --> 00:32:34.630
<v Speaker 3>nightmare about being naked in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a crowd,</v>

626
00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:36.940
<v Speaker 3>it means that you're exposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowd.</v>

627
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 3>All your flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all your mortal vulnerability is exposed</v>

628
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:42.710
<v Speaker 3>to the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for for for them to see,</v>

629
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:45.260
<v Speaker 3>for you to be ashamed of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for them to judge.</v>

630
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:46.603
<v Speaker 3>That's partly why we're all close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's partly why human being a human </v>

631
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:53.120
<v Speaker 3>white clothing is a human universal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's many human universals,</v>

632
00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clothing is one of them,</v>

633
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.170
<v Speaker 3>although it's used for many different </v>
<v Speaker 3>purposes,</v>

634
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.453
<v Speaker 3>so Adam and eve cover themselves up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so because they've realized that </v>

635
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:03.320
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're vulnerable,</v>

636
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.570
<v Speaker 3>they're naked and vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That self consciousness,</v>

637
00:33:05.571 --> 00:33:06.404
<v Speaker 3>human beings are self conscious animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're really the only self conscious </v>

638
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:10.454
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other animals have the glimmerings of </v>

639
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:13.904
<v Speaker 3>self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them can identify themselves in </v>

640
00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 3>a mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

641
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:17.953
<v Speaker 3>but we have whole theories of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have whole articulated verbal and </v>

642
00:33:22.071 --> 00:33:22.904
<v Speaker 3>philosophical theories of what a human </v>
<v Speaker 3>being is and what we each are as </v>

643
00:33:25.901 --> 00:33:26.490
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

644
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.150
<v Speaker 3>So really those aren't in the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptual universe.</v>

645
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.930
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a qualitatively different issue.</v>

646
00:33:32.931 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 3>In the case of human beings were self </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious,</v>

647
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.210
<v Speaker 3>selfconsciousness loads on trait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism,</v>

648
00:33:38.211 --> 00:33:39.044
<v Speaker 3>technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that self consciousness is </v>

649
00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:41.654
<v Speaker 3>primarily something that manifests </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself in the form of negative emotion </v>

650
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:47.540
<v Speaker 3>and we all know that you're onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get self conscious.</v>

651
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Is that a good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

652
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.250
<v Speaker 3>You can give.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So self conscious that your tongue tied,</v>

653
00:33:52.251 --> 00:33:53.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

654
00:33:53.151 --> 00:33:53.984
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be self conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage or maybe ever you get self </v>

655
00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:59.720
<v Speaker 3>conscious in the in the face of someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to impress.</v>

656
00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:01.340
<v Speaker 3>He turned all red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Stammer.</v>

657
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.373
<v Speaker 3>It's like self consciousness is a rough </v>
<v Speaker 3>business and it's no wonder because you </v>

658
00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:05.984
<v Speaker 3>know yourself for the for the fragile </v>
<v Speaker 3>fool that you are and it's even worse </v>

659
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:13.220
<v Speaker 3>than that because see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took me a long time to figure out why</v>

660
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.203
<v Speaker 3>it was that when Adam and eve woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they also develop the knowledge of good </v>

661
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:17.390
<v Speaker 3>and evil.</v>

662
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:19.940
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't figure that out because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't make sense to me.</v>

663
00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:20.983
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How selfconsciousness knowledge of </v>

664
00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:23.624
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability and the knowledge of good </v>
<v Speaker 3>and evil we're tangled together or even </v>

665
00:34:27.351 --> 00:34:29.240
<v Speaker 3>really what the knowledge of good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil meant,</v>

666
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.550
<v Speaker 3>but I figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually I thought,</v>

667
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.271
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

668
00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:35.090
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a real revelation to me.</v>

669
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.720
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you know you're vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the difference between good and</v>

670
00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:39.554
<v Speaker 3>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because as soon as you know you're </v>

671
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:42.680
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know everyone else is.</v>

672
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.320
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as you know that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else is vulnerable,</v>

673
00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:46.154
<v Speaker 3>you know how to hurt them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that means you consciously know </v>

674
00:34:50.601 --> 00:34:54.650
<v Speaker 3>how to bring suffering into being and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the knowledge of good and evil.</v>

675
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.860
<v Speaker 3>And you know that because let's say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really good at torturing people,</v>

676
00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.753
<v Speaker 3>hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt a number of people in </v>

677
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:00.704
<v Speaker 3>the audience who are actually quite good</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that and maybe you all have a bit of </v>

678
00:35:03.441 --> 00:35:05.520
<v Speaker 3>an affinity for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

679
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.273
<v Speaker 3>if you're married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure your partner would testify to </v>

680
00:35:08.841 --> 00:35:09.674
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

681
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.680
<v Speaker 3>So if you're going to hurt someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think essentially is,</v>

682
00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:17.510
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would really hurt me?</v>

683
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:18.441
<v Speaker 3>Then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

684
00:35:18.441 --> 00:35:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I'll just do that to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

685
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.601
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

686
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:22.580
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good theory.</v>

687
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.810
<v Speaker 3>It's a very sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

688
00:35:25.811 --> 00:35:26.391
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

689
00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:27.620
<v Speaker 3>so what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam and eve,</v>

690
00:35:27.621 --> 00:35:29.480
<v Speaker 3>wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't supposed to do this.</v>

691
00:35:29.481 --> 00:35:32.000
<v Speaker 3>God told them that they are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry if they did that,</v>

692
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.163
<v Speaker 3>but they did it anyways because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what people are like and because we </v>

693
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.183
<v Speaker 3>learn things that knock us out of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>present paradises we're curious and we </v>

694
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:46.490
<v Speaker 3>won't leave things alone and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are not so bad and then you,</v>

695
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask some questions that maybe you're not</v>

696
00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:50.364
<v Speaker 3>so happy about asking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you find the answer and you fall </v>

697
00:35:52.711 --> 00:35:53.544
<v Speaker 3>out of your little paradise into history</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you gotta work to set things right </v>

698
00:35:56.491 --> 00:35:58.060
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

699
00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.333
<v Speaker 3>God gets wind of this and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he chases Adam and eve out of the </v>

700
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.930
<v Speaker 3>garden of Eden,</v>

701
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.780
<v Speaker 3>but he said some interesting things when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he chases them out,</v>

702
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:10.620
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

703
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.080
<v Speaker 3>now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the consequences of that?</v>

704
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:16.831
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>

705
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:19.190
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

706
00:36:19.191 --> 00:36:20.800
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really cool.</v>

707
00:36:20.801 --> 00:36:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is God after all.</v>

708
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:23.600
<v Speaker 3>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

709
00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.640
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows what he's talking about.</v>

710
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.220
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to work.</v>

711
00:36:28.221 --> 00:36:31.490
<v Speaker 3>So why would you have to work now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you knew you were vulnerable?</v>

712
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer to that is,</v>

713
00:36:33.141 --> 00:36:34.340
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know you're vulnerable,</v>

714
00:36:34.341 --> 00:36:37.250
<v Speaker 3>that stretches out into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're going to die,</v>

715
00:36:37.251 --> 00:36:38.084
<v Speaker 3>you know that you're fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like maybe all your problems are </v>

716
00:36:40.941 --> 00:36:42.530
<v Speaker 3>solved right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're all sitting here,</v>

717
00:36:42.531 --> 00:36:43.910
<v Speaker 3>you're safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not hungry,</v>

718
00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:47.960
<v Speaker 3>you don't want anything to drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc. But what about tomorrow?</v>

719
00:36:47.961 --> 00:36:50.780
<v Speaker 3>What about next week or next month or 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>years from now?</v>

720
00:36:50.781 --> 00:36:51.614
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because you got all your problems </v>

721
00:36:52.391 --> 00:36:53.224
<v Speaker 3>solved for this second doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got them solved for the rest of </v>

722
00:36:56.241 --> 00:36:58.130
<v Speaker 3>your iterations through time.</v>

723
00:36:58.900 --> 00:36:59.733
<v Speaker 3>So you got to work and the work is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice of the president for the </v>

724
00:37:02.201 --> 00:37:04.810
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's exactly right.</v>

725
00:37:04.811 --> 00:37:08.350
<v Speaker 3>You have to work now you see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See what's interesting aBout that,</v>

726
00:37:08.351 --> 00:37:09.640
<v Speaker 3>and this is the theory that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

727
00:37:09.641 --> 00:37:12.520
<v Speaker 3>and then of course god tells that eve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

728
00:37:12.521 --> 00:37:14.200
<v Speaker 3>you've really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

729
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.093
<v Speaker 3>screwed things up to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have these big brain </v>

730
00:37:17.051 --> 00:37:19.600
<v Speaker 3>babies and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a big problem.</v>

731
00:37:19.601 --> 00:37:20.434
<v Speaker 3>You're going to suffer in childbirth and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they're going to be dependent on </v>

732
00:37:23.891 --> 00:37:25.150
<v Speaker 3>you forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>

733
00:37:25.151 --> 00:37:28.390
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be dependent on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>man that you just woke up and that's not</v>

734
00:37:28.391 --> 00:37:29.860
<v Speaker 3>going to be very pleasant for either of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

735
00:37:29.861 --> 00:37:30.694
<v Speaker 3>but tough luck and so that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the curse in some sense and it's </v>

736
00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:37.030
<v Speaker 3>exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is,</v>

737
00:37:37.031 --> 00:37:37.864
<v Speaker 3>there's a theory in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an interesting theory of </v>

738
00:37:40.031 --> 00:37:40.864
<v Speaker 3>suffering that's implicit in that story </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the theory of suffering is that </v>

739
00:37:43.871 --> 00:37:47.260
<v Speaker 3>suffering is built into the structure of</v>
<v Speaker 3>self conscious being.</v>

740
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:51.640
<v Speaker 3>It's built right into the structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you're a self conscious being,</v>

741
00:37:51.641 --> 00:37:54.880
<v Speaker 3>that's your lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't someone else's fault.</v>

742
00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:58.600
<v Speaker 3>It isn't a consequence of sociological </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppression.</v>

743
00:37:59.110 --> 00:37:59.943
<v Speaker 3>It isn't the consequences of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that our society isn't organized </v>

744
00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:03.693
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

745
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:06.750
<v Speaker 3>It's just part of being.</v>

746
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:10.270
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's a big deal because that's a.</v>

747
00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:12.670
<v Speaker 3>That's an important theory because one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the questions is,</v>

748
00:38:12.671 --> 00:38:14.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we know why is there suffering,</v>

749
00:38:14.561 --> 00:38:16.840
<v Speaker 3>but what are you going to do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a big.</v>

750
00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:17.733
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot different if it's just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Way it is for you and if it's actually </v>

751
00:38:21.911 --> 00:38:23.880
<v Speaker 3>your fault that he's suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are,</v>

752
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.100
<v Speaker 3>or maybe it's the group's fault that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're suffering.</v>

753
00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Those are major.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those theories are really,</v>

754
00:38:30.531 --> 00:38:33.860
<v Speaker 3>really different and then in the second </v>
<v Speaker 3>story in cain and abel,</v>

755
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:40.530
<v Speaker 3>cane make sacrifices to try to get it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>good with god enabled,</v>

756
00:38:40.531 --> 00:38:45.430
<v Speaker 3>make sacrifices and sacrifices are kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of archaic from our perspective.</v>

757
00:38:45.431 --> 00:38:46.264
<v Speaker 3>They're burnt offerings so the smoke </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes up where god can detect it because </v>

758
00:38:48.731 --> 00:38:52.820
<v Speaker 3>he's up there somewhere up there where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stars are and uh,</v>

759
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 3>god rejects cane sacrifices and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>really know why,</v>

760
00:38:56.471 --> 00:39:00.790
<v Speaker 3>but it kind of looks like cain is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>second grader and then god king goes and</v>

761
00:39:00.791 --> 00:39:01.624
<v Speaker 3>complains to god and says like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of stupid universe did you </v>

762
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:04.210
<v Speaker 3>make here?</v>

763
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm breaking myself and half trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get things together,</v>

764
00:39:08.231 --> 00:39:13.150
<v Speaker 3>making the proper sacrifices and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing's going well for me and abel.</v>

765
00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:13.781
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

766
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:17.080
<v Speaker 3>he's everything he touches turns to </v>
<v Speaker 3>gold.</v>

767
00:39:17.081 --> 00:39:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Everyone loves him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's even a really good guy.</v>

768
00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:23.440
<v Speaker 3>It's like so annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's up with this place you built?</v>

769
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.603
<v Speaker 3>And god tells kane don't become an and </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me that the entire fabric of </v>

770
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:31.330
<v Speaker 3>reality is wrong because it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>working out for you.</v>

771
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Says sin crouches at your door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a,</v>

772
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.720
<v Speaker 3>like a sexually aroused predatory cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's basically the metaphor that,</v>

773
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.013
<v Speaker 3>that god uses and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you let it in and had it and let it </v>

774
00:39:44.141 --> 00:39:44.974
<v Speaker 3>have its way with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's really an interesting way of </v>

775
00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 3>putting it because what god says to cain</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>

776
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.053
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all bitter and resentful and </v>

777
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:53.913
<v Speaker 3>really it's no wonder because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things aren't going well for you and </v>

778
00:39:56.891 --> 00:40:00.670
<v Speaker 3>then you've got able who's over shining </v>
<v Speaker 3>you in every way and uh,</v>

779
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:03.550
<v Speaker 3>but it's your fault,</v>

780
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:05.953
<v Speaker 3>this terrible thing waited at the door </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you let it in and then you entered </v>

781
00:40:10.851 --> 00:40:11.684
<v Speaker 3>into a creative union with it and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>produced something as a consequence and </v>

782
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.413
<v Speaker 3>that's this tormented spirit that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have now and it's polluting your </v>

783
00:40:19.671 --> 00:40:24.020
<v Speaker 3>relationship with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why things aren't working out</v>

784
00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:24.943
<v Speaker 3>very well for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So go put yourself together before you </v>

785
00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:32.591
<v Speaker 3>come and tell me just exactly what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong with the structure of reality.</v>

786
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:34.303
<v Speaker 3>And cain isn't very happy about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because really is that really what you </v>

787
00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:37.650
<v Speaker 3>want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

788
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:38.563
<v Speaker 3>Like you have more misery than is </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary because you really didn't put </v>

789
00:40:43.401 --> 00:40:44.234
<v Speaker 3>your act together and you know it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've done it creatively and so kayden </v>

790
00:40:49.521 --> 00:40:50.570
<v Speaker 3>goes and kills abel.</v>

791
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.703
<v Speaker 3>That's the story of how resentment </v>
<v Speaker 3>enters the world and it's the first </v>

792
00:40:55.831 --> 00:40:56.664
<v Speaker 3>story in the judeo christian canon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say about actual human beings </v>

793
00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.480
<v Speaker 3>because adam and eve were made by god so</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't really count.</v>

794
00:41:03.481 --> 00:41:04.314
<v Speaker 3>Cain and abel were born and so that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something so there's a reaction to </v>

795
00:41:08.011 --> 00:41:08.791
<v Speaker 3>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

796
00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:09.624
<v Speaker 3>The necessIty of sacrifice and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of the necessity of </v>

797
00:41:12.001 --> 00:41:15.390
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices that some sacrifices work and</v>
<v Speaker 3>others don't,</v>

798
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:18.540
<v Speaker 3>and then if your sacrifices aren't met </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

799
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.790
<v Speaker 3>with the good will of god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

800
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:23.010
<v Speaker 3>well then that makes you angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

801
00:41:23.011 --> 00:41:23.844
<v Speaker 3>of course it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can take god out of this story if </v>

802
00:41:25.561 --> 00:41:26.394
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not happy with that kind of </v>

803
00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:32.010
<v Speaker 3>mythological or narrative statement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't really matter because the</v>

804
00:41:32.011 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 3>whole point is is that if you make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices,</v>

805
00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:35.024
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're second rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things aren't going to go very well for </v>

806
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:38.174
<v Speaker 3>you and you're going to get bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentful and murderous and maybe </v>

807
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:43.100
<v Speaker 3>genocidal and it's really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

808
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:47.330
<v Speaker 3>because cane has descendants and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>bug,</v>

809
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.210
<v Speaker 3>if you transgress against them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't just kill you.</v>

810
00:41:50.211 --> 00:41:53.750
<v Speaker 3>They killed seven of you and then his </v>
<v Speaker 3>later descendants kill 49 of you.</v>

811
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:58.700
<v Speaker 3>There's this exponential growth of </v>
<v Speaker 3>murderousness as a consequence of canes,</v>

812
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:03.350
<v Speaker 3>primary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>primal fratricide,</v>

813
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.430
<v Speaker 3>and then the next story is the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not an accident.</v>

814
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.190
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing in those stories is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>accident.</v>

815
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now you've got two different theories</v>

816
00:42:12.891 --> 00:42:16.610
<v Speaker 3>about the nature of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got the one I just laid out,</v>

817
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.320
<v Speaker 3>it's called the foundational story of </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering and malevolence,</v>

818
00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:22.154
<v Speaker 3>and you have the marxists story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is while there's an oppressed </v>

819
00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.353
<v Speaker 3>people and the reason they're oppressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and suffering is because of the </v>

820
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:30.560
<v Speaker 3>oppressors are oppressing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are not the same theories.</v>

821
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.710
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a utopianism that's implicit</v>

822
00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:34.544
<v Speaker 3>in marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is if you could just get the damn </v>

823
00:42:36.861 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 3>old pressers to stop oppressing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressed,</v>

824
00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.453
<v Speaker 3>then the utopia would arrive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so not only are the oppressors </v>

825
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:46.970
<v Speaker 3>responsible for the suffering of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>poor,</v>

826
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:52.040
<v Speaker 3>they're also responsible for the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the utopia isn't here for everyone.</v>

827
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:53.323
<v Speaker 3>And so how reprehensible can you get?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then that certainly justifies that </v>

828
00:42:59.411 --> 00:43:04.300
<v Speaker 3>degree of malevolence justifies pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>much anything you'd like to do to them.</v>

829
00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:05.493
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's take this apart in a little </v>

830
00:43:06.941 --> 00:43:11.941
<v Speaker 3>more detail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do the marxists.</v>

831
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:13.004
<v Speaker 3>Have sympathy for the working class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George orwell was interested in this </v>

832
00:43:17.481 --> 00:43:21.980
<v Speaker 3>question and so he wrote this book </v>
<v Speaker 3>called wiggins road to wigan pier,</v>

833
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.730
<v Speaker 3>which I would highly recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So on a reading list I've made,</v>

834
00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.980
<v Speaker 3>it's on my website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can check that out.</v>

835
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Those are books that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly influential to me.</v>

836
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:31.753
<v Speaker 3>And so orwell was a socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wrote the book for the left book </v>

837
00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:37.874
<v Speaker 3>club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which published a kind of a socialist </v>

838
00:43:40.281 --> 00:43:42.590
<v Speaker 3>book once a month or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

839
00:43:42.591 --> 00:43:45.530
<v Speaker 3>by the time he wrote this book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was already awake.</v>

840
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.740
<v Speaker 3>No buy in the 19 twenties after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>russian revolution.</v>

841
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.753
<v Speaker 3>No one really knew what to make of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>was happening in what would become the </v>

842
00:43:55.671 --> 00:43:57.100
<v Speaker 3>soviet union,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right be.</v>

843
00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 3>It was after world war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One planet was in ashes,</v>

844
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.113
<v Speaker 3>pro intents and purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The old aristocratic order was </v>

845
00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:06.404
<v Speaker 3>crumbling.</v>

846
00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.253
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

847
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.113
<v Speaker 3>it was a horror show and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionaries came out with these new </v>

848
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:16.370
<v Speaker 3>ideas and tried to give the in </v>
<v Speaker 3>principle,</v>

849
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.233
<v Speaker 3>give the working class a break and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody watched to see what would </v>

850
00:44:19.371 --> 00:44:20.204
<v Speaker 3>happen then,</v>

851
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:21.983
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

852
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:23.743
<v Speaker 3>the honest people and the intellectuals </v>
<v Speaker 3>watched and I separate them for a </v>

853
00:44:27.111 --> 00:44:28.510
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

854
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:31.140
<v Speaker 3>but by 1920,</v>
<v Speaker 3>21,</v>

855
00:44:31.141 --> 00:44:32.700
<v Speaker 3>22,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

856
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.570
<v Speaker 3>it was obvious already that something </v>
<v Speaker 3>was rotten in the state of Denmark.</v>

857
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.433
<v Speaker 3>Malcolm muggeridge went over to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>soviet union to check out how the </v>

858
00:44:40.021 --> 00:44:40.854
<v Speaker 3>collectivization of the farms was going </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he found out it was actually pretty </v>

859
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:45.930
<v Speaker 3>murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

860
00:44:45.931 --> 00:44:46.764
<v Speaker 3>Because what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the communists did was roundup all </v>

861
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.433
<v Speaker 3>the successful farmers and rape them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill them and steal everything they had </v>

862
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:55.110
<v Speaker 3>and send them off to siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which turned out actually to be a pretty</v>

863
00:44:55.111 --> 00:44:58.560
<v Speaker 3>bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you think you think about it,</v>

864
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:03.360
<v Speaker 3>those people were serfs not very long </v>
<v Speaker 3>before a couple of generations at most,</v>

865
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.373
<v Speaker 3>they were so not much more than slaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of them had risen up to the </v>

866
00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:08.244
<v Speaker 3>point where the media had a nice brick </v>
<v Speaker 3>house and a couple of cows and maybe a </v>

867
00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:11.334
<v Speaker 3>person working for them or too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was a small proportion of the </v>

868
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.383
<v Speaker 3>agriculturalists in the soviet union </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're producing most of the food </v>

869
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:19.763
<v Speaker 3>and that's just how it goes because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a prieto distribution issue in </v>

870
00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:25.830
<v Speaker 3>any field where there's human </v>
<v Speaker 3>productivity,</v>

871
00:45:25.831 --> 00:45:28.830
<v Speaker 3>a small proportion of the people produce</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all of the output.</v>

872
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.053
<v Speaker 3>It's actually the square root of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of people in the field produce </v>

873
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 3>half the output.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have 100 farmers,</v>

874
00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:35.154
<v Speaker 3>ted of them produce half the food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you have 10,000 to 100 of them </v>

875
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:39.990
<v Speaker 3>produce half the food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

876
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:42.720
<v Speaker 3>So what happens when you kill all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>good farmers?</v>

877
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.760
<v Speaker 3>You starve 6 million ukrainians to death</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 19 thirties.</v>

878
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:49.163
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not something that's all that </v>

879
00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:52.200
<v Speaker 3>widely known,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you want to</v>

880
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:56.700
<v Speaker 3>provide some additional fodder for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>nightmares,</v>

881
00:45:56.701 --> 00:45:57.534
<v Speaker 3>you could go online and read about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to the ukrainians in the 19 </v>

882
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:02.810
<v Speaker 3>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So underneath the,</v>

883
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.773
<v Speaker 3>under the collectivization principles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you're a mother and you </v>

884
00:46:06.971 --> 00:46:10.350
<v Speaker 3>were starving to death and so are your </v>
<v Speaker 3>children and you know,</v>

885
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.660
<v Speaker 3>the communists had come in and forcibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>collectivized you and then they took all</v>

886
00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.800
<v Speaker 3>the grain that your collective farm and </v>
<v Speaker 3>producing,</v>

887
00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:18.230
<v Speaker 3>they shipped it all to the city say.</v>

888
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:20.040
<v Speaker 3>And so that's all done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>

889
00:46:20.041 --> 00:46:20.821
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

890
00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:21.654
<v Speaker 3>the city's got eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you go out in the field to pick </v>

891
00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:28.320
<v Speaker 3>up the grains that the harvesters missed</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that you can,</v>

892
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones that they'd be lying there,</v>

893
00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:32.520
<v Speaker 3>they're not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not that many of them.</v>

894
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:33.403
<v Speaker 3>you go out and glean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pick up the seeds that weren't </v>

895
00:46:35.221 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 3>picked up a so you can feed your kids so</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't die.</v>

896
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.360
<v Speaker 3>And so what's the punishment for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>death?</v>

897
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:44.303
<v Speaker 3>Because you were obliged under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>collectivization orders to turn in any </v>

898
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:48.683
<v Speaker 3>additional grains that you happen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick off the ground to the authorities </v>

899
00:46:52.111 --> 00:46:53.850
<v Speaker 3>so that they can be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

900
00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:55.890
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least so you.</v>

901
00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:58.200
<v Speaker 3>So they could be shipped to the cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose,</v>

902
00:46:58.201 --> 00:47:01.110
<v Speaker 3>which is of course absurd because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course that would never happen,</v>

903
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.230
<v Speaker 3>but it was mostly so that you could just</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually die.</v>

904
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

905
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:09.210
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the road to wigan pier.</v>

906
00:47:09.211 --> 00:47:10.044
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

907
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to read you a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 3>about from the book.</v>

908
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.980
<v Speaker 3>So orwell went out to this mining town </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the northern uk and coal miners</v>

909
00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:26.483
<v Speaker 3>had sympathy for the working class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really worked on that hiS whole life </v>

910
00:47:28.861 --> 00:47:32.950
<v Speaker 3>because he was a middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>upper middle class,</v>

911
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.083
<v Speaker 3>snobby type englishman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he knew it and he tried really hard </v>

912
00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:39.364
<v Speaker 3>to overcome that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

913
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.320
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

914
00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:44.590
<v Speaker 3>he served in the spanish civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wandered around as a tramp.</v>

915
00:47:44.591 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 3>He worked in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in low end restaurant.</v>

916
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:50.410
<v Speaker 3>He worked as a low end worker in </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants in paris and in london.</v>

917
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:51.244
<v Speaker 3>He has a very good book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called down and out in </v>

918
00:47:53.391 --> 00:47:54.224
<v Speaker 3>paris and london that describes that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was seriously committed dude and really </v>

919
00:47:58.181 --> 00:47:59.014
<v Speaker 3>a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's going up to these terrible </v>

920
00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:03.843
<v Speaker 3>towns in the northern uk where the coal </v>
<v Speaker 3>miners worked and have their families </v>

921
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:09.220
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had hard lives.</v>

922
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.890
<v Speaker 3>They had hard lives and that's just say </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

923
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.300
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

924
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:14.163
<v Speaker 3>the coal miners that he met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have any teeth by the time </v>

925
00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:17.944
<v Speaker 3>they were 30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said the women he talked to you said </v>

926
00:48:20.711 --> 00:48:21.544
<v Speaker 3>teeth or just a misery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better to get rid of them as soon </v>

927
00:48:23.441 --> 00:48:25.020
<v Speaker 3>as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

928
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:26.450
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

929
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:29.950
<v Speaker 3>and they went and the man went and mined</v>
<v Speaker 3>coal and that was rough.</v>

930
00:48:29.951 --> 00:48:30.784
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all have black lung by the time </v>

931
00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:34.780
<v Speaker 3>they were 40 and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were done fundamentally.</v>

932
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:37.460
<v Speaker 3>But here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a bit,</v>

933
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.520
<v Speaker 3>a bit of a story about how hard their </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives were.</v>

934
00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:44.521
<v Speaker 3>So they had to go in the mines during </v>
<v Speaker 3>the day so that they never saw the day.</v>

935
00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:45.964
<v Speaker 3>So that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to go to the mines and then </v>

936
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:47.914
<v Speaker 3>they ended like not coal off the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hard with hammers and picks and </v>

937
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:55.000
<v Speaker 3>all of that and they had to move it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was.</v>

938
00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:57.730
<v Speaker 3>That was their job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was the commute,</v>

939
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.983
<v Speaker 3>so here is the commute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that the typical tunnel was </v>

940
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:02.860
<v Speaker 3>about that high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

941
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:05.260
<v Speaker 3>and the typical coal miner was about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that high.</v>

942
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:06.483
<v Speaker 3>Lots of problem maybe because you've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to walk through those tunnels to get to </v>

943
00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:11.740
<v Speaker 3>work so you have to walk like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the question might be,</v>

944
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:14.200
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how far do you have to walk to work?</v>

945
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.273
<v Speaker 3>And that answer is three and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles and that's how far you have to </v>

946
00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:18.994
<v Speaker 3>walk back from work after you put your </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight hour shift in the coal mine and </v>

947
00:49:23.051 --> 00:49:27.850
<v Speaker 3>the you don't get paid for the commute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so orwell said that was more or less</v>

948
00:49:27.851 --> 00:49:32.290
<v Speaker 3>like climbing a small mountain in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning before you went to work and then</v>

949
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.050
<v Speaker 3>climbing another one at night before you</v>
<v Speaker 3>went home.</v>

950
00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:36.880
<v Speaker 3>And so that was just.</v>

951
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:38.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>

952
00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:41.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you very little about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>tough their lives were,</v>

953
00:49:41.051 --> 00:49:41.884
<v Speaker 3>but that gives you a little flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said one day like that for a modern </v>

954
00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:45.334
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just your dad or you wish you </v>

955
00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:51.721
<v Speaker 3>were dead anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so orwell talks about going up there</v>

956
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:52.624
<v Speaker 3>to stay in terrible places he lived in </v>
<v Speaker 3>while he was up there and the terrible </v>

957
00:49:55.781 --> 00:49:59.260
<v Speaker 3>food he ate and and the miserable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wretched scenes that he saw.</v>

958
00:49:59.261 --> 00:50:01.420
<v Speaker 3>And here's one of the miserable richard </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenes.</v>

959
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 3>He's on a train through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods.</v>

960
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:05.524
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the train bore me away for the monster </v>

961
00:50:07.991 --> 00:50:09.250
<v Speaker 3>scenery of slag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heaps,</v>

962
00:50:09.251 --> 00:50:13.660
<v Speaker 3>chimneys piled scrap iron fall canals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paths of singery mud,</v>

963
00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.930
<v Speaker 3>criss cross by the prince of clogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was march,</v>

964
00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:18.183
<v Speaker 3>but the weather had been horribly cold </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everywhere there were mounds of </v>

965
00:50:21.491 --> 00:50:22.324
<v Speaker 3>black and snow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As we move slowly through the outskirts </v>

966
00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:26.044
<v Speaker 3>of the town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we passed row after of little gray slum </v>

967
00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:29.504
<v Speaker 3>houses running at right angles to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>embankment at the back of one of the </v>

968
00:50:33.771 --> 00:50:34.120
<v Speaker 3>houses.</v>

969
00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:34.953
<v Speaker 3>The young woman was kneeling on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stones poking a stick up the lead and </v>

970
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:40.520
<v Speaker 3>waste pipe which ran from the sink </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside him,</v>

971
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:44.930
<v Speaker 3>which I suppose was blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had time to see everything about her.</v>

972
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Her sack apron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her clumsy clogs her arms,</v>

973
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:52.190
<v Speaker 3>reddened by the cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looked up as the train passed,</v>

974
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.710
<v Speaker 3>and I was almost near enough to catch </v>
<v Speaker 3>her eye.</v>

975
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:56.563
<v Speaker 3>She had around pale face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usual exhausted face of the slum girl </v>

976
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:04.490
<v Speaker 3>who's 25 and looks 40 thanks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two miscarriages and drudgery and at war</v>

977
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.610
<v Speaker 3>for the second in which I sought the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most desolate,</v>

978
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:11.930
<v Speaker 3>hopeless expression I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It struck me.</v>

979
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:15.020
<v Speaker 3>Then we meaning the middle class at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

980
00:51:15.021 --> 00:51:15.854
<v Speaker 3>our mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when we saY that it isn't the same </v>

981
00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:18.674
<v Speaker 3>for them as it would be for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then people bread in the slums can </v>

982
00:51:21.261 --> 00:51:22.094
<v Speaker 3>imagine nothing but the slums for what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw on her face was by no means the </v>

983
00:51:25.731 --> 00:51:26.564
<v Speaker 3>ignorant suffering of an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knew well enough what was happening </v>

984
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:31.670
<v Speaker 3>to her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understood as well as I did,</v>

985
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:34.910
<v Speaker 3>how dreadful of destiny it was to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>kneeling there in the bitter cold.</v>

986
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 3>On the slimy stones of a slum backyard </v>
<v Speaker 3>poking a stick up,</v>

987
00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:40.580
<v Speaker 3>a follow drain pipe.</v>

988
00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:43.613
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so orwell rates the first part of the </v>

989
00:51:47.581 --> 00:51:48.414
<v Speaker 3>book and it details the lives of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and then he makes an argument he </v>

990
00:51:52.771 --> 00:51:54.480
<v Speaker 3>says was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you read about this?</v>

991
00:51:54.481 --> 00:51:58.160
<v Speaker 3>How can you know about this without </v>
<v Speaker 3>having some sympathy for</v>

992
00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.990
<v Speaker 3>redistribution schemes and social and </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialist ideas.</v>

993
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.170
<v Speaker 3>And so he's actually asking himself this</v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

994
00:52:07.171 --> 00:52:09.150
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a rhetorical question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

995
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:10.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a serious guy,</v>

996
00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:11.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went,</v>

997
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:12.263
<v Speaker 3>he goeS up there and he tells you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>story that you have to have a heart of </v>

998
00:52:15.361 --> 00:52:16.950
<v Speaker 3>stone if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't,</v>

999
00:52:16.951 --> 00:52:18.390
<v Speaker 3>if you read that you don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1000
00:52:18.391 --> 00:52:20.700
<v Speaker 3>something should be done about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really awful.</v>

1001
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:21.743
<v Speaker 3>So he set up this situation where your </v>
<v Speaker 3>sympathies are completely with the </v>

1002
00:52:27.121 --> 00:52:32.121
<v Speaker 3>people that he's describing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but socialism wasn't all that popular in</v>

1003
00:52:32.651 --> 00:52:33.750
<v Speaker 3>britain at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1004
00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:34.943
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and socialists weren't all that popular </v>

1005
00:52:37.691 --> 00:52:40.810
<v Speaker 3>with orwell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't really like them that much and</v>

1006
00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.640
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to figure out why that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1007
00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.320
<v Speaker 3>So this is what he wrote in the second </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the book.</v>

1008
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Now this card have been a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>

1009
00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:53.930
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want to publish this damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>book after he wrote the second part.</v>

1010
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:55.703
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1011
00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.710
<v Speaker 3>but he fought with him and he got it </v>
<v Speaker 3>published and it's a classic and,</v>

1012
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:00.583
<v Speaker 3>and people still read it and you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>read it because it's a great book and </v>

1013
00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:04.093
<v Speaker 3>orwell's great writer and orwell is </v>
<v Speaker 3>another one of those people and </v>

1014
00:53:07.631 --> 00:53:10.050
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals who woke up pretty early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1015
00:53:10.051 --> 00:53:10.884
<v Speaker 3>orwell wrote animal farm and 1984.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote 1984 and 1940 eIght wrote </v>

1016
00:53:16.331 --> 00:53:18.790
<v Speaker 3>animal farm approximately around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>

1017
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:23.290
<v Speaker 3>He knew what was happening under stalin </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he wasn't afraid to say it,</v>

1018
00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 3>but it was a that in some sense fell on </v>
<v Speaker 3>deaf ears,</v>

1019
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:28.883
<v Speaker 3>especially among the intelligentsia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's complicated reasons for </v>

1020
00:53:31.231 --> 00:53:32.350
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

1021
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:34.483
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't like the facts weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>there for people to see them if they </v>

1022
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 3>wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And has already said muggeridge.</v>

1023
00:53:38.581 --> 00:53:39.414
<v Speaker 3>Malcolm muggeridge had made it pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>clear in the 19 twenties and that was </v>

1024
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:44.340
<v Speaker 3>widely publicized by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout the uk.</v>

1025
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.353
<v Speaker 3>What was happening during d kula,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kulaks being the farmers that I </v>

1026
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 3>talked about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1027
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:56.750
<v Speaker 3>who had committed the unspeakable sin of</v>
<v Speaker 3>crawling out of their surf status over a</v>

1028
00:53:58.531 --> 00:53:59.364
<v Speaker 3>couple of Generations to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't mirror property and half </v>

1029
00:54:03.721 --> 00:54:04.554
<v Speaker 3>starved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is what oracle had to say about </v>

1030
00:54:07.861 --> 00:54:08.760
<v Speaker 3>socialists.</v>

1031
00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:12.550
<v Speaker 3>It might be sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>

1032
00:54:12.551 --> 00:54:13.384
<v Speaker 3>that Even if the theoretical oriented </v>
<v Speaker 3>book train socialist is not a working </v>

1033
00:54:18.101 --> 00:54:18.934
<v Speaker 3>man himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least he has actually by a love of </v>

1034
00:54:21.941 --> 00:54:25.810
<v Speaker 3>the working class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's endeavoring to shed his joie status</v>

1035
00:54:25.811 --> 00:54:27.610
<v Speaker 3>and fight on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proletariat.</v>

1036
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that must be his motive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

1037
00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.113
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I look at the socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intellectual tract writing type of </v>

1038
00:54:37.811 --> 00:54:38.644
<v Speaker 3>socialist with his pullover is fuzzy </v>
<v Speaker 3>hair and his marxist quotation and </v>

1039
00:54:42.941 --> 00:54:45.220
<v Speaker 3>wonder what the devil is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motive really is.</v>

1040
00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.520
<v Speaker 3>It's really difficult to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a love of anybody,</v>

1041
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.700
<v Speaker 3>especially if the working class from </v>
<v Speaker 3>whom he is of all people,</v>

1042
00:54:51.701 --> 00:54:52.534
<v Speaker 3>the furthest removed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is that too many people </v>

1043
00:54:56.231 --> 00:54:57.064
<v Speaker 3>calling them socialists revolution does </v>
<v Speaker 3>not mean a movement of the masses with </v>

1044
00:55:01.361 --> 00:55:04.870
<v Speaker 3>which they hope to associate themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means instead of set of reforms which</v>

1045
00:55:04.871 --> 00:55:05.704
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the clever ones are going to impose on </v>

1046
00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:11.560
<v Speaker 3>them the lower orders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

1047
00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:15.940
<v Speaker 3>it would be a mistake to regard the book</v>
<v Speaker 3>train socialist as a bloodless creature,</v>

1048
00:55:15.941 --> 00:55:16.774
<v Speaker 3>entirely incapable of emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>though seldom giving much evidence of </v>

1049
00:55:20.861 --> 00:55:21.694
<v Speaker 3>affection for the exploited</v>
<v Speaker 3>is perfectly capable of displaying </v>

1050
00:55:26.201 --> 00:55:30.010
<v Speaker 3>hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of queer theoretical in vacuum.</v>

1051
00:55:30.011 --> 00:55:32.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hatred against the explorers.</v>

1052
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Hence the grand old social sport of </v>
<v Speaker 3>denouncing the bourgeoisie.</v>

1053
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:37.643
<v Speaker 3>It is strange how easily almost any </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialist writer can lash himself into </v>

1054
00:55:40.991 --> 00:55:44.860
<v Speaker 3>frenzies of rage against the class too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by birth or by adoption,</v>

1055
00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:48.280
<v Speaker 3>he himself almost invariably belongs.</v>

1056
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:51.893
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked for the ndp when I was a kid </v>

1057
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:55.163
<v Speaker 3>and I had privileged access to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>leadership for provincially and </v>

1058
00:55:58.851 --> 00:56:00.770
<v Speaker 3>federally for reasons that I won't go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>

1059
00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:01.933
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of them were honorable people who </v>

1060
00:56:06.491 --> 00:56:09.130
<v Speaker 3>were really striving to give the working</v>
<v Speaker 3>class of voice.</v>

1061
00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:12.550
<v Speaker 3>And I believe that the working class </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs a voice,</v>

1062
00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:16.570
<v Speaker 3>a political voice for obvious reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1063
00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.213
<v Speaker 3>I think the democrats in the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States have made it absolutely dreadful </v>

1064
00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:26.311
<v Speaker 3>abysmal mistake replacing their working </v>
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>

1065
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:31.920
<v Speaker 3>political ethos with identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk about that and,</v>

1066
00:56:32.171 --> 00:56:33.004
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1067
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.460
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think the situation has </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed that much.</v>

1068
00:56:39.461 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in the United States is that</v>

1069
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.733
<v Speaker 3>world stability and peace in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been purchased at the expense of </v>

1070
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:54.450
<v Speaker 3>north american working class wellbeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>now because the chinese have gotten rich</v>

1071
00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:58.360
<v Speaker 3>compared to 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 years ago,</v>

1072
00:56:58.361 --> 00:57:00.800
<v Speaker 3>50 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1073
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:03.730
<v Speaker 3>the indians have gotten rich again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same comparison basis.</v>

1074
00:57:03.731 --> 00:57:04.564
<v Speaker 3>There's more middle class people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>India now than there are on the United </v>

1075
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:07.800
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1076
00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:08.973
<v Speaker 3>the trade arrangements that have been in</v>
<v Speaker 3>north America allowed for the rise of </v>

1077
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.690
<v Speaker 3>middle classes globally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the same time,</v>

1078
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:17.583
<v Speaker 3>they opened up the working class in </v>
<v Speaker 3>north America to competition from those </v>

1079
00:57:20.561 --> 00:57:23.170
<v Speaker 3>low wage sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that's a good deal.</v>

1080
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.310
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1081
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 3>because it's not such a bad thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the chinese aren't starving and it's not</v>

1082
00:57:29.111 --> 00:57:29.944
<v Speaker 3>such a bad thing that the indians aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>starving and that those societies are </v>

1083
00:57:32.531 --> 00:57:35.200
<v Speaker 3>transforming themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually into communities that are quite</v>

1084
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:36.910
<v Speaker 3>wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like hooray for that.</v>

1085
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.220
<v Speaker 3>It's an absolutely miraculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

1086
00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:43.900
<v Speaker 3>It's the most rapid growth of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth in the history of humanity,</v>

1087
00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:45.123
<v Speaker 3>so we should be pretty happy about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we should also remember at least to </v>

1088
00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:53.431
<v Speaker 3>some degree who's paid the price for it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1089
00:57:55.421 --> 00:57:58.090
<v Speaker 3>the working class needs a voice</v>

1090
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:00.303
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

1091
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:03.130
<v Speaker 3>it isn't obvious that they have one at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment.</v>

1092
00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>

1093
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:10.330
<v Speaker 3>it isn't obvious to me at all</v>

1094
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:17.750
<v Speaker 3>that the people who purport to stand for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the working class actually do so or that</v>

1095
00:58:19.261 --> 00:58:22.710
<v Speaker 3>if they do so that the reason they do so</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because they're all compassionate and</v>

1096
00:58:22.711 --> 00:58:23.544
<v Speaker 3>sympathetic and loving and kind and st.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm more convinced by orwell's </v>

1097
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.530
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So back to the mdp,</v>

1098
00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:34.650
<v Speaker 3>the people I met at the leadership </v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

1099
00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.150
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them I had a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>admiration for,</v>

1100
00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:41.880
<v Speaker 3>but as I worked with the party over </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a five year period,</v>

1101
00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:43.493
<v Speaker 3>there's this contradiction that kept </v>
<v Speaker 3>emerging for me and that was that I </v>

1102
00:58:46.621 --> 00:58:49.980
<v Speaker 3>didn't really like the low level party </v>
<v Speaker 3>functionary activist types.</v>

1103
00:58:49.981 --> 00:58:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Like they just weren't personally </v>
<v Speaker 3>appealing to me.</v>

1104
00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:57.680
<v Speaker 3>They seem peevish and resentful and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time I was going to college,</v>

1105
00:58:58.350 --> 00:58:59.183
<v Speaker 3>I was about 17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got elected to the senate on the </v>

1106
00:59:01.921 --> 00:59:02.754
<v Speaker 3>college board of governors and at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time alberta was conservative </v>

1107
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:07.530
<v Speaker 3>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1108
00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:09.740
<v Speaker 3>It still is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they.</v>

1109
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.030
<v Speaker 3>It was part of the progressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative</v>

1110
00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:14.663
<v Speaker 3>empire because they ruled alberta </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever and all the board of governor </v>

1111
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 3>members were basically nominees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1112
00:59:22.221 --> 00:59:23.054
<v Speaker 3>TheY were conservative nominees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these were conservative people and I </v>

1113
00:59:25.201 --> 00:59:26.034
<v Speaker 3>was an ndp member and I thought I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked for small businessman to who </v>

1114
00:59:29.541 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 3>weren't mdp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

1115
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.810
<v Speaker 3>they were conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can never figure that out.</v>

1116
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:33.673
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you about that in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I had a bad case of cognitive </v>

1117
00:59:37.191 --> 00:59:38.024
<v Speaker 3>dissonance because they actually turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>out that I admired the people on the </v>

1118
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:42.850
<v Speaker 3>board of governors and they were mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in grand prairie.</v>

1119
00:59:42.851 --> 00:59:44.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not a very big place and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>very old.</v>

1120
00:59:44.901 --> 00:59:49.190
<v Speaker 3>And so if you were reasonably successful</v>
<v Speaker 3>in grand prairie,</v>

1121
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:50.053
<v Speaker 3>the probability that you would inherited</v>
<v Speaker 3>your money from the aristocrat </v>

1122
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:56.000
<v Speaker 3>aristocracy was like zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause there wasn't one,</v>

1123
00:59:56.001 --> 00:59:56.834
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the whole damn town was 50 years </v>

1124
00:59:58.521 --> 01:00:02.390
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you had any influencer or wealth,</v>

1125
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:03.283
<v Speaker 3>you are a small businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small to middle sized businessmen and </v>

1126
01:00:05.421 --> 01:00:06.254
<v Speaker 3>you'd.</v>

1127
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:08.200
<v Speaker 5>You knew what you were doing.</v>

1128
01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.310
<v Speaker 3>And I actually admired these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

1129
01:00:11.311 --> 01:00:12.144
<v Speaker 3>well that's not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mire them and I don't share their </v>

1130
01:00:14.761 --> 01:00:16.560
<v Speaker 3>political views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's these other people with</v>

1131
01:00:16.561 --> 01:00:20.340
<v Speaker 3>whom I hypothetically share political </v>
<v Speaker 3>views and I don't admire them at all.</v>

1132
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.220
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I read road to wigan pier and I</v>

1133
01:00:23.221 --> 01:00:24.450
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1134
01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:29.310
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't like the poor.</v>

1135
01:00:29.311 --> 01:00:34.110
<v Speaker 3>They just hate the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same thing.</v>

1136
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:35.303
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same set of motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so let's say that you're a </v>

1137
01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:42.510
<v Speaker 3>postmodernist and you privileged </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassion for the oppressed.</v>

1138
01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:43.621
<v Speaker 3>Think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1139
01:00:43.621 --> 01:00:46.530
<v Speaker 3>what are you pushed to the margins?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1140
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.030
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing with all your hatred </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your resentment and your evil?</v>

1141
01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:56.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't have any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad theory.</v>

1142
01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.420
<v Speaker 3>That's a really bad theory.</v>

1143
01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fine.</v>

1144
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:02.810
<v Speaker 3>So you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>

1145
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 3>you can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't buy it.</v>

1146
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:06.343
<v Speaker 3>I still think that the people who stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>to speak for the oppressed are in fact </v>

1147
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:14.090
<v Speaker 3>motivated by empathy and sympathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their hearts are in the right place.</v>

1148
01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.430
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really buy that either because I</v>

1149
01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:17.264
<v Speaker 3>don't really think generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's a credible claim for someone </v>

1150
01:01:21.471 --> 01:01:24.380
<v Speaker 3>to make that their heart is in the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1151
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:26.443
<v Speaker 3>Now you can ask that of yourself and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think your heart is in the right </v>

1152
01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:30.860
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well more power to you.</v>

1153
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:31.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1154
01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:34.760
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't see the halo from here.</v>

1155
01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:35.623
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so given that you're just as </v>

1156
01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:41.834
<v Speaker 3>malevolent as your neighbor or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>even more so and that that's actually </v>

1157
01:01:47.001 --> 01:01:51.140
<v Speaker 3>pretty malevolent given the intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature of human beings.</v>

1158
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:52.303
<v Speaker 3>I cAn't help but wonder what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing with all those traits that you're </v>

1159
01:01:55.131 --> 01:01:56.470
<v Speaker 3>not admitting to,</v>

1160
01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.293
<v Speaker 5>but you can.</v>

1161
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.220
<v Speaker 3>You could even object.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1162
01:02:02.221 --> 01:02:03.054
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty pessimistic view of </v>

1163
01:02:04.081 --> 01:02:06.900
<v Speaker 3>humankind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not by the way,</v>

1164
01:02:06.901 --> 01:02:08.430
<v Speaker 3>it's just not naive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>

1165
01:02:08.431 --> 01:02:10.650
<v Speaker 3>you could object that and you can say </v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1166
01:02:10.651 --> 01:02:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weight of moral authority is in fact</v>

1167
01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.593
<v Speaker 3>on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the radical left with those who </v>

1168
01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:22.110
<v Speaker 3>identify the oppressed and who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>working to better their conditions.</v>

1169
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.353
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1170
01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.600
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then let's say,</v>

1171
01:02:29.601 --> 01:02:31.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's give those people some power</v>

1172
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.153
<v Speaker 3>and if they're actually motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassion and empathy and desire for </v>

1173
01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:38.054
<v Speaker 3>the working class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you give them power and you give the </v>

1174
01:02:40.621 --> 01:02:44.180
<v Speaker 3>ideas power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then as those ideas unfold in real time,</v>

1175
01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.373
<v Speaker 3>you're going to find out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did things get better for the working </v>

1176
01:02:48.411 --> 01:02:49.490
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say?</v>

1177
01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Or did they get worse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we could.</v>

1178
01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:55.070
<v Speaker 3>We could consider that like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment.</v>

1179
01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:59.180
<v Speaker 3>We could consider the outcome proof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what else you would do.</v>

1180
01:02:59.181 --> 01:03:00.014
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how else you would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would come to your decision because </v>

1181
01:03:02.781 --> 01:03:04.670
<v Speaker 3>it's just theory until you see it </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1182
01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature said back in the 18,</v>

1183
01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:11.000
<v Speaker 3>late 18 hundreds that</v>

1184
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.633
<v Speaker 3>after he said that god was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I suppose that would also Mean the </v>

1185
01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.040
<v Speaker 3>theory that of suffering that I outlined</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the beginning.</v>

1186
01:03:21.041 --> 01:03:24.210
<v Speaker 3>That is that the basis of judeo </v>
<v Speaker 3>christian civilization,</v>

1187
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:27.270
<v Speaker 3>that god was dead in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people had killed him,</v>

1188
01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.150
<v Speaker 3>and that we'd never find enough water to</v>
<v Speaker 3>wash away the blood.</v>

1189
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a paraphrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got the basic message right,</v>

1190
01:03:33.241 --> 01:03:34.074
<v Speaker 3>and he also said there'll be two </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of that nihilism because </v>

1191
01:03:39.661 --> 01:03:40.494
<v Speaker 3>there's no transcendent meaning and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>move to totalitarianism because people </v>

1192
01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:44.334
<v Speaker 3>can't tolerate nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said the most likely pathway to </v>

1193
01:03:48.451 --> 01:03:52.200
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism would be communism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Essentially.</v>

1194
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:57.290
<v Speaker 3>He didn't quite use those words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he meant that he,</v>

1195
01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:01.950
<v Speaker 3>the words are close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said socialism,</v>

1196
01:04:01.951 --> 01:04:04.250
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to use communism to </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinguishing it,</v>

1197
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.390
<v Speaker 3>distinguish it from democratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialism,</v>

1198
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:07.583
<v Speaker 3>and he said that probably tens of tens </v>
<v Speaker 3>of millions of people would die in the </v>

1199
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:13.890
<v Speaker 3>20th century as we played out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment and then he said,</v>

1200
01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:15.960
<v Speaker 3>but it might be worth it if we learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>something from it.</v>

1201
01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:20.040
<v Speaker 3>Rough man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1202
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.790
<v Speaker 3>and and unbelievable like I cannot </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how in the world he knew that</v>

1203
01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:26.640
<v Speaker 3>that was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially so far in advance,</v>

1204
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:27.503
<v Speaker 3>but dostoevsky knew the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote this book called the devil's </v>

1205
01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:32.910
<v Speaker 3>are the possessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could read that,</v>

1206
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:36.540
<v Speaker 3>that's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes about 150 pages to get going,</v>

1207
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:41.130
<v Speaker 3>but once it like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything snaps together after that,</v>

1208
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it moves and it's basically his</v>

1209
01:04:44.671 --> 01:04:49.671
<v Speaker 3>prophecy about it's an examination of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of person who had arisen in the</v>

1210
01:04:49.951 --> 01:04:54.780
<v Speaker 3>aftermath of the death of god in Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>who would lead the communist revolution.</v>

1211
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:57.150
<v Speaker 3>That's essentially it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's brilliant.</v>

1212
01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:57.751
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1213
01:04:57.751 --> 01:05:02.751
<v Speaker 3>it's terrifying and it's a great intro </v>
<v Speaker 3>to solzhenitsyn's gulag archipelago,</v>

1214
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:03.863
<v Speaker 3>which describes what did happen when </v>
<v Speaker 3>those sort of people took over the </v>

1215
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.470
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's look at what happened after the</v>

1216
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:12.810
<v Speaker 3>revolution and we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1217
01:05:12.811 --> 01:05:13.644
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about we replicate the experiment a </v>

1218
01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:15.804
<v Speaker 3>few times because you know how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're running this scientific </v>

1219
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:18.754
<v Speaker 3>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to find out what something </v>

1220
01:05:21.491 --> 01:05:23.950
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you allow it to behave,</v>

1221
01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:24.903
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to just run it once </v>
<v Speaker 3>because while maybe there was something </v>

1222
01:05:27.161 --> 01:05:29.950
<v Speaker 3>specific about those conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>lead to the outcome.</v>

1223
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.880
<v Speaker 3>You want to generalize it across </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple circumstances.</v>

1224
01:05:33.881 --> 01:05:34.840
<v Speaker 3>So we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1225
01:05:34.841 --> 01:05:37.610
<v Speaker 3>let's take this set of ideas and let's,</v>

1226
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:40.783
<v Speaker 3>let's run it on large scale over very </v>
<v Speaker 3>long period of time in a variety of </v>

1227
01:05:43.641 --> 01:05:46.850
<v Speaker 3>exceptionally diverse cultures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>languages.</v>

1228
01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:51.900
<v Speaker 3>So let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1229
01:05:51.901 --> 01:05:52.734
<v Speaker 3>well we could first start with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the soviet people even now because </v>

1230
01:05:58.921 --> 01:05:59.754
<v Speaker 3>it's like the 100 anniversary of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>russian revolution are celebrating </v>

1231
01:06:02.761 --> 01:06:03.900
<v Speaker 3>lennon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1232
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:07.260
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like celebrating hitler.</v>

1233
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.470
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dead serious about that.</v>

1234
01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:11.993
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that people can dare to </v>

1235
01:06:14.911 --> 01:06:15.744
<v Speaker 3>think that that's okay means that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with the way </v>

1236
01:06:18.631 --> 01:06:19.464
<v Speaker 3>that we look at history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Landon was a monster and if you want to </v>

1237
01:06:23.671 --> 01:06:24.504
<v Speaker 3>know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can read solzhenitsyn's writings </v>

1238
01:06:25.801 --> 01:06:28.590
<v Speaker 3>about lending because they communist </v>
<v Speaker 3>apologist say,</v>

1239
01:06:28.591 --> 01:06:29.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't landing.</v>

1240
01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.293
<v Speaker 3>Len was a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was all motivated by love of the </v>

1241
01:06:32.551 --> 01:06:34.080
<v Speaker 3>working class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1242
01:06:34.081 --> 01:06:34.914
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his henchmen was stolen and if you're </v>

1243
01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:40.350
<v Speaker 3>hansman is stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not a good guy.</v>

1244
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.823
<v Speaker 3>And and lenin was around during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>early collectivization and if you read </v>

1245
01:06:46.441 --> 01:06:47.274
<v Speaker 3>what he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find out that he is perfectly </v>

1246
01:06:48.721 --> 01:06:49.554
<v Speaker 3>willing to have any number of people die</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as his ideological system could </v>

1247
01:06:53.101 --> 01:06:56.490
<v Speaker 3>be brought into big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no celebrating lennon.</v>

1248
01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.533
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're cool young marxist hip </v>

1249
01:06:59.491 --> 01:07:04.140
<v Speaker 3>revolutionaries and he's our idol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's none of that.</v>

1250
01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:08.160
<v Speaker 3>Not if you know anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not if you're decent,</v>

1251
01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.393
<v Speaker 3>whether it's death of the kulaks I told </v>
<v Speaker 3>you about that there was a ukrainian </v>

1252
01:07:13.591 --> 01:07:15.630
<v Speaker 3>famine that's 6 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go there.</v>

1253
01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:18.780
<v Speaker 3>There was the rise of the gulag state </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it turned out that Russia,</v>

1254
01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.960
<v Speaker 3>the soviet union couldn't run on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>principles that it had,</v>

1255
01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:27.000
<v Speaker 3>that it had a laid down as sacrosanct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just didn't work.</v>

1256
01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:27.834
<v Speaker 3>So you had to enslave everybody and run </v>
<v Speaker 3>your economy as a slave state </v>

1257
01:07:32.011 --> 01:07:32.844
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And try not to kill the people into </v>

1258
01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.073
<v Speaker 3>gulags so fast that you can't suck some </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive labor out of them is the </v>

1259
01:07:41.571 --> 01:07:44.630
<v Speaker 3>death of tens of millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't even know.</v>

1260
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:45.523
<v Speaker 3>The estimates range from 15 to $60 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million and like we won't get too picky </v>

1261
01:07:50.961 --> 01:07:51.794
<v Speaker 3>even about the numbers because after the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first 10 million you kinda made your </v>

1262
01:07:54.681 --> 01:07:55.514
<v Speaker 3>point and the fact that we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>between 15 and 60 is actually an </v>

1263
01:07:59.991 --> 01:08:01.580
<v Speaker 3>indication of the horror</v>

1264
01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.473
<v Speaker 4>of it</v>

1265
01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:09.060
<v Speaker 3>because our count is off by tens of </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions and that's only within the last</v>

1266
01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:10.863
<v Speaker 3>century and then there was the 1956 </v>
<v Speaker 3>crackdown on Hungary and the 19 eight </v>

1267
01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:16.573
<v Speaker 3>invasion of czechoslovakia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there was the whole like thermo </v>

1268
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:23.750
<v Speaker 3>nuclear holocaust thing that was going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on at the same time and the fact that in</v>

1269
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:24.584
<v Speaker 3>1962 and in 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were seconds away from complete </v>

1270
01:08:29.031 --> 01:08:29.990
<v Speaker 3>annihilation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1271
01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:30.824
<v Speaker 3>During the cuban missile crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the keys were in the intercontinental </v>

1272
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.700
<v Speaker 3>ballistic missile release systems and </v>
<v Speaker 3>castro,</v>

1273
01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.960
<v Speaker 3>as he admitted to jimmy carter case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of you are castro fans,</v>

1274
01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:43.183
<v Speaker 3>which you shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That he was perfectly willing to have </v>

1275
01:08:46.461 --> 01:08:49.340
<v Speaker 3>Cuba annihilated if it would've meant </v>
<v Speaker 3>the defeat of the United States.</v>

1276
01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:56.930
<v Speaker 3>And then in 1984 approximately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I may have the date exactly wrong.</v>

1277
01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:58.790
<v Speaker 3>The russians received</v>

1278
01:08:59.060 --> 01:08:59.720
<v Speaker 5>an indication</v>

1279
01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.553
<v Speaker 3>from their early warning systems that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the americans had launched five thermal </v>

1280
01:09:03.101 --> 01:09:03.934
<v Speaker 3>and nuclear missiles and one russian </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided that it was a mistake and </v>

1281
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:13.850
<v Speaker 3>refused to launch the retaliation and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>just died about two weeks ago.</v>

1282
01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:15.350
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1283
01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:19.160
<v Speaker 3>that was pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1284
01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:23.120
<v Speaker 3>so that was experiment number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that that wasn't good,</v>

1285
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:25.640
<v Speaker 3>that experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's put it that way.</v>

1286
01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:30.810
<v Speaker 3>IT wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was exactly the antithesis of good.</v>

1287
01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:36.080
<v Speaker 3>It was precisely the antithesis of good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't all.</v>

1288
01:09:36.461 --> 01:09:37.294
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the people's republic of China </v>

1289
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:41.830
<v Speaker 3>has a different country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like seriously,</v>

1290
01:09:41.831 --> 01:09:42.940
<v Speaker 3>a different country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1291
01:09:42.941 --> 01:09:45.220
<v Speaker 3>Different tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different language.</v>

1292
01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:50.590
<v Speaker 3>How many people died in China under mao?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knows.</v>

1293
01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:52.773
<v Speaker 3>Same issue with the soviet union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although myra was a bigger monster than </v>

1294
01:09:56.741 --> 01:09:57.940
<v Speaker 3>stalin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1295
01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.340
<v Speaker 3>that's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1296
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.233
<v Speaker 3>because there's hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's stalin and mao and of the three </v>

1297
01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:09.940
<v Speaker 3>mile was probably the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's still revered in China.</v>

1298
01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that accounts for their affinity </v>
<v Speaker 3>for North Korea,</v>

1299
01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:18.490
<v Speaker 3>which could still destroy us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the remnants of that horrible state.</v>

1300
01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:23.320
<v Speaker 3>Maybe 100 million people died in China </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the great leap forward.</v>

1301
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:25.720
<v Speaker 3>That's a hell of a leap forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1302
01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.250
<v Speaker 3>maybe it wasn't a 100 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1303
01:10:27.251 --> 01:10:30.340
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was only $40 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as I said before,</v>

1304
01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:33.520
<v Speaker 3>when you're counting in the tens of </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions,</v>

1305
01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:34.373
<v Speaker 3>your points already made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was Cambodia and the </v>

1306
01:10:36.851 --> 01:10:37.684
<v Speaker 3>killing fields and Bulgaria at east </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany and Romania and the democratic </v>

1307
01:10:40.931 --> 01:10:41.764
<v Speaker 3>people's republic of Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's North Korea and Vietnam and </v>

1308
01:10:44.321 --> 01:10:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hungary,</v>

1309
01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.800
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

1310
01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:48.693
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was never a successful communist </v>

1311
01:10:51.341 --> 01:10:55.590
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuba I suppose came closest,</v>

1312
01:10:55.591 --> 01:10:56.820
<v Speaker 3>but it was radically,</v>

1313
01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:58.083
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1314
01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:02.550
<v Speaker 3>the soviets poured money into Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that doesn't really count.</v>

1315
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.330
<v Speaker 3>So then the first question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1316
01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:12.360
<v Speaker 3>are these marxists motivated by love or </v>
<v Speaker 3>hatred?</v>

1317
01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it love or hatred that produces $100,</v>

1318
01:11:18.831 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 3>million dead people?</v>

1319
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.173
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1320
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:26.900
<v Speaker 3>Is that enough evidence or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it's not enough evidence,</v>

1321
01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.300
<v Speaker 3>if you think to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's not enough evidence,</v>

1322
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:34.630
<v Speaker 3>it was never really given its proper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a proper try.</v>

1323
01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:37.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1324
01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:40.150
<v Speaker 3>what would have been a proper try?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1325
01:11:40.151 --> 01:11:42.970
<v Speaker 3>I always think when I hear someone say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I know what you think,</v>

1326
01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.320
<v Speaker 3>you think in your delusional arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you understand the marxist doctrines</v>

1327
01:11:49.761 --> 01:11:50.594
<v Speaker 3>better than anyone else ever has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that if you were the one </v>

1328
01:11:53.031 --> 01:11:57.370
<v Speaker 3>implementing those doctrines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have ushered in the utopia.</v>

1329
01:11:58.090 --> 01:12:01.230
<v Speaker 3>That's what you mean when you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

1330
01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:05.670
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're say,</v>

1331
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.630
<v Speaker 3>and there's an idea in the new testament</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a sin.</v>

1332
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:12.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a sin against the holy ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you commit that sand,</v>

1333
01:12:12.371 --> 01:12:17.140
<v Speaker 3>no one really knows what it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't be forgiven,</v>

1334
01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:18.490
<v Speaker 3>and I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1335
01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:19.803
<v Speaker 3>if you want a candidate for the sin </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the holy ghost and the 21st </v>

1336
01:12:22.721 --> 01:12:25.420
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the statement</v>

1337
01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:28.293
<v Speaker 3>communism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real communism was never tried with the </v>

1338
01:12:31.451 --> 01:12:35.050
<v Speaker 3>underlying idea that if you had been the</v>
<v Speaker 3>person implementing it,</v>

1339
01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:35.884
<v Speaker 3>it would have worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a pretty good contender </v>

1340
01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:41.710
<v Speaker 3>for something for which you should never</v>
<v Speaker 3>be forgiven.</v>

1341
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.863
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1342
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's marxism.</v>

1343
01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:53.260
<v Speaker 3>So let's go on to postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked a little bit about it.</v>

1344
01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothetically,</v>

1345
01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:02.653
<v Speaker 3>it's an attitude of skepticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>irony towards rejection of grand </v>

1346
01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:07.520
<v Speaker 3>narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologies and universalism.</v>

1347
01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:11.360
<v Speaker 3>CriT criticizes objective notions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>

1348
01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.190
<v Speaker 3>human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social progress,</v>

1349
01:13:13.191 --> 01:13:14.024
<v Speaker 3>absolute truth in objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's predicated on the idea that the </v>

1350
01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:18.924
<v Speaker 3>reason that you categorize especially </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that you categorize is to </v>

1351
01:13:23.011 --> 01:13:26.010
<v Speaker 3>marginalize you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Categorize,</v>

1352
01:13:26.011 --> 01:13:28.050
<v Speaker 3>to marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to obtain power.</v>

1353
01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:33.210
<v Speaker 3>Power is pretty much all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's other elements of postmodernism.</v>

1354
01:13:34.791 --> 01:13:38.600
<v Speaker 3>One of them is that human nature is </v>
<v Speaker 3>merely a social construct.</v>

1355
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.650
<v Speaker 3>See the reason for that as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned,</v>

1356
01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:44.390
<v Speaker 3>and this is a postmodern critique as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1357
01:13:44.391 --> 01:13:47.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to move the center to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>margin and the margin to the centers.</v>

1358
01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Why would you think that human nature is</v>
<v Speaker 3>only a social construct?</v>

1359
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.781
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's why.</v>

1360
01:13:52.781 --> 01:13:55.570
<v Speaker 3>It's because that means you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>construct it any way you want to.</v>

1361
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:59.760
<v Speaker 3>That was a very common idea among this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>among the communists.</v>

1362
01:13:59.761 --> 01:14:00.594
<v Speaker 3>You know they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why michael wanted to wipe out </v>

1363
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.473
<v Speaker 3>chinese history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why the red guard went around in </v>

1364
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:05.964
<v Speaker 3>China and tried to destroy everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every element of china's history prior </v>

1365
01:14:10.171 --> 01:14:14.500
<v Speaker 3>to approximately 1960 at that great </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

1366
01:14:14.501 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Thousands and thousands of years old as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1367
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:20.500
<v Speaker 3>So you could bring in the new man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what does the new man.</v>

1368
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Well it was whatever slave mile happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fantasize about,</v>

1369
01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.490
<v Speaker 3>or it was the utopian person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take your pick.</v>

1370
01:14:27.491 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 3>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take a look at the corpses,</v>

1371
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:34.240
<v Speaker 3>you can pretty much figure out which of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those two it was.</v>

1372
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.320
<v Speaker 3>So what's up with these people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These deconstructionists postmodernists.</v>

1373
01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:43.090
<v Speaker 3>What are they up to exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1374
01:14:43.091 --> 01:14:44.200
<v Speaker 3>here's the first thing</v>

1375
01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:53.380
<v Speaker 3>they came about pretty much when marxism</v>
<v Speaker 3>was no longer credible,</v>

1376
01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:57.940
<v Speaker 3>no longer tenable as an intellectual set</v>
<v Speaker 3>of intellectual propositions.</v>

1377
01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were a french intellectual,</v>

1378
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:01.953
<v Speaker 3>you had to have a lot of corpses piled </v>
<v Speaker 3>at your feet before you were willing to </v>

1379
01:15:04.241 --> 01:15:08.650
<v Speaker 3>think that you were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's an example,</v>

1380
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:09.903
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the architect of the killing </v>

1381
01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:15.280
<v Speaker 3>fields in Cambodia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't pol pot.</v>

1382
01:15:15.281 --> 01:15:17.830
<v Speaker 3>It was one of his advisors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>

1383
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:20.890
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took his phd at the bomb</v>

1384
01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.373
<v Speaker 3>and he developed the thesis in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorbonne what marxists thesis that the </v>

1385
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:32.260
<v Speaker 3>cities were parasites on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the land.</v>

1386
01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.753
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an extension of the whole </v>

1387
01:15:34.241 --> 01:15:37.960
<v Speaker 3>bourgeoisie proletarian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cities were full of bourgeois types,</v>

1388
01:15:37.961 --> 01:15:38.794
<v Speaker 3>educated and educated parasites </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially who were doing nothing but </v>

1389
01:15:42.491 --> 01:15:47.491
<v Speaker 3>stealing what was rightly the farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when he came back to Cambodia,</v>

1390
01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:54.670
<v Speaker 3>he put that into action and emptied out </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cities and put all the intellectuals</v>

1391
01:15:54.671 --> 01:15:57.070
<v Speaker 3>and the city dwellers either to death or</v>
<v Speaker 3>to work,</v>

1392
01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:57.933
<v Speaker 3>which generally resulted in death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed about one six to one quarter of </v>

1393
01:16:02.561 --> 01:16:06.100
<v Speaker 3>the population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he got his phd from the bomb</v>

1394
01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:08.453
<v Speaker 3>and that's a good story because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly how complicit the western </v>

1395
01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:13.534
<v Speaker 3>leftist intellectuals were in </v>
<v Speaker 3>facilitating the horrors of the 20th </v>

1396
01:16:17.501 --> 01:16:20.410
<v Speaker 3>century and it's not like we've learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything since then.</v>

1397
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:21.303
<v Speaker 3>Quite the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just gone underground and that's </v>

1398
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:25.623
<v Speaker 3>what I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I see when I see </v>

1399
01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:30.790
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened was</v>

1400
01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.120
<v Speaker 3>despite the affinity of western </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals for marxism,</v>

1401
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.710
<v Speaker 3>maybe because they weren't paid as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>as bankers,</v>

1402
01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:47.110
<v Speaker 3>let's say if we're being cynical about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1403
01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.273
<v Speaker 3>because I've often thought that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>paid sociologists as much as investment </v>

1404
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:53.230
<v Speaker 3>bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be capitalist very rapidly.</v>

1405
01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Which is also to say that you may </v>
<v Speaker 3>underpay intellectuals at your peril and</v>

1406
01:17:00.641 --> 01:17:01.474
<v Speaker 3>you know that's actually dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things that's </v>

1407
01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:04.174
<v Speaker 3>happening is that as the universities </v>
<v Speaker 3>have become corporatized and corrupted </v>

1408
01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:08.164
<v Speaker 3>in a variety of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more of the professors or </v>

1409
01:17:10.161 --> 01:17:11.370
<v Speaker 3>adjuncts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1410
01:17:11.371 --> 01:17:12.710
<v Speaker 3>I think it's up to 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40,</v>

1411
01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:14.240
<v Speaker 3>50 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1412
01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:15.074
<v Speaker 3>Now they've got no tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got no job security and they're </v>

1413
01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:17.804
<v Speaker 3>paid like $24,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good idea to radicalize the </v>

1414
01:17:21.391 --> 01:17:24.000
<v Speaker 3>people that are teaching your children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

1415
01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.673
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1416
01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.033
<v Speaker 3>by the end of the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much data on the catastrophic </v>

1417
01:17:35.861 --> 01:17:36.694
<v Speaker 3>failures of communism had accrued that </v>
<v Speaker 3>even the most intransigent of french </v>

1418
01:17:41.741 --> 01:17:45.310
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals had to admit that the jig </v>
<v Speaker 3>was up.</v>

1419
01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:52.290
<v Speaker 3>but that's a problem because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole ideology,</v>

1420
01:17:52.421 --> 01:17:55.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole raison d'etre.</v>

1421
01:17:55.990 --> 01:18:00.990
<v Speaker 3>He says in his terrible alberta french,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to just give that up.</v>

1422
01:18:02.081 --> 01:18:06.490
<v Speaker 3>What are you goIng to do after that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1423
01:18:06.491 --> 01:18:11.491
<v Speaker 3>what happened was postmodernism was </v>
<v Speaker 3>invented and so it's a slight of hand as</v>

1424
01:18:11.831 --> 01:18:13.910
<v Speaker 3>far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and,</v>

1425
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:16.660
<v Speaker 3>and with postmodernism identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

1426
01:18:16.661 --> 01:18:21.661
<v Speaker 3>and so the postmodern transformation is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1427
01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.670
<v Speaker 3>we're a little wrong with the working </v>
<v Speaker 3>class thing.</v>

1428
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.753
<v Speaker 3>Turns out that communists killed them </v>
<v Speaker 3>all and capitalists make them all rich </v>

1429
01:18:30.311 --> 01:18:33.100
<v Speaker 3>and that's actually exactly the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what we predicted,</v>

1430
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:38.110
<v Speaker 3>but maybe there's still a way this could</v>
<v Speaker 3>be salvaged.</v>

1431
01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:42.880
<v Speaker 3>How about if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't say working class capitalists,</v>

1432
01:18:42.881 --> 01:18:46.250
<v Speaker 3>we say oppressor or oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just.</v>

1433
01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.633
<v Speaker 3>Well just trends transformed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>terminology a bit and we'll start </v>

1434
01:18:53.611 --> 01:18:54.444
<v Speaker 3>thinking about all the other ways that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people plural pressed and then and all </v>

1435
01:18:57.231 --> 01:19:00.140
<v Speaker 3>the other ways that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressors and then we can play the same</v>

1436
01:19:00.141 --> 01:19:02.060
<v Speaker 3>damn game under a new guys</v>

1437
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:06.160
<v Speaker 3>and now lord the postmodernists were </v>
<v Speaker 3>marxists.</v>

1438
01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:07.023
<v Speaker 3>So let's make no mistake about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darren himself said that postmodernism </v>

1439
01:19:10.091 --> 01:19:12.940
<v Speaker 3>was a transformation of marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making this up.</v>

1440
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.950
<v Speaker 3>The question is why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1441
01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:15.963
<v Speaker 3>because you could say what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Postmodernism is a valid philosophical </v>

1442
01:19:18.131 --> 01:19:21.370
<v Speaker 3>school and we'll get into that for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute and they make some valid claims.</v>

1443
01:19:21.371 --> 01:19:22.390
<v Speaker 3>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1444
01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:23.224
<v Speaker 3>this is a central postmodernist claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there's an infinite number of </v>

1445
01:19:25.661 --> 01:19:26.494
<v Speaker 3>ways of interpreting the world and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually turns out to be technically </v>

1446
01:19:29.171 --> 01:19:31.960
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of the reason that we've had a very</v>

1447
01:19:31.961 --> 01:19:32.794
<v Speaker 3>difficult time building robots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ai robots that can operate in the real </v>

1448
01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:37.204
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because perceiving the real world </v>

1449
01:19:38.411 --> 01:19:42.420
<v Speaker 3>turns out to be so difficult that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>really can't figure out how human beings</v>

1450
01:19:42.421 --> 01:19:47.421
<v Speaker 3>do it because it is susceptible to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of interpretations.</v>

1451
01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:48.533
<v Speaker 3>So that's actually correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm not going to give the </v>

1452
01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:50.563
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>credit for discovering that because it </v>

1453
01:19:53.461 --> 01:19:57.180
<v Speaker 3>was discovered simultaneously in about </v>
<v Speaker 3>five disciplines at pretty much the same</v>

1454
01:19:57.181 --> 01:19:59.940
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you give the devil his due,</v>

1455
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:05.900
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the logic?</v>

1456
01:20:07.190 --> 01:20:07.861
<v Speaker 3>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1457
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 3>there's</v>

1458
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.260
<v Speaker 4>an infinite number of interpretations of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

1459
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.450
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell which of those are </v>
<v Speaker 3>canonically,</v>

1460
01:20:14.451 --> 01:20:15.680
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1461
01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:21.170
<v Speaker 3>The basic narrative of human struggle as</v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressor versus oppressed,</v>

1462
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.903
<v Speaker 3>we use category structures can constrain</v>
<v Speaker 3>that infinite number of interpretations </v>

1463
01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.080
<v Speaker 3>because the basic narrative is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressor versus oppressed.</v>

1464
01:20:30.081 --> 01:20:34.790
<v Speaker 3>We choose those narratIves that serve </v>
<v Speaker 3>our function as old pressers,</v>

1465
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:38.190
<v Speaker 4>so it's</v>

1466
01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:44.800
<v Speaker 3>deeply cynical but credible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1467
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:45.653
<v Speaker 3>and you can say if you're not naive that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are motivated by power and that </v>

1468
01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.630
<v Speaker 3>our interpretations of the world can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>self serving.</v>

1469
01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:56.493
<v Speaker 3>I mean we do want to serve ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>after all because otherwise we die and </v>

1470
01:20:59.891 --> 01:21:00.724
<v Speaker 3>so and we are centered in one place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so we can't see everything and we're </v>

1471
01:21:04.781 --> 01:21:09.781
<v Speaker 3>biased so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there is the probability that the way</v>

1472
01:21:09.941 --> 01:21:10.774
<v Speaker 3>that we look at the world will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>tainted by narrow self interest and </v>

1473
01:21:15.311 --> 01:21:20.311
<v Speaker 3>maybe even tainted by ingroup interests </v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond narrow individual self interest.</v>

1474
01:21:20.471 --> 01:21:23.260
<v Speaker 3>And we know thIs is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also not all bad.</v>

1475
01:21:23.261 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>

1476
01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.980
<v Speaker 3>a good person takes care of his or her </v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

1477
01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.980
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means you prefer your family.</v>

1478
01:21:29.981 --> 01:21:32.470
<v Speaker 3>The outsiders are going to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1479
01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:33.603
<v Speaker 3>It's a form of prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it really is like your choice of </v>

1480
01:21:37.001 --> 01:21:37.930
<v Speaker 3>sexual partners.</v>

1481
01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.890
<v Speaker 3>A form of prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1482
01:21:39.891 --> 01:21:43.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe it should be distributed in</v>
<v Speaker 3>an egalitarianism manner.</v>

1483
01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:45.123
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a lot funnier if it isn't </v>

1484
01:21:49.931 --> 01:21:52.570
<v Speaker 3>a possibility like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1485
01:21:52.571 --> 01:21:53.470
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1486
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:57.580
<v Speaker 3>in huxley's brave new world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the rule you,</v>

1487
01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.473
<v Speaker 3>you shared yourself with whoever asked </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was rude not to and you know </v>

1488
01:22:01.511 --> 01:22:05.740
<v Speaker 3>what it is actually rude not to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's seriously rude.</v>

1489
01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:07.053
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that something you want to take away </v>

1490
01:22:07.451 --> 01:22:08.284
<v Speaker 3>from people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want that to be distributed in an </v>

1491
01:22:10.121 --> 01:22:10.954
<v Speaker 3>egalitarianism fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How prejudiced are you when you choose </v>

1492
01:22:14.921 --> 01:22:19.570
<v Speaker 3>someone to sleep with you choose that </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and not everyone else.</v>

1493
01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:22.210
<v Speaker 3>It's the ultimate in prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you say,</v>

1494
01:22:22.211 --> 01:22:23.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not prejudicial.</v>

1495
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1496
01:22:24.730 --> 01:22:27.370
<v Speaker 3>Usually go for the most attractive </v>
<v Speaker 3>partner you can find.</v>

1497
01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.073
<v Speaker 3>Usually go for the healthiest partner </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go for the best person you can find </v>

1498
01:22:32.141 --> 01:22:37.141
<v Speaker 3>who could tolerate you prejudicial in </v>
<v Speaker 3>every possible way so</v>

1499
01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:41.741
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so okay,</v>

1500
01:22:41.741 --> 01:22:42.574
<v Speaker 3>so your self serving and you construct a</v>
<v Speaker 3>view of the world that serves those </v>

1501
01:22:47.411 --> 01:22:50.890
<v Speaker 3>selfserving causes and some of that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do with power.</v>

1502
01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:52.593
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean it all has to do with </v>

1503
01:22:54.551 --> 01:22:55.384
<v Speaker 3>power</v>

1504
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:56.833
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1505
01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:59.560
<v Speaker 3>It means that some of it has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

1506
01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.633
<v Speaker 3>It's like racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are kind of racist or maybe </v>

1507
01:23:03.491 --> 01:23:04.324
<v Speaker 3>people prefer their ingroup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that easy or maybe people </v>

1508
01:23:06.911 --> 01:23:07.744
<v Speaker 3>prefer the familiar to the novel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that I eat that the social </v>

1509
01:23:12.281 --> 01:23:13.114
<v Speaker 3>psychologists have come up with implicit</v>
<v Speaker 3>association test that measures </v>

1510
01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:16.653
<v Speaker 3>unconscious bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what the hell that </v>

1511
01:23:18.401 --> 01:23:20.980
<v Speaker 3>measures the people who invented that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bloody thing.</v>

1512
01:23:20.981 --> 01:23:22.630
<v Speaker 3>They know we don't know what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>measures.</v>

1513
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.943
<v Speaker 3>They know it's not reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know it's not valid enough to be </v>

1514
01:23:27.131 --> 01:23:29.470
<v Speaker 3>used as an individual diagnostic </v>
<v Speaker 3>instrument.</v>

1515
01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:30.573
<v Speaker 3>That's technically the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also know that you can't train </v>

1516
01:23:34.451 --> 01:23:35.284
<v Speaker 3>people out of their unconscious biases </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there is not much difference </v>

1517
01:23:38.021 --> 01:23:41.770
<v Speaker 3>between the unconscious bias and </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneous perception,</v>

1518
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:47.510
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've I've written to mazda and banerji.</v>

1519
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:50.740
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the inventors of the iet </v>
<v Speaker 3>several times saying,</v>

1520
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:53.920
<v Speaker 3>how about you come out in public and say</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you already know?</v>

1521
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Which is that people are misusing your </v>
<v Speaker 3>damn test.</v>

1522
01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1523
01:23:59.741 --> 01:24:00.574
<v Speaker 3>that's partly because her discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social psychology is a corrupt </v>

1524
01:24:02.801 --> 01:24:06.550
<v Speaker 3>discipline as the social psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 3>have discovered over the last four years</v>

1525
01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:10.750
<v Speaker 3>and be turning themselves inside out </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to rectify which they haven't</v>

1526
01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:13.643
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>

1527
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:14.743
<v Speaker 3>we're giving the devil his due.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an infinite number of </v>

1528
01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:17.684
<v Speaker 3>interpretations of the world and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>highly probable that you'll lay a self </v>

1529
01:24:20.411 --> 01:24:22.850
<v Speaker 3>serving one on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1530
01:24:22.851 --> 01:24:24.980
<v Speaker 3>and also that will serve the interests </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your group.</v>

1531
01:24:24.981 --> 01:24:26.840
<v Speaker 3>However you define that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1532
01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.810
<v Speaker 3>but it only accounts for a fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your behavior.</v>

1533
01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:33.410
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of other things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>work as well and you don't get to reduce</v>

1534
01:24:33.411 --> 01:24:36.290
<v Speaker 3>all human motivations to one motivation </v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

1535
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:37.720
<v Speaker 3>and then you might also ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1536
01:24:37.721 --> 01:24:40.430
<v Speaker 3>why would you want to reduce all human </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivations to power?</v>

1537
01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.473
<v Speaker 3>It's so you can use power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you can justify the use of </v>

1538
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:46.783
<v Speaker 3>power that's force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to engage in civilized </v>

1539
01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:50.984
<v Speaker 3>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to give a damn about the </v>

1540
01:24:51.741 --> 01:24:53.930
<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're not a postmodernist</v>

1541
01:24:54.170 --> 01:24:55.850
<v Speaker 3>because you don't believe in facts </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

1542
01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:56.900
<v Speaker 3>and you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1543
01:24:56.901 --> 01:24:57.640
<v Speaker 3>why don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1544
01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>

1545
01:24:59.810 --> 01:25:00.643
<v Speaker 3>Postmodernists don't believe in facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believe that the idea of fact is </v>

1546
01:25:04.941 --> 01:25:05.774
<v Speaker 3>part of the power game that's place </v>
<v Speaker 3>played by the white dominated male </v>

1547
01:25:10.161 --> 01:25:10.994
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy to impose the theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of the patriarchy on the </v>

1548
01:25:15.111 --> 01:25:18.200
<v Speaker 3>oppressors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm not making this stuff up.</v>

1549
01:25:18.230 --> 01:25:19.130
<v Speaker 3>It's embedded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1550
01:25:19.131 --> 01:25:19.964
<v Speaker 3>In theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is read it and you </v>

1551
01:25:21.771 --> 01:25:25.130
<v Speaker 3>find this out so they don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts.</v>

1552
01:25:25.131 --> 01:25:27.380
<v Speaker 3>While facts would constrain the use of </v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

1553
01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:29.630
<v Speaker 3>at least that's how it looks to me.</v>

1554
01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fine.</v>

1555
01:25:33.051 --> 01:25:33.884
<v Speaker 3>We gave the devil his due.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an infinite number of </v>

1556
01:25:35.331 --> 01:25:40.331
<v Speaker 3>interpretations and you're likely to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>bias compression algorithms on the world</v>

1557
01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.670
<v Speaker 3>and they're likely to be biased in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>favor.</v>

1558
01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:45.633
<v Speaker 3>True,</v>

1559
01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:47.993
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1560
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:51.350
<v Speaker 3>only partly true.</v>

1561
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:54.763
<v Speaker 3>And the difference between an idea log </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the thinker is that a thinker knows </v>

1562
01:25:58.131 --> 01:25:58.964
<v Speaker 3>the difference between things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>only partly true and things that are </v>

1563
01:26:02.361 --> 01:26:05.150
<v Speaker 3>completely true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things are complicated.</v>

1564
01:26:05.151 --> 01:26:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Like I like to think everything is as </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated as a military helicopter.</v>

1565
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:10.663
<v Speaker 3>You have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's eight hours of maintenance </v>

1566
01:26:12.291 --> 01:26:16.340
<v Speaker 3>to keep those things in the air for one </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour because they don't fly there rocks.</v>

1567
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.640
<v Speaker 3>They plummet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to keep them in the air</v>

1568
01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:22.970
<v Speaker 3>and they're full of parts and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know all those parts,</v>

1569
01:26:22.971 --> 01:26:26.000
<v Speaker 3>you don't go in there and monkey about </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them because just wreck it.</v>

1570
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:27.103
<v Speaker 3>And that's just a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everything is way more complicated </v>

1571
01:26:31.251 --> 01:26:33.470
<v Speaker 3>than the helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you don't just go muck about in there</v>

1572
01:26:33.471 --> 01:26:36.320
<v Speaker 3>hoping you're going to make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That isn't how it works.</v>

1573
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:37.300
<v Speaker 3>You need to be</v>

1574
01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.340
<v Speaker 4>competent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>

1575
01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:40.203
<v Speaker 4>so look,</v>

1576
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.823
<v Speaker 3>here's where the postmodernists sarong I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think there's three places and they're </v>

1577
01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:45.683
<v Speaker 3>serious errors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first is that there is an infinite </v>

1578
01:26:49.091 --> 01:26:49.924
<v Speaker 3>number of interpretations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is not an infinite number of </v>

1579
01:26:51.821 --> 01:26:52.654
<v Speaker 3>viable interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a very finite number of </v>

1580
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:57.970
<v Speaker 3>viable interpretations and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is theory.</v>

1581
01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:59.433
<v Speaker 3>I think that game theorists have already</v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrated this to some degree and </v>

1582
01:27:02.201 --> 01:27:04.750
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be built into ai systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>

1583
01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what are the constraints?</v>

1584
01:27:06.850 --> 01:27:07.661
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1585
01:27:07.661 --> 01:27:08.494
<v Speaker 3>you can't have an interpretation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>leads to immediately to your death or </v>

1586
01:27:11.531 --> 01:27:12.640
<v Speaker 3>your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1587
01:27:12.641 --> 01:27:14.530
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

1588
01:27:14.531 --> 01:27:18.280
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you got a lot of limited options,</v>

1589
01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:19.173
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to run naked across an </v>

1590
01:27:21.101 --> 01:27:25.060
<v Speaker 3>eight lane freeway at night blindfolded </v>
<v Speaker 3>because probably you'll be dead.</v>

1591
01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:28.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1592
01:27:28.031 --> 01:27:32.170
<v Speaker 3>so you might say because you're fragile </v>
<v Speaker 3>and vulnerable and mortal,</v>

1593
01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:33.243
<v Speaker 3>that there's a limited number of ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can look at the world that </v>

1594
01:27:36.101 --> 01:27:36.934
<v Speaker 3>don't result in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say death or serious damage or </v>

1595
01:27:40.031 --> 01:27:41.860
<v Speaker 3>agony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad thing.</v>

1596
01:27:41.861 --> 01:27:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Agony is a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people agreed on that.</v>

1597
01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.260
<v Speaker 3>So you're constrained by pain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety.</v>

1598
01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:48.213
<v Speaker 3>At least your interpretations are </v>
<v Speaker 3>constrained by pain and anxiety and you </v>

1599
01:27:51.881 --> 01:27:56.290
<v Speaker 3>know you can make pain worse or better </v>
<v Speaker 3>by thinking about it to some degree,</v>

1600
01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:00.220
<v Speaker 3>but only to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When push comes to shove,</v>

1601
01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.290
<v Speaker 3>pain is your master.</v>

1602
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a big constraint.</v>

1603
01:28:05.491 --> 01:28:07.360
<v Speaker 3>That's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big constraint.</v>

1604
01:28:07.710 --> 01:28:08.543
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the constraints are worse than that </v>

1605
01:28:09.631 --> 01:28:11.780
<v Speaker 3>because not only do you not</v>

1606
01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:13.953
<v Speaker 3>get to have an interpretation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world that produces anxiety and </v>

1607
01:28:16.161 --> 01:28:16.994
<v Speaker 3>suffering right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't get to have an </v>

1608
01:28:18.891 --> 01:28:19.724
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of the world that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>iterated across time produces pain and </v>

1609
01:28:23.391 --> 01:28:25.370
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's,</v>

1610
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.500
<v Speaker 3>that's a big problem because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of.</v>

1611
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.513
<v Speaker 3>You could go out tonight and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself blind drunk on cocaine and </v>

1612
01:28:31.371 --> 01:28:33.800
<v Speaker 3>sleep with hookers and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that,</v>

1613
01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.690
<v Speaker 3>maybe that'd be a good night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1614
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:37.940
<v Speaker 3>you might not think about it being so </v>
<v Speaker 3>good tomorrow,</v>

1615
01:28:37.941 --> 01:28:41.960
<v Speaker 3>but then maybe your dad of aids in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year or maybe you're addicted to cocaine</v>

1616
01:28:41.961 --> 01:28:44.330
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you're a street alcoholic or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1617
01:28:44.331 --> 01:28:47.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like as an iterable game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a downhill.</v>

1618
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:50.330
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is you play iterated </v>
<v Speaker 3>games.</v>

1619
01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.400
<v Speaker 3>You don't play one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you play iterated games.</v>

1620
01:28:52.401 --> 01:28:56.540
<v Speaker 3>And so your interpretation of the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be one that will sustain multiple</v>

1621
01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:57.374
<v Speaker 3>iterations across time because you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to worry about 40 year old you and 60 </v>

1622
01:29:02.191 --> 01:29:03.150
<v Speaker 3>year old you.</v>

1623
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:04.343
<v Speaker 3>And that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of use stretched over a </v>

1624
01:29:06.481 --> 01:29:07.314
<v Speaker 3>long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's worse than that because it's </v>

1625
01:29:09.331 --> 01:29:12.390
<v Speaker 3>not just you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you and your family,</v>

1626
01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not only so,</v>

1627
01:29:14.281 --> 01:29:17.670
<v Speaker 3>not only do you have to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself now in a manner that allows you</v>

1628
01:29:17.671 --> 01:29:22.470
<v Speaker 3>to take care of yourself when you're 40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to take care of yourself now in</v>

1629
01:29:22.471 --> 01:29:27.270
<v Speaker 3>a manner that takes care of you when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 40 so that other people are happy</v>

1630
01:29:27.271 --> 01:29:28.104
<v Speaker 3>to have you around now and continually </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that they'll cooperate and compete </v>

1631
01:29:31.921 --> 01:29:32.754
<v Speaker 3>with you in a positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's getting ridiculously </v>

1632
01:29:36.421 --> 01:29:37.254
<v Speaker 3>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just you now when you in the </v>

1633
01:29:38.461 --> 01:29:39.294
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's you surrounded by other people </v>

1634
01:29:41.011 --> 01:29:41.844
<v Speaker 3>doing the same thing now and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future and there's a lot of other </v>

1635
01:29:44.191 --> 01:29:47.100
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can even just be you and your family,</v>

1636
01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1637
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:52.740
<v Speaker 3>like the psychopathic burglar mob that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just not going to go so well,</v>

1638
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:53.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1639
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Other people are going to object and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world's going to object and so fine.</v>

1640
01:29:57.511 --> 01:29:59.520
<v Speaker 3>There's an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretations,</v>

1641
01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:02.460
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't mean there's an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of viable interpretations.</v>

1642
01:30:02.461 --> 01:30:04.050
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are hardly any.</v>

1643
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:07.610
<v Speaker 3>There are hardly any playable games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now piaget,</v>

1644
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:08.743
<v Speaker 3>piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the developmental psychologist who's a </v>

1645
01:30:09.841 --> 01:30:10.674
<v Speaker 3>very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he pointed out something very </v>

1646
01:30:12.781 --> 01:30:13.890
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1647
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.903
<v Speaker 3>now imagine you ran a set of iterated </v>
<v Speaker 3>games as a competition and in one </v>

1648
01:30:19.201 --> 01:30:22.590
<v Speaker 3>iterated game the rule was you bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>well do what I tell you to,</v>

1649
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:24.780
<v Speaker 3>and the other one is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1650
01:30:24.781 --> 01:30:27.060
<v Speaker 3>we'll all get together and decide how </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do this.</v>

1651
01:30:27.061 --> 01:30:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we run the competition.</v>

1652
01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>piaget's claim is you do what I tell you</v>

1653
01:30:32.221 --> 01:30:33.054
<v Speaker 3>fails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is I have to </v>

1654
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:38.130
<v Speaker 3>impose force in order to keep you </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperating.</v>

1655
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:40.890
<v Speaker 3>And the imposition of forest is a cost.</v>

1656
01:30:41.190 --> 01:30:42.023
<v Speaker 3>It's an efficiency cost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And across time that efficiency cost is </v>

1657
01:30:45.181 --> 01:30:48.420
<v Speaker 3>going to multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the equilibrated state solution,</v>

1658
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:51.090
<v Speaker 3>which is the one where we all agree it </v>
<v Speaker 3>winds.</v>

1659
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:54.840
<v Speaker 3>Now that's worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can think about that locally.</v>

1660
01:30:54.841 --> 01:30:56.820
<v Speaker 3>So you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to organize your family,</v>

1661
01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.073
<v Speaker 3>you have a little family conference </v>
<v Speaker 3>about who's doing what in the household </v>

1662
01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:01.463
<v Speaker 3>and what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want peace and harmony and an </v>

1663
01:31:03.571 --> 01:31:05.730
<v Speaker 3>iterated game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get everybody to say,</v>

1664
01:31:05.731 --> 01:31:06.564
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the tasks and we they have to be </v>

1665
01:31:08.491 --> 01:31:10.200
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have to agree on that,</v>

1666
01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.041
<v Speaker 3>and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1667
01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:11.874
<v Speaker 3>which task would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to some how about you and you </v>

1668
01:31:14.581 --> 01:31:18.780
<v Speaker 3>know which task would you do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody agrees and then you say,</v>

1669
01:31:18.781 --> 01:31:19.614
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you can come up with a better </v>

1670
01:31:20.251 --> 01:31:22.050
<v Speaker 3>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the one we're going to go with,</v>

1671
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:25.800
<v Speaker 3>and then people can be a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentful and angry about the conditions</v>

1672
01:31:25.801 --> 01:31:26.634
<v Speaker 3>of existence where they have to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can't really blame that on </v>

1673
01:31:29.281 --> 01:31:32.550
<v Speaker 3>anyone else and maybe that's the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution you could come up with.</v>

1674
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:35.130
<v Speaker 3>And that was pIaget's idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>equilibrium state.</v>

1675
01:31:35.131 --> 01:31:40.131
<v Speaker 3>It was like it's a voluntary agreement </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be iterated across time.</v>

1676
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.460
<v Speaker 3>That works at multiple levels of social </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>

1677
01:31:45.450 --> 01:31:46.980
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a serious,</v>

1678
01:31:46.981 --> 01:31:49.140
<v Speaker 3>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>serious set of constraints.</v>

1679
01:31:49.530 --> 01:31:50.700
<v Speaker 3>And piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1680
01:31:50.710 --> 01:31:54.570
<v Speaker 3>was looking for a way to reconcile </v>
<v Speaker 3>science and religion.</v>

1681
01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:55.553
<v Speaker 3>He was looking for biological origin to </v>
<v Speaker 3>morality and he thought he found it in </v>

1682
01:31:59.171 --> 01:32:02.320
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the state and it's even </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeper than that.</v>

1683
01:32:02.321 --> 01:32:07.321
<v Speaker 3>So imagine this equilibrium state ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually there's something to it that if</v>

1684
01:32:07.571 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 3>you set the the state up property,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will iterate across time so long that</v>

1685
01:32:11.981 --> 01:32:14.140
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a permanent part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1686
01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:17.080
<v Speaker 3>Hierarchy is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what the hierarchy is.</v>

1687
01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:22.200
<v Speaker 3>Hierarchies are 350 million years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not the patriarchal invention of</v>

1688
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 3>white european christian males in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last 300 years.</v>

1689
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:29.770
<v Speaker 3>There are 350 million years old.</v>

1690
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:30.783
<v Speaker 3>They're stable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're stable solutions to this </v>

1691
01:32:33.071 --> 01:32:33.904
<v Speaker 3>iterated game problem and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>around so long that we're actually </v>

1692
01:32:36.101 --> 01:32:36.934
<v Speaker 3>adapted to the and that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason we have archetypal </v>

1693
01:32:39.431 --> 01:32:40.264
<v Speaker 3>representations of the social structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and then we also have archetypal </v>

1694
01:32:43.721 --> 01:32:48.721
<v Speaker 3>representations of the relationship of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual to the social structure.</v>

1695
01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:49.953
<v Speaker 3>Your job as an individual in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the social structure is </v>

1696
01:32:53.291 --> 01:32:58.291
<v Speaker 3>to embody the social structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also to serve as as its eyes and its</v>

1697
01:32:58.511 --> 01:33:03.511
<v Speaker 3>mouth so that can update itself when </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily so you take on the mantle of</v>

1698
01:33:04.511 --> 01:33:06.310
<v Speaker 3>your father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1699
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:09.940
<v Speaker 3>but he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the path he can't see.</v>

1700
01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:13.060
<v Speaker 3>You can see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you take the structure that's already</v>

1701
01:33:13.061 --> 01:33:13.894
<v Speaker 3>there and you modify it where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary and that modification process </v>

1702
01:33:17.231 --> 01:33:18.064
<v Speaker 3>is necessary or the state becomes too </v>
<v Speaker 3>static and collapses and that's why the </v>

1703
01:33:21.581 --> 01:33:22.414
<v Speaker 3>state has to be subordinate to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual and that's what western </v>

1704
01:33:25.031 --> 01:33:29.110
<v Speaker 3>culture has discovered and we can't just</v>
<v Speaker 3>let it go.</v>

1705
01:33:29.111 --> 01:33:30.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The logos,</v>

1706
01:33:30.491 --> 01:33:31.324
<v Speaker 3>that's a big idea and you'd want to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere where you want to live </v>

1707
01:33:35.051 --> 01:33:37.480
<v Speaker 3>somewhere where the individual is </v>
<v Speaker 3>subordinate to the state.</v>

1708
01:33:37.481 --> 01:33:38.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1709
01:33:38.170 --> 01:33:40.030
<v Speaker 3>go right ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of places like that,</v>

1710
01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:42.190
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emigrate go there.</v>

1711
01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent of the world's countries </v>
<v Speaker 3>are like that.</v>

1712
01:33:45.490 --> 01:33:46.900
<v Speaker 3>If you want to live like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1713
01:33:46.901 --> 01:33:51.250
<v Speaker 3>go find out what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't see immigration going there.</v>

1714
01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:52.210
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

1715
01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:55.083
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's a big mistake that the </v>

1716
01:33:56.010 --> 01:33:58.480
<v Speaker 3>postmodernist made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not trivial.</v>

1717
01:33:58.481 --> 01:34:00.580
<v Speaker 3>That's a big mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the only one.</v>

1718
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:02.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another one.</v>

1719
01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.510
<v Speaker 3>They don't like inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1720
01:34:04.511 --> 01:34:05.344
<v Speaker 3>who does?</v>

1721
01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:10.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm against poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1722
01:34:10.351 --> 01:34:13.020
<v Speaker 3>that's like classic protest sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1723
01:34:13.021 --> 01:34:17.190
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm against torture.</v>

1724
01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:18.053
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get any brownie points for </v>

1725
01:34:21.601 --> 01:34:22.434
<v Speaker 3>being against poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one in their right mind is for </v>

1726
01:34:25.051 --> 01:34:28.160
<v Speaker 3>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1727
01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:33.120
<v Speaker 3>you ever watch the simpsons?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see the republican party in the</v>

1728
01:34:33.121 --> 01:34:33.954
<v Speaker 3>simpsons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all meet in an old haunted castle </v>

1729
01:34:35.581 --> 01:34:36.414
<v Speaker 3>at night with like lightening bolts </v>
<v Speaker 3>going off and there's a vampire and a </v>

1730
01:34:38.941 --> 01:34:39.774
<v Speaker 3>crazy texts and then even the simpson </v>
<v Speaker 3>republicans don't sit around in the </v>

1731
01:34:43.921 --> 01:34:46.170
<v Speaker 3>haunted tower at midnight saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1732
01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:51.200
<v Speaker 3>we need more poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's an interesting thing.</v>

1733
01:34:56.651 --> 01:34:57.484
<v Speaker 3>So one of the postmodernist claims is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that diversity is necessary and they </v>

1734
01:35:00.681 --> 01:35:05.360
<v Speaker 3>make it racial and they make it sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They may get ethnIc and all of that.</v>

1735
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.760
<v Speaker 3>That's actually technically incorrect by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>

1736
01:35:07.761 --> 01:35:08.594
<v Speaker 3>because</v>

1737
01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:10.933
<v Speaker 3>I study individual differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are the differences between </v>

1738
01:35:13.551 --> 01:35:16.190
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the literature.</v>

1739
01:35:16.191 --> 01:35:19.930
<v Speaker 3>So you know about James Morris memo </v>
<v Speaker 3>right from google.</v>

1740
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 3>He wrote that partly because he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching my videos,</v>

1741
01:35:22.131 --> 01:35:22.964
<v Speaker 3>which is why he wanted me to interview </v>
<v Speaker 3>him and I'm a believer that there are </v>

1742
01:35:26.541 --> 01:35:27.374
<v Speaker 3>biological differences in temperament </v>
<v Speaker 3>between men and women apart from the </v>

1743
01:35:30.471 --> 01:35:31.304
<v Speaker 3>other obvious differences and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're actually not trivial and that </v>

1744
01:35:34.891 --> 01:35:35.724
<v Speaker 3>they maximizing the societies that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most have moved farthest to </v>

1745
01:35:39.441 --> 01:35:43.580
<v Speaker 3>producing egalitarian states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scandinavian countries,</v>

1746
01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:44.563
<v Speaker 3>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason for that is that there's two </v>

1747
01:35:45.471 --> 01:35:47.420
<v Speaker 3>reasons why men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different temperament.</v>

1748
01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:48.283
<v Speaker 3>One is biological and the other is </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental and if you remove the </v>

1749
01:35:51.501 --> 01:35:53.360
<v Speaker 3>environmental variation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you do,</v>

1750
01:35:53.361 --> 01:35:54.194
<v Speaker 3>if you make the state egalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you maximize the genetic variation and </v>

1751
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:59.143
<v Speaker 3>that's been demonstrated in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific literature over about four </v>

1752
01:36:01.821 --> 01:36:02.654
<v Speaker 3>decades and no one wanted it or hope for</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and they weren't biased and looking </v>

1753
01:36:06.381 --> 01:36:07.214
<v Speaker 3>for it because that was exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite of what social scientists </v>

1754
01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:10.124
<v Speaker 3>wanted to find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>BecAuse social scientists lean heavily </v>

1755
01:36:11.901 --> 01:36:12.734
<v Speaker 3>to the left and what they wanted to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>was you flatten out the state so that </v>

1756
01:36:15.831 --> 01:36:19.670
<v Speaker 3>everyone has equal opportunity and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between people disappear.</v>

1757
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:20.623
<v Speaker 3>That is not what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The opposite happened that wasn't wrong </v>

1758
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:27.530
<v Speaker 3>and no one was happy about it and no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one's happy about it.</v>

1759
01:36:27.531 --> 01:36:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Now you can actually tell when you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered something in a social science</v>

1760
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:37.030
<v Speaker 3>because you're not happy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1761
01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:43.563
<v Speaker 3>if you take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say there's a big difference </v>

1762
01:36:44.951 --> 01:36:47.440
<v Speaker 3>between men and women in terms of trait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>agreeableness,</v>

1763
01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.500
<v Speaker 3>compassion and politeness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On average,</v>

1764
01:36:50.501 --> 01:36:54.820
<v Speaker 3>women are more agreeable than men and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference is approximately this.</v>

1765
01:36:54.821 --> 01:36:58.060
<v Speaker 3>If you take random pairs of men and </v>
<v Speaker 3>women out of the population,</v>

1766
01:36:58.090 --> 01:37:00.730
<v Speaker 3>let's say you had to make a bet on who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was more agreeable.</v>

1767
01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:04.120
<v Speaker 3>if you bet that it was the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be right 60 percent of the time,</v>

1768
01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.780
<v Speaker 3>well that's not that much means you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1769
01:37:07.781 --> 01:37:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Forty percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's almost 50 percent of the time.</v>

1770
01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.260
<v Speaker 3>So this is a big difference by social </v>
<v Speaker 3>science standards,</v>

1771
01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:17.050
<v Speaker 3>but that's the magnitude of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

1772
01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.700
<v Speaker 3>There are some differences that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger,</v>

1773
01:37:18.701 --> 01:37:22.120
<v Speaker 3>like the difference between men and </v>
<v Speaker 3>women's interest in people versus things</v>

1774
01:37:22.121 --> 01:37:24.640
<v Speaker 3>is actually bigger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the biggest difference we know,</v>

1775
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:27.700
<v Speaker 3>but it's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say the agreeableness difference,</v>

1776
01:37:27.701 --> 01:37:28.534
<v Speaker 3>but still they the shared attributes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women far outweigh the </v>

1777
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:36.423
<v Speaker 3>attributes that differentiate them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you could ask are there more </v>

1778
01:37:40.091 --> 01:37:42.340
<v Speaker 3>differences with any groups or between </v>
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>

1779
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Now the postmodern answer to that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>between them.</v>

1780
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:49.840
<v Speaker 3>That's why you need diversity by group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1781
01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:50.733
<v Speaker 3>That's why you need different races.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you need different </v>

1782
01:37:52.151 --> 01:37:54.850
<v Speaker 3>ethnicities and sexual preferences and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

1783
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong.</v>

1784
01:37:58.130 --> 01:38:00.710
<v Speaker 3>There's more differences within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups than there is between them.</v>

1785
01:38:00.711 --> 01:38:03.950
<v Speaker 3>You don't get diversity by crossing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>

1786
01:38:03.951 --> 01:38:07.400
<v Speaker 3>You get diversity by group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by selecting across individuals.</v>

1787
01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:08.533
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that there is more differences </v>

1788
01:38:10.341 --> 01:38:11.174
<v Speaker 3>between groups and there is between </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals is actually the fundamental </v>

1789
01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:15.013
<v Speaker 3>racist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the fundamental racist idea which </v>

1790
01:38:17.751 --> 01:38:18.351
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1791
01:38:18.351 --> 01:38:19.184
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're asian oriental to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>the old word to discriminate the one </v>

1792
01:38:25.341 --> 01:38:30.230
<v Speaker 3>type of asian say from the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're so different from me that there's</v>

1793
01:38:30.231 --> 01:38:31.064
<v Speaker 3>no overlap between our groups and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>also so different and there's so little </v>

1794
01:38:35.031 --> 01:38:39.140
<v Speaker 3>difference within your group that now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I know that you're not me,</v>

1795
01:38:39.141 --> 01:38:41.480
<v Speaker 3>you're not one of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually know what you're like,</v>

1796
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:45.740
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technically that's incorrect.</v>

1797
01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:48.380
<v Speaker 3>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That isn't how you get diversity.</v>

1798
01:38:52.930 --> 01:38:53.763
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity is actually necessary because </v>

1799
01:38:55.001 --> 01:38:55.834
<v Speaker 3>people differ in intelligence and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different temperament and the different </v>

1800
01:38:57.881 --> 01:38:58.714
<v Speaker 3>skills and so you actually need </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity because otherwise you can't </v>

1801
01:39:01.091 --> 01:39:02.920
<v Speaker 3>take advantage of all those differences,</v>

1802
01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:05.583
<v Speaker 3>so you need diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you need genuine diversity and like </v>

1803
01:39:09.850 --> 01:39:10.683
<v Speaker 3>what would genuine diversity mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're trying to put together a work </v>

1804
01:39:12.881 --> 01:39:14.110
<v Speaker 3>team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want enough,</v>

1805
01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:15.003
<v Speaker 3>you want people have sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity so that they more or less so </v>

1806
01:39:18.521 --> 01:39:19.354
<v Speaker 3>that you gathered together the </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate talent to produce the </v>

1807
01:39:23.051 --> 01:39:25.900
<v Speaker 3>implement that's necessary to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly in the world.</v>

1808
01:39:25.930 --> 01:39:29.950
<v Speaker 3>That's a competence marker because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise your business is going to fail</v>

1809
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:34.690
<v Speaker 3>and so the proper diversity with regards</v>
<v Speaker 3>to employment is the diversity that</v>

1810
01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:39.280
<v Speaker 3>meets the requirements of the business </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

1811
01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:45.210
<v Speaker 3>obviously that's why you try to hire </v>
<v Speaker 3>people carefully and not randomly.</v>

1812
01:39:45.851 --> 01:39:46.684
<v Speaker 3>Let's say</v>

1813
01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:52.620
<v Speaker 3>third error,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first errors.</v>

1814
01:39:52.621 --> 01:39:55.870
<v Speaker 3>There's only a finite number of valid </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation.</v>

1815
01:39:55.871 --> 01:39:56.704
<v Speaker 3>Second error is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are real differences between </v>

1816
01:40:00.211 --> 01:40:01.044
<v Speaker 3>groups of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's more difference within the </v>

1817
01:40:02.101 --> 01:40:03.120
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then between them.</v>

1818
01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:08.190
<v Speaker 3>Third difference is social status and </v>
<v Speaker 3>payment.</v>

1819
01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:09.203
<v Speaker 3>Especially in a free democratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalist society is based more on </v>

1820
01:40:12.391 --> 01:40:15.810
<v Speaker 3>competence than on</v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

1821
01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:16.973
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would say that when a person in a </v>

1822
01:40:19.801 --> 01:40:24.801
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy starts to act like their </v>
<v Speaker 3>position entitles them to power,</v>

1823
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:26.423
<v Speaker 3>then that hierarchy has become corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvey weinstein is a good example of </v>

1824
01:40:30.361 --> 01:40:32.130
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious.</v>

1825
01:40:32.131 --> 01:40:35.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like he acts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>acted like a tyrant.</v>

1826
01:40:35.191 --> 01:40:37.860
<v Speaker 3>What happened to him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

1827
01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Not good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he did was not good,</v>

1828
01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:44.310
<v Speaker 3>but it's an indication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's revealed.</v>

1829
01:40:44.311 --> 01:40:48.930
<v Speaker 3>It's an indication that that misuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's competent,</v>

1830
01:40:48.990 --> 01:40:52.860
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets to have position because we need</v>

1831
01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:53.733
<v Speaker 3>people who are competent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean you get to turn </v>

1832
01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:56.290
<v Speaker 3>into a tyrant.</v>

1833
01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.273
<v Speaker 3>If you turn it into a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that overshadows your competence </v>

1834
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.903
<v Speaker 3>and you go as the definition of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>functioning state and our state </v>

1835
01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:07.690
<v Speaker 3>essentially functions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not perfect.</v>

1836
01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:11.710
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but compared to what?</v>

1837
01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:15.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the issue compared to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothetical marxist utopia.</v>

1838
01:41:16.210 --> 01:41:17.043
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to your hypothetical marxist </v>

1839
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:21.430
<v Speaker 3>utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're living in auschwitz,</v>

1840
01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:22.503
<v Speaker 3>but you're what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your actual marxist utopia is </v>

1841
01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.393
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're not listening to that </v>

1842
01:41:30.611 --> 01:41:31.444
<v Speaker 3>comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to take a look at what we </v>

1843
01:41:32.681 --> 01:41:33.514
<v Speaker 3>have and we're going to compare it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>other places that actually existed in </v>

1844
01:41:37.061 --> 01:41:40.630
<v Speaker 3>time and geographically and by those </v>
<v Speaker 3>criteria.</v>

1845
01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:43.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there another time you'd rather live?</v>

1846
01:41:44.850 --> 01:41:48.090
<v Speaker 3>there's another place you'd rather live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the real place and real time.</v>

1847
01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:50.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean you want to live back in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>95.</v>

1848
01:41:50.371 --> 01:41:51.204
<v Speaker 3>Even in the western world where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>average person lived on less than a </v>

1849
01:41:53.281 --> 01:41:54.930
<v Speaker 3>dollar a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In today's money,</v>

1850
01:41:56.010 --> 01:41:59.910
<v Speaker 3>you want to live like those coal miners </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the answer to.</v>

1851
01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:01.860
<v Speaker 3>That's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have any sense,</v>

1852
01:42:01.861 --> 01:42:02.694
<v Speaker 3>you should have some gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another problem with the </v>

1853
01:42:04.981 --> 01:42:08.340
<v Speaker 3>postmodern neo marxists like zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero,</v>

1854
01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:11.250
<v Speaker 3>zero gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>

1855
01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.290
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more pressed.</v>

1856
01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:15.983
<v Speaker 3>Of course you're oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not oppressed by the </v>

1857
01:42:18.091 --> 01:42:19.800
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy for god's sake,</v>

1858
01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:25.930
<v Speaker 3>so you have status in the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>

1859
01:42:25.931 --> 01:42:27.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a reward to your.</v>

1860
01:42:28.130 --> 01:42:30.280
<v Speaker 3>You're a high status person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a reward.</v>

1861
01:42:30.281 --> 01:42:34.210
<v Speaker 3>The reward should be shared equally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a badge of merit that you get.</v>

1862
01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:38.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the reason that in a capitalist</v>

1863
01:42:38.531 --> 01:42:39.364
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>filthy selfish capitalists put you in a </v>

1864
01:42:42.311 --> 01:42:46.000
<v Speaker 3>position so they can extract maximum </v>
<v Speaker 3>productivity from you,</v>

1865
01:42:46.990 --> 01:42:49.150
<v Speaker 3>and that's exactly why you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get paid,</v>

1866
01:42:49.151 --> 01:42:50.770
<v Speaker 3>you get paid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you keep working.</v>

1867
01:42:50.771 --> 01:42:51.604
<v Speaker 3>Why do we want you to work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>BecAuse your work is actually valuable </v>

1868
01:42:54.161 --> 01:42:57.310
<v Speaker 3>to us and so we're going to pay you so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't quit.</v>

1869
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:59.650
<v Speaker 3>It's not a reward because you're a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

1870
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.650
<v Speaker 3>it's not a privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what It is.</v>

1871
01:43:02.651 --> 01:43:05.080
<v Speaker 3>You don't hand those things out like </v>
<v Speaker 3>merit badges.</v>

1872
01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.153
<v Speaker 3>That's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The society is setup on selfish </v>

1873
01:43:08.381 --> 01:43:09.214
<v Speaker 3>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We pay people who are competent so they </v>

1874
01:43:11.111 --> 01:43:14.320
<v Speaker 3>won't stop striving because we want what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can produce.</v>

1875
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:18.310
<v Speaker 3>So you don't just distribute that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's a gift.</v>

1876
01:43:18.311 --> 01:43:20.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a gift at all.</v>

1877
01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:22.540
<v Speaker 3>So that's another place where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1878
01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:24.213
<v Speaker 3>Social status and payment is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of the selfish desire of </v>

1879
01:43:27.881 --> 01:43:31.510
<v Speaker 3>individuals and the group to extract </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources of intellect,</v>

1880
01:43:31.511 --> 01:43:32.344
<v Speaker 3>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and industriousness from those who </v>

1881
01:43:34.601 --> 01:43:37.630
<v Speaker 3>possess them in excess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1882
01:43:37.631 --> 01:43:39.790
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not 100 percent like that.</v>

1883
01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:42.070
<v Speaker 3>There's the incompetent people who rise </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the top,</v>

1884
01:43:42.130 --> 01:43:42.963
<v Speaker 3>you can fool people and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulate them and you can act like a </v>

1885
01:43:45.131 --> 01:43:49.030
<v Speaker 3>tyrant and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might say maybe the system is like 30</v>

1886
01:43:49.031 --> 01:43:51.440
<v Speaker 3>percent warped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1887
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:52.303
<v Speaker 3>It's not much more than that because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can account for people's success across </v>

1888
01:43:55.101 --> 01:43:57.980
<v Speaker 3>life by looking at their individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences,</v>

1889
01:43:57.981 --> 01:43:58.980
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>con,</v>

1890
01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:01.490
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional stability,</v>

1891
01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:02.443
<v Speaker 3>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do a pretty good job of </v>

1892
01:44:04.221 --> 01:44:07.580
<v Speaker 3>predicting their trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's error,</v>

1893
01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:08.870
<v Speaker 3>some of its health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1894
01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:12.320
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes you've got what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need but you get cut off at the knees or</v>

1895
01:44:12.321 --> 01:44:15.660
<v Speaker 3>your family members do or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some tragic thing befalls you.</v>

1896
01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:17.233
<v Speaker 3>There's a randomness in the system that </v>
<v Speaker 3>accounts for a fair bit of it and then </v>

1897
01:44:20.091 --> 01:44:23.090
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain amount of corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>

1898
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:27.200
<v Speaker 3>But not so much that the lights go off.</v>

1899
01:44:29.150 --> 01:44:33.140
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What time is it?</v>

1900
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:37.123
<v Speaker 3>Eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>15.</v>

1901
01:44:37.210 --> 01:44:41.000
<v Speaker 3>And I started when.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

1902
01:44:41.001 --> 01:44:44.120
<v Speaker 3>it's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>6:30.</v>

1903
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:45.530
<v Speaker 3>I should stop them.</v>

1904
01:44:51.730 --> 01:44:56.730
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1905
01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:04.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go for five more minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll wrap this up.</v>

1906
01:45:04.021 --> 01:45:07.090
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk about intersectionality </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1907
01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:12.500
<v Speaker 3>and white privilege a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1908
01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.680
<v Speaker 3>So I first said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1909
01:45:17.710 --> 01:45:20.860
<v Speaker 3>we analyzed marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we analyzed postmodernism.</v>

1910
01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:23.473
<v Speaker 3>I suggested that postmodernism was a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the marxist to keep going under a </v>

1911
01:45:26.871 --> 01:45:27.704
<v Speaker 3>new guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suggested that marxism was </v>

1912
01:45:29.601 --> 01:45:33.860
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally based on hatred rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than sympathy and an empathy.</v>

1913
01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:38.240
<v Speaker 3>I suggested that the corpses were the </v>
<v Speaker 3>the evidence for that.</v>

1914
01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:42.290
<v Speaker 3>I told you why I think postmodernism is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally wrong.</v>

1915
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.843
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1916
01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:48.170
<v Speaker 3>now I want to talk to you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>about white privilege.</v>

1917
01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:51.443
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1918
01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:55.180
<v Speaker 3>the first thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I haven't got this quite figured out</v>

1919
01:45:55.181 --> 01:45:56.014
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't quite figure out why the </v>

1920
01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:00.750
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists made the canonical </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinctions.</v>

1921
01:46:00.751 --> 01:46:03.630
<v Speaker 3>They've made race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethnicity,</v>

1922
01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:06.930
<v Speaker 3>sexual proclivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual,</v>

1923
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:07.823
<v Speaker 3>gender identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say those are four dimensions </v>

1924
01:46:10.611 --> 01:46:11.444
<v Speaker 3>along which people vary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a very large number of </v>

1925
01:46:13.701 --> 01:46:15.770
<v Speaker 3>dimensions along which people vary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1926
01:46:15.771 --> 01:46:19.440
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given that there's an infinite number of</v>

1927
01:46:19.441 --> 01:46:20.274
<v Speaker 3>ways of interpreting the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could immediately pointed out if </v>

1928
01:46:22.721 --> 01:46:25.780
<v Speaker 3>there's an infinite number of dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 3>along which people vary.</v>

1929
01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:26.913
<v Speaker 3>And so then the postmodern question is </v>
<v Speaker 3>why would you privilege some of those </v>

1930
01:46:29.261 --> 01:46:31.540
<v Speaker 3>dimensions over the other?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say,</v>

1931
01:46:31.541 --> 01:46:32.374
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it sustains your bloody marxist </v>

1932
01:46:33.671 --> 01:46:34.840
<v Speaker 3>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>

1933
01:46:34.841 --> 01:46:37.330
<v Speaker 3>But you're not going to say that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it marginalizes,</v>

1934
01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:38.373
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've marginalized that so you can </v>

1935
01:46:39.461 --> 01:46:40.294
<v Speaker 3>ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's one of the fun things about </v>

1936
01:46:42.710 --> 01:46:43.543
<v Speaker 3>organism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>

1937
01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:48.290
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a very vulgar image in my mind,</v>

1938
01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:53.280
<v Speaker 3>but</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't share that with you,</v>

1939
01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:56.850
<v Speaker 3>but you can infer it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's some ways people differ.</v>

1940
01:46:56.860 --> 01:46:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>temperament,</v>

1941
01:46:58.111 --> 01:47:00.300
<v Speaker 3>geography,</v>
<v Speaker 3>historical time.</v>

1942
01:47:00.301 --> 01:47:03.060
<v Speaker 3>You live now in 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Attractiveness.</v>

1943
01:47:03.061 --> 01:47:04.710
<v Speaker 3>That's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one.</v>

1944
01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:07.290
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you imagine?</v>

1945
01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:08.220
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>

1946
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:10.220
<v Speaker 5>You won't.</v>

1947
01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:14.300
<v Speaker 3>We won't go there either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Youth eat it's advantageous to be young.</v>

1948
01:47:14.301 --> 01:47:16.550
<v Speaker 3>You've got potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's advantageous to be old.</v>

1949
01:47:16.551 --> 01:47:17.960
<v Speaker 3>You've got wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Health,</v>

1950
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:21.470
<v Speaker 3>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sex women have advantages.</v>

1951
01:47:21.471 --> 01:47:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Men have advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe one has more than the other.</v>

1952
01:47:24.111 --> 01:47:24.944
<v Speaker 3>It's not self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women live about eight years longer </v>

1953
01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:28.100
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Multiorgasmic,</v>

1954
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:35.120
<v Speaker 3>athleticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1955
01:47:35.121 --> 01:47:36.610
<v Speaker 3>family structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>friendship,</v>

1956
01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.473
<v Speaker 3>education.</v>

1957
01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Well then there's the classic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1958
01:47:41.911 --> 01:47:43.170
<v Speaker 3>postmodern once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>

1959
01:47:43.171 --> 01:47:44.160
<v Speaker 3>ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

1960
01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Why not those other dimensions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>variation.</v>

1961
01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:51.120
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence that they're less </v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

1962
01:47:51.121 --> 01:47:51.954
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's quite a bit of evidence that </v>

1963
01:47:52.621 --> 01:47:55.560
<v Speaker 3>they're are more important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like why not consider them?</v>

1964
01:47:55.770 --> 01:47:56.603
<v Speaker 3>Then you get intersectionality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the things that's really </v>

1965
01:47:58.591 --> 01:47:59.424
<v Speaker 3>comical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think because the postmodernists </v>

1966
01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:03.390
<v Speaker 3>identity politics types actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized this.</v>

1967
01:48:03.391 --> 01:48:04.320
<v Speaker 3>They thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1968
01:48:04.321 --> 01:48:05.580
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>race and gender.</v>

1969
01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if you're.</v>

1970
01:48:08.670 --> 01:48:10.580
<v Speaker 3>What if you're a black woman?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1971
01:48:10.581 --> 01:48:11.414
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well now you've got two dimensions of </v>

1972
01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:15.864
<v Speaker 3>differentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the hell are we going to do about </v>

1973
01:48:16.951 --> 01:48:19.920
<v Speaker 3>that and what if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you're gay and black and female?</v>

1974
01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:23.850
<v Speaker 3>Well then what if you're not very bright</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gay and black and female,</v>

1975
01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:27.900
<v Speaker 3>and then what if you're ugly and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>very bright and gay and black and female</v>

1976
01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:30.090
<v Speaker 3>and like you can keep playing that game.</v>

1977
01:48:30.630 --> 01:48:31.463
<v Speaker 3>You can keep playing that game and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of ways because there's </v>

1978
01:48:33.871 --> 01:48:36.120
<v Speaker 3>an infinite number of ways to categorize</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1979
01:48:36.121 --> 01:48:37.950
<v Speaker 3>As The postmodernist sorority pointed </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1980
01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:41.100
<v Speaker 3>and so the intersectionality theorists </v>
<v Speaker 3>came along to plug the hole,</v>

1981
01:48:41.101 --> 01:48:41.934
<v Speaker 3>but they don't know where they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand that the logical </v>

1982
01:48:44.821 --> 01:48:45.654
<v Speaker 3>conclusion of intersectionality is </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuality because there's so many </v>

1983
01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:53.160
<v Speaker 3>different ways of categorizing people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantages and disadvantages.</v>

1984
01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:55.770
<v Speaker 3>If you take that all the way out to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end,</v>

1985
01:48:55.771 --> 01:48:56.251
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1986
01:48:56.251 --> 01:48:58.020
<v Speaker 3>the individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate minority,</v>

1987
01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.153
<v Speaker 3>and that's exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's exactly what the west </v>

1988
01:49:00.511 --> 01:49:02.670
<v Speaker 3>discovered and you know the intersection</v>
<v Speaker 3>list,</v>

1989
01:49:02.671 --> 01:49:05.040
<v Speaker 3>so get there if they don't kill everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>

1990
01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:10.350
<v Speaker 3>so onto white privilege.</v>

1991
01:49:14.370 --> 01:49:18.630
<v Speaker 3>So it's really interesting to find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>where these ideas come from because it's</v>

1992
01:49:18.631 --> 01:49:22.320
<v Speaker 3>usually the scholarship is so awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just cannot possibly believe it.</v>

1993
01:49:22.321 --> 01:49:23.154
<v Speaker 3>It's just absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't end at the university of </v>

1994
01:49:26.311 --> 01:49:27.144
<v Speaker 3>toronto in the psychology department,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the original paper on white privilege </v>

1995
01:49:30.930 --> 01:49:31.763
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have received a passing grade </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the hypothesis part of a </v>

1996
01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:39.210
<v Speaker 3>undergraduate honors thesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're noT even close.</v>

1997
01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:41.820
<v Speaker 3>There's no methodology at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The person who wrote it,</v>

1998
01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:45.150
<v Speaker 3>it was called white privilege and male </v>
<v Speaker 3>privilege,</v>

1999
01:49:45.630 --> 01:49:46.463
<v Speaker 3>a personal account of coming to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>correspondences through work in women's </v>

2000
01:49:50.921 --> 01:49:52.660
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2001
01:49:52.661 --> 01:49:54.190
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal account.</v>

2002
01:49:54.191 --> 01:49:55.001
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

2003
01:49:55.001 --> 01:49:55.834
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2004
01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:01.333
<v Speaker 3>So she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she listed a bunch of ways that she </v>

2005
01:50:03.201 --> 01:50:04.034
<v Speaker 3>thought she says these are personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal examples of her unearned </v>

2006
01:50:06.891 --> 01:50:07.724
<v Speaker 3>privilege or unearned privilege that she</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw as she experienced in the 19 </v>

2007
01:50:10.941 --> 01:50:11.900
<v Speaker 3>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19 eighties.</v>

2008
01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:12.913
<v Speaker 3>So this part of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this idea is the opinion of one </v>

2009
01:50:15.081 --> 01:50:15.914
<v Speaker 3>person who wrote one paper that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no empirical backing </v>

2010
01:50:19.461 --> 01:50:20.294
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a set of hypotheses which had </v>

2011
01:50:22.791 --> 01:50:25.760
<v Speaker 3>never been subject to any statistical </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis.</v>

2012
01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:27.830
<v Speaker 3>Like if I asked you a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>

2013
01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:30.950
<v Speaker 3>it's not obvious how many questions I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking you because I could say,</v>

2014
01:50:31.130 --> 01:50:33.290
<v Speaker 3>how tall are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I could say,</v>

2015
01:50:33.291 --> 01:50:36.170
<v Speaker 3>if you're laying on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how extended would you be?</v>

2016
01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:38.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like that two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2017
01:50:38.091 --> 01:50:39.170
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one question.</v>

2018
01:50:39.650 --> 01:50:43.610
<v Speaker 3>It's just asked two ways and the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out if you ask someone a bunch of</v>

2019
01:50:43.611 --> 01:50:45.890
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many questions you're asking them is</v>

2020
01:50:45.891 --> 01:50:47.720
<v Speaker 3>by doing something called a factor </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis,</v>

2021
01:50:47.721 --> 01:50:52.721
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of an elementary form now </v>
<v Speaker 3>of social science investigation.</v>

2022
01:50:52.970 --> 01:50:53.803
<v Speaker 3>If you make a questionnaire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to subject it to a factor </v>

2023
01:50:55.401 --> 01:50:58.190
<v Speaker 3>analysis beCause you've got to find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>how many questions you're asking because</v>

2024
01:50:58.191 --> 01:51:00.710
<v Speaker 3>you might think it's 60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's probably not.</v>

2025
01:51:00.711 --> 01:51:02.870
<v Speaker 3>It's probably five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the big five,</v>

2026
01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:05.810
<v Speaker 3>by the way anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who cares about that?</v>

2027
01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:07.940
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

2028
01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:12.380
<v Speaker 3>that's all part of the oppressive white </v>
<v Speaker 3>male european patriarchy,</v>

2029
01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:13.363
<v Speaker 3>so we can just not bother with that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can pin a few notes about how we </v>

2030
01:51:16.611 --> 01:51:17.444
<v Speaker 3>think the world is constructed and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can screw up the entire political </v>

2031
01:51:20.991 --> 01:51:24.500
<v Speaker 3>system two decades later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2032
01:51:24.501 --> 01:51:26.840
<v Speaker 3>so here's your white privilege list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of it,</v>

2033
01:51:26.841 --> 01:51:27.674
<v Speaker 3>there's like 50 things I can if I wish </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrange to be in the company of people </v>

2034
01:51:30.801 --> 01:51:32.210
<v Speaker 3>of my race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time,</v>

2035
01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:33.553
<v Speaker 3>if I should need to move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be pretty sure of renting or </v>

2036
01:51:35.091 --> 01:51:35.924
<v Speaker 3>purchasing housing in an area which I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can afford and in which I would want to </v>

2037
01:51:38.481 --> 01:51:39.314
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

2038
01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.240
<v Speaker 3>That's actually a wealth thing by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2039
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:42.283
<v Speaker 3>I can be pretty sure that my neighbors </v>
<v Speaker 3>and such a location will be neutral or </v>

2040
01:51:44.601 --> 01:51:45.434
<v Speaker 3>pleasant to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can go shopping alone most of the </v>

2041
01:51:47.211 --> 01:51:48.044
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty well assured that I will not be </v>

2042
01:51:48.861 --> 01:51:49.694
<v Speaker 3>followed or harassed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can turn on the television or open to </v>

2043
01:51:51.951 --> 01:51:52.784
<v Speaker 3>the front page of the paper and see </v>
<v Speaker 3>people of my waist race widely </v>

2044
01:51:55.911 --> 01:51:56.744
<v Speaker 3>represented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I'm talking about our national </v>

2045
01:51:58.611 --> 01:51:59.444
<v Speaker 3>heritage or about civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am shown that people of my color made </v>

2046
01:52:03.171 --> 01:52:06.140
<v Speaker 3>it what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's 50 of those,</v>

2047
01:52:06.141 --> 01:52:07.190
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2048
01:52:07.370 --> 01:52:10.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that white privilege?</v>

2049
01:52:10.891 --> 01:52:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Is that majority privilege?</v>

2050
01:52:14.010 --> 01:52:15.360
<v Speaker 3>It's the same tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to China,</v>

2051
01:52:15.361 --> 01:52:16.530
<v Speaker 3>you're chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the same?</v>

2052
01:52:16.531 --> 01:52:17.640
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're chinese,</v>

2053
01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:21.810
<v Speaker 3>does the majority privilege benefits?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Majority privileges.</v>

2054
01:52:21.811 --> 01:52:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Like isn't that just part of living </v>
<v Speaker 3>within your culture?</v>

2055
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:27.263
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you live in your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're privileged as a member of that </v>

2056
01:52:30.451 --> 01:52:31.284
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while obviously that's what the culture </v>

2057
01:52:32.941 --> 01:52:35.100
<v Speaker 3>is for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's for.</v>

2058
01:52:35.670 --> 01:52:36.503
<v Speaker 3>Why would you bother building the damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing if it didn't accrue benefits to </v>

2059
01:52:39.061 --> 01:52:39.871
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might say,</v>

2060
01:52:39.871 --> 01:52:40.704
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the consequences that it accrues </v>

2061
01:52:42.270 --> 01:52:45.000
<v Speaker 3>fewer benefits to those who aren't in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the culture.</v>

2062
01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.213
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can immediately associate that </v>

2063
01:52:47.601 --> 01:52:50.150
<v Speaker 3>with race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just do that.</v>

2064
01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Say it's white privileGed does many </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2065
01:52:52.551 --> 01:52:53.384
<v Speaker 3>It could be certainly could be well and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the intersection of people have already </v>

2066
01:52:56.301 --> 01:53:00.440
<v Speaker 3>figured out that there's many things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that could be so like what the hell?</v>

2067
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2068
01:53:01.611 --> 01:53:02.444
<v Speaker 3>what's going on while we let these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pseudo disciplines into the university </v>

2069
01:53:05.241 --> 01:53:06.074
<v Speaker 3>because we're stupid and guilty </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously and they have no </v>

2070
01:53:10.011 --> 01:53:10.844
<v Speaker 3>methodological requirements and plenty </v>
<v Speaker 3>of power and plenty of time to produce </v>

2071
01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:15.493
<v Speaker 3>nonsensical research and produce like </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentful activists and now we're </v>

2072
01:53:19.341 --> 01:53:20.720
<v Speaker 3>bearing the fruits of that.</v>

2073
01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:24.620
<v Speaker 3>It's not pretty so white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2074
01:53:24.621 --> 01:53:25.454
<v Speaker 3>the other thing you might notice is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>to attribute to the individuals of a </v>

2075
01:53:30.151 --> 01:53:30.984
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the attributes of that community on the </v>

2076
01:53:33.531 --> 01:53:37.040
<v Speaker 3>basis of their racial identity is called</v>
<v Speaker 3>racism.</v>

2077
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:41.000
<v Speaker 3>That's what racism is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no other way of defining it.</v>

2078
01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:42.193
<v Speaker 3>It's attributing to the individual the </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristics of the group as if the </v>

2079
01:53:46.161 --> 01:53:49.730
<v Speaker 3>group was homogenous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the intersection people have already</v>

2080
01:53:49.731 --> 01:53:50.564
<v Speaker 3>decided that's not a fair game because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many differences between </v>

2081
01:53:53.361 --> 01:53:54.194
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the postmodernist don't care about </v>

2082
01:53:55.701 --> 01:53:59.090
<v Speaker 3>logical coherence because they regard </v>
<v Speaker 3>logical coherence.</v>

2083
01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Here it comes again as a creation of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>

2084
01:54:02.421 --> 01:54:03.254
<v Speaker 3>european male patriarchal structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's designed to oppress the </v>

2085
01:54:06.201 --> 01:54:08.930
<v Speaker 3>oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's technically the case.</v>

2086
01:54:09.170 --> 01:54:10.760
<v Speaker 3>So logical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incoherence,</v>

2087
01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:12.290
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could say,</v>

2088
01:54:12.291 --> 01:54:15.080
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you act out your logically incoherent</v>

2089
01:54:15.081 --> 01:54:15.914
<v Speaker 3>ideas in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to run face first into a </v>

2090
01:54:17.571 --> 01:54:18.404
<v Speaker 3>brick wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the postmodern answer to that is </v>

2091
01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:23.930
<v Speaker 3>there's actually no real world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all interpretation.</v>

2092
01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:27.560
<v Speaker 3>So there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no having that discussion,</v>

2093
01:54:27.710 --> 01:54:28.543
<v Speaker 3>but the postmodernists don't care </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't believe that </v>

2094
01:54:30.411 --> 01:54:32.960
<v Speaker 3>discussion between people of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>power groups as possible.</v>

2095
01:54:32.961 --> 01:54:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here we are.</v>

2096
01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I made a case tonight,</v>

2097
01:54:38.130 --> 01:54:39.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go over it.</v>

2098
01:54:39.170 --> 01:54:40.010
<v Speaker 3>What's the case?</v>

2099
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:48.050
<v Speaker 3>The postmodernists are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're philosophically naive,</v>

2100
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:50.223
<v Speaker 3>they're right about an infinite number </v>
<v Speaker 3>of interpretations and wrong about a </v>

2101
01:54:52.961 --> 01:54:56.920
<v Speaker 3>finite number of viable interpretations </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's like that's,</v>

2102
01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:58.053
<v Speaker 3>that's death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the end of postmodernist theory </v>

2103
01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:02.110
<v Speaker 3>and that's not the only way in which </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're wrong.</v>

2104
01:55:02.111 --> 01:55:04.510
<v Speaker 3>They're wrong in a bunch of other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're more subsidiary.</v>

2105
01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:06.040
<v Speaker 3>The marxists.</v>

2106
01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:11.970
<v Speaker 3>They're not just wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're wrong and murderous or wrong,</v>

2107
01:55:11.971 --> 01:55:15.540
<v Speaker 3>murderous and genocidal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you think murderous and genocidal</v>

2108
01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:19.320
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean wrong and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think that there's lots of would</v>

2109
01:55:19.321 --> 01:55:23.220
<v Speaker 3>be revolutionaries who would be happy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have blood running in the street if they</v>

2110
01:55:23.221 --> 01:55:24.054
<v Speaker 3>had their chance for revenge and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to move up the hierarchy of </v>

2111
01:55:27.331 --> 01:55:28.164
<v Speaker 3>charity so you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to think that murder and </v>

2112
01:55:30.901 --> 01:55:31.734
<v Speaker 3>genocide is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if the right people are </v>

2113
01:55:33.451 --> 01:55:34.860
<v Speaker 3>murdered in genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2114
01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:37.860
<v Speaker 3>That's actually part of the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole equation,</v>

2115
01:55:38.130 --> 01:55:38.963
<v Speaker 3>but if you're willing to think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>murder and genocide on a mass scale </v>

2116
01:55:41.731 --> 01:55:45.180
<v Speaker 3>across many cultures over decades is </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

2117
01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:46.073
<v Speaker 3>then marxism is wrong and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernist don't get to just come </v>

2118
01:55:50.521 --> 01:55:51.354
<v Speaker 3>along and a dark marxism as a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleight of hand because there are </v>

2119
01:55:55.201 --> 01:55:56.034
<v Speaker 3>marches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Theory didn't work out and they figured </v>

2120
01:55:56.971 --> 01:55:57.804
<v Speaker 3>out a rationalization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't get to get away with that </v>

2121
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:02.820
<v Speaker 3>because it's too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too dangerous to the rest of us</v>

2122
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:06.343
<v Speaker 3>and we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it isn't necessary for us who are </v>

2123
01:56:11.241 --> 01:56:12.074
<v Speaker 3>trying with the small part of our hearts</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be oriented towards the good </v>

2124
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:17.143
<v Speaker 3>to allow people who are manipulating us </v>
<v Speaker 3>with historical ignorance and </v>

2125
01:56:20.331 --> 01:56:21.164
<v Speaker 3>philosophical sleight of hand to render </v>
<v Speaker 3>so god damn guilty about what our </v>

2126
01:56:25.011 --> 01:56:29.330
<v Speaker 3>ancestors may or may not have done so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we allow our shame and our guilt to</v>

2127
01:56:29.331 --> 01:56:30.164
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be used as tools to manipulate us </v>

2128
01:56:33.171 --> 01:56:35.780
<v Speaker 3>into accepting a future that we do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to have.</v>

2129
01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:39.073
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2130
01:56:40.610 --> 01:56:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2131
01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're just gonna do the uh,</v>

2132
01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:11.030
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Move on onto the q and a now.</v>

2133
01:57:11.031 --> 01:57:14.600
<v Speaker 1>but before we do the venue wants to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little announcement.</v>

2134
01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:21.220
<v Speaker 6>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2135
01:57:21.221 --> 01:57:22.360
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My name's cameron mcneil.</v>

2136
01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:24.610
<v Speaker 6>I'm the managing director here at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>chan center.</v>

2137
01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:26.413
<v Speaker 6>As you are all leaving tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>please be where something has come to </v>

2138
01:57:29.271 --> 01:57:31.280
<v Speaker 6>light tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Outside the building,</v>

2139
01:57:31.281 --> 01:57:35.690
<v Speaker 6>there is an individual impersonating a </v>
<v Speaker 6>ubc security guard.</v>

2140
01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:39.380
<v Speaker 6>It is not in the building.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was in the rose garden.</v>

2141
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:41.210
<v Speaker 6>There was no damage done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody was hurt,</v>

2142
01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:44.630
<v Speaker 6>but there is an impersonator out there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so just please be aware of that.</v>

2143
01:57:45.230 --> 01:57:46.063
<v Speaker 6>Thank you very much.</v>

2144
01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:50.850
<v Speaker 1>So for those of you in the first two </v>
<v Speaker 1>rows,</v>

2145
01:57:50.851 --> 01:57:53.400
<v Speaker 1>you can either line up here or at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mic over there and,</v>

2146
01:57:53.401 --> 01:57:55.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask your questions</v>

2147
01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:09.150
<v Speaker 1>and also try to keep it short because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have that much time.</v>

2148
01:58:21.590 --> 01:58:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan B.</v>

2149
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan.</v>

2150
01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:24.973
<v Speaker 1>I'm in your lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use the term postmodernism </v>

2151
01:58:27.531 --> 01:58:31.760
<v Speaker 1>interchangeably with cultural marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism and moral relativism.</v>

2152
01:58:32.210 --> 01:58:33.043
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you've considered or heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative beliefs that the term </v>

2153
01:58:35.001 --> 01:58:38.930
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism is not necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is necessarily always congruent on a one</v>

2154
01:58:38.931 --> 01:58:39.764
<v Speaker 1>to one scale of these other terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some limited circumstances is </v>

2155
01:58:43.331 --> 01:58:44.164
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Specifically the idea that when you use </v>

2156
01:58:46.271 --> 01:58:47.104
<v Speaker 1>the term postmodernism to vilify as by </v>
<v Speaker 1>some others referred to as pseudo </v>

2157
01:58:50.321 --> 01:58:51.154
<v Speaker 1>modernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas as some would call what you </v>

2158
01:58:52.601 --> 01:58:55.720
<v Speaker 1>endorsed to not be modernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in fact metta modernism,</v>

2159
01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:59.620
<v Speaker 1>post millennialism or post </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism,</v>

2160
01:58:59.621 --> 01:59:03.700
<v Speaker 1>which unfortunately has a terrible name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I have a brief,</v>

2161
01:59:03.850 --> 01:59:04.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitions of those words if you need </v>

2162
01:59:06.791 --> 01:59:07.624
<v Speaker 1>me to.</v>

2163
01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:10.790
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as I said tonight,</v>

2164
01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:15.200
<v Speaker 7>you have to give the devil his due and </v>
<v Speaker 7>so we'll do that.</v>

2165
01:59:15.201 --> 01:59:16.034
<v Speaker 7>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there is a very large number of ways of </v>

2166
01:59:17.781 --> 01:59:20.900
<v Speaker 7>interpreting the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no doubt about that.</v>

2167
01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:27.050
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People use biased interpretive lenses to</v>

2168
01:59:28.190 --> 01:59:30.800
<v Speaker 7>as means of interpreting the world to </v>
<v Speaker 7>put their own</v>

2169
01:59:33.330 --> 01:59:38.040
<v Speaker 7>priorities forward without necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 7>knowing that they're doing so and that,</v>

2170
01:59:38.041 --> 01:59:38.874
<v Speaker 7>that can corrupt them and society.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The psychoanalysts figured that out way </v>

2171
01:59:43.981 --> 01:59:46.380
<v Speaker 7>before the postmodernist so they don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>get any credit for that,</v>

2172
01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.330
<v Speaker 7>like really not.</v>

2173
01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:50.370
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2174
01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:53.430
<v Speaker 7>so it's useful to keep those things in </v>
<v Speaker 7>mind.</v>

2175
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:58.200
<v Speaker 7>It's when they're put,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when they're put forward is absolute</v>

2176
01:59:58.290 --> 02:00:00.660
<v Speaker 7>truth that disturbs me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

2177
02:00:00.661 --> 02:00:02.670
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people are probably racist.</v>

2178
02:00:02.671 --> 02:00:03.504
<v Speaker 7>They miGht even be implicitly racist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>although we don't know what that means </v>

2179
02:00:06.061 --> 02:00:06.894
<v Speaker 7>and we don't know how it's related to </v>
<v Speaker 7>their explicit behavior and we can't </v>

2180
02:00:09.151 --> 02:00:14.151
<v Speaker 7>separate from ingroup preference or </v>
<v Speaker 7>necessarily from reaction to novelty.</v>

2181
02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.900
<v Speaker 7>So it's a tricky business,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2182
02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:17.213
<v Speaker 7>and we don't know how to separate </v>
<v Speaker 7>stereotypical racial perceptions from </v>

2183
02:00:23.730 --> 02:00:24.563
<v Speaker 7>perceptual heuristics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We don't know how to do that because </v>

2184
02:00:26.521 --> 02:00:27.354
<v Speaker 7>you're always oversimplifying the world </v>
<v Speaker 7>because you're not smart enough to live </v>

2185
02:00:29.131 --> 02:00:31.290
<v Speaker 7>in the world as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to oversimplify it.</v>

2186
02:00:31.770 --> 02:00:32.603
<v Speaker 7>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there are times with postmodernism is </v>

2187
02:00:35.101 --> 02:00:35.934
<v Speaker 7>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are used it quite usefully tonight to </v>

2188
02:00:37.681 --> 02:00:39.690
<v Speaker 7>deconstruct postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>

2189
02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:44.730
<v Speaker 7>so but but way it's when it's turned </v>
<v Speaker 7>into an absolute,</v>

2190
02:00:44.731 --> 02:00:48.900
<v Speaker 7>especially a moral absolute that it and </v>
<v Speaker 7>winded allies itself with marxism,</v>

2191
02:00:48.901 --> 02:00:49.920
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sorry guys.</v>

2192
02:00:49.921 --> 02:00:51.560
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't like grand narratives.</v>

2193
02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:53.750
<v Speaker 7>You don't get to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>while that's where you.</v>

2194
02:00:53.850 --> 02:00:57.180
<v Speaker 7>that isn't where you went,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's where you came from.</v>

2195
02:00:57.181 --> 02:00:59.160
<v Speaker 7>You've never,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've never left there.</v>

2196
02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:03.330
<v Speaker 7>So</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>

2197
02:01:03.810 --> 02:01:06.120
<v Speaker 7>that's basically what I have to say </v>
<v Speaker 7>about that.</v>

2198
02:01:06.190 --> 02:01:07.023
<v Speaker 7>Thanks.</v>

2199
02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:08.580
<v Speaker 8>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dr. Peterson.</v>

2200
02:01:08.581 --> 02:01:12.270
<v Speaker 8>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now my question is regarding adhd,</v>

2201
02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:15.240
<v Speaker 8>which is something I haven't heard you </v>
<v Speaker 8>speak a whole lot about,</v>

2202
02:01:15.241 --> 02:01:16.074
<v Speaker 8>maybe a little bit now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It seems to me that we are at least </v>

2203
02:01:20.190 --> 02:01:21.023
<v Speaker 8>maybe just me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>do not quite understand adhd to what </v>

2204
02:01:24.421 --> 02:01:28.170
<v Speaker 8>could be at full capacity maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and because there's many,</v>

2205
02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:31.890
<v Speaker 8>many voices sayinG that it's an </v>
<v Speaker 8>overdiagnosed overblown,</v>

2206
02:01:31.891 --> 02:01:32.724
<v Speaker 8>small mental variants that's prevalent </v>
<v Speaker 8>in boys or it's just young boys being </v>

2207
02:01:36.571 --> 02:01:37.404
<v Speaker 8>young boys and then there are some that </v>
<v Speaker 8>would fight and advocate for a very </v>

2208
02:01:42.501 --> 02:01:47.360
<v Speaker 8>different treatment in the academic </v>
<v Speaker 8>world and I was wondering what you,</v>

2209
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:52.390
<v Speaker 8>what your thoughts are on adhd itself</v>
<v Speaker 8>and on the,</v>

2210
02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:54.973
<v Speaker 8>whether you think it's overdiagnosed and</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe advice for me as someone who has </v>

2211
02:01:58.941 --> 02:01:59.774
<v Speaker 8>been diagnosed with adhd on how to </v>
<v Speaker 8>overcome it without maybe becoming </v>

2212
02:02:03.891 --> 02:02:07.010
<v Speaker 8>completely reliant on prescribed </v>
<v Speaker 8>medication.</v>

2213
02:02:08.530 --> 02:02:10.660
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so first of all,</v>

2214
02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:15.280
<v Speaker 7>it's definitely overdiagnosed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Second,</v>

2215
02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:20.770
<v Speaker 7>it's very unreliable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Psychiatric diagnosis.</v>

2216
02:02:20.890 --> 02:02:21.723
<v Speaker 7>Many psychiatric diagnosis are </v>
<v Speaker 7>unreliable and that's because </v>

2217
02:02:24.341 --> 02:02:27.820
<v Speaker 7>psychiatric diagnosis aren't precisely </v>
<v Speaker 7>scientific categories.</v>

2218
02:02:27.821 --> 02:02:29.110
<v Speaker 7>They're weird hybrids,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2219
02:02:29.111 --> 02:02:31.330
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>psychiatrists aren't scientists.</v>

2220
02:02:31.331 --> 02:02:32.164
<v Speaker 7>They're engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Engineers are trying to do something </v>

2221
02:02:34.181 --> 02:02:35.014
<v Speaker 7>rather than to describe the objective </v>
<v Speaker 7>world and psychiatrists are trying to </v>

2222
02:02:37.391 --> 02:02:39.550
<v Speaker 7>make people healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whatever that means.</v>

2223
02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:42.670
<v Speaker 7>It's actually partly ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's very complicated.</v>

2224
02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:51.000
<v Speaker 7>We don't know how to distinguish it from</v>
<v Speaker 7>temperamental variation,</v>

2225
02:02:51.450 --> 02:02:52.283
<v Speaker 7>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're high in openness and high in </v>

2226
02:02:53.551 --> 02:02:56.220
<v Speaker 7>extroversion and low in </v>
<v Speaker 7>conscientiousness,</v>

2227
02:02:58.090 --> 02:03:00.010
<v Speaker 7>low in agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>conscientiousness,</v>

2228
02:03:00.011 --> 02:03:00.844
<v Speaker 7>and and high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're likely to manifest symptoms of </v>

2229
02:03:04.751 --> 02:03:07.960
<v Speaker 7>adhd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's because your exploratory,</v>

2230
02:03:08.170 --> 02:03:10.480
<v Speaker 7>you don't like to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're full of ideas.</v>

2231
02:03:10.481 --> 02:03:11.314
<v Speaker 7>Your attention scatters across a wide </v>
<v Speaker 7>variety of topics and you're not very </v>

2232
02:03:14.561 --> 02:03:15.394
<v Speaker 7>stable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Temperamental variation is also much </v>

2233
02:03:17.231 --> 02:03:18.790
<v Speaker 7>more common among boys.</v>

2234
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:26.470
<v Speaker 7>Panksepp showed same guy with rats that </v>
<v Speaker 7>if you deprive young routes of rough and</v>

2235
02:03:27.711 --> 02:03:28.544
<v Speaker 7>tumble play,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is what the young boys are </v>

2236
02:03:30.561 --> 02:03:31.394
<v Speaker 7>deprived of in school,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say that they get hyperactive and </v>

2237
02:03:37.490 --> 02:03:38.323
<v Speaker 7>then their prefrontal cortex is don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>develop very well because they're not </v>

2238
02:03:40.251 --> 02:03:41.084
<v Speaker 7>having the right kind of experienCes and</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you can treat that quite </v>

2239
02:03:42.921 --> 02:03:46.520
<v Speaker 7>effectively with psychomotor stimulants </v>
<v Speaker 7>like ritalin.</v>

2240
02:03:47.690 --> 02:03:48.523
<v Speaker 7>so that's kind of an interesting bit of </v>
<v Speaker 7>scientific information that no one pays </v>

2241
02:03:51.501 --> 02:03:52.334
<v Speaker 7>any attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There is also absolutely no evidence </v>

2242
02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:55.994
<v Speaker 7>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That longterm use of psychomotor </v>

2243
02:03:57.351 --> 02:04:00.350
<v Speaker 7>stimulants produces increases in </v>
<v Speaker 7>cognitive gain,</v>

2244
02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:02.990
<v Speaker 7>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and there's plenty of evidence that it's</v>

2245
02:04:02.991 --> 02:04:05.180
<v Speaker 7>harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

2246
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:10.220
<v Speaker 7>then the second part of that was what </v>
<v Speaker 7>about.</v>

2247
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:13.383
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2248
02:04:13.590 --> 02:04:18.590
<v Speaker 7>adjustments for in the academic world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>say that disability adjustments.</v>

2249
02:04:19.081 --> 02:04:23.150
<v Speaker 7>It's like that's such a rat's nest that </v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to even discuss it.</v>

2250
02:04:23.490 --> 02:04:27.120
<v Speaker 7>I mean it it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll discuss it for like 15 seconds.</v>

2251
02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:32.710
<v Speaker 7>There is a never endinG multiplication </v>
<v Speaker 7>of disability.</v>

2252
02:04:33.190 --> 02:04:34.023
<v Speaker 7>That's what's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The disability offices in the </v>

2253
02:04:36.251 --> 02:04:40.920
<v Speaker 7>universities are like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know some people have it rough,</v>

2254
02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:42.690
<v Speaker 7>like believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know that I,</v>

2255
02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:44.233
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I seriously know that I've dealt with </v>

2256
02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:48.420
<v Speaker 7>extraordinarily damaged people in my </v>
<v Speaker 7>life.</v>

2257
02:04:50.250 --> 02:04:50.730
<v Speaker 7>It,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

2258
02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:51.563
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're bloody hard pressed to find </v>

2259
02:04:52.631 --> 02:04:53.464
<v Speaker 7>someone who doesn't have a serious </v>
<v Speaker 7>problem or who doesn't have a serious </v>

2260
02:04:59.981 --> 02:05:02.740
<v Speaker 7>problem in a close family member.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

2261
02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:06.400
<v Speaker 7>where do you draw the line with regards </v>
<v Speaker 7>to disability where you can't,</v>

2262
02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:11.560
<v Speaker 7>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They multiply just like lgbt identities.</v>

2263
02:05:11.561 --> 02:05:13.120
<v Speaker 7>Multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just knows.</v>

2264
02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:14.033
<v Speaker 7>She really technically just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just like intersectionality cateGories </v>

2265
02:05:18.071 --> 02:05:19.880
<v Speaker 7>of oppression multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

2266
02:05:19.881 --> 02:05:20.714
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's inevitable the way that you deal </v>

2267
02:05:23.291 --> 02:05:25.270
<v Speaker 7>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>As you have objective standards,</v>

2268
02:05:25.450 --> 02:05:28.510
<v Speaker 7>you apply them to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not because that's fair.</v>

2269
02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:29.890
<v Speaker 7>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you,</v>

2270
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:34.000
<v Speaker 7>if your criteria for fairness is that </v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone has the same outcome,</v>

2271
02:05:34.001 --> 02:05:36.520
<v Speaker 7>it's not fair at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not even close to fair.</v>

2272
02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:39.820
<v Speaker 7>It's just less piratical radical than </v>
<v Speaker 7>the alternatives.</v>

2273
02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:41.013
<v Speaker 7>Now we don't know that yet because we </v>
<v Speaker 7>haven't seen the full range of the </v>

2274
02:05:43.571 --> 02:05:46.240
<v Speaker 7>tyranny of the alternatives manifest </v>
<v Speaker 7>itself.</v>

2275
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:49.180
<v Speaker 7>Not in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it certainly did in other cultures.</v>

2276
02:05:49.630 --> 02:05:54.160
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a bad idea now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to be absolute about that.</v>

2277
02:05:54.190 --> 02:05:59.190
<v Speaker 7>Like</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's tricky,</v>

2278
02:05:59.351 --> 02:06:02.350
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because if you have a disability</v>

2279
02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:04.913
<v Speaker 5>that</v>

2280
02:06:04.930 --> 02:06:05.763
<v Speaker 7>would allow you to do the work in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>university and in the workplace with a </v>

2281
02:06:09.821 --> 02:06:10.654
<v Speaker 7>modification,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then perhaps the modification could be </v>

2282
02:06:13.661 --> 02:06:14.494
<v Speaker 7>made,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think that was done a lot better </v>

2283
02:06:15.701 --> 02:06:18.460
<v Speaker 7>when I was in the hands of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>professors and not in the hands of these</v>

2284
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:23.500
<v Speaker 7>crazy bureaucratic structures that have </v>
<v Speaker 7>risen up around the disability issue.</v>

2285
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:24.663
<v Speaker 7>Like they're one of the 10 things that </v>
<v Speaker 7>are going to kill the universities or </v>

2286
02:06:27.431 --> 02:06:31.840
<v Speaker 7>maybe have already killed them possibly </v>
<v Speaker 7>because they may their walking corpses.</v>

2287
02:06:31.841 --> 02:06:35.470
<v Speaker 7>As far as I can tell zombies so and that</v>
<v Speaker 7>might be wrong,</v>

2288
02:06:35.471 --> 02:06:40.360
<v Speaker 7>but it's what it looks like to me</v>
<v Speaker 7>versus I want to say thank you so much.</v>

2289
02:06:40.361 --> 02:06:44.050
<v Speaker 7>Those an amazing talk and I was </v>
<v Speaker 7>wondering if you could elaborate.</v>

2290
02:06:44.051 --> 02:06:44.884
<v Speaker 7>What I noticed a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go here to ubc is that a lot of </v>

2291
02:06:46.691 --> 02:06:50.380
<v Speaker 7>students and young people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're often desensitized to,</v>

2292
02:06:50.381 --> 02:06:51.214
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the atrocities that communism or </v>

2293
02:06:52.991 --> 02:06:53.824
<v Speaker 7>ideologies that forced terrorism and </v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe it's some sort of stockholm </v>

2294
02:06:57.461 --> 02:07:01.670
<v Speaker 7>syndrome that I'm seeing where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 7>people are just there,</v>

2295
02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:03.670
<v Speaker 7>they're trapped and they can't.</v>

2296
02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:07.570
<v Speaker 7>They feel in a way they can't do </v>
<v Speaker 7>anything about it and then they start to</v>

2297
02:07:08.110 --> 02:07:09.950
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2298
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:10.833
<v Speaker 7>like communism or they start to see more</v>
<v Speaker 7>socialists or adopt socialist policy </v>

2299
02:07:13.821 --> 02:07:16.840
<v Speaker 7>that in the end we'll get them killed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'll get them hurt.</v>

2300
02:07:17.380 --> 02:07:21.490
<v Speaker 7>As long as you kind of elaborate on what</v>
<v Speaker 7>you think can be done about that or even</v>

2301
02:07:21.491 --> 02:07:23.740
<v Speaker 7>if something can be done in that </v>
<v Speaker 7>respect.</v>

2302
02:07:24.130 --> 02:07:25.840
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think something can be done.</v>

2303
02:07:25.841 --> 02:07:29.560
<v Speaker 7>I mean I've been trying to educate </v>
<v Speaker 7>people about the horrors of</v>

2304
02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:35.920
<v Speaker 7>the nazi regime and the soviet in </v>
<v Speaker 7>particular.</v>

2305
02:07:35.921 --> 02:07:40.921
<v Speaker 7>I've concentrated mostly on those two </v>
<v Speaker 7>because that's good enough and trying to</v>

2306
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:46.120
<v Speaker 7>let people know that it was through the </v>
<v Speaker 7>fault of people,</v>

2307
02:07:46.121 --> 02:07:48.880
<v Speaker 7>much like them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that those systems are rows and,</v>

2308
02:07:50.530 --> 02:07:51.363
<v Speaker 7>and that there are steps you can take to</v>
<v Speaker 7>limit the probability that you would </v>

2309
02:07:55.781 --> 02:07:56.614
<v Speaker 7>participate in such a thing and that </v>
<v Speaker 7>those steps are associated with trying </v>

2310
02:07:59.831 --> 02:08:00.664
<v Speaker 7>to be truthful in your speech and </v>
<v Speaker 7>actions because the stability of those </v>

2311
02:08:04.361 --> 02:08:09.040
<v Speaker 7>systems depends on the willingness of </v>
<v Speaker 7>individuals to lie and,</v>

2312
02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:10.113
<v Speaker 7>and also on your willingness to take </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsibility for the malevolence in </v>

2313
02:08:13.901 --> 02:08:17.650
<v Speaker 7>your own heart that manifests itself in </v>
<v Speaker 7>those social movements.</v>

2314
02:08:19.450 --> 02:08:24.450
<v Speaker 7>And so that when I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I do my lectures,</v>

2315
02:08:25.451 --> 02:08:27.760
<v Speaker 7>when I do talks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I put them on youtube,</v>

2316
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:28.623
<v Speaker 7>what I'm trying to do is exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 7>because that was the best pathway </v>

2317
02:08:33.281 --> 02:08:37.540
<v Speaker 7>forward through such things that I could</v>
<v Speaker 7>think up over 20 years of thinking about</v>

2318
02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:38.980
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2319
02:08:39.330 --> 02:08:40.163
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one is so habituated to suffering that </v>

2320
02:08:48.161 --> 02:08:48.994
<v Speaker 7>they can read the gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is actually quite hard to read </v>

2321
02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:56.770
<v Speaker 7>without having an effect them like your </v>
<v Speaker 7>psychopathic.</v>

2322
02:08:56.771 --> 02:08:59.500
<v Speaker 7>If that book doesn't affect you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it should.</v>

2323
02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:00.573
<v Speaker 7>If you read it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it affects you deeply and it's not the </v>

2324
02:09:03.701 --> 02:09:08.701
<v Speaker 7>only example of that kind of literature.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the people who are habituated aren't.</v>

2325
02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:10.473
<v Speaker 7>They've just been shown low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 7>representations of things they don't </v>

2326
02:09:13.481 --> 02:09:17.890
<v Speaker 7>understand that looked vaguely bad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't know a damn thing about them,</v>

2327
02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:19.353
<v Speaker 7>and our education system has done a </v>
<v Speaker 7>tremendously appalling job of educating </v>

2328
02:09:24.221 --> 02:09:28.420
<v Speaker 7>young people about the absolute </v>
<v Speaker 7>catastrophe of radical left isn't now.</v>

2329
02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:32.560
<v Speaker 7>It's not much better with regards to say</v>
<v Speaker 7>the actions of the nazis,</v>

2330
02:09:32.561 --> 02:09:35.620
<v Speaker 7>although I would say on average people </v>
<v Speaker 7>are more aware of that,</v>

2331
02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:37.660
<v Speaker 7>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it's shallow,</v>

2332
02:09:37.661 --> 02:09:38.494
<v Speaker 7>shallow knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you make the knowledge deep and deep </v>

2333
02:09:42.101 --> 02:09:44.800
<v Speaker 7>knowledge changes people and wakes them </v>
<v Speaker 7>up.</v>

2334
02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:45.773
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2335
02:09:45.970 --> 02:09:46.803
<v Speaker 7>the only reason that I ever got </v>
<v Speaker 7>convinced that they're that good and </v>

2336
02:09:48.941 --> 02:09:52.210
<v Speaker 7>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're real more real than anything else.</v>

2337
02:09:52.450 --> 02:09:54.670
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't because I learned that good </v>
<v Speaker 7>was real.</v>

2338
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 7>That's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's hard.</v>

2339
02:09:57.940 --> 02:09:58.773
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to learn that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to find examples of </v>

2340
02:10:01.061 --> 02:10:02.620
<v Speaker 7>transcendent good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2341
02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:04.780
<v Speaker 7>they're rare,</v>
<v Speaker 7>evil.</v>

2342
02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:10.420
<v Speaker 7>All you have to do is look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>read history a bit and read it like it's</v>

2343
02:10:10.421 --> 02:10:15.421
<v Speaker 7>about you and there's no way that you </v>
<v Speaker 7>can do that without a transformation,</v>

2344
02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:19.140
<v Speaker 7>but people won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you want.</v>

2345
02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:23.350
<v Speaker 7>Imagine yourself as an auschwitz guard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a rough thing you see because you</v>

2346
02:10:23.351 --> 02:10:24.330
<v Speaker 7>have to figure out.</v>

2347
02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:27.310
<v Speaker 7>See young said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you confronted the shadow,</v>

2348
02:10:27.370 --> 02:10:29.860
<v Speaker 7>which is the dark side of people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the aggressive side,</v>

2349
02:10:29.861 --> 02:10:31.870
<v Speaker 7>that malevolent side,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that it.</v>

2350
02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:32.793
<v Speaker 7>It really reaches all the down to hell </v>
<v Speaker 7>and dante sort of was trying to put </v>

2351
02:10:37.761 --> 02:10:39.800
<v Speaker 7>forward the same thing when he wrote the</v>
<v Speaker 7>inferno,</v>

2352
02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:41.300
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>With the levels of evil,</v>

2353
02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:42.193
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because it was a voyage through the </v>

2354
02:10:42.981 --> 02:10:44.600
<v Speaker 7>levels of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right to the bottom.</v>

2355
02:10:44.601 --> 02:10:47.540
<v Speaker 7>He thought the bottom was betrayal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty good.</v>

2356
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:49.010
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the most,</v>

2357
02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:51.340
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the center of malevolence is be trail.</v>

2358
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:53.820
<v Speaker 7>I liked that because to be trained </v>
<v Speaker 7>someone,</v>

2359
02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:56.630
<v Speaker 7>you have to get them to trust you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and trust is a moral virtue,</v>

2360
02:10:56.631 --> 02:10:58.490
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially if it's courageous trust,</v>

2361
02:10:58.610 --> 02:10:59.443
<v Speaker 7>because it it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it puts you in alignment with other </v>

2362
02:11:00.831 --> 02:11:01.664
<v Speaker 7>people and allows you to move forward </v>
<v Speaker 7>into life and if you'd be trained that </v>

2363
02:11:03.771 --> 02:11:05.330
<v Speaker 7>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like a knife in the.</v>

2364
02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:07.850
<v Speaker 7>It's like knife in the heart through the</v>
<v Speaker 7>back,</v>

2365
02:11:08.330 --> 02:11:10.520
<v Speaker 7>especially if it's someone who loves,</v>
<v Speaker 7>loves you,</v>

2366
02:11:10.521 --> 02:11:11.354
<v Speaker 7>betrays you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and especially if they be you for your </v>

2367
02:11:13.281 --> 02:11:15.680
<v Speaker 7>virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a really nice twist.</v>

2368
02:11:16.190 --> 02:11:17.023
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2369
02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:23.150
<v Speaker 7>I believe because I think that people </v>
<v Speaker 7>are capable of good,</v>

2370
02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:26.960
<v Speaker 7>that if they know enough about evil that</v>
<v Speaker 7>that will straighten them out.</v>

2371
02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:29.960
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but who wants that?</v>

2372
02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:31.113
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is one of the things I really like </v>

2373
02:11:31.941 --> 02:11:32.774
<v Speaker 7>about young.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's often regarded as a new age </v>

2374
02:11:34.581 --> 02:11:36.680
<v Speaker 7>thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's wrong.</v>

2375
02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:40.700
<v Speaker 7>He's no new age thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He knew that the,</v>

2376
02:11:41.150 --> 02:11:41.983
<v Speaker 7>the pathway to enlightenment was barred </v>
<v Speaker 7>by the necessity of a passage through </v>

2377
02:11:47.271 --> 02:11:50.270
<v Speaker 7>hell and that no one was going to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

2378
02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:53.930
<v Speaker 7>That's why there isn't a world full of </v>
<v Speaker 7>enlightened people,</v>

2379
02:11:53.931 --> 02:11:54.764
<v Speaker 7>you might say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it was just a matter of doing </v>

2380
02:11:57.171 --> 02:12:02.150
<v Speaker 7>nice things following your bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say however you might put it.</v>

2381
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:07.040
<v Speaker 7>Then why wouldn't everyone walk up the </v>
<v Speaker 7>stairway to heaven?</v>

2382
02:12:07.610 --> 02:12:10.910
<v Speaker 7>That isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not how it works at all.</v>

2383
02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:14.540
<v Speaker 7>I don't think you can be convinced of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the necessity for moral action until you</v>

2384
02:12:14.541 --> 02:12:15.374
<v Speaker 7>understand exactly how dark and terrible</v>
<v Speaker 7>things can get and that it's your fault </v>

2385
02:12:19.221 --> 02:12:22.640
<v Speaker 7>that they're getting that way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who wants to think that?</v>

2386
02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:27.140
<v Speaker 7>So you can think it though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not,</v>

2387
02:12:27.170 --> 02:12:28.700
<v Speaker 7>not without it burning you.</v>

2388
02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:31.410
<v Speaker 5>So thanks so much,</v>

2389
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:36.680
<v Speaker 1>lou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson a thank you for coming.</v>

2390
02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:39.420
<v Speaker 1>We appreciate it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2391
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to get your opinion on </v>
<v Speaker 1>censorship that we're seeing on the web.</v>

2392
02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's accelerating.</v>

2393
02:12:45.561 --> 02:12:46.394
<v Speaker 1>You were a very notable example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were locked out of your g male </v>

2394
02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:50.600
<v Speaker 1>indian trump account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me?</v>

2395
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's got a deleted by an in person,</v>

2396
02:12:55.041 --> 02:12:57.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're saying that perhaps this was</v>

2397
02:12:57.171 --> 02:13:02.171
<v Speaker 1>just a contractor and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe someone from twitter who's gone in</v>

2398
02:13:02.911 --> 02:13:03.744
<v Speaker 1>a very far left direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A youtube has gone very far left </v>

2399
02:13:07.011 --> 02:13:09.320
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wondering,</v>

2400
02:13:09.321 --> 02:13:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I've started an alternative to youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>called youtube.</v>

2401
02:13:12.650 --> 02:13:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of,</v>

2402
02:13:14.490 --> 02:13:15.323
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you see for possible solutions </v>

2403
02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:22.850
<v Speaker 1>and just your thoughts in generAl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a crazy thought,</v>

2404
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:24.163
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to tell it to you anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I Was just reading one of ray </v>

2405
02:13:27.021 --> 02:13:27.854
<v Speaker 1>kurzweil's books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called how to make a </v>

2406
02:13:29.271 --> 02:13:30.980
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked it actually.</v>

2407
02:13:32.850 --> 02:13:36.220
<v Speaker 7>It helped me understand how the brain </v>
<v Speaker 7>compresses information because the world</v>

2408
02:13:36.221 --> 02:13:40.170
<v Speaker 7>is really complicated so you have to </v>
<v Speaker 7>make a low resolution representations of</v>

2409
02:13:40.171 --> 02:13:43.350
<v Speaker 7>it to live in it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he actually explained to me in a way</v>

2410
02:13:43.351 --> 02:13:46.500
<v Speaker 7>that I hadn't really understood how the </v>
<v Speaker 7>brain might do that neurologically.</v>

2411
02:13:46.501 --> 02:13:47.790
<v Speaker 7>So that was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

2412
02:13:47.791 --> 02:13:50.700
<v Speaker 7>kurtzweil is this guy who thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 7>he's a smart guy,</v>

2413
02:13:51.630 --> 02:13:56.250
<v Speaker 7>very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he's invented a fair bit of high end</v>

2414
02:13:56.251 --> 02:13:57.084
<v Speaker 7>technical technological software and </v>
<v Speaker 7>hardware and he's the guy that thinks </v>

2415
02:14:02.011 --> 02:14:03.690
<v Speaker 7>that we're heading towards the </v>
<v Speaker 7>singularity.</v>

2416
02:14:03.691 --> 02:14:05.480
<v Speaker 7>And so the singularity is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2417
02:14:05.490 --> 02:14:06.323
<v Speaker 7>how processing speed doubles every 18 </v>
<v Speaker 7>months and hard disk capacity every </v>

2418
02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:11.873
<v Speaker 7>year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there's a bunch of doublings going </v>

2419
02:14:13.471 --> 02:14:14.304
<v Speaker 7>on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a huge number of them and they </v>

2420
02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:20.550
<v Speaker 7>accelerate exponentially.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so it's probably,</v>

2421
02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:21.413
<v Speaker 7>we're probably three years away,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe even less then from building a </v>

2422
02:14:25.651 --> 02:14:26.484
<v Speaker 7>computer that has the capacity to make </v>
<v Speaker 7>as many calculations as reasonable </v>

2423
02:14:31.231 --> 02:14:35.610
<v Speaker 7>estimates of the calculating capacity of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the human brain are currently set up,</v>

2424
02:14:36.150 --> 02:14:38.940
<v Speaker 7>18 months away,</v>
<v Speaker 7>two years away,</v>

2425
02:14:38.941 --> 02:14:39.840
<v Speaker 7>something like that.</v>

2426
02:14:41.630 --> 02:14:42.463
<v Speaker 7>And then we're 18 months away from </v>
<v Speaker 7>having one that's twice that fast and </v>

2427
02:14:44.941 --> 02:14:47.730
<v Speaker 7>then 18 months away from having one </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's twice as fast as that.</v>

2428
02:14:47.731 --> 02:14:48.564
<v Speaker 7>So that's like say six years</v>
<v Speaker 7>and we've got something that's eight </v>

2429
02:14:52.651 --> 02:14:56.580
<v Speaker 7>times as smart as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But there's a twist on that.</v>

2430
02:14:56.581 --> 02:14:59.480
<v Speaker 7>And this is kurtzweil twist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is as soon as you make a machine's</v>

2431
02:14:59.481 --> 02:15:02.040
<v Speaker 7>smart enough to make the next machine </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's smarter than it,</v>

2432
02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:03.233
<v Speaker 7>which is sort of what we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 7>because computers are so fast that that </v>

2433
02:15:07.381 --> 02:15:08.214
<v Speaker 7>will scale up to near infinite computing</v>
<v Speaker 7>power computing power almost </v>

2434
02:15:10.471 --> 02:15:13.500
<v Speaker 7>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

2435
02:15:14.170 --> 02:15:15.300
<v Speaker 7>let me think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2436
02:15:15.301 --> 02:15:16.134
<v Speaker 7>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And Alan Gates partner has written </v>

2437
02:15:20.281 --> 02:15:21.114
<v Speaker 7>critiques of kurtzweil and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you might think if something's </v>

2438
02:15:23.431 --> 02:15:25.820
<v Speaker 7>impossible then it won't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even if you don't know why.</v>

2439
02:15:25.821 --> 02:15:29.100
<v Speaker 7>And there's reasons to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to not think that that will happen.</v>

2440
02:15:29.101 --> 02:15:29.934
<v Speaker 7>But kurzweil's traced to back the </v>
<v Speaker 7>doubling of computing power way before </v>

2441
02:15:34.291 --> 02:15:37.980
<v Speaker 7>the existence of the transistor and it's</v>
<v Speaker 7>been ridiculously stable,</v>

2442
02:15:38.220 --> 02:15:39.053
<v Speaker 7>crazily stable,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so god only knows what we're coming up </v>

2443
02:15:42.241 --> 02:15:43.074
<v Speaker 7>with here.</v>

2444
02:15:43.530 --> 02:15:44.363
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you don't know what something have </v>

2445
02:15:45.481 --> 02:15:49.950
<v Speaker 7>infinite computing power might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you seriously don't know.</v>

2446
02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.950
<v Speaker 7>And there are serious people who are </v>
<v Speaker 7>very,</v>

2447
02:15:52.951 --> 02:15:54.660
<v Speaker 7>very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very worried about that.</v>

2448
02:15:54.661 --> 02:15:55.950
<v Speaker 7>They're very worried,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

2449
02:15:55.951 --> 02:15:59.790
<v Speaker 7>that companies like facebook and google </v>
<v Speaker 7>will manage that first.</v>

2450
02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:01.133
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tHose companies are already making </v>

2451
02:16:02.041 --> 02:16:06.090
<v Speaker 7>censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ai bots and that's not that smart.</v>

2452
02:16:06.150 --> 02:16:08.880
<v Speaker 7>It's sorta like making really fast </v>
<v Speaker 7>robots that can shoot people.</v>

2453
02:16:08.881 --> 02:16:12.180
<v Speaker 7>It's not that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And we're doing that to very rapidly.</v>

2454
02:16:12.181 --> 02:16:13.014
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know some guys who work in advanced </v>

2455
02:16:14.761 --> 02:16:16.340
<v Speaker 7>ai,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know how you look,</v>

2456
02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:17.213
<v Speaker 7>you watch the term terminator movies and</v>
<v Speaker 7>you see the robots that miss when they </v>

2457
02:16:19.891 --> 02:16:23.100
<v Speaker 7>shoot at you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like they're not very bright because the</v>

2458
02:16:23.101 --> 02:16:25.230
<v Speaker 7>bright ones not only shoot at where you </v>
<v Speaker 7>are,</v>

2459
02:16:25.231 --> 02:16:26.064
<v Speaker 7>but they estimate where you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>be when you make your escape moves and </v>

2460
02:16:28.051 --> 02:16:31.360
<v Speaker 7>they shoot their simultaneously and </v>
<v Speaker 7>their death rate is 100 percent.</v>

2461
02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:36.430
<v Speaker 7>And so there's no war against the </v>
<v Speaker 7>robots.</v>

2462
02:16:36.431 --> 02:16:37.690
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when those things get going,</v>

2463
02:16:37.691 --> 02:16:38.524
<v Speaker 7>they're going to be so much faster than </v>
<v Speaker 7>us that will look like we're moving </v>

2464
02:16:40.511 --> 02:16:43.120
<v Speaker 7>through molasses to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

2465
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.863
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so maybe what we're deciding now with </v>

2466
02:16:49.011 --> 02:16:49.844
<v Speaker 7>all of our individual decisions about </v>
<v Speaker 7>censorship and the way that we're going </v>

2467
02:16:51.861 --> 02:16:52.694
<v Speaker 7>to construct the world and all that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly what kind of super intelligence </v>

2468
02:16:55.371 --> 02:16:56.780
<v Speaker 7>we're going to bring into being.</v>

2469
02:16:57.690 --> 02:17:01.020
<v Speaker 7>And I would suggest that we try to bring</v>
<v Speaker 7>one in that's good and moral rather than</v>

2470
02:17:01.021 --> 02:17:05.100
<v Speaker 7>one that's evil and demonic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2471
02:17:05.850 --> 02:17:09.420
<v Speaker 7>So what can we do about that?</v>

2472
02:17:13.450 --> 02:17:15.340
<v Speaker 7>The.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's only one answer to that.</v>

2473
02:17:15.341 --> 02:17:19.090
<v Speaker 7>As far as I know that that works is gay </v>
<v Speaker 7>rock together.</v>

2474
02:17:20.530 --> 02:17:22.600
<v Speaker 7>You're going to be the person who is </v>
<v Speaker 7>working in ai,</v>

2475
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:25.330
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know some of these people,</v>

2476
02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:26.733
<v Speaker 7>it better be good people because they're</v>
<v Speaker 7>going to build whatever they're like </v>

2477
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:29.943
<v Speaker 7>into their machines.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They better have their heads screwed on </v>

2478
02:17:32.321 --> 02:17:35.490
<v Speaker 7>straight because they're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 7>amplified like mad.</v>

2479
02:17:35.770 --> 02:17:39.460
<v Speaker 7>And I don't like What's happening with </v>
<v Speaker 7>google and facebook and youtube.</v>

2480
02:17:39.670 --> 02:17:40.503
<v Speaker 7>They're building censorship bots </v>
<v Speaker 7>predicated on a certain kind of </v>

2481
02:17:42.810 --> 02:17:43.643
<v Speaker 7>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The kind of videology that we outlined </v>

2482
02:17:44.711 --> 02:17:47.530
<v Speaker 7>today,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a very bad idea.</v>

2483
02:17:52.730 --> 02:17:56.410
<v Speaker 7>hopefully good people will stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So then that,</v>

2484
02:17:56.420 --> 02:18:00.440
<v Speaker 7>what that means is that your moral </v>
<v Speaker 7>obligation is to be good and the way you</v>

2485
02:18:00.441 --> 02:18:05.441
<v Speaker 7>do that is first by stopping being bad </v>
<v Speaker 7>and everyone can do that a little bit.</v>

2486
02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:11.800
<v Speaker 7>So I hope that's what everyone does </v>
<v Speaker 7>because the consequences of not doing it</v>

2487
02:18:12.260 --> 02:18:14.540
<v Speaker 7>are not going to be pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They never are.</v>

2488
02:18:16.130 --> 02:18:16.963
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2489
02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:19.593
<v Speaker 7>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this question is about your biblical </v>

2490
02:18:21.010 --> 02:18:21.843
<v Speaker 7>lecture series.</v>

2491
02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:23.373
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2492
02:18:23.770 --> 02:18:25.540
<v Speaker 7>I liked that one because it's about </v>
<v Speaker 7>genesis,</v>

2493
02:18:25.541 --> 02:18:30.340
<v Speaker 7>which is usually ignored as being where </v>
<v Speaker 7>this post enlightenment society,</v>

2494
02:18:30.341 --> 02:18:31.990
<v Speaker 7>you don't need these ancient creation </v>
<v Speaker 7>myths.</v>

2495
02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:33.393
<v Speaker 7>And also I thought revelations kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>gets the same treatment has been </v>

2496
02:18:36.910 --> 02:18:41.250
<v Speaker 7>dismissed because it's the crazy </v>
<v Speaker 7>hallucinogenic trip,</v>

2497
02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:44.260
<v Speaker 7>some isolated madman in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the mediterranean.</v>

2498
02:18:44.890 --> 02:18:47.050
<v Speaker 7>So I was wondering if after you're done </v>
<v Speaker 7>with genesis,</v>

2499
02:18:47.051 --> 02:18:48.970
<v Speaker 7>if you were thinking about doing </v>
<v Speaker 7>revelations,</v>

2500
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:53.200
<v Speaker 7>not without traversing the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the geo geography in between.</v>

2501
02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:55.240
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2502
02:18:55.241 --> 02:18:58.450
<v Speaker 7>I want to walk through the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 7>if I can do that before they expire.</v>

2503
02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:01.653
<v Speaker 7>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've read it and thought about it and </v>

2504
02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:05.273
<v Speaker 7>like it's such a strange book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a because it's really big among the </v>

2505
02:19:08.021 --> 02:19:11.120
<v Speaker 7>evangelical republican types and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 7>think really,</v>

2506
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:14.930
<v Speaker 7>really that's the book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you're relying,</v>

2507
02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:16.640
<v Speaker 7>have you read it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

2508
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:17.783
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

2509
02:19:17.970 --> 02:19:20.790
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's A crazy hallucinogenic trip.</v>

2510
02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:22.600
<v Speaker 7>That's what revelation is now.</v>

2511
02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:23.493
<v Speaker 7>That's not to play it down because God </v>
<v Speaker 7>only knows about crazy hallucinogenic </v>

2512
02:19:28.701 --> 02:19:30.560
<v Speaker 7>trips,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's for sure.</v>

2513
02:19:30.710 --> 02:19:33.380
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's accruing evidence.</v>

2514
02:19:33.381 --> 02:19:34.214
<v Speaker 7>I would say that a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the religious orientation of human </v>

2515
02:19:38.001 --> 02:19:38.661
<v Speaker 7>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you Know,</v>

2516
02:19:38.661 --> 02:19:43.280
<v Speaker 7>that deep mythological,</v>
<v Speaker 7>symbolic orientation is in no small part</v>

2517
02:19:43.281 --> 02:19:44.114
<v Speaker 7>a consequence of humanities </v>
<v Speaker 7>experimentation with psychedelics </v>

2518
02:19:46.221 --> 02:19:47.980
<v Speaker 7>substances.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's,</v>

2519
02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:52.580
<v Speaker 7>that the evidence for that I think has </v>
<v Speaker 7>become virtually an overwhelming.</v>

2520
02:19:53.390 --> 02:19:56.060
<v Speaker 7>So</v>
<v Speaker 7>anyways,</v>

2521
02:19:56.061 --> 02:19:56.894
<v Speaker 7>I will get there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe probably not because at the rate </v>

2522
02:19:59.901 --> 02:20:02.870
<v Speaker 7>I'm going through the first stories,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it'll take me forever to get there,</v>

2523
02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:05.120
<v Speaker 7>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>

2524
02:20:05.410 --> 02:20:06.120
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>

2525
02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:06.953
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

2526
02:20:08.980 --> 02:20:09.940
<v Speaker 9>Dr. Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Thank you.</v>

2527
02:20:09.941 --> 02:20:11.470
<v Speaker 9>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's great.</v>

2528
02:20:11.471 --> 02:20:13.990
<v Speaker 9>Pleasure being here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's awesome to see you live.</v>

2529
02:20:14.050 --> 02:20:14.883
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I basically got into your work's just </v>

2530
02:20:17.021 --> 02:20:19.450
<v Speaker 9>earlier this year and I had an original </v>
<v Speaker 9>question,</v>

2531
02:20:19.451 --> 02:20:22.460
<v Speaker 9>but your talk today kind of made me </v>
<v Speaker 9>decide to change my mind and I was going</v>

2532
02:20:22.461 --> 02:20:23.410
<v Speaker 9>to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2533
02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:24.993
<v Speaker 9>do you feel as though would you agree </v>
<v Speaker 9>with me in the sentiment that the left </v>

2534
02:20:29.411 --> 02:20:30.244
<v Speaker 9>has pushed so hard for total control of </v>
<v Speaker 9>our society over the last however many </v>

2535
02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:37.420
<v Speaker 9>years?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's almost to a point where st 2013 was</v>

2536
02:20:37.421 --> 02:20:38.254
<v Speaker 9>a different time.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Would you say that because they pushed </v>

2537
02:20:42.551 --> 02:20:43.384
<v Speaker 9>so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they've created this backlash and the </v>

2538
02:20:45.461 --> 02:20:49.570
<v Speaker 9>backlash created caused them to backlash</v>
<v Speaker 9>back again.</v>

2539
02:20:49.571 --> 02:20:52.450
<v Speaker 9>So they doubled down with their ideology</v>
<v Speaker 9>and then they get,</v>

2540
02:20:52.990 --> 02:20:57.160
<v Speaker 9>they lose another argument,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they lose another ideological war,</v>

2541
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:58.023
<v Speaker 9>they lose,</v>
<v Speaker 9>lose another me more and they double </v>

2542
02:20:59.631 --> 02:21:02.410
<v Speaker 9>down and then doubled down again and </v>
<v Speaker 9>again.</v>

2543
02:21:02.590 --> 02:21:05.710
<v Speaker 9>And they can't seem to mean.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They can't seem to argue.</v>

2544
02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:07.150
<v Speaker 9>They can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they can't,</v>

2545
02:21:07.210 --> 02:21:09.190
<v Speaker 9>they don't want to have an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 9>discussion.</v>

2546
02:21:09.370 --> 02:21:12.730
<v Speaker 9>And as an interpretation of what you </v>
<v Speaker 9>were saying,</v>

2547
02:21:12.970 --> 02:21:15.040
<v Speaker 9>there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there doesn't seem to be any,</v>

2548
02:21:15.041 --> 02:21:17.980
<v Speaker 9>any,</v>
<v Speaker 9>any care of what's right with them.</v>

2549
02:21:18.010 --> 02:21:20.380
<v Speaker 9>They just want power.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They just want,</v>

2550
02:21:20.860 --> 02:21:22.950
<v Speaker 9>they just want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2551
02:21:22.990 --> 02:21:23.823
<v Speaker 9>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>would you agree with the sentiment that </v>

2552
02:21:25.391 --> 02:21:26.224
<v Speaker 9>they're burning themselves out and </v>
<v Speaker 9>creating the mass red pilling of the </v>

2553
02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:32.140
<v Speaker 9>conservative movement that we see going </v>
<v Speaker 9>on?</v>

2554
02:21:32.410 --> 02:21:35.620
<v Speaker 9>Would you possibly think that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 9>they've committed suicide and,</v>

2555
02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:38.860
<v Speaker 9>and talks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 9>people like yourself,</v>

2556
02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:43.240
<v Speaker 9>ben shapiro and others who talk to </v>
<v Speaker 9>people like what?</v>

2557
02:21:43.390 --> 02:21:46.090
<v Speaker 9>The subjects that we do the taboo of </v>
<v Speaker 9>nowadays,</v>

2558
02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:49.820
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>possibly that this,</v>

2559
02:21:49.821 --> 02:21:54.490
<v Speaker 9>this is the answer to defeat the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the leftist stranglehold.</v>

2560
02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:55.333
<v Speaker 9>It's society.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I</v>

2561
02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:57.110
<v Speaker 7>will untangle some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2562
02:21:57.150 --> 02:21:59.320
<v Speaker 7>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well first of all,</v>

2563
02:21:59.321 --> 02:22:00.154
<v Speaker 7>the first observation is a really </v>
<v Speaker 7>interesting one because you know that </v>

2564
02:22:02.650 --> 02:22:07.060
<v Speaker 7>things can go out of hand very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very rapidly and the reason they do that</v>

2565
02:22:07.061 --> 02:22:09.220
<v Speaker 7>is because of positive feedback loops.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

2566
02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:10.113
<v Speaker 7>the thing that kurzweil talks about is a</v>
<v Speaker 7>positive feedback loop and intelligent </v>

2567
02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:13.924
<v Speaker 7>machine makes another intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 7>machine that makes another intelligent </v>

2568
02:22:16.271 --> 02:22:17.104
<v Speaker 7>machine and that's a positive feedback </v>
<v Speaker 7>loop and now can spiral upwards out of </v>

2569
02:22:20.951 --> 02:22:23.860
<v Speaker 7>control very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's when polarization is,</v>

2570
02:22:23.861 --> 02:22:24.940
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2571
02:22:25.290 --> 02:22:26.850
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you tap me,</v>

2572
02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:30.240
<v Speaker 7>I slapped you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you punched me well up.</v>

2573
02:22:30.241 --> 02:22:31.074
<v Speaker 7>It goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's partly why in the new </v>

2574
02:22:33.481 --> 02:22:34.530
<v Speaker 7>testament,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

2575
02:22:34.531 --> 02:22:38.100
<v Speaker 7>there's an injunction that says,</v>
<v Speaker 7>turn the other cheek,</v>

2576
02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:41.250
<v Speaker 7>resist not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

2577
02:22:42.630 --> 02:22:43.463
<v Speaker 7>Because otherwise you get into a </v>
<v Speaker 7>positive feedback loop and then you </v>

2578
02:22:45.391 --> 02:22:48.180
<v Speaker 7>better look the hell out and things can </v>
<v Speaker 7>tilt very,</v>

2579
02:22:48.181 --> 02:22:49.020
<v Speaker 7>very rapidly.</v>

2580
02:22:49.290 --> 02:22:50.160
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all you have to do,</v>

2581
02:22:50.190 --> 02:22:52.530
<v Speaker 7>look at what happened in world war one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No one expected that.</v>

2582
02:22:52.531 --> 02:22:53.364
<v Speaker 7>It waS like one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one relatively minor member I think of </v>

2583
02:22:59.311 --> 02:23:01.290
<v Speaker 7>the aristocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I remember correctly,</v>

2584
02:23:01.291 --> 02:23:04.560
<v Speaker 7>waS assassinated in one minor little </v>
<v Speaker 7>Country.</v>

2585
02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:05.433
<v Speaker 7>It's like bang,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everything fell apart and that's </v>

2586
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:09.690
<v Speaker 7>positive feedback loops.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2587
02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:12.400
<v Speaker 7>And so that's what we're in right now </v>
<v Speaker 7>and we've got to be.</v>

2588
02:23:12.610 --> 02:23:13.443
<v Speaker 7>That's a really chaotic time and so I </v>
<v Speaker 7>would say maintain self control and </v>

2589
02:23:18.781 --> 02:23:21.150
<v Speaker 7>don't aim to win.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Amen.</v>

2590
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:23.340
<v Speaker 7>Peace.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because winning,</v>

2591
02:23:23.341 --> 02:23:24.900
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not peace.</v>

2592
02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:27.480
<v Speaker 7>It's better to aim for pace.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2593
02:23:27.570 --> 02:23:29.910
<v Speaker 7>I've got this tart coming up in November</v>
<v Speaker 7>11th.</v>

2594
02:23:30.770 --> 02:23:31.603
<v Speaker 7>I'm quite worried about it because I </v>
<v Speaker 7>know there's going to be protesters </v>

2595
02:23:33.631 --> 02:23:34.464
<v Speaker 7>there and that they've been emboldened </v>
<v Speaker 7>by the fact that they shut the torque </v>

2596
02:23:36.330 --> 02:23:37.163
<v Speaker 7>down before and I want to make a video.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'Ll probably do it tomorrow telling </v>

2597
02:23:40.261 --> 02:23:41.094
<v Speaker 7>everyone that comes to that meeting to </v>
<v Speaker 7>like watch their bloody step and stay </v>

2598
02:23:45.450 --> 02:23:50.450
<v Speaker 7>out of the gutter because you just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're at,</v>

2599
02:23:51.490 --> 02:23:52.260
<v Speaker 7>we're at.</v>

2600
02:23:52.260 --> 02:23:55.740
<v Speaker 7>We're at a point now where under the </v>
<v Speaker 7>wrong circumstances,</v>

2601
02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:58.500
<v Speaker 7>if the wrong person does the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing,</v>

2602
02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:01.200
<v Speaker 7>that the consequences will be very </v>
<v Speaker 7>great.</v>

2603
02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:06.230
<v Speaker 7>Now we can't predict which action is </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to precipitate that and or even if</v>

2604
02:24:07.831 --> 02:24:12.060
<v Speaker 7>that will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's chaotic enough so that it could</v>

2605
02:24:12.061 --> 02:24:14.090
<v Speaker 7>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>

2606
02:24:14.091 --> 02:24:18.540
<v Speaker 7>so govern yourselves accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now the problem is that there are people</v>

2607
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:21.330
<v Speaker 7>who would be happy if there was blood </v>
<v Speaker 7>running in the street.</v>

2608
02:24:21.450 --> 02:24:24.690
<v Speaker 7>They the same sort of people that shoot </v>
<v Speaker 7>up high schools or kill innocent,</v>

2609
02:24:24.990 --> 02:24:27.930
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>elementary school kids just to show what</v>

2610
02:24:27.931 --> 02:24:30.870
<v Speaker 7>they're made of and what they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's a big problem.</v>

2611
02:24:30.871 --> 02:24:34.380
<v Speaker 7>But for the rest of us,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like hopefully calmer heads can prevail.</v>

2612
02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:36.810
<v Speaker 7>And so it really is important not to </v>
<v Speaker 7>win.</v>

2613
02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:38.753
<v Speaker 7>It's like fighting with your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't when you can't because you </v>

2614
02:24:43.141 --> 02:24:44.040
<v Speaker 7>have to live with her.</v>

2615
02:24:44.310 --> 02:24:45.143
<v Speaker 7>I just can't win,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but maybe you can solve the problem and </v>

2616
02:24:47.671 --> 02:24:48.504
<v Speaker 7>bring about peace and so you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 7>practice doing that practice restraint </v>

2617
02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:53.793
<v Speaker 7>now and remember too that these people </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you're talking about who had </v>

2618
02:24:56.521 --> 02:25:01.521
<v Speaker 7>radical leftist is most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not like they're 95 percent like</v>

2619
02:25:02.071 --> 02:25:06.870
<v Speaker 7>you and if you pull them out of the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're just like your neighbors.</v>

2620
02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:10.620
<v Speaker 7>Nineteen year old kid who's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>clueless and rebellious.</v>

2621
02:25:10.621 --> 02:25:13.950
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And who you might even like you put them</v>

2622
02:25:13.951 --> 02:25:15.510
<v Speaker 7>in the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's a whole different thing.</v>

2623
02:25:15.511 --> 02:25:17.550
<v Speaker 7>And so you got to remember that too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2624
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:22.250
<v Speaker 7>the fear of social isolation kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're saying no,</v>

2625
02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:24.850
<v Speaker 7>it's just that they're possessed by </v>
<v Speaker 7>these ideas,</v>

2626
02:25:24.851 --> 02:25:26.650
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but only partially,</v>

2627
02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:30.670
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you hardly find it full blooded.</v>

2628
02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:34.240
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely committed radical leftist </v>
<v Speaker 7>activist,</v>

2629
02:25:34.241 --> 02:25:36.190
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like there are some but not very many.</v>

2630
02:25:36.191 --> 02:25:37.024
<v Speaker 7>Most of it is just fragmentary behavior </v>
<v Speaker 7>and you have to remember that like when </v>

2631
02:25:41.111 --> 02:25:43.690
<v Speaker 7>the students come out to protest me was </v>
<v Speaker 7>a case,</v>

2632
02:25:43.691 --> 02:25:45.010
<v Speaker 7>particularly at mcmaster.</v>

2633
02:25:45.010 --> 02:25:50.010
<v Speaker 7>I have to remember these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not much different than my kids.</v>

2634
02:25:51.970 --> 02:25:55.390
<v Speaker 7>They are when they're in a stupid mob </v>
<v Speaker 7>behind a hammer and sickle flag,</v>

2635
02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:56.590
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

2636
02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:57.423
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but</v>

2637
02:25:59.290 --> 02:26:04.290
<v Speaker 7>you don't want to make a low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 7>homogenous representation of them and so</v>

2638
02:26:06.370 --> 02:26:07.930
<v Speaker 7>and so you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why,</v>

2639
02:26:07.931 --> 02:26:09.400
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think instead of winning,</v>

2640
02:26:09.401 --> 02:26:12.610
<v Speaker 7>you turn to your own development,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you turn to your own development,</v>

2641
02:26:12.611 --> 02:26:13.444
<v Speaker 7>you do what you can to stop doing the </v>
<v Speaker 7>things that you're doing that aren't </v>

2642
02:26:16.301 --> 02:26:19.030
<v Speaker 7>good because you're not going to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 7>anybody if you do that.</v>

2643
02:26:19.031 --> 02:26:19.864
<v Speaker 7>All you're going to do is help and </v>
<v Speaker 7>otherwise you'll participate in this </v>

2644
02:26:22.481 --> 02:26:27.160
<v Speaker 7>polarization and that's unless you want </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

2645
02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:28.153
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a dark part of people that it's </v>

2646
02:26:30.130 --> 02:26:34.120
<v Speaker 7>part of the part that voted for trump </v>
<v Speaker 7>would like to burn things to the ground.</v>

2647
02:26:34.450 --> 02:26:35.283
<v Speaker 7>It's like to help.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know how people felt when they went </v>

2648
02:26:36.851 --> 02:26:37.510
<v Speaker 7>into the voting booth.</v>

2649
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:39.700
<v Speaker 7>It was like hillary hillary to hell with</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2650
02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:40.930
<v Speaker 7>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2651
02:26:40.931 --> 02:26:41.764
<v Speaker 7>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a hell of a thing to say to hell </v>

2652
02:26:43.271 --> 02:26:44.470
<v Speaker 7>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know.</v>

2653
02:26:44.830 --> 02:26:45.663
<v Speaker 7>Although I could,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could certainly understand that </v>

2654
02:26:46.901 --> 02:26:47.734
<v Speaker 7>sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we have to be careful and all of you </v>

2655
02:26:52.001 --> 02:26:52.834
<v Speaker 7>people who are here who are advocates of</v>
<v Speaker 7>free speech and who are theoretically </v>

2656
02:26:57.880 --> 02:26:58.713
<v Speaker 7>happy to come hear me speak,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like I really do believe it are </v>

2657
02:27:00.641 --> 02:27:01.474
<v Speaker 7>truly believed this and this is </v>
<v Speaker 7>something I learned in part from social </v>

2658
02:27:03.521 --> 02:27:05.080
<v Speaker 7>units and then part from you all missed </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

2659
02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:06.273
<v Speaker 7>The way that you set the world straight </v>
<v Speaker 7>is by constraining the malevolence in </v>

2660
02:27:10.661 --> 02:27:12.790
<v Speaker 7>your own heart.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's no joke,</v>

2661
02:27:12.791 --> 02:27:13.624
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's no easy thing and that's a good </v>

2662
02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:16.473
<v Speaker 7>voyage for people to go on if they want </v>
<v Speaker 7>something difficult and worthwhile to </v>

2663
02:27:19.181 --> 02:27:20.410
<v Speaker 7>do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>

2664
02:27:21.310 --> 02:27:22.143
<v Speaker 7>Thank you very much.</v>

2665
02:27:23.940 --> 02:27:25.650
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 10>just a quick thing.</v>

2666
02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:27.780
<v Speaker 10>We're not going to have time for </v>
<v Speaker 10>pictures,</v>

2667
02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:28.673
<v Speaker 10>so you're.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Unless you're yours is the last </v>

2668
02:27:30.391 --> 02:27:31.320
<v Speaker 10>question.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

2669
02:27:31.321 --> 02:27:34.050
<v Speaker 10>So sorry to everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but you're the last one.</v>

2670
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:35.063
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

2671
02:27:39.410 --> 02:27:40.890
<v Speaker 11>Hi Dr. Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Thanks for coming.</v>

2672
02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:41.813
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>my question is a little bit off topic </v>

2673
02:27:44.041 --> 02:27:46.830
<v Speaker 11>from everything else tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I really wanted to hear what you had</v>

2674
02:27:46.831 --> 02:27:47.810
<v Speaker 11>to say about it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

2675
02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:53.660
<v Speaker 11>I work in residence life here at ubc and</v>
<v Speaker 11>in the community where I am,</v>

2676
02:27:55.291 --> 02:27:56.124
<v Speaker 11>we were recently effected by a suicide </v>
<v Speaker 11>of someone who lived in our community </v>

2677
02:28:00.751 --> 02:28:01.584
<v Speaker 11>and that I was upset about it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>not just because obviously it's a </v>

2678
02:28:03.541 --> 02:28:04.374
<v Speaker 11>horrible thing to have happen,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but also because rez life in the </v>

2679
02:28:07.621 --> 02:28:08.454
<v Speaker 11>university,</v>
<v Speaker 11>like they talk all this talk about self </v>

2680
02:28:10.171 --> 02:28:13.320
<v Speaker 11>care and your mental health is so </v>
<v Speaker 11>important to us.</v>

2681
02:28:13.321 --> 02:28:15.700
<v Speaker 11>But then things like this still </v>
<v Speaker 11>happened.</v>

2682
02:28:15.701 --> 02:28:18.750
<v Speaker 11>So I wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>like if you think like,</v>

2683
02:28:18.751 --> 02:28:21.030
<v Speaker 11>what do you think the university should </v>
<v Speaker 11>be doing?</v>

2684
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 11>Keep stuff</v>

2685
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:23.330
<v Speaker 7>like this from happening in the future?</v>

2686
02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:27.933
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2687
02:28:30.820 --> 02:28:31.653
<v Speaker 7>it's not self evident that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 7>university's responsibility and the </v>

2688
02:28:36.401 --> 02:28:38.620
<v Speaker 7>reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying it isn't.</v>

2689
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:39.520
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>

2690
02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:40.353
<v Speaker 7>I'm saying it's not self evident that it</v>
<v Speaker 7>is because different institutions can </v>

2691
02:28:44.291 --> 02:28:46.020
<v Speaker 7>only do so many things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2692
02:28:46.030 --> 02:28:46.863
<v Speaker 7>and we were already requiring that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>university is to educate and to act as </v>

2693
02:28:51.850 --> 02:28:56.800
<v Speaker 7>substitute parents increasingly and to </v>
<v Speaker 7>take on the role of judge,</v>

2694
02:28:57.370 --> 02:28:58.203
<v Speaker 7>jury and executioner as there are more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What should be criminal cases are being </v>

2695
02:29:05.311 --> 02:29:07.230
<v Speaker 7>handled within the university.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Say,</v>

2696
02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:09.033
<v Speaker 5>um.</v>

2697
02:29:12.650 --> 02:29:15.230
<v Speaker 7>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you could ask the broader question is,</v>

2698
02:29:15.231 --> 02:29:16.064
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do you do to help people be </v>

2699
02:29:19.041 --> 02:29:23.380
<v Speaker 7>sufficiently in love with life so that </v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't wish to end it now?</v>

2700
02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:24.253
<v Speaker 7>And I've tried to puzzle through that </v>
<v Speaker 7>for a long time and that's partly why </v>

2701
02:29:27.501 --> 02:29:29.030
<v Speaker 7>I've written the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 7>written.</v>

2702
02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:32.390
<v Speaker 7>It's partly why I've produced the online</v>
<v Speaker 7>programs that I've produced,</v>

2703
02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:36.800
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so we know that if you do,</v>

2704
02:29:36.860 --> 02:29:38.930
<v Speaker 7>if you have students do the future </v>
<v Speaker 7>authoring program,</v>

2705
02:29:38.931 --> 02:29:39.764
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're much less likely to drop out of </v>

2706
02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:43.970
<v Speaker 7>university about 30 percent less likely </v>
<v Speaker 7>and their grades go up.</v>

2707
02:29:43.971 --> 02:29:48.440
<v Speaker 7>And That's especially true if they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>male and marginalized.</v>

2708
02:29:48.620 --> 02:29:50.780
<v Speaker 7>It has a bigger impact on those </v>
<v Speaker 7>communities.</v>

2709
02:29:51.290 --> 02:29:52.160
<v Speaker 7>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2710
02:29:52.161 --> 02:29:54.680
<v Speaker 7>I've tried to get university's interests</v>
<v Speaker 7>now the data's there,</v>

2711
02:29:54.681 --> 02:29:55.514
<v Speaker 7>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's very difficult to get a big </v>

2712
02:29:57.381 --> 02:29:58.370
<v Speaker 7>bureaucracy to move.</v>

2713
02:29:58.370 --> 02:30:02.000
<v Speaker 7>A big,</v>
<v Speaker 7>big is immobile.</v>

2714
02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:06.680
<v Speaker 7>So I'm not sure there's anything they </v>
<v Speaker 7>can really do about it.</v>

2715
02:30:07.130 --> 02:30:07.963
<v Speaker 7>It's certainly possible that the things </v>
<v Speaker 7>that they're trying to do about it or </v>

2716
02:30:09.891 --> 02:30:11.340
<v Speaker 7>making it worse,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2717
02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:14.070
<v Speaker 7>that's another thing that you learn if </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're a good social scientists.</v>

2718
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:14.923
<v Speaker 7>Just like there was evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I don't know if this is still the </v>

2719
02:30:17.211 --> 02:30:19.160
<v Speaker 7>case,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there was good evidence.</v>

2720
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:23.210
<v Speaker 7>I looked into this about 15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Say you want to prevent suicides,</v>

2721
02:30:23.211 --> 02:30:27.200
<v Speaker 7>produce suicide hotline in your town and</v>
<v Speaker 7>you advertise it.</v>

2722
02:30:27.260 --> 02:30:28.093
<v Speaker 7>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Suicide rate goes up because you're </v>

2723
02:30:30.531 --> 02:30:32.900
<v Speaker 7>advertising suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2724
02:30:33.050 --> 02:30:35.390
<v Speaker 7>And lots of lots of interventions are </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>

2725
02:30:35.391 --> 02:30:36.224
<v Speaker 7>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really hard to make thinGs better and </v>

2726
02:30:38.601 --> 02:30:40.970
<v Speaker 7>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really easy to make them worse.</v>

2727
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:44.600
<v Speaker 7>And so that's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You get these big bureaucracies,</v>

2728
02:30:44.601 --> 02:30:45.434
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and there hypothetically motivated by </v>

2729
02:30:46.521 --> 02:30:49.070
<v Speaker 7>positive intentions and I would say </v>
<v Speaker 7>hypothetically,</v>

2730
02:30:49.071 --> 02:30:51.470
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because it takes an awful lot of work to</v>

2731
02:30:51.471 --> 02:30:53.630
<v Speaker 7>help someone straightened out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's no joke,</v>

2732
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:57.890
<v Speaker 7>especially if they're in real trouble </v>
<v Speaker 7>and they put in place these</v>

2733
02:30:59.690 --> 02:31:00.523
<v Speaker 7>structures that are designed to help but</v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't ever evaluate them and they </v>

2734
02:31:03.591 --> 02:31:06.980
<v Speaker 7>could easily be making it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>

2735
02:31:09.710 --> 02:31:11.930
<v Speaker 7>So I don't have a straightforward answer</v>
<v Speaker 7>to that question.</v>

2736
02:31:12.820 --> 02:31:14.870
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that.</v>

2737
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:17.190
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>

2738
02:31:17.190 --> 02:31:18.870
<v Speaker 7>that's the only answer I have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2739
02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:19.793
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2740
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:21.390
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2741
02:31:21.391 --> 02:31:23.170
<v Speaker 2>So that's the end of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2742
02:31:23.490 --> 02:31:24.323
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the first two rows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can stick around and get some </v>

2743
02:31:25.861 --> 02:31:26.820
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

2744
02:31:26.821 --> 02:31:31.821
<v Speaker 2>a drive safe and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
