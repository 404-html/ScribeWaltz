<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's January 15th a few weeks ago in a</v>

2
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:10.940
<v Speaker 1>discussion with Dave Ruben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I announced that I would be closing my</v>

3
00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:15.941
<v Speaker 1>patrion account as of today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I am doing so as Dave has or will</v>

4
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>shortly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not pleased about this in any way</v>

5
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>and patrons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovative service helped me a lot when</v>

6
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I was first in trouble because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos I made criticizing the Canadian</v>

7
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>compelled speech bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see 16 and the University of Toronto's</v>

8
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:37.961
<v Speaker 1>forest anti-biased training policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think what patron has</v>

9
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>decided to do in the case of Sar gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a cad.</v>

10
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Carl Benjamin was right and I think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>sets a bad precedent so that's that</v>

11
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm actively working on an alternative</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform has a competitor to patron.</v>

12
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>In the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've set up a simple rather featureless</v>

13
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:00.920
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is now where the support bar on</v>

14
00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:03.590
<v Speaker 1>the lower left hand side of my videos</v>
<v Speaker 1>points.</v>

15
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>This is for those who would like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue their patronage or begin his</v>

16
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:12.830
<v Speaker 1>new supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My financial situation has stabilized</v>

17
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:17.600
<v Speaker 1>substantially since I originally set up</v>
<v Speaker 1>a patron account and I did it then in</v>

18
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>March of 2016 to see if I could fund</v>
<v Speaker 1>further development of my youtube</v>

19
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:25.130
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not and has never been ad</v>

20
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>supported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

21
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>it seems that a substantial number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to indicate and provide</v>

22
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:36.971
<v Speaker 1>their support on a continued basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling inclined by all appearances to</v>

23
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:41.120
<v Speaker 1>provide something reciprocal in return</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the content they have been provided</v>

24
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:44.060
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I would likely continue to</v>

25
00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:49.061
<v Speaker 1>generate video content in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing all that support definitely</v>

26
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:53.750
<v Speaker 1>incentivizes me on an ongoing basis to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make generating youtube content,</v>

27
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top priority as well as allowing me to</v>

28
00:01:56.151 --> 00:02:01.151
<v Speaker 1>continue to fund the small team I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on an online education project.</v>

29
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I've discussed a bit in various</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews in the past,</v>

30
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>about 5,000 of my patrons have already</v>
<v Speaker 1>left the platform in protest,</v>

31
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>so I'm already down to about half the</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of subscribers I once had.</v>

32
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Approximately 2,500 of these have</v>
<v Speaker 1>transferred their support to the</v>

33
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>alternative I spoke of earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although an unknowable proportion of</v>

34
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:29.471
<v Speaker 1>this 2,500 have new lease signed on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much to all my patrons</v>

35
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>and all my viewers and listeners and</v>
<v Speaker 1>readers for their past support and to</v>

36
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:38.600
<v Speaker 1>all of those who have transferred their</v>
<v Speaker 1>contributions to the alternative system.</v>

37
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.470
<v Speaker 1>So let's see how this goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have it set up here to delete.</v>

38
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>We'll see right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disabled my account.</v>

39
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're goes,</v>

40
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.440
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 I have to withdraw $11 and 21 cents</v>

41
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>it looks like that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see now if I can do this</v>

42
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.030
<v Speaker 1>one more step by the looks of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>

43
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.840
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right there.</v>

44
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>It's nighttime in Switzerland where I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

45
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I tried to sign in and it's</v>

46
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>definitely gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just thought I'd let you know that.</v>

47
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Thanks again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk to you soon.</v>

48
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I've got a couple of new youtube videos</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll be up in the next week</v>

49
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>and I'll see those of you who are coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my shows in California and New</v>

50
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Zealand and Australia over the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

51
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Bye Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>
