00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this,</v>

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>there's this spirit of good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.123
<v Speaker 1>and what the spirit of good does is act </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world on the potential of the </v>

4
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 1>world to generate the actuality of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>And the Judeo Christian proposition is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you confront the potential of</v>

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>the world with good in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using truth,</v>

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>truthful communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the order that you extract is good.</v>

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.703
<v Speaker 1>And then that's echoed in genesis when </v>
<v Speaker 1>God is using the word and he creates </v>

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>cosmos out of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every time he does that,</v>

10
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was good.</v>

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.533
<v Speaker 1>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so interesting because </v>

12
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.863
<v Speaker 1>there's a proposition there and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition there is that if you </v>

13
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>encounter potential with truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos you create is actually good.</v>

14
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.243
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

15
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>that's just an absolutely overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

16
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it's true,</v>

17
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>it's the greatest idea there ever was.</v>
