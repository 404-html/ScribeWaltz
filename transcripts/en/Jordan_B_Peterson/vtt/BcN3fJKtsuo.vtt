1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't</v>

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>back down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can stand up at the gates of hell,</v>

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>but I won't.</v>

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 2>In the first video I posted this </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

5
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:21.034
<v Speaker 2>I read a letter from a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 2>student activist groups calling for my </v>

6
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:27.490
<v Speaker 2>silencing apology and discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this video,</v>

7
00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to read a similar letter from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a branch of the Canadian Union of public</v>

8
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:36.931
<v Speaker 2>employees asking for similar measures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is the second letter.</v>

9
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 2>This is from the Canadian Union of </v>
<v Speaker 2>public employees.</v>

10
00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:41.644
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's from one branch of the Canadian </v>

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Union of public employees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

12
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.933
<v Speaker 2>I should also note that another </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of the Canadian Union of </v>

13
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.820
<v Speaker 2>public employees actually came and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to me yesterday on,</v>

14
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.723
<v Speaker 2>on something unrelated to this about his</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear that the new university sexual </v>

15
00:00:56.501 --> 00:01:00.160
<v Speaker 2>harassment policy is so broad and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>wide that it risks,</v>

16
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.083
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turning normal misunderstandings into </v>

17
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 2>career destroying a debacle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

18
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just telling you that so that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that,</v>

19
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not homogeneity on the left and,</v>

20
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.373
<v Speaker 2>and there's not homogenous eat within </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Canadian Union public employees </v>

21
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

22
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what they want.</v>

23
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.923
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson's comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make the U of t a hostile place to work </v>

24
00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:26.830
<v Speaker 2>and study as queer people who study and </v>
<v Speaker 2>work at the University of Toronto.</v>

25
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.903
<v Speaker 2>We have the right to fully access all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the resources of the university without </v>

26
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:30.934
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the right to enter and </v>

27
00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 2>participate in every classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every lab,</v>

28
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 2>library,</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletic facility,</v>

29
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:35.854
<v Speaker 2>in event space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have the right to participate as </v>

30
00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:38.224
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the right to go to work and be </v>

31
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:41.134
<v Speaker 2>treated with dignity and respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know no one and explanation of much </v>

32
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.390
<v Speaker 2>less a defense of our gender or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality.</v>

33
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.253
<v Speaker 2>We sit insist on a truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so simple that it shouldn't need to be </v>

34
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:50.464
<v Speaker 2>stated that we have not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychology professor has who has never </v>

35
00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 2>met us are the authorities on our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>identities and yes,</v>

36
00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:56.554
<v Speaker 2>we have the right to be recognized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>referred to as we are in the ways we </v>

37
00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:00.280
<v Speaker 2>choose reviews to low.</v>

38
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Least of all,</v>

39
00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:02.284
<v Speaker 2>someone who could be our professor or </v>
<v Speaker 2>our work supervisor to the side that he </v>

40
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 2>knows better who we are and what is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right way to refer to us.</v>

41
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Speaker 2>If insisting on this kind of recognition</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems petty or an unimportant to som,</v>

42
00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:12.994
<v Speaker 2>we remind them of our long and </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuing struggle as queer people to </v>

43
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:18.400
<v Speaker 2>gain the same rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedoms and recognitions enjoyed by CIS</v>

44
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 2>straight people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CIS.</v>

45
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.550
<v Speaker 2>That's a word I really don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way we remind that's manufactured</v>

46
00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 2>word and that's exactly the kind of word</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I not ever going to be compelled to</v>

47
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:31.000
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We remind them that for us going to work</v>

48
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.210
<v Speaker 2>already involves daily Calculus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation by situation,</v>

49
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 2>colleague by calling of what and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much of ourselves to reveal.</v>

50
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.313
<v Speaker 2>We have to remain conscious of all at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all times of the details of our lives </v>

51
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 2>that may make us physically unsafe.</v>

52
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.023
<v Speaker 2>Prompt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humiliating questions lead to social </v>

53
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:45.394
<v Speaker 2>alienation or takeaway our chance next </v>
<v Speaker 2>employment contract we desperately need </v>

54
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 2>in this city in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not safe to be a queer person.</v>

55
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.993
<v Speaker 2>That's why we had a month long pride </v>
<v Speaker 2>festival last year and it is especially </v>

56
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.003
<v Speaker 2>safe to be a trans or gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonconforming person at the University </v>

57
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.813
<v Speaker 2>of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our commitment must not only be to </v>

58
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>protect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to affirm and elevate our colleagues</v>

59
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>who faced discrimination in danger in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their daily lives.</v>

60
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 2>We should be proactive in inviting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that the default expectation</v>

61
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>for queer people is that we will not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>welcomed in new environments.</v>

62
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.114
<v Speaker 2>We entered and stand reason comments by </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor Jordan Peterson have </v>

63
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 2>communicated that in some parts of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>working lives,</v>

64
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 2>trans and gender nonconforming people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not welcome,</v>

65
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>that will be denied basic recognition of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our humanity,</v>

66
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.263
<v Speaker 2>that we will be called delusional and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lectured to and that a potential </v>

67
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.534
<v Speaker 2>supervisor will be given authority to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide who we really are and how we </v>

68
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:34.564
<v Speaker 2>should be referred to at work in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>unions will view this situation </v>

69
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:39.034
<v Speaker 2>constitutes a clear and unacceptable </v>
<v Speaker 2>violation of our human rights and our </v>

70
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:42.934
<v Speaker 2>workplace rights.</v>

71
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.773
<v Speaker 2>It has also a violation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective agreements we negotiate with </v>

72
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 2>the university to set the terms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations of our working lives.</v>

73
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.073
<v Speaker 2>These collective agreements guarantee US</v>
<v Speaker 2>protection from quote verbal conduct or </v>

74
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 2>other forms of communication that </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasize the sex,</v>

75
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:56.854
<v Speaker 2>sexuality or gender identity or </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression of an employee in a manner </v>

76
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.650
<v Speaker 2>that the actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 2>he Jordan Peterson knows or ought </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably to know,</v>

78
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 2>is unwelcome or creates an intimidating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hostile or offensive working or learning</v>

79
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:08.674
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor Peterson ought reasonably to </v>

80
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 2>know that refusing to his dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his students and his tds as they request</v>

81
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 2>to be addressed and deriding their </v>
<v Speaker 2>identities in public by.</v>

82
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:18.514
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that means is unwelcome behavior </v>

83
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:21.844
<v Speaker 2>that makes his classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his department and his university </v>

84
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 2>intimidating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hostile or offensive for us.</v>

85
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.013
<v Speaker 2>The UFT administration ought reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know that when comments are made </v>

86
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.483
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to be swiftly and </v>

87
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:32.344
<v Speaker 2>categorically condemned and appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions need to be taken to restore a </v>

88
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 2>workplace free of intimidation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hostility.</v>

89
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.303
<v Speaker 2>But in case any of our managers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>supervisors didn't understand that </v>

90
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:42.454
<v Speaker 2>actions like professor Peterson's and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the silence of the university </v>

91
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:47.040
<v Speaker 2>administration in response are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unwelcomed,</v>

92
00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 2>hostile and offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let us be the ones to tell you they are.</v>

93
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.573
<v Speaker 2>And now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we expect and demand better and our </v>

94
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 2>union will be organizing and acting </v>
<v Speaker 2>accordingly.</v>

95
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Sincerely,</v>
