WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.423
<v Speaker 2>so we started to talk a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenology last time and about Carl </v>

3
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.743
<v Speaker 2>Rogers and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned that the phenomenologists </v>

4
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 2>were interested in experience in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense as the ultimate reality and that's</v>

5
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a very complicated concept to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to grasp</v>

6
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 2>the existentialists</v>
<v Speaker 2>also adopted that viewpoint.</v>

7
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 2>They were concerned with the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjective experience,</v>

8
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 2>not that they were ignoring the reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>of object of experience,</v>

9
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:49.464
<v Speaker 2>but they were concerned with the reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>of subjective experience and they're </v>

10
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 2>also more focused on action then on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on statement or belief.</v>

11
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 2>Here's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think about this for a very long</v>

12
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:01.764
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to understand what </v>

13
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:04.734
<v Speaker 2>someone believes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're trying to analyze their </v>

14
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:11.571
<v Speaker 2>representations of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should you pay attention to how they act</v>

15
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:16.851
<v Speaker 2>or what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a profound question even from</v>

16
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:17.964
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a neurological perspective or a </v>

17
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:21.624
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychological perspective because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the memory system that you use to </v>

18
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:26.484
<v Speaker 2>represent what you say that you believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not the same memory system that you </v>

19
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:34.971
<v Speaker 2>use to embody your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your knowledge about action.</v>

20
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a can.</v>

21
00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:39.304
<v Speaker 2>I would say to the distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling someone how to ride a bike and </v>

22
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 2>knowing how to ride a bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are not the same things.</v>

23
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.313
<v Speaker 2>The descriptions don't even really lay </v>
<v Speaker 2>very well on top of one another because </v>

24
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 2>you don't actually know how you ride a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bike.</v>

25
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 2>You just know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's built into your physiology,</v>

26
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a skill,</v>

27
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.873
<v Speaker 2>and that's called procedural memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Procedural memory is the same kind of </v>

28
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 2>memory that basically structures your </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptions.</v>

29
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.583
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you can't orient your </v>

30
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.323
<v Speaker 2>perceptions consciously because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you've oriented them </v>

31
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 2>consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say towards some goal,</v>

32
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.533
<v Speaker 2>it's automatic procedures that take over</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you really don't know how it is </v>

33
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 2>that you organize your senses so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pay attention.</v>

34
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 2>You just know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

35
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:29.781
<v Speaker 2>the existentialists believed that</v>
<v Speaker 2>actions spoke louder than words and that</v>

36
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:36.351
<v Speaker 2>if you were interested in belief and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you were interested in analyzing</v>

37
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:37.644
<v Speaker 2>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was better for you to look at </v>

38
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 2>how someone acted than what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

39
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you might think </v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to rogers</v>

40
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 2>is that his psychotherapeutic practice </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be predicated on the idea that you</v>

41
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:58.941
<v Speaker 2>should bring how you act into alignment </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what you say you believe,</v>

42
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 2>so that there was no discontinuity in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your between your body.</v>

43
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:05.374
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind and so that there are fewer </v>

44
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 2>paradoxes in your</v>

45
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.720
<v Speaker 2>in the way that you manifest yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

46
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.993
<v Speaker 2>So the concentration on auction is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the fundamental characteristics of </v>

47
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 2>existentialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another one is</v>

48
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.193
<v Speaker 2>the insistence upon trouble and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering as an intrinsic element of </v>

49
00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:37.500
<v Speaker 2>human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say,</v>

50
00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:39.510
<v Speaker 2>we could concentrate on subjective </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

51
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.210
<v Speaker 2>What's your life like to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you experience it?</v>

52
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.620
<v Speaker 2>And we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

53
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:48.621
<v Speaker 2>built into that is trouble built into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is chaos built into that is anxiety</v>

54
00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:49.524
<v Speaker 2>and pain and disease and and that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can fall prey to those things without </v>

55
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:56.694
<v Speaker 2>there being something wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know if you pin down a </v>

56
00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:00.144
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalyst like younger Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would of course admit that human </v>

57
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.663
<v Speaker 2>misery is endemic to human experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Freud in particular tend to look </v>

58
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.630
<v Speaker 2>tended to look for adult psychopathology</v>
<v Speaker 2>in childhood,</v>

59
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Miss Adventure in childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in pathological childhood experience,</v>

60
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:20.514
<v Speaker 2>and he at least implicitly claimed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hadn't experienced childhood </v>

61
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:30.300
<v Speaker 2>trauma and you had developed properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what would happen is that you would</v>

62
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:35.301
<v Speaker 2>end up healthy roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly mentally sound,</v>

63
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.610
<v Speaker 2>but the existentialist centrally by that</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

64
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:42.330
<v Speaker 2>right from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically make a different claim,</v>

65
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:46.080
<v Speaker 2>which is that life is so full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic misery,</v>

66
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.943
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but suffering is a better way of </v>

67
00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:49.014
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suffering that manifests itself as a </v>

68
00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:54.090
<v Speaker 2>consequence of your intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability,</v>

69
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.500
<v Speaker 2>that psychopathology is built into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human experience.</v>

70
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.040
<v Speaker 2>There's no real way of avoiding it or at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least</v>

71
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.230
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to look for extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>causes.</v>

72
00:05:07.231 --> 00:05:10.140
<v Speaker 2>That might be a better way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and</v>

73
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.270
<v Speaker 2>you'd be surprised how often that sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of observation is useful for.</v>

74
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.130
<v Speaker 2>For clinical clients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

75
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:20.280
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic about people,</v>

76
00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:22.800
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're introverted and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have very many friends,</v>

77
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:25.500
<v Speaker 2>they don't have people to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're suffering,</v>

78
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.363
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're depressed or anxious or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some sets of strange symptoms </v>

79
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:32.130
<v Speaker 2>like agoraphobic or obsessive compulsive</v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder.</v>

80
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.653
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they always presume </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is that the fact that they're </v>

81
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:38.634
<v Speaker 2>suffering in that manner means that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something not only something </v>

82
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:46.011
<v Speaker 2>wrong with them but something uniquely </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with them so that it's their fault</v>

83
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.333
<v Speaker 2>and no one else is like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things you do as a </v>

84
00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:51.480
<v Speaker 2>diagnostician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:56.481
<v Speaker 2>you'll hear a lot of rattling about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>labeling is bad for people and certainly</v>

86
00:05:58.731 --> 00:05:59.564
<v Speaker 2>mislabeling is bad for people and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>an accurate label can be a box that you </v>

87
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 2>can't get out of.</v>

88
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.323
<v Speaker 2>But it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very frequently the case that if you </v>

89
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>diagnose someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a relief to them.</v>

90
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:10.334
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't believe because they come</v>
<v Speaker 2>in to see you knowing that something </v>

91
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 2>isn't going properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they think,</v>

92
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:17.354
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the only person facing it and </v>

93
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 2>that means they're idiosyncratically </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange.</v>

94
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:22.244
<v Speaker 2>In some incomprehensible way that no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>else could possibly understand and </v>

95
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:26.234
<v Speaker 2>there's no way they could ever get </v>
<v Speaker 2>better and one of the things you do is </v>

96
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:29.624
<v Speaker 2>pointed out to them as like depression </v>
<v Speaker 2>and anxiety doesn't really require any </v>

97
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 2>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

98
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who said it.</v>

99
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has sufficient justification </v>
<v Speaker 2>for suicide.</v>

100
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.373
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the claim well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is is that if you look </v>

101
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 2>through the experiences of the typical </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

102
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:48.224
<v Speaker 2>unless they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fortunate and they won't be that </v>

103
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 2>way forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly the case,</v>

104
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 2>that they can point to traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences in their life,</v>

105
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.163
<v Speaker 2>death and loss and illness and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>humiliation and all those sorts of </v>

106
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:00.854
<v Speaker 2>things that are sufficient to account </v>
<v Speaker 2>for existence in the state of quasi </v>

107
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 2>permanent negative emotion.</v>

108
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often if you see,</v>

109
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:10.034
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see people who are depressed and </v>

110
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:11.924
<v Speaker 2>anxious by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they assume that everyone else is the </v>

111
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:15.194
<v Speaker 2>smiling face that you see on facebook </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that that alienates them from </v>

112
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 2>other people and themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even more than that,</v>

113
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 2>then that certainly far more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary,</v>

114
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:25.484
<v Speaker 2>and part of the psychoeducation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes along with therapy is merely </v>

115
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.793
<v Speaker 2>educating people to understand that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fair bit of misery is the norm and that </v>

116
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:36.734
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of genuine reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the existentialists basically </v>

117
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:43.120
<v Speaker 2>start from that stance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

118
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 2>it's like a fall of man stance in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

119
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because deeply rooted in,</v>

120
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.610
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

121
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.940
<v Speaker 2>in the western tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking is the idea that people</v>

122
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.323
<v Speaker 2>are divorced from some early paradise </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and that it was the emergence of </v>

123
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:04.931
<v Speaker 2>something like self consciousness that </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced that demolition of humanity and</v>

124
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 2>left us in a damaged state.</v>

125
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.690
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

126
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 2>people think they don't believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they believe it all the time.</v>

127
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's frequently help people </v>

128
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 2>experience themselves as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if there's something wrong that needs</v>

129
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:20.474
<v Speaker 2>to be rectified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems unique in some sense to </v>

130
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:25.094
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem all that obvious that </v>

131
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 2>animals think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people definitely think that way.</v>

132
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.940
<v Speaker 2>And so all the existentialists basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>take that as a given and then they,</v>

133
00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they offer another question which is,</v>

134
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.073
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that that's your lot and that </v>

135
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:44.654
<v Speaker 2>there's ample reason for misery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it that you should conduct </v>

136
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:48.404
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because merely say giving into that </v>

137
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 2>misery or multiplying it doesn't seem to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

138
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but multiply it.</v>

139
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to do anything but </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase.</v>

140
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 2>It knows that it's bad to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

141
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:08.724
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing it is definitely going to be </v>

142
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 2>increasing in is something that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to regard as worse.</v>

143
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.390
<v Speaker 2>So how do you conduct yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face of misery?</v>

144
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do they,</v>

145
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.450
<v Speaker 2>how did they present that to begin with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

146
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:23.451
<v Speaker 2>this is from Pascal and and this is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>existential statement that describes the</v>

147
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.900
<v Speaker 2>position of the individual in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

148
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:28.561
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

149
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:29.394
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you could say that it explains the </v>

150
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 2>individ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deep,</v>

151
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 2>deep characteristic of individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience or existence.</v>

152
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.253
<v Speaker 2>Hence existentialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I consider the brief span of my </v>

153
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 2>life swallowed up in the eternity before</v>
<v Speaker 2>and behind it,</v>

154
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.183
<v Speaker 2>the small space that I feel or or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>see engulfed in the infinite immensity </v>

155
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:55.650
<v Speaker 2>of spaces which I know not in which no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not me.</v>

156
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:56.484
<v Speaker 2>I am afraid and wonder to see myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>here rather than there for there's no </v>

157
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 2>reason why I should be here rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>there or now rather than then.</v>

158
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.353
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an element of existential </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that is shared with the </v>

159
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 2>phenomenologists called thrownness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a term that heidegger</v>

160
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.220
<v Speaker 2>originated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

161
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.443
<v Speaker 2>And what it means is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's an analysis of a certain </v>

162
00:10:22.341 --> 00:10:24.320
<v Speaker 2>characteristic of human experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>

163
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.603
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an immense span of time in </v>

164
00:10:27.231 --> 00:10:29.510
<v Speaker 2>which you could have been born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you weren't born then.</v>

165
00:10:29.511 --> 00:10:30.344
<v Speaker 2>You were born 20 years ago and there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>an immense span of time in the future </v>

166
00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:36.050
<v Speaker 2>that you could have been born and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't born then.</v>

167
00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:36.884
<v Speaker 2>Either you were born when you were born </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your who you are and you have </v>

168
00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:41.810
<v Speaker 2>exactly the characteristics that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

169
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.300
<v Speaker 2>And there's something tremendously </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary about that.</v>

170
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.283
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were thrown into experience and </v>

171
00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:47.894
<v Speaker 2>that's what thrown this means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that you were randomly placed </v>

172
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:54.380
<v Speaker 2>in a place and time and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something fundamentally irrational about</v>

173
00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:55.214
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that there's no real way of </v>

174
00:10:56.301 --> 00:10:59.600
<v Speaker 2>understanding it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something you have to deal with and</v>

175
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:00.201
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

176
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:05.201
<v Speaker 2>why was I born poor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or why was I born less attractive than I</v>

177
00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:05.831
<v Speaker 2>might be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

178
00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:08.890
<v Speaker 2>or why was I born less intelligent than </v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be,</v>

179
00:11:08.891 --> 00:11:12.130
<v Speaker 2>or maybe why I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why was I born to these terrible parents</v>

180
00:11:12.131 --> 00:11:14.440
<v Speaker 2>at this particular horrible moment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

181
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.230
<v Speaker 2>And in some sense there's no answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions like that.</v>

182
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just how it is and you have to deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

183
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.570
<v Speaker 2>So the question is for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existentialists,</v>

184
00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:26.710
<v Speaker 2>how do you deal with that?</v>

185
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.813
<v Speaker 2>This is Walter Calf Kauffman for Renault</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rollo may rarely has the existential </v>

186
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:35.460
<v Speaker 2>question we'd put more simply are </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautifully.</v>

187
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.670
<v Speaker 2>In this passage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see first the profound realization of</v>

188
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:39.504
<v Speaker 2>the contingency of human life with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>which the existentialists call </v>

189
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.030
<v Speaker 2>thrownness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second,</v>

190
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:48.720
<v Speaker 2>we see Pascal Flinch facing </v>
<v Speaker 2>unflinchingly unflinchingly.</v>

191
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:53.721
<v Speaker 2>The question of being there or more </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurately being where third,</v>

192
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.743
<v Speaker 2>we see the realization that you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>take refuge in some superficial </v>

193
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 2>explanation of time and space which </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pascal scientists that he was could well</v>

194
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.264
<v Speaker 2>know and lastly the deep shaking anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 2>arising from this stark awareness of </v>

195
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 2>existence in such a universe.</v>

196
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.193
<v Speaker 3>There's a</v>

197
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.830
<v Speaker 2>fairly well developed line of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological theorizing known as terror</v>

198
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:21.094
<v Speaker 2>management theory and the basic premise </v>
<v Speaker 2>of terror management theory is that </v>

199
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.493
<v Speaker 2>human beings have belief systems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the belief systems do is serve to </v>

200
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:31.444
<v Speaker 2>protect them against death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and that now I have that that's </v>

201
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 2>derived from the work of Ernest Becker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

202
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:39.484
<v Speaker 2>who wrote a great book called the denial</v>
<v Speaker 2>of death and his theories in the denial </v>

203
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:46.240
<v Speaker 2>of death have been put to the test by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the terror management theorists with,</v>

204
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:51.540
<v Speaker 2>I would say some success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the theory is flawed because</v>

205
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that</v>
<v Speaker 2>becker phrase the issue properly.</v>

206
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:02.723
<v Speaker 2>I think it's deeper than a fear of death</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what the existentialists are </v>

207
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.180
<v Speaker 2>attempting to to to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more like.</v>

208
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.860
<v Speaker 2>It's more like terror at ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more like terror of isolated being,</v>

209
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not only that you're a pro,</v>

210
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.560
<v Speaker 2>you're mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that you have a border,</v>

211
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 2>a temporal border,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're born and you die,</v>

212
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.113
<v Speaker 2>but also that during that time you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable to all sorts of things and </v>

213
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of contingencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of which of course is death,</v>

214
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's by no means the only one that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is horrifying.</v>

215
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 2>I think you can certainly make a case </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the existentialists do,</v>

216
00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:41.764
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mere fact that you're your limited </v>

217
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:48.610
<v Speaker 2>in the face of infinite complexity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>also a primary existential problem.</v>

218
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:54.973
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem that human beings have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been dealing with ever since they </v>

219
00:13:56.871 --> 00:13:57.704
<v Speaker 2>started to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started to make sense of concepts </v>

220
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:03.700
<v Speaker 2>that were beyond their immediate </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

221
00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.493
<v Speaker 3>No</v>

222
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.190
<v Speaker 2>millions of years ago or tens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of years ago when our ancestors</v>

223
00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:12.024
<v Speaker 2>lived in trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be sure that they were </v>

224
00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:16.584
<v Speaker 2>frightened of what surrounded them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were frightened of when they were </v>

225
00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:21.120
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were frightened of birds that might</v>

226
00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:21.954
<v Speaker 2>pick them out of a tree or they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of cats that might climb a tree </v>

227
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:25.404
<v Speaker 2>and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were afraid of snakes that would </v>

228
00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:29.940
<v Speaker 2>come slithering along and bite them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

229
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.560
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They existed in the space that was safe,</v>

230
00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:37.830
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by a space that wasn't safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was full of predatory,</v>

231
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.473
<v Speaker 2>a predatory entities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those were primarily birds of prey </v>

232
00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:48.931
<v Speaker 2>and cats and snakes or other reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what seemed to have happened as</v>

233
00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Speaker 2>we evolved was that the way we construed</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

234
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:53.954
<v Speaker 2>you can think of the world as a safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>place surrounded by the possibility of </v>

235
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 2>predation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could also think of the world as</v>

236
00:14:58.881 --> 00:14:59.714
<v Speaker 2>the known surrounded by the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same idea except put up one </v>

237
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:03.944
<v Speaker 2>level of abstraction and the unknown has</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same relationship to us in some </v>

238
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:08.444
<v Speaker 2>sense that the territory of predators </v>
<v Speaker 2>has relationship to us and we use the </v>

239
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:17.471
<v Speaker 2>same circuitry to represent the absolute</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown that we used so many millions of</v>

240
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:19.933
<v Speaker 2>years ago to represent predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's called more complicated for </v>

241
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 2>human beings because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not just prey animals.</v>

242
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 2>We're also predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're not only targets,</v>

243
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:30.554
<v Speaker 2>but we're the thing that makes other </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing targets and we're also something </v>

244
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:33.674
<v Speaker 2>that isn't only shaking in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the unknown because of it's predatory </v>

245
00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:38.810
<v Speaker 2>element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like a rabbit,</v>

246
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.400
<v Speaker 2>but something that can explore the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown and Garner something of value as</v>

247
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 2>a consequence.</v>

248
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 2>And so we have this very paradoxical </v>
<v Speaker 2>wiring.</v>

249
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:47.744
<v Speaker 2>You might say that a known is partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>terror and that's the prepotent element </v>

250
00:15:53.031 --> 00:15:53.864
<v Speaker 2>of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So negative emotion for human beings is </v>

251
00:15:56.271 --> 00:15:57.104
<v Speaker 2>more powerful than positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emotion is sort of dose for dose and </v>

252
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:04.400
<v Speaker 2>that's I think that's because you can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely and utterly dead,</v>

253
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.640
<v Speaker 2>but you can only be so much happier and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so it makes much more sense to be tilted</v>

254
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:10.604
<v Speaker 2>to some degree towards sensitivity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion than it does to be </v>

255
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:16.670
<v Speaker 2>tilted towards sensitivity for positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>

256
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:17.893
<v Speaker 2>but it's also another one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that makes life rather </v>

257
00:16:19.671 --> 00:16:20.504
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically dif difficult because</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotions are commonplace and </v>

258
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:26.564
<v Speaker 2>they're powerful and they need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise you'd wander stupidly </v>

259
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.573
<v Speaker 2>into something that would kill you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better to be anxious than to be in </v>

260
00:16:34.851 --> 00:16:35.684
<v Speaker 2>pain or dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's not so good to be </v>

261
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:38.414
<v Speaker 2>anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for the existentialists that the </v>

262
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.433
<v Speaker 2>fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental quality of human </v>

263
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.933
<v Speaker 2>existence is limitation in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 2>incomprehensible complexity and all of </v>

264
00:16:55.451 --> 00:16:58.330
<v Speaker 2>the things that stem from that</v>

265
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.660
<v Speaker 2>existentialism is not a comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy or a way of life,</v>

266
00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:12.661
<v Speaker 2>but it an endeavor to grasp reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Existentialism is immersed in and arises</v>

267
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:15.820
<v Speaker 2>directly out of man's anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>estrangement and conflicts.</v>

268
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:20.830
<v Speaker 2>This was written 60 years ago and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>written so it was.</v>

269
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.200
<v Speaker 2>It was aimed at western audiences at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point,</v>

270
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.420
<v Speaker 2>if you go back 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could make the case or or or perhaps</v>

271
00:17:28.421 --> 00:17:29.254
<v Speaker 2>a little longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could make the case that the parts </v>

272
00:17:31.841 --> 00:17:35.200
<v Speaker 2>of the world that weren't western,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're still reasonably well ensconced in</v>

273
00:17:35.201 --> 00:17:36.034
<v Speaker 2>traditional belief systems and so those </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional belief systems provided an </v>

274
00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:43.930
<v Speaker 2>overarching canopy of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

275
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.263
<v Speaker 2>That was designed exactly to you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>say rationalize or you could say cope </v>

276
00:17:51.301 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 2>with or deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depending on your perspective.</v>

277
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 2>That existential anxiety it gave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave significance to everything.</v>

278
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:00.060
<v Speaker 2>It gave meaning to everything and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a religious systems.</v>

279
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.893
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they came crashing down in the West </v>

280
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:04.523
<v Speaker 2>in the late 18 hundreds and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly everywhere else in the </v>

281
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:07.584
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the point at which we are now in </v>

282
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:10.584
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't reasonable to only consider </v>

283
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:16.620
<v Speaker 2>this a pathology of the western </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

284
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:17.933
<v Speaker 2>It might even be the prime conflict that</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists in the world right now between </v>

285
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.043
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive and traditional religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems in a modern viewpoint that has </v>

286
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 2>this existential angst built into it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of its as part of its nature.</v>

287
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:35.754
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's the price you pay for </v>
<v Speaker 2>increased technological mastery and </v>

288
00:18:39.031 --> 00:18:39.864
<v Speaker 2>awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a big price to pay and the </v>

289
00:18:41.881 --> 00:18:42.714
<v Speaker 2>existentialists were concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because they also believe that </v>

290
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.180
<v Speaker 2>although the scientific method had given</v>
<v Speaker 2>us immense technological power,</v>

291
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.590
<v Speaker 2>the worldview that came along with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you could say in some sense,</v>

292
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:56.760
<v Speaker 2>is incidental to the method,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

293
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:57.803
<v Speaker 2>The worldview that came along with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was sufficiently powerful and objective </v>

294
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.663
<v Speaker 2>and reductive to blow gaping holes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the meaning systems that protected us </v>

295
00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:11.124
<v Speaker 2>from our existential anxiety and to open</v>
<v Speaker 2>us up to the possibility number one of </v>

296
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:17.370
<v Speaker 2>nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really belief and nothing,</v>

297
00:19:17.371 --> 00:19:18.204
<v Speaker 2>and we'll talk about that more as we </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress or a proclivity towards </v>

298
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:23.580
<v Speaker 2>rational totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be,</v>

299
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

300
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.660
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

301
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.653
<v Speaker 2>extreme reaction to the threat of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilism and the abandonment of classic </v>

302
00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:33.380
<v Speaker 2>belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

303
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.110
<v Speaker 2>I think you still see that playing out </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

304
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 2>You certainly see it playing out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities right now because the,</v>

305
00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:42.270
<v Speaker 2>there's huge ideological conflicts at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

306
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.540
<v Speaker 2>in the substructure of Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual thinking.</v>

307
00:19:45.541 --> 00:19:50.280
<v Speaker 2>And people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is very hard on young people,</v>

308
00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:51.114
<v Speaker 2>they're caught in part B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be between an emergent nihilism that </v>

309
00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:56.760
<v Speaker 2>seems to be implicit in a materialist </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview.</v>

310
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.430
<v Speaker 2>And the temptation of radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies.</v>

311
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 2>And neither of those options I would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>is tenable.</v>

312
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nihilistic option leaves you with </v>

313
00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not good.</v>

314
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's an existential realization in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense too,</v>

315
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.680
<v Speaker 2>because if your life is fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic,</v>

316
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>without you being pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as the the essence of your life,</v>

317
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.420
<v Speaker 2>then you need something to defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

318
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.453
<v Speaker 2>to defend against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just have nothing because all </v>

319
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:27.750
<v Speaker 2>it does is leave you with the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's implicit in your experience.</v>

320
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:33.050
<v Speaker 2>And then to swing to a totalitarianism </v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian system means that you don't</v>

321
00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 2>even exist to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you've done that,</v>

322
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.563
<v Speaker 2>everything you say can be predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just the puppet of a of a </v>

323
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.780
<v Speaker 2>rational scheme that has an explanation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for everything.</v>

324
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:43.614
<v Speaker 2>But that's really good for nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>except destruction because it's too </v>

325
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.780
<v Speaker 2>vague and abstract it to be used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually solve any concrete problems.</v>

326
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.493
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the situation of modern people </v>

327
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:57.544
<v Speaker 2>as far as the existentialists were </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned and the people that I'm </v>

328
00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:02.560
<v Speaker 2>talking to you about specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to talk to you about Nietzsche</v>

329
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:03.394
<v Speaker 2>and Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>picked those people who aren't </v>

330
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:06.964
<v Speaker 2>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except in the broader sense because I </v>

331
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:10.054
<v Speaker 2>don't think there is anybody who there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were and are existential </v>

332
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that any of them do as</v>

333
00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 2>good a job of explaining the problem as </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people do.</v>

334
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:19.474
<v Speaker 2>So you might as well get right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might as well get the information </v>

335
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:23.740
<v Speaker 2>right from the source.</v>

336
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:27.963
<v Speaker 2>Like psychoanalysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Existentialism seeks to utilize these </v>

337
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 2>very conflicts as avenues to the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>profound self understanding of man.</v>

338
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what does that mean?</v>

339
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means at least in part,</v>

340
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:39.094
<v Speaker 2>that the theorists that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about had an idea that was akin to </v>

341
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:46.000
<v Speaker 2>the psychoanalytic idea of facing what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid of,</v>

342
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's a key concept in </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy.</v>

343
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.293
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not that many key concepts in </v>

344
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:51.634
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One might be that you enter into an </v>

345
00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:54.544
<v Speaker 2>honest relationship with your client.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second is that exposure to the </v>

346
00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:03.820
<v Speaker 2>things that you don't want to be exposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to is curative.</v>

347
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:04.893
<v Speaker 2>If it's voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big deal and it has to be </v>

348
00:22:07.601 --> 00:22:08.434
<v Speaker 2>voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be involuntary because that'll </v>

349
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:11.320
<v Speaker 2>just make it worse because you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask,</v>

350
00:22:11.321 --> 00:22:12.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.143
<v Speaker 2>if a kid has a fear of rats or mice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got that fear because often they </v>

352
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:18.754
<v Speaker 2>were exposed to rats or mice and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you use exposure to rats and mice to </v>

353
00:22:21.881 --> 00:22:22.660
<v Speaker 2>cure them.</v>

354
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.493
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes the precipitator of the </v>

355
00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:27.370
<v Speaker 2>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the carer,</v>

356
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.990
<v Speaker 2>which makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

357
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:30.610
<v Speaker 2>what's the distinction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

358
00:22:30.611 --> 00:22:31.444
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing to have something pop up </v>

359
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:33.724
<v Speaker 2>at you when you're not expecting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That puts you in a state of of </v>

360
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:37.833
<v Speaker 2>apprehension and preparation for action </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the state of even a state of terror </v>

361
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.293
<v Speaker 2>estate of a reflex of shock and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps terror and maybe something you </v>

362
00:22:46.121 --> 00:22:46.954
<v Speaker 2>don't recover from that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than facing something </v>

363
00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:50.854
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The psychophysiology isn't even the </v>

364
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:53.494
<v Speaker 2>same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're faced with a stressor of a </v>

365
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:56.254
<v Speaker 2>certain magnitude and it's involuntary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body produces a lot of the stress </v>

366
00:22:58.721 --> 00:23:02.260
<v Speaker 2>hormone cortisol and in large doses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cortisol is toxic,</v>

367
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:05.740
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's produced over long </v>
<v Speaker 2>periods of time,</v>

368
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 2>but if you face it voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that doesn't happen.</v>

369
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:12.220
<v Speaker 2>You use a completely different set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuits to do something voluntarily and</v>

370
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.293
<v Speaker 2>it's the utilization of the voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuits that indicates your mastery </v>

371
00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:18.124
<v Speaker 2>over the thing that you're afraid of and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mastery over the thing that you're </v>

372
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:22.024
<v Speaker 2>afraid of and can't cope with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That actually constitutes your adaptive </v>

373
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:25.444
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of what the existentialists </v>

374
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:30.700
<v Speaker 2>were suggesting is that precisely and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see this,</v>

375
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:31.743
<v Speaker 2>you see this in Freud with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>insistence that you go into your messy </v>

376
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:35.374
<v Speaker 2>past and dig up the corpses in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeletons and sort them out and young's </v>

377
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:40.354
<v Speaker 2>insistence that what you want most is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be found where you least want to look </v>

378
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>and Roger's insistence that people</v>

379
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 4>communicate honestly about difficult </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

380
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:48.974
<v Speaker 4>It's all predicated on the same idea in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sense that voluntary exposure is </v>

381
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:53.684
<v Speaker 4>one of the prime things that cures </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and one of the things that you </v>

382
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:57.170
<v Speaker 4>should think about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

383
00:23:57.171 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that a valid claim?</v>

384
00:23:58.401 --> 00:23:59.234
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have the psychophysiological </v>

385
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:01.034
<v Speaker 4>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also the case that that is how </v>

386
00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 4>people learn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

387
00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:07.400
<v Speaker 4>If you're a child and you're learning to</v>
<v Speaker 4>master the world,</v>

388
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:08.563
<v Speaker 4>you actually exist in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 4>existential anxiety unless you're near </v>

389
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:14.810
<v Speaker 4>someone that will take care of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

390
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:17.750
<v Speaker 4>if you take the typical child and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>go to a mall,</v>

391
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:23.020
<v Speaker 4>say a three year old and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>the three year old Stan and you leave,</v>

392
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.793
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be very long until you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>far enough away so that most of most </v>

393
00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 4>children in that situation will </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately start to cry.</v>

394
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.820
<v Speaker 4>They'll get worried and they'll start to</v>
<v Speaker 4>cry and then they'll break down because,</v>

395
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.193
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's the existential anxiety </v>

396
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.041
<v Speaker 4>like you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

397
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:42.470
<v Speaker 4>a normal child is calm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like wrong.</v>

398
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 4>A normal child close to someone who will</v>
<v Speaker 4>take care of them is calm,</v>

399
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.720
<v Speaker 4>but that is by no means the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not even close to the same thing,</v>

400
00:24:50.721 --> 00:24:54.230
<v Speaker 4>and so if you get backwards in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological thinking,</v>

401
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:55.760
<v Speaker 4>if you don't notice that because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

402
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:56.594
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the normal human being is calm and well </v>

403
00:24:57.981 --> 00:25:00.200
<v Speaker 4>put together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like no wrong.</v>

404
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.520
<v Speaker 4>The normal human being in a place of </v>
<v Speaker 4>safety is calm and well put together,</v>

405
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.410
<v Speaker 4>but why you would ever think that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal place is a place of safety.</v>

406
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assuming that that's the standard or the</v>

407
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Speaker 4>norm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely no reason for that.</v>

408
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.470
<v Speaker 4>You see this with rats too because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>behaviorist,</v>

409
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.333
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made the presumption that you had to </v>

410
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:21.560
<v Speaker 4>teach rats to be afraid.</v>

411
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.870
<v Speaker 4>But let me tell you how that actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>worked.</v>

412
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.710
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting and it shows you</v>
<v Speaker 4>how carefully you have to analyze,</v>

413
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.633
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological experiments to understand </v>

414
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:33.170
<v Speaker 4>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say you take a lab rat,</v>

415
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.070
<v Speaker 4>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

416
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 4>and let's say it's a lab rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rat that skinner used,</v>

417
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.400
<v Speaker 4>bf skinner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is the most famous of the behaviors,</v>

418
00:25:39.401 --> 00:25:43.550
<v Speaker 4>and he could get rats to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He taught pigeons to play ping pong.</v>

419
00:25:43.551 --> 00:25:47.600
<v Speaker 4>He taught pigeons to guide guided </v>
<v Speaker 4>missiles by photographs,</v>

420
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:49.130
<v Speaker 4>and he did that with behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>

421
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.540
<v Speaker 4>They were never used for guided missiles</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they got the electronics working</v>

422
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:55.340
<v Speaker 4>before the program was set into </v>
<v Speaker 4>operation,</v>

423
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.383
<v Speaker 4>but he could get them to peck at photos </v>
<v Speaker 4>to guide something that was flying </v>

424
00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:00.523
<v Speaker 4>accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he did that with behavioral </v>

425
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:03.200
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So skinner,</v>

426
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:03.731
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

427
00:26:03.731 --> 00:26:04.850
<v Speaker 4>he was no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could.</v>

428
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.810
<v Speaker 4>He really knew how to train animals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very useful material to know.</v>

429
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.510
<v Speaker 4>We'll talk about it to some degree if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to train children,</v>

430
00:26:11.511 --> 00:26:12.201
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

431
00:26:12.201 --> 00:26:13.034
<v Speaker 4>or pets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So because the learning mechanisms are </v>

432
00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 4>very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why,</v>

433
00:26:16.881 --> 00:26:18.530
<v Speaker 4>of course we can get along with pets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

434
00:26:18.531 --> 00:26:19.364
<v Speaker 4>We understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we understand children roughly </v>

435
00:26:20.811 --> 00:26:23.570
<v Speaker 4>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

436
00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.003
<v Speaker 4>so let's say you've got your rat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's sitting there and he's pretty calm </v>

437
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.483
<v Speaker 4>and he's in his cage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he's already a weird rat because </v>

438
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.670
<v Speaker 4>he's been genetically altered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not a wild Norway rat,</v>

439
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.920
<v Speaker 4>so he's a little tamer than a normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>rat.</v>

440
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:39.200
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's a little more fearful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although perhaps not,</v>

441
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.453
<v Speaker 4>and he's also a solitary rat in his cage</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's no such thing as a solitary </v>

442
00:26:43.801 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 4>rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a solitary zebra or a solitary</v>

443
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:51.531
<v Speaker 4>carp or a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cod Cod existed.</v>

444
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:54.720
<v Speaker 4>Huge schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no such thing as at cod,</v>

445
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.330
<v Speaker 4>which is why they will never come back </v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as I can tell,</v>

446
00:26:57.331 --> 00:26:58.164
<v Speaker 4>because once you wipe out the school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you wipe out a beehive and </v>

447
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have six bees.</v>

448
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 4>What the hell are you going to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>six bees?</v>

449
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:07.070
<v Speaker 4>What are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't exist on their own and,</v>

450
00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.780
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and hurt animals are like that too.</v>

451
00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:10.623
<v Speaker 4>And caught her like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they organized their mating behavior </v>

452
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 4>in their huge schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So without the schools,</v>

453
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 4>like what the hell is the cod going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do?</v>

454
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.560
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is what they're doing.</v>

455
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the,</v>

456
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.070
<v Speaker 4>back to the rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got this rat,</v>

457
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:23.904
<v Speaker 4>he's in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's alone and he's hungry because one </v>

458
00:27:27.241 --> 00:27:28.074
<v Speaker 4>of the things that skinner did was </v>
<v Speaker 4>starve his rats down to 75 percent of </v>

459
00:27:30.721 --> 00:27:34.050
<v Speaker 4>their normal body weight so that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would respond to a lot more to food.</v>

460
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.363
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's the model and that you've got </v>

461
00:27:36.941 --> 00:27:39.000
<v Speaker 4>to keep in mind that the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>model,</v>

462
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:39.834
<v Speaker 4>because the model is like the way the </v>
<v Speaker 4>model is constituted is equivalent to </v>

463
00:27:43.921 --> 00:27:44.754
<v Speaker 4>your implicit assumptions about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment and people don't take that </v>

464
00:27:48.421 --> 00:27:49.350
<v Speaker 4>into consideration.</v>

465
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.730
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the rats come.</v>

466
00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:51.564
<v Speaker 4>So then what you do is you take the ride</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of his cage and you put them in the </v>

467
00:27:53.911 --> 00:27:54.744
<v Speaker 4>testing chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so maybe what you're going to do is </v>

468
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.953
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have set the rat up so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a light goes on and then he gets a </v>

469
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Speaker 4>little electric shock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

470
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.870
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now you're going to teach them to be</v>

471
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:04.704
<v Speaker 4>afraid of the light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So after you pair the light with the </v>

472
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:07.104
<v Speaker 4>shock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six or seven times when the light comes </v>

473
00:28:08.911 --> 00:28:10.020
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rats going to freeze.</v>

474
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.693
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he freezes because he's using </v>

475
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Predator avoidance strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically to deal with the threat,</v>

476
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.800
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

477
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 4>and so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

478
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.160
<v Speaker 4>calm rat learns to be afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

479
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.800
<v Speaker 4>because when you put the rat in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cage,</v>

480
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 4>the new cage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does it do?</v>

481
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:26.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't just,</v>

482
00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:28.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find the sofa and have a nap.</v>

483
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.740
<v Speaker 4>It's terrified when he put it in the new</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>

484
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.933
<v Speaker 4>that's the normal rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the one that's like this and it </v>

485
00:28:35.811 --> 00:28:36.644
<v Speaker 4>doesn't move because if it moved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe a Predator would pick it out like </v>

486
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:40.860
<v Speaker 4>a cat because cats can see lateral </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>

487
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:42.600
<v Speaker 4>That's why they have slit eyes by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

488
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.583
<v Speaker 4>so they can detect lateral movement and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that because if you play with </v>

489
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 4>your cat like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll chase your hand.</v>

490
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:49.110
<v Speaker 4>But if you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it won't.</v>

491
00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.290
<v Speaker 4>It is because it doesn't chase things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that do.</v>

492
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:54.420
<v Speaker 4>This doesn't chase kangaroos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

493
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.140
<v Speaker 4>chase's things that move like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it has eyes for that.</v>

494
00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.633
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rats frozen and then it starts to </v>

495
00:29:03.151 --> 00:29:06.120
<v Speaker 4>sniff because Erad is all smell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most animals,</v>

496
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.150
<v Speaker 4>most the brains of most animals are </v>
<v Speaker 4>organized around smell.</v>

497
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.720
<v Speaker 4>Human beings are very weird because our </v>
<v Speaker 4>brains are organized around vision.</v>

498
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.640
<v Speaker 4>But that's just not the case for most.</v>

499
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

500
00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.250
<v Speaker 4>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're the weirdest things.</v>

501
00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:18.600
<v Speaker 4>A because they can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

502
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:19.434
<v Speaker 4>they can smell like way better than you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can detect odors way better than </v>

503
00:29:22.801 --> 00:29:24.330
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably most of you smell better than a</v>

504
00:29:24.331 --> 00:29:26.310
<v Speaker 4>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

505
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.000
<v Speaker 4>they can detect odors better than you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But everything seems to smell good too.</v>

506
00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:32.010
<v Speaker 4>A dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the strangest damn thing,</v>

507
00:29:32.011 --> 00:29:34.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a nose like that,</v>

508
00:29:34.351 --> 00:29:36.090
<v Speaker 4>you'd think they'd never even want to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside.</v>

509
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:39.280
<v Speaker 4>But anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

510
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.060
<v Speaker 4>now I probably lost my place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

511
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.330
<v Speaker 4>Dogs smell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where were we going with that?</v>

512
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.090
<v Speaker 4>Rats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

513
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 4>And what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Frozen?</v>

514
00:29:52.031 --> 00:29:52.601
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

515
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:53.860
<v Speaker 4>So the rat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the one,</v>

516
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.143
<v Speaker 4>that's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the rod is in its cage and it's </v>

517
00:29:56.951 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 4>frozen so that nothing can see it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat it.</v>

518
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:04.030
<v Speaker 4>And so it starts to sniff because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>uses smell to see what's going on.</v>

519
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:04.923
<v Speaker 4>And so if you take rats that have never </v>
<v Speaker 4>been exposed to a cat and you like blow </v>

520
00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 4>cat odor over them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do not like that at all.</v>

521
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.210
<v Speaker 4>They didn't not like cat odor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's built right into,</v>

522
00:30:15.211 --> 00:30:18.580
<v Speaker 4>it's an archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Predator cat is an archetype for the</v>

523
00:30:18.581 --> 00:30:19.414
<v Speaker 4>rat and it doesn't need any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any pre-training to respond to it and </v>

524
00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:23.464
<v Speaker 4>it's probably also the case with human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings and things like snakes and </v>

525
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.913
<v Speaker 4>looming objects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got some archetipal predators as </v>

526
00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:30.100
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all right,</v>

527
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:34.210
<v Speaker 4>so the rat sniffs and then if nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens that thinks okay,</v>

528
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.363
<v Speaker 4>a rad can sniff here without dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then it starts to relax a little </v>

529
00:30:39.251 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it starts to move around a bit and</v>

530
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:41.883
<v Speaker 4>it thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

531
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.880
<v Speaker 4>A sniffing wrap that's moving a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit can live here without dying and then</v>

532
00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:46.714
<v Speaker 4>nothing else happens and so it relaxes a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit more and then it starts to sniff </v>

533
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:50.314
<v Speaker 4>it's way around and it'll sniff all </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the cage and check out all the </v>

534
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:53.854
<v Speaker 4>corners and make sure that there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything there that can eat it because </v>

535
00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:58.000
<v Speaker 4>the rat actually cares about that.</v>

536
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:03.180
<v Speaker 4>And then when it's completely explored </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cage and decided that it's safe,</v>

537
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:08.050
<v Speaker 4>then it turns into a normal calm rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's post exploration.</v>

538
00:31:08.051 --> 00:31:09.310
<v Speaker 4>So you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

539
00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:12.880
<v Speaker 4>a rat that has thoroughly explored it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>territory is a calm rat.</v>

540
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.460
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole different way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about fear.</v>

541
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:20.020
<v Speaker 4>Then you turn the light on and shock it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the rat thinks you're wrong.</v>

542
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.183
<v Speaker 4>It's not safe here in that light </v>
<v Speaker 4>indicates so indicates that it's not </v>

543
00:31:23.711 --> 00:31:24.544
<v Speaker 4>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So basically what you've done is </v>

544
00:31:25.451 --> 00:31:28.300
<v Speaker 4>reminded the rack that life is </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>

545
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 4>You have not taught it fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same thing.</v>

546
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.093
<v Speaker 4>The rat knows everything about fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It learned that it was safe and it was </v>

547
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:39.550
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a really,</v>

548
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:40.803
<v Speaker 4>really important thing to understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>also about what you're like because you </v>

549
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:48.970
<v Speaker 4>know per like anxiety that needs no </v>
<v Speaker 4>explanation,</v>

550
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.370
<v Speaker 4>depression that needs no explanation.</v>

551
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:56.050
<v Speaker 4>What needs explanation is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the hell do you ever feel secure and</v>

552
00:31:56.051 --> 00:31:59.890
<v Speaker 4>together ever because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mystery.</v>

553
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.160
<v Speaker 4>And partly the way you do that is by </v>
<v Speaker 4>never going anywhere where you're upset,</v>

554
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:04.923
<v Speaker 4>you stay in your territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so like this is your territory and </v>

555
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.180
<v Speaker 4>everyone knows how to act here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

556
00:32:10.181 --> 00:32:11.014
<v Speaker 4>So you look around it and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting and doing exactly the same </v>

557
00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:15.250
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can ignore them.</v>

558
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.340
<v Speaker 4>You can pretend that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous and most of the time that will</v>

559
00:32:20.561 --> 00:32:23.530
<v Speaker 4>be correct and some of the time it won't</v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

560
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.143
<v Speaker 4>and so you maintain your emotional </v>
<v Speaker 4>stability by staying where you belong </v>

561
00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.850
<v Speaker 4>and that's quite different than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoanalytic view.</v>

562
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.390
<v Speaker 4>Psychoanalytic view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that you're.</v>

563
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:40.310
<v Speaker 4>You're calm and well put together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your psyche is properly organized.</v>

564
00:32:40.311 --> 00:32:43.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is partly why I introduced you guys</v>

565
00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 4>to piaget because Piaget adds this other</v>
<v Speaker 4>element,</v>

566
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says something like,</v>

567
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.073
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well your psyche has to be organized </v>

568
00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:50.990
<v Speaker 4>properly so you have to turn.</v>

569
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:51.883
<v Speaker 4>You have to have turned everything that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a constituent element of you into a </v>

570
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:58.310
<v Speaker 4>functional being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that being has to be integrated in a</v>

571
00:32:58.311 --> 00:32:59.144
<v Speaker 4>functional game like landscape made of </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people who are doing the same </v>

572
00:33:03.051 --> 00:33:03.884
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it's the concordance between </v>

573
00:33:05.301 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 4>your structure and that landscape that </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you emotionally regulated.</v>

574
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 4>That's a way different theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a much more sophisticated theory.</v>

575
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:16.130
<v Speaker 4>So you could say in some sense the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoanalysts had it half right.</v>

576
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.633
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also you can be individually </v>

577
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 4>pathological in a way that doesn't let </v>
<v Speaker 4>you fit into society.</v>

578
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.113
<v Speaker 4>But you have to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 4>concordance between the social </v>

579
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:27.920
<v Speaker 4>organization and the Individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>Organization to get the.</v>

580
00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:32.240
<v Speaker 4>To get the picture right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

581
00:33:32.241 --> 00:33:34.220
<v Speaker 4>so what are the existentialists say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

582
00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:39.550
<v Speaker 4>it's something like in the depths of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your existential terror,</v>

583
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:43.430
<v Speaker 4>the wisdom to cope with that terror will</v>
<v Speaker 4>be found.</v>

584
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.850
<v Speaker 4>So that's the fundamental idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a.</v>

585
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:47.953
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a more profound idea in that which I </v>

586
00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:52.850
<v Speaker 4>would also say is implicit in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in psychotherapy,</v>

587
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 4>the more behavioral the psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more implicit it is.</v>

588
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.980
<v Speaker 4>But the idea is that</v>

589
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.310
<v Speaker 4>despite the fact that you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>mismatched,</v>

590
00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.060
<v Speaker 4>that you're outmatched by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it existential complexity.</v>

591
00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.720
<v Speaker 4>There's something in you that's far more</v>
<v Speaker 4>complex than you know,</v>

592
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.333
<v Speaker 4>and if you challenge it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will respond by growing and </v>

593
00:34:14.381 --> 00:34:15.214
<v Speaker 4>developing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that will not protect you against </v>

594
00:34:17.471 --> 00:34:18.304
<v Speaker 4>the existential anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like a shield or a guard that </v>

595
00:34:21.071 --> 00:34:22.930
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're hiding behind.</v>

596
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:23.913
<v Speaker 4>It's not a defense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens instead is that you </v>

597
00:34:25.871 --> 00:34:27.820
<v Speaker 4>actually learn how to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

598
00:34:27.821 --> 00:34:28.654
<v Speaker 4>so you think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that human beings are </v>

599
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:34.223
<v Speaker 4>archetipal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he related to his fire and of course </v>

600
00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.140
<v Speaker 4>fire is something to be afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it,</v>

601
00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.290
<v Speaker 4>it will burn you and it will burn </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything down,</v>

602
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:44.740
<v Speaker 4>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we mastered fire,</v>

603
00:34:44.741 --> 00:34:45.574
<v Speaker 4>which may have been 2 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that because it looks </v>

604
00:34:47.621 --> 00:34:49.600
<v Speaker 4>like it was about then that we learned </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to cook,</v>

605
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:51.160
<v Speaker 4>which made a big difference.</v>

606
00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:54.190
<v Speaker 4>So you know how chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't totally the chimps story,</v>

607
00:34:54.191 --> 00:34:55.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

608
00:34:55.121 --> 00:34:55.954
<v Speaker 4>chimps are sort of shaped like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got this huge barrel shaped </v>

609
00:34:58.691 --> 00:34:59.890
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>

610
00:34:59.891 --> 00:35:02.740
<v Speaker 4>they spend like 12 hours a day chewing </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaves.</v>

611
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.760
<v Speaker 4>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you go out in the forest and eat</v>

612
00:35:06.761 --> 00:35:09.790
<v Speaker 4>leaves and see how much you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>choose so you don't starve to death.</v>

613
00:35:09.791 --> 00:35:13.360
<v Speaker 4>It's like leaves aren't edible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They hardly have any nourishment at all.</v>

614
00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:16.480
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're a chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all you do is sit around and chew leaves</v>

615
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.920
<v Speaker 4>and then you need to have an intestinal </v>
<v Speaker 4>track that could wrap two or three times</v>

616
00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:23.980
<v Speaker 4>around this room so that you can digest </v>
<v Speaker 4>the damn things right.</v>

617
00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:26.500
<v Speaker 4>So that's chimp life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While human beings,</v>

618
00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:31.390
<v Speaker 4>we decided to trade intestinal length </v>
<v Speaker 4>for brain and the way we did that was by</v>

619
00:35:31.391 --> 00:35:34.060
<v Speaker 4>learning how to cook and we mastered </v>
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>

620
00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.320
<v Speaker 4>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

621
00:35:35.321 --> 00:35:37.680
<v Speaker 4>is fire dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the to that is.</v>

622
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends on how you react to it.</v>

623
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:41.250
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

624
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:43.560
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well fire is intrinsically dangerous.</v>

625
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 4>It's like no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fire is multi valence.</v>

626
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.693
<v Speaker 4>It has all sorts of possibilities and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them are extraordinarily </v>

627
00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:51.174
<v Speaker 4>destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you match your behavior properly </v>

628
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:56.430
<v Speaker 4>to the phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can master something like fire.</v>

629
00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:57.773
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is that there's a potential </v>

630
00:35:59.431 --> 00:36:00.264
<v Speaker 4>inside you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever inside means there's a </v>

631
00:36:02.221 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 4>potential that's part of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of it's genetic potential,</v>

632
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:08.520
<v Speaker 4>and we know that because if we move you </v>
<v Speaker 4>into a new environment,</v>

633
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.480
<v Speaker 4>new genes will turn on inside of you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>manufacturer new parts of you.</v>

634
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:17.750
<v Speaker 4>So if you stress yourself optimally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you push yourself out into the world,</v>

635
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.420
<v Speaker 4>you can incorporate information from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that journey.</v>

636
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 4>You're the exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a Piagetian idea,</v>

637
00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

638
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.440
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go out,</v>

639
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.630
<v Speaker 4>you learn something new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you adjust your behavior to it.</v>

640
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:30.060
<v Speaker 4>And you adjust your concepts to it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can master it.</v>

641
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.253
<v Speaker 4>But what piaget didn't realize was that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it also transforms your biological </v>

642
00:36:35.011 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 4>structure at a microscopic level merely </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a consequence of being put in the new</v>

643
00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:39.984
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is that there's more to you </v>

644
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:43.074
<v Speaker 4>than you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the way you call it out is by </v>

645
00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:48.840
<v Speaker 4>challenging yourself voluntarily in as </v>
<v Speaker 4>many directions as you can manage.</v>

646
00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.740
<v Speaker 4>And that's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't the construction of defenses.</v>

647
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not something artificial like </v>
<v Speaker 4>defense against death,</v>

648
00:36:55.771 --> 00:36:56.604
<v Speaker 4>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually how you learn to cope in </v>

649
00:36:58.801 --> 00:36:59.634
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the existentialists I would say </v>

650
00:37:01.441 --> 00:37:02.274
<v Speaker 4>despite their exceptional pessimism were</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sense unbelievably optimistic </v>

651
00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:07.674
<v Speaker 4>because what they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the opposite of a straw man </v>

652
00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:10.650
<v Speaker 4>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would say,</v>

653
00:37:10.651 --> 00:37:11.340
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how?</v>

654
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.320
<v Speaker 4>How weaker human beings ultimately week </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

655
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.830
<v Speaker 4>we're up against an opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>

656
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:21.300
<v Speaker 4>social opponents say which would be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>crushing weight of society and a natural</v>

657
00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:25.230
<v Speaker 4>opponent that is nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which overwhelms you were up against the</v>

658
00:37:25.231 --> 00:37:27.270
<v Speaker 4>ultimate opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

659
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.940
<v Speaker 4>And so in that sense we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily weak.</v>

660
00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:33.750
<v Speaker 4>But it turns out that if we face that </v>
<v Speaker 4>opponent or that series of opponents,</v>

661
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:34.853
<v Speaker 4>then all sorts of possibilities manifest</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves inside of us and it isn't </v>

662
00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:39.414
<v Speaker 4>clear what the upper limits are to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's so interesting that it's a good </v>

663
00:37:44.101 --> 00:37:46.440
<v Speaker 4>example of how if you face what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>afraid of,</v>

664
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:47.780
<v Speaker 4>you can find what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

665
00:37:47.781 --> 00:37:48.614
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the existentialist make the strongest </v>

666
00:37:49.861 --> 00:37:53.070
<v Speaker 4>case possible for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the vulnerability of human beings.</v>

667
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:54.083
<v Speaker 4>And out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the extract out the strongest case </v>

668
00:37:55.951 --> 00:37:56.784
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why human beings are strong and </v>

669
00:37:58.591 --> 00:38:01.530
<v Speaker 4>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very interesting paradox.</v>

670
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.573
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that that's central to </v>

671
00:38:03.721 --> 00:38:05.610
<v Speaker 4>psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things you,</v>

672
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.050
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's been learned </v>
<v Speaker 4>about agoraphobic,</v>

673
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.920
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agoraphobic,</v>

674
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.110
<v Speaker 4>they're usually women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're usually in their forties.</v>

675
00:38:13.111 --> 00:38:13.944
<v Speaker 4>They've usually been dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>often someone close to them as divorced </v>

676
00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:20.340
<v Speaker 4>or died or they're having heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>palpitations or something like that.</v>

677
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:23.300
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes as a consequence of menopause </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they've,</v>

678
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.970
<v Speaker 4>they've accustomed themselves to seeking</v>
<v Speaker 4>authority when challenged.</v>

679
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.930
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with having heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>palpitations is like,</v>

680
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.040
<v Speaker 4>who's going to help you with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

681
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:35.490
<v Speaker 4>maybe you go to the emergency room and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is what agoraphobic do.</v>

682
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.483
<v Speaker 4>Most agoraphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so have been to the emergency room like </v>

683
00:38:37.931 --> 00:38:41.080
<v Speaker 4>a dozen times because they have heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>palpitations and then they feel them.</v>

684
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.123
<v Speaker 4>Then they get afraid and panic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then their heart rate goes way up and </v>

685
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:46.450
<v Speaker 4>then they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

686
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:48.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to die and while I do it while</v>
<v Speaker 4>I die,</v>

687
00:38:48.641 --> 00:38:49.474
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make an absolute fool of </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself and everyone's going to laugh at </v>

688
00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:52.060
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

689
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.870
<v Speaker 4>So that's social rejection and </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological mortality.</v>

690
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.840
<v Speaker 4>Staring them right in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

691
00:38:58.841 --> 00:38:59.674
<v Speaker 4>so then you take an agoraphobic and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>find out her background because as I </v>

692
00:39:03.971 --> 00:39:06.910
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's usually women and then you start to</v>

693
00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:09.850
<v Speaker 4>expose that person to the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's afraid of.</v>

694
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.950
<v Speaker 4>Elevators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe subways,</v>

695
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.023
<v Speaker 4>taxis actually agoraphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really what happens is they're not </v>

696
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:19.120
<v Speaker 4>really so much afraid of of places or </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

697
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.343
<v Speaker 4>What they're afraid of is being trapped </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a place or a situation where they </v>

698
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:27.880
<v Speaker 4>can't get away and then if they had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart attack,</v>

699
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:29.710
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't be able to get to an </v>
<v Speaker 4>emergency ward.</v>

700
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.440
<v Speaker 4>So that's really at the basis of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fear and so on.</v>

701
00:39:33.441 --> 00:39:34.274
<v Speaker 4>The emergency roared reward thing only </v>
<v Speaker 4>helps to a limited degree because if </v>

702
00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:39.490
<v Speaker 4>you're having a heart attack and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good one,</v>

703
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.653
<v Speaker 4>your dad and so the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a place where recourse to </v>

704
00:39:43.961 --> 00:39:45.850
<v Speaker 4>authority is only going to take you so </v>
<v Speaker 4>far.</v>

705
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:46.721
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a,</v>

706
00:39:46.721 --> 00:39:49.360
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a good solution to the problem.</v>

707
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what do you do?</v>

708
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.473
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you expose the person maybe to an </v>

709
00:39:54.131 --> 00:39:58.600
<v Speaker 4>elevator and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the elevator is there and you tell</v>

710
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:01.810
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well can you get on an elevator?</v>

711
00:40:01.811 --> 00:40:02.644
<v Speaker 4>And they say no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say Well can you look at an elevator </v>

712
00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:04.930
<v Speaker 4>while?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

713
00:40:04.931 --> 00:40:06.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about some pictures of an elevator?</v>

714
00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:07.504
<v Speaker 4>So you show them some pictures of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>elevator on Google and maybe one with </v>

715
00:40:10.901 --> 00:40:11.734
<v Speaker 4>closed doors and one with open doors and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have them look at the damn thing </v>

716
00:40:14.651 --> 00:40:18.250
<v Speaker 4>because they won't want to look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll want to look away,</v>

717
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.430
<v Speaker 4>but you can't look away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to investigate it.</v>

718
00:40:21.431 --> 00:40:24.400
<v Speaker 4>And then what your brain learns is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're afraid of that thing,</v>

719
00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:27.460
<v Speaker 4>but you can scan it with your eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing happens.</v>

720
00:40:27.461 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 4>It's like the rat in the cage sniffing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and realizing,</v>

721
00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:32.650
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can sniff it and he doesn't die.</v>

722
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:35.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can look at the picture of</v>
<v Speaker 4>an elevator and you don't die.</v>

723
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do that until you're bored and not.</v>

724
00:40:38.351 --> 00:40:43.330
<v Speaker 4>That's then you've learned that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that elevator without dying.</v>

725
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.553
<v Speaker 4>It's built right into you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then maybe I can take you out and </v>

726
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.770
<v Speaker 4>we'll look at a real elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you.</v>

727
00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.411
<v Speaker 4>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

728
00:40:50.411 --> 00:40:52.840
<v Speaker 4>let's walk as close to that elevator is </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can manage.</v>

729
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:55.600
<v Speaker 4>I want you right on the edge between </v>
<v Speaker 4>order and chaos.</v>

730
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to find that edge.</v>

731
00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.230
<v Speaker 4>Can you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you stand here?</v>

732
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.790
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about here?</v>

733
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.710
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that's good enough.</v>

734
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.870
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're standing here,</v>

735
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.500
<v Speaker 4>order chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where you're at.</v>

736
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.490
<v Speaker 4>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You stand there and you notice you don't</v>

737
00:41:12.491 --> 00:41:15.430
<v Speaker 4>die and you do that long enough so </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're bored with it.</v>

738
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:16.091
<v Speaker 4>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

739
00:41:16.091 --> 00:41:18.280
<v Speaker 4>can you step three feet closer?</v>

740
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:19.900
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>

741
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe after three weeks you say,</v>

742
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:23.620
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're by the door,</v>

743
00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:24.454
<v Speaker 4>so here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to open that door and I'm </v>

744
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:29.590
<v Speaker 4>going to hold it open and I'm not going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to play a trick on you,</v>

745
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.470
<v Speaker 4>and so what you're going to do is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>poke your head in and take a around,</v>

746
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.140
<v Speaker 4>and so imagine doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

747
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:37.190
<v Speaker 4>so you imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

748
00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:40.340
<v Speaker 4>now actually do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I know I don't let go of the door.</v>

749
00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.510
<v Speaker 4>That's what evil psychotherapists do </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyways.</v>

750
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:45.733
<v Speaker 4>Then you get the person inside and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you see is they're looking at their </v>

751
00:41:47.511 --> 00:41:49.100
<v Speaker 4>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're in there,</v>

752
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:50.390
<v Speaker 4>but they're not really in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He say,</v>

753
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:50.691
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

754
00:41:50.691 --> 00:41:51.200
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta.</v>

755
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta.</v>

756
00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.990
<v Speaker 4>Look in the corners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to look at the numbers.</v>

757
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:57.110
<v Speaker 4>You've got to see that you're in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that you're afraid of,</v>

758
00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.290
<v Speaker 4>and so you have them look around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>look around and look around.</v>

759
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 4>They're like the rat coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relaxing and starting to move.</v>

760
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:04.611
<v Speaker 4>Then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

761
00:42:04.611 --> 00:42:07.040
<v Speaker 4>that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get out of the elevator slowly.</v>

762
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.680
<v Speaker 4>Don't rush out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just go out Carmley.</v>

763
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go home,</v>

764
00:42:11.601 --> 00:42:14.390
<v Speaker 4>sleep for a week and then come back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll do it again.</v>

765
00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:15.224
<v Speaker 4>And then if you do that for it depends </v>
<v Speaker 4>on how fast the person is capable of </v>

766
00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.253
<v Speaker 4>advancing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can move people through phobias </v>

767
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:22.873
<v Speaker 4>pretty fast if they trust you and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to trust you and you have to be </v>

768
00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:26.750
<v Speaker 4>careful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say you say to them,</v>

769
00:42:26.751 --> 00:42:27.584
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we will stop doing this whenever you </v>

770
00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:31.220
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you say so.</v>

771
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.770
<v Speaker 4>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is completely up to you.</v>

772
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm not pushing you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got no demands on you.</v>

773
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:39.920
<v Speaker 4>You want to be able to go outside again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna.</v>

774
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.220
<v Speaker 4>Walk through that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not performing for me.</v>

775
00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.320
<v Speaker 4>This isn't a test,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't a contest,</v>

776
00:42:45.321 --> 00:42:47.540
<v Speaker 4>it's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you're done,</v>

777
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.080
<v Speaker 4>we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

778
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.820
<v Speaker 4>you can also have help people like step </v>
<v Speaker 4>through that.</v>

779
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:53.654
<v Speaker 4>So I was treating someone who had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>needle phobia recently and this person </v>

780
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:57.463
<v Speaker 4>really felt trapped by authority figures</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were medical and this person had </v>

781
00:43:01.971 --> 00:43:02.804
<v Speaker 4>their reasons for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the first thing I did because we </v>

782
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:06.014
<v Speaker 4>were working with this needle was say </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to practice getting the </v>

783
00:43:08.811 --> 00:43:11.270
<v Speaker 4>hell out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'll come at you.</v>

784
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 4>I'll come at you with this needle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

785
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a needle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we'll pretend I do.</v>

786
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:16.664
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to move it towards you and </v>

787
00:43:17.601 --> 00:43:18.434
<v Speaker 4>you're going to tell me to stop and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to leave the room because </v>

788
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:22.730
<v Speaker 4>you want to see that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

789
00:43:22.731 --> 00:43:23.541
<v Speaker 4>and the person will think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

790
00:43:23.541 --> 00:43:24.200
<v Speaker 4>I know I can.</v>

791
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:24.651
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

792
00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:25.484
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

793
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.473
<v Speaker 4>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we're going to practice it just </v>

794
00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:29.504
<v Speaker 4>like a kid pretending.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I moved forward with the </v>

795
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.500
<v Speaker 4>nonexistent needle and they say stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I stopped and they say I'm leaving.</v>

796
00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:40.130
<v Speaker 4>And they leave and they come back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're smiling because they didn't know</v>

797
00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:41.750
<v Speaker 4>they could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

798
00:43:41.751 --> 00:43:44.450
<v Speaker 4>in part of them is still thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I'm a four year old kid and there's</v>

799
00:43:44.451 --> 00:43:45.960
<v Speaker 4>no way I can get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's gonna.</v>

800
00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.020
<v Speaker 4>Listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's built right into them.</v>

801
00:43:48.021 --> 00:43:51.050
<v Speaker 4>That's like Freud and regression or </v>
<v Speaker 4>fixation.</v>

802
00:43:51.051 --> 00:43:54.340
<v Speaker 4>At an earlier developmental stages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you watch that with you,</v>

803
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:57.410
<v Speaker 4>watch for that in people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you can see how old they are,</v>

804
00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you.</v>

805
00:43:58.371 --> 00:44:01.040
<v Speaker 4>If you tap into something that they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>afraid of very young,</v>

806
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.580
<v Speaker 4>their whole facial expression will turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>into that person their body language and</v>

807
00:44:04.581 --> 00:44:05.210
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

808
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.730
<v Speaker 4>It's very interesting to watch very </v>
<v Speaker 4>carefully to see it,</v>

809
00:44:07.731 --> 00:44:11.390
<v Speaker 4>but you can definitely see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So okay.</v>

810
00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 4>So with the agoraphobic you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you treat the Agora phobic,</v>

811
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:17.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then she can go take taxis and she'd</v>

812
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:21.380
<v Speaker 4>go on the subway and then she goes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a big fight with her husband because</v>

813
00:44:21.381 --> 00:44:22.214
<v Speaker 4>she showed it had 1:20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she was dependent and authority </v>

814
00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:26.594
<v Speaker 4>seeking so she never would risk it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if she upset the relationship </v>

815
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 4>with authority that it would expose her </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the world.</v>

816
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:32.993
<v Speaker 4>And so she was always in a subordinate </v>
<v Speaker 4>and inferior position and a bit of a </v>

817
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:38.400
<v Speaker 4>slave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that often happens</v>

818
00:44:38.401 --> 00:44:40.240
<v Speaker 4>when you treat someone with Agora </v>
<v Speaker 4>Phobias,</v>

819
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 4>they get a lot more assertive and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

820
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:43.134
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things the psychoanalysts </v>

821
00:44:45.691 --> 00:44:46.524
<v Speaker 4>objected to when the behaviors started </v>
<v Speaker 4>to use exposure therapy as a treatment </v>

822
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:50.904
<v Speaker 4>was the idea that there would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>substitution because the psychoanalyst </v>

823
00:44:53.631 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 4>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not really afraid of an elevator.</v>

824
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:57.413
<v Speaker 4>So if I just treat your elevator fear </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's really not what you're </v>

825
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:00.954
<v Speaker 4>afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fear is just going to pop up </v>

826
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:04.470
<v Speaker 4>somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be symbolic substitution.</v>

827
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:05.543
<v Speaker 4>But that isn't what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened was is that if they learn </v>

828
00:45:07.981 --> 00:45:08.814
<v Speaker 4>to get on the elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are much more likely to take a </v>

829
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:11.700
<v Speaker 4>taxi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>

830
00:45:11.701 --> 00:45:12.690
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is that?</v>

831
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.380
<v Speaker 4>It's because they weren't learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The things were less frightening.</v>

832
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:17.214
<v Speaker 4>That was the original idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The original idea was counter </v>

833
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.153
<v Speaker 4>conditioning that basically the person </v>
<v Speaker 4>had been conditioned to be afraid of </v>

834
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.353
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was and then what you did </v>
<v Speaker 4>was you put them in an encounter with </v>

835
00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:29.514
<v Speaker 4>that and you let them breathe and relax </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the relaxation they learned </v>

836
00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:36.330
<v Speaker 4>would counteract the panic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why exposure therapy work.</v>

837
00:45:36.331 --> 00:45:38.370
<v Speaker 4>But it turned out you didn't need to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>any of that.</v>

838
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't counter conditioning at all.</v>

839
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:41.700
<v Speaker 4>And so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

840
00:45:41.701 --> 00:45:44.520
<v Speaker 4>it's fear reduction or habituation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the next theory.</v>

841
00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:48.810
<v Speaker 4>Habituation is just take a snail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He comes out of his shell,</v>

842
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.823
<v Speaker 4>you poke them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes into his shell and he comes out </v>

843
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.830
<v Speaker 4>to get poke sell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tease a snail if you,</v>

844
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.713
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

845
00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.770
<v Speaker 4>if you ever need to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he comes out and you tap them and you</v>

846
00:45:58.771 --> 00:46:01.570
<v Speaker 4>do that 10 or 15 times the snail gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>bored and you tap him.</v>

847
00:46:01.571 --> 00:46:02.404
<v Speaker 4>He just sits there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he doesn't get bored because snails </v>

848
00:46:04.141 --> 00:46:05.550
<v Speaker 4>are probably always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always board.</v>

849
00:46:05.551 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 4>But what's happened is that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sense,</v>

850
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:11.880
<v Speaker 4>you've exhausted the nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 4>representation.</v>

851
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.193
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you can think about it as a very </v>

852
00:46:14.941 --> 00:46:17.100
<v Speaker 4>simple form of learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's habituation.</v>

853
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.710
<v Speaker 4>It's learn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you learn to ignore.</v>

854
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:24.330
<v Speaker 4>And the idea then for a while was that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were teaching people to habituate to</v>

855
00:46:24.331 --> 00:46:27.630
<v Speaker 4>these things they were afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that also turned out not to be true.</v>

856
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:28.703
<v Speaker 4>What you're actually doing is teaching </v>
<v Speaker 4>the person to be brave and that </v>

857
00:46:32.191 --> 00:46:33.024
<v Speaker 4>generalizes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what happens is they think they're </v>

858
00:46:35.071 --> 00:46:36.830
<v Speaker 4>all pathetic and and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

859
00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.693
<v Speaker 4>and fear ridden and tiny and vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 4>and useless and and so they're acting </v>

860
00:46:42.961 --> 00:46:44.430
<v Speaker 4>like that and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well look,</v>

861
00:46:44.431 --> 00:46:46.170
<v Speaker 4>this is a horrible thing you've got </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

862
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:47.663
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we see if you can manage it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they go through it and they </v>

863
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:50.101
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

864
00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:51.440
<v Speaker 4>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi,</v>

865
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:52.463
<v Speaker 4>I'm not as useless as I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe they try 20 things like </v>

866
00:46:54.781 --> 00:46:55.620
<v Speaker 4>that and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

867
00:46:55.621 --> 00:46:56.454
<v Speaker 4>I'm a lot tougher than I knew I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they stand up a little bit </v>

868
00:46:58.771 --> 00:47:01.750
<v Speaker 4>straighter because they're a little more</v>
<v Speaker 4>dominant in their serotonin system.</v>

869
00:47:01.751 --> 00:47:02.584
<v Speaker 4>Start to work again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they're ready to take on the </v>

870
00:47:04.381 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 4>world more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so maybe that's why they go home and</v>

871
00:47:06.361 --> 00:47:07.194
<v Speaker 4>have a fight with their stupid husband </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that doesn't necessarily make him </v>

872
00:47:09.721 --> 00:47:10.710
<v Speaker 4>very happy either.</v>

873
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:14.040
<v Speaker 4>And that would be a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an example of psychotherapy,</v>

874
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:14.913
<v Speaker 4>pubic resistance from a family member.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you really want your person to be </v>

875
00:47:17.911 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 4>better?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

876
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.510
<v Speaker 4>If they are a little more assertive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>little less fearful,</v>

877
00:47:21.511 --> 00:47:22.344
<v Speaker 4>you might not be able to tyrannize over </v>
<v Speaker 4>them so easily and so it's not </v>

878
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:27.210
<v Speaker 4>necessarily the case at all that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be happy about that,</v>

879
00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.200
<v Speaker 4>so you've got to watch that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing too,</v>

880
00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:30.034
<v Speaker 4>and maybe the person wouldn't even be </v>
<v Speaker 4>that happy about it because they're </v>

881
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:36.940
<v Speaker 4>getting all sorts of secondary benefits </v>
<v Speaker 4>from being neurotic and martyred because</v>

882
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 4>that's how vicious weapon to be weak and</v>
<v Speaker 4>useless.</v>

883
00:47:40.001 --> 00:47:43.600
<v Speaker 4>If you can wield that as a weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's extraordinarily effective.</v>

884
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.793
<v Speaker 4>So you gotta watch for that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing to be working against your </v>

885
00:47:46.601 --> 00:47:51.601
<v Speaker 4>psychotherapeutic aims as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Psychoanalysis,</v>

886
00:47:52.171 --> 00:47:53.004
<v Speaker 4>existentialism seeks to utilize these </v>
<v Speaker 4>very conflicts as avenues to the more </v>

887
00:47:55.831 --> 00:47:59.610
<v Speaker 4>profound self understanding of mat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In many ways,</v>

888
00:47:59.611 --> 00:48:03.570
<v Speaker 4>existential invisible existentialism is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the unique and specific portrayal of the</v>

889
00:48:03.571 --> 00:48:05.940
<v Speaker 4>psychological predicament of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Contemporary Matt.</v>

890
00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:09.600
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that relates back to the idea that</v>

891
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.263
<v Speaker 4>modern people have been stripped of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their archaic belief systems that are </v>

892
00:48:15.031 --> 00:48:20.031
<v Speaker 4>exposed more completely to to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility of a meaningless and painful</v>

893
00:48:23.461 --> 00:48:25.920
<v Speaker 4>existence with no superordinate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning.</v>

894
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:29.783
<v Speaker 4>Existentialism is not a school of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought nor reduceable to one set of </v>

895
00:48:32.281 --> 00:48:33.114
<v Speaker 4>tenants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The three writers who appear invariably </v>

896
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.200
<v Speaker 4>on every list of existentialists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>existentialist,</v>

897
00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:38.363
<v Speaker 4>Heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Sartre are not in agreement on </v>

898
00:48:40.141 --> 00:48:40.974
<v Speaker 4>essentials,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such a legend precursors as Pascal and </v>

899
00:48:43.141 --> 00:48:47.310
<v Speaker 4>kierkegaard differed from all three men </v>
<v Speaker 4>by being dedicated Christians and Pascal</v>

900
00:48:47.311 --> 00:48:51.090
<v Speaker 4>was a catholic of sorts while </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kierkegaard was a Protestant Protestant.</v>

901
00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:55.110
<v Speaker 4>If there's often done Nietzsche and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky or included in the fold,</v>

902
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.590
<v Speaker 4>then we must make room for an </v>
<v Speaker 4>impassioned Antichristian,</v>

903
00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:03.270
<v Speaker 4>Nicha and an even more fanatical Greek </v>
<v Speaker 4>Orthodox Russian imperialist.</v>

904
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:05.550
<v Speaker 4>That's a little hard on Dostoevsky I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would say,</v>

905
00:49:05.551 --> 00:49:06.384
<v Speaker 4>but by the time we consider adding real </v>
<v Speaker 4>key CAFCA Ortega and come to it became </v>

906
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.843
<v Speaker 4>plain that one essential features shared</v>
<v Speaker 4>by all these men is their preferred </v>

907
00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:15.420
<v Speaker 4>individualism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

908
00:49:15.421 --> 00:49:18.000
<v Speaker 4>so that's another element of </v>
<v Speaker 4>existentialism.</v>

909
00:49:18.001 --> 00:49:23.001
<v Speaker 4>The locale of action is in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual and the idea is that well,</v>

910
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:28.670
<v Speaker 4>you're faded in some sense to suffer and</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be vulnerable as an individual.</v>

911
00:49:28.861 --> 00:49:33.750
<v Speaker 4>And so the right unit of analysis for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people is as individuals,</v>

912
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:34.643
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's a primary tenant of </v>

913
00:49:36.001 --> 00:49:38.820
<v Speaker 4>psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are family psychotherapy schools.</v>

914
00:49:38.821 --> 00:49:39.654
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but individual psychotherapy is </v>

915
00:49:41.521 --> 00:49:42.354
<v Speaker 4>predicated on the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual is the right level of </v>

916
00:49:45.541 --> 00:49:47.490
<v Speaker 4>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the correct level of analysis,</v>

917
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.060
<v Speaker 4>intense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intense,</v>

918
00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:52.043
<v Speaker 4>committed.</v>

919
00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.480
<v Speaker 4>I can give you an interesting example of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

920
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:56.733
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to do is you're going to do the </v>

921
00:49:59.111 --> 00:49:59.944
<v Speaker 4>personality analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is part of this self authoring </v>

922
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:04.980
<v Speaker 4>suite that my colleagues and I have have</v>
<v Speaker 4>developed.</v>

923
00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.273
<v Speaker 4>If you take maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would also do the future authoring </v>

924
00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:09.124
<v Speaker 4>exercise and we've done that for people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly university students mostly in </v>

925
00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:15.124
<v Speaker 4>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I want to tell you an interesting </v>

926
00:50:16.631 --> 00:50:18.700
<v Speaker 4>story and this has been replicated a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of times.</v>

927
00:50:18.701 --> 00:50:22.720
<v Speaker 4>So in the business school at at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rotterdam School of Management,</v>

928
00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:23.554
<v Speaker 4>we've tested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've put about 4,000 students through </v>

929
00:50:25.601 --> 00:50:26.434
<v Speaker 4>this future authoring program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That helps you make a plan for three to </v>

930
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 4>five years into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A plan and a counter plan.</v>

931
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.413
<v Speaker 4>The plan is what you want to have happen</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the counter plan is what you really </v>

932
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:36.074
<v Speaker 4>do not want to have happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you make a plan to avoid the </v>

933
00:50:38.601 --> 00:50:40.280
<v Speaker 4>ladder and to move towards the former.</v>

934
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:41.653
<v Speaker 4>And we compared their performance three </v>
<v Speaker 4>years per students performance to the </v>

935
00:50:46.011 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 4>performance of students three years </v>
<v Speaker 4>before that.</v>

936
00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:48.944
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't a perfect design,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although we also did a controlled study </v>

937
00:50:50.991 --> 00:50:54.940
<v Speaker 4>that had the same results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when,</v>

938
00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:55.853
<v Speaker 4>when we started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before we started having people do this </v>

939
00:50:57.801 --> 00:51:00.470
<v Speaker 4>plan here was the ranking of </v>
<v Speaker 4>performance.</v>

940
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 4>So we looked at ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ethnicity,</v>

941
00:51:02.571 --> 00:51:03.404
<v Speaker 4>and gender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the top performing people were Dutch </v>

942
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:10.550
<v Speaker 4>national women and they were a minority </v>
<v Speaker 4>among the business students and probably</v>

943
00:51:10.551 --> 00:51:13.280
<v Speaker 4>a fairly selected minority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe that's what accounted for their</v>

944
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:14.114
<v Speaker 4>higher performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although women tend to be outperforming </v>

945
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:16.773
<v Speaker 4>men in academic institutions pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the way from elementary school </v>

946
00:51:19.821 --> 00:51:22.370
<v Speaker 4>through university now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just an absolute catastrophe.</v>

947
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:25.160
<v Speaker 4>But we won't talk about that now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

948
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:25.994
<v Speaker 4>And then the next highest performing </v>
<v Speaker 4>group were Dutch nationals and then the </v>

949
00:51:29.121 --> 00:51:33.620
<v Speaker 4>next highest performing group were </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonwestern ethnic minority women and the</v>

950
00:51:33.621 --> 00:51:36.020
<v Speaker 4>lowest performing group or West </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonwestern,</v>

951
00:51:36.021 --> 00:51:38.300
<v Speaker 4>west non ethnic minority men.</v>

952
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:40.430
<v Speaker 4>And there were quite a few people in all</v>
<v Speaker 4>those categories.</v>

953
00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:44.000
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't just even a couple dozen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a couple of hundred solid study.</v>

954
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.750
<v Speaker 4>And within two years after doing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>future authoring program,</v>

955
00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:51.590
<v Speaker 4>the nonwestern ethnic minority men were </v>
<v Speaker 4>outperforming the Dutch women.</v>

956
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:52.833
<v Speaker 4>They're their academic performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went up 70 percent and their dropout </v>

957
00:51:55.821 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 4>rate plummeted and it really looks good </v>
<v Speaker 4>for decreasing dropout rate.</v>

958
00:51:59.121 --> 00:51:59.954
<v Speaker 4>And the reason I'm telling you about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is because people make the </v>

959
00:52:02.451 --> 00:52:03.284
<v Speaker 4>automatic assumption that ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 4>disparities and ethnic performance are </v>

960
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:09.740
<v Speaker 4>necessarily a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sociological inequality,</v>

961
00:52:09.741 --> 00:52:12.830
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or sociological or political or economic</v>

962
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:14.653
<v Speaker 4>disparity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say this was a pure psychological </v>

963
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:17.743
<v Speaker 4>intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wiped out the difference completely </v>

964
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:19.873
<v Speaker 4>and the Dutch women had actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>improved slightly over that two year </v>

965
00:52:22.461 --> 00:52:24.830
<v Speaker 4>period as a consequence of doing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>program as well.</v>

966
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:28.670
<v Speaker 4>So the man not only caught up to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>women the way they were performing,</v>

967
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:33.671
<v Speaker 4>but the way they were performing even </v>
<v Speaker 4>better in the in the aftermath of having</v>

968
00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:34.874
<v Speaker 4>a plant.</v>

969
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:35.833
<v Speaker 4>So our provisional theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've replicated that at a couple of </v>

970
00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:39.590
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It works better for men.</v>

971
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:41.750
<v Speaker 4>Now that's partly because women are </v>
<v Speaker 4>already doing well,</v>

972
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 4>but we have a hypothesis that men are </v>
<v Speaker 4>ordinary enough so that unless they have</v>

973
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:47.630
<v Speaker 4>their own plan and they just won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>perform.</v>

974
00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:49.423
<v Speaker 4>I think it's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>disagreeableness now we don't know that </v>

975
00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:53.780
<v Speaker 4>for sure because we haven't been able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>disentangle that,</v>

976
00:52:53.781 --> 00:52:57.600
<v Speaker 4>but it's been a very striking finding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

977
00:52:57.601 --> 00:52:58.580
<v Speaker 4>so you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

978
00:52:58.581 --> 00:52:59.414
<v Speaker 4>what's the right level of analysis when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to to improve human </v>

979
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:05.570
<v Speaker 4>adaptation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terrible word,</v>

980
00:53:05.571 --> 00:53:06.404
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

981
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.053
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it'll do for now because I can't </v>

982
00:53:11.091 --> 00:53:12.800
<v Speaker 4>think of another one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

983
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:16.370
<v Speaker 4>the refusal to belong to any school of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>

984
00:53:16.371 --> 00:53:19.580
<v Speaker 4>the repudiation of the adequacy of any </v>
<v Speaker 4>body of beliefs,</v>

985
00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:20.683
<v Speaker 4>whatever and especially of systems and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>market dissatisfaction with traditional </v>

986
00:53:24.141 --> 00:53:27.120
<v Speaker 4>philosophy as academic and remote from </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

987
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:28.163
<v Speaker 4>That's the heart of existentialism and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that if you're a good </v>

988
00:53:31.621 --> 00:53:35.970
<v Speaker 4>psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take an existential approach to your</v>

989
00:53:35.971 --> 00:53:36.804
<v Speaker 4>clients and that's why listening is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>important as well because it's really </v>

990
00:53:40.261 --> 00:53:41.094
<v Speaker 4>useful to have a body of theories about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what might be up with a person and how </v>

991
00:53:45.841 --> 00:53:46.674
<v Speaker 4>you might approach the problem and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a whole array of psychotherapeutic </v>

992
00:53:52.231 --> 00:53:53.760
<v Speaker 4>tools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those would be the.</v>

993
00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.300
<v Speaker 4>The theories that we've been discussing </v>
<v Speaker 4>opens up your,</v>

994
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:59.580
<v Speaker 4>your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes you more skilled,</v>

995
00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:01.140
<v Speaker 4>it gives you more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more to offer,</v>

996
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.213
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to be careful not to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hammer the person into one of those </v>

997
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:05.244
<v Speaker 4>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

998
00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:06.293
<v Speaker 4>sometimes that's useful because if </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone comes to you and they're just </v>

999
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:10.410
<v Speaker 4>chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got no structure at all.</v>

1000
00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:11.453
<v Speaker 4>If you approach them as if their </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems were Friday and at least it's </v>

1001
00:54:14.281 --> 00:54:15.114
<v Speaker 4>systematic and they can come out with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>systematic understanding of their </v>

1002
00:54:17.971 --> 00:54:20.250
<v Speaker 4>problem and it might match to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree,</v>

1003
00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:21.084
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're having all sorts of anxiety </v>

1004
00:54:22.621 --> 00:54:23.454
<v Speaker 4>and depression problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could probably look into your family </v>

1005
00:54:25.711 --> 00:54:30.150
<v Speaker 4>history and identify reasons why that </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be at least partly the case and so</v>

1006
00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 4>at at least a reasonable.</v>

1007
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:32.933
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's multiple reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least nailing one of them would </v>

1008
00:54:34.891 --> 00:54:37.140
<v Speaker 4>be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More useful than nailing none of them.</v>

1009
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what's better is to treat the person</v>

1010
00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:41.793
<v Speaker 4>as someone you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have no idea what's up with this </v>

1011
00:54:43.621 --> 00:54:44.454
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have a bunch of potential tools </v>

1012
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:47.304
<v Speaker 4>to use and then you talk to them and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>treat them as if they're unique and </v>

1013
00:54:51.451 --> 00:54:53.940
<v Speaker 4>you've figured out what is up with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Specifically,</v>

1014
00:54:53.941 --> 00:54:55.690
<v Speaker 4>and they tell you what's up with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1015
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:56.543
<v Speaker 4>they've got all sorts of cockeyed </v>
<v Speaker 4>theories about who they are and what </v>

1016
00:54:58.381 --> 00:54:59.214
<v Speaker 4>they're doing and it's scattered and </v>
<v Speaker 4>paradoxical and it doesn't make much </v>

1017
00:55:02.221 --> 00:55:05.310
<v Speaker 4>sense and it's like a bad undergraduate </v>
<v Speaker 4>essay.</v>

1018
00:55:05.311 --> 00:55:06.570
<v Speaker 4>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's full.</v>

1019
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.750
<v Speaker 4>Well really it's full of internal </v>
<v Speaker 4>contradictions and it's incoherent,</v>

1020
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.050
<v Speaker 4>but if you listen long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stops being the case.</v>

1021
00:55:13.051 --> 00:55:13.884
<v Speaker 4>The person starts to pull themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>together with their representation and </v>

1022
00:55:17.191 --> 00:55:19.860
<v Speaker 4>they start to act that out properly and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's great,</v>

1023
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:20.753
<v Speaker 4>so that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's you could consider that applied </v>

1024
00:55:23.701 --> 00:55:24.690
<v Speaker 4>existentialism.</v>

1025
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:29.730
<v Speaker 4>Now</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other thing,</v>

1026
00:55:29.731 --> 00:55:31.740
<v Speaker 4>the existentialists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of romantic,</v>

1027
00:55:31.741 --> 00:55:32.574
<v Speaker 4>I would say even the Romantics are are </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinkers who who deny the overarching </v>

1028
00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:41.100
<v Speaker 4>supremacy of rationality and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellect.</v>

1029
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.233
<v Speaker 4>They would say that to think about life </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a problem that is to be solved </v>

1030
00:55:45.451 --> 00:55:46.284
<v Speaker 4>rationally is insufficient because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not a rational being or you're </v>

1031
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:49.824
<v Speaker 4>only partly a rational being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're also an emotional being and </v>

1032
00:55:52.201 --> 00:55:53.034
<v Speaker 4>you're a motivated being and you're an </v>
<v Speaker 4>embodied being and that's a lot </v>

1033
00:55:55.471 --> 00:55:56.304
<v Speaker 4>different than being purely rational and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say there's actually not even </v>

1034
00:55:59.581 --> 00:56:01.940
<v Speaker 4>debate about that anymore because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1035
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.823
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty damn clear that rationality </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot really operate unless it's </v>

1036
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:09.540
<v Speaker 4>embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it has a,</v>

1037
00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:10.763
<v Speaker 4>it has a set of operations that it can </v>
<v Speaker 4>undertake that it's motivated so that </v>

1038
00:56:14.941 --> 00:56:17.200
<v Speaker 4>there's certain things it's doing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>other things that aren't,</v>

1039
00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:21.240
<v Speaker 4>that it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's emotional because emotions are</v>

1040
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.793
<v Speaker 4>low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick solutions to problems that can't </v>

1041
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 4>be computed.</v>

1042
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:27.933
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get in an argument and we just can't </v>

1043
00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:32.290
<v Speaker 4>go anywhere and at some point you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well to hell with you,</v>

1044
00:56:32.291 --> 00:56:34.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm going home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're angry when.</v>

1045
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:35.411
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1046
00:56:35.411 --> 00:56:37.660
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to have the stupid </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument anymore.</v>

1047
00:56:37.661 --> 00:56:38.494
<v Speaker 4>So the anger is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a way of popping you out of a </v>

1048
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 4>rational framework that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>escaping from.</v>

1049
00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:44.741
<v Speaker 4>You just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1050
00:56:44.741 --> 00:56:48.760
<v Speaker 4>this is stupid and you leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's nothing rational about</v>

1051
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:49.594
<v Speaker 4>that except that you don't want to stand</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and argue till you starve to </v>

1052
00:56:51.911 --> 00:56:53.020
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1053
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:54.993
<v Speaker 4>So we need the emotions to give you </v>
<v Speaker 4>guides in situations that you can't </v>

1054
00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:00.244
<v Speaker 4>really compute your way through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so and only inside of that does </v>

1055
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:04.323
<v Speaker 4>rationality operate with all of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>underlying predicates and the </v>

1056
00:57:07.481 --> 00:57:08.314
<v Speaker 4>rationality has to be informed by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>body and by the motivations and by the </v>

1057
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.790
<v Speaker 4>emotions for it to even operate.</v>

1058
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:16.150
<v Speaker 4>So the existentialists are correct about</v>
<v Speaker 4>that too.</v>

1059
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:20.740
<v Speaker 4>To deny rationality as the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>principle of orientation.</v>

1060
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.440
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that irrationality is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right approach.</v>

1061
00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:28.540
<v Speaker 4>It means that rationality has to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>augmented by other elements of being.</v>

1062
00:57:28.541 --> 00:57:29.374
<v Speaker 4>I'll almost have subjective big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's akin to the psychoanalytic </v>

1063
00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:32.614
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have to integrate your drives </v>

1064
00:57:35.261 --> 00:57:37.930
<v Speaker 4>and emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially anger and sexuality into your</v>

1065
00:57:37.931 --> 00:57:41.580
<v Speaker 4>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also akin to Piaget's idea that this</v>

1066
00:57:41.581 --> 00:57:45.130
<v Speaker 4>subpersonalities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reflexes and so forth have to be,</v>

1067
00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jen have to be organized into a playable</v>

1068
00:57:48.341 --> 00:57:50.530
<v Speaker 4>game so that everything is working in </v>
<v Speaker 4>harmony.</v>

1069
00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:51.723
<v Speaker 4>So it's a similar idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the existentialists regard the </v>

1070
00:57:55.691 --> 00:57:56.524
<v Speaker 4>division between object and subject as </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of what specifically torturing </v>

1071
00:58:00.311 --> 00:58:04.090
<v Speaker 4>people who are outside of say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>traditional systems of belief.</v>

1072
00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.010
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a tricky one,</v>

1073
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:07.373
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists might claim that while the </v>

1074
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:10.473
<v Speaker 4>world has material and matter is spent </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially dead and without spirit or </v>

1075
00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.030
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or psyche,</v>

1076
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.493
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's easy as a consequence of </v>

1077
00:58:19.661 --> 00:58:22.450
<v Speaker 4>adopting that viewpoint to think the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing about you,</v>

1078
00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:23.284
<v Speaker 4>that you're ultimately a shortlived </v>
<v Speaker 4>material entity in a meaningless </v>

1079
00:58:27.191 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 4>material world.</v>

1080
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 4>But the weird thing about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is where thinking about is that</v>

1081
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:36.220
<v Speaker 4>if you're a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you throw away this objective as soon as</v>

1082
00:58:36.221 --> 00:58:39.490
<v Speaker 4>you start operating the science because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is,</v>

1083
00:58:39.491 --> 00:58:40.324
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll watch something according to a </v>

1084
00:58:41.711 --> 00:58:42.544
<v Speaker 4>procedure and you'll watch it and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch it and you'll watch it and we're </v>

1085
00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:45.754
<v Speaker 4>only going to allow what all have you </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced the same way to be real </v>

1086
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:53.690
<v Speaker 4>while you throw out the subjective right</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the beginning and then you.</v>

1087
00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:54.880
<v Speaker 4>So you can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1088
00:58:54.881 --> 00:58:55.714
<v Speaker 4>there's no subject left in what results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the reason there's nothing left in </v>

1089
00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:02.080
<v Speaker 4>what results is because you throw it out</v>
<v Speaker 4>to begin with.</v>

1090
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.600
<v Speaker 4>Now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what should you do with it?</v>

1091
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:05.980
<v Speaker 4>When the existentialists say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1092
00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:09.100
<v Speaker 4>you're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't just dispense with it.</v>

1093
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.113
<v Speaker 4>The fact that you're alive is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>critical issue and so you can use </v>

1094
00:59:13.331 --> 00:59:18.331
<v Speaker 4>science as a tool which is proper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you use it as a way of describing</v>

1095
00:59:19.271 --> 00:59:20.104
<v Speaker 4>being well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you fall into this subject object </v>

1096
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:22.694
<v Speaker 4>dichotomy and underneath that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>nihilism or the proclivity for </v>

1097
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:28.220
<v Speaker 4>totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they don't like that idea.</v>

1098
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:33.350
<v Speaker 4>They don't like the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>compartmentalization for people either,</v>

1099
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 4>but we won't go into that to any great </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree.</v>

1100
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.153
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm going to read you some things </v>

1101
00:59:42.851 --> 00:59:45.970
<v Speaker 4>from some of the people that I described</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'll take them apart a little bit.</v>

1102
00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.120
<v Speaker 4>Things I've been collecting for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>period of time.</v>

1103
00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:50.523
<v Speaker 4>So this is Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard and I called </v>

1104
00:59:54.641 --> 00:59:57.400
<v Speaker 4>them prophets of the dawning age care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kguard.</v>

1105
00:59:57.490 --> 00:59:58.323
<v Speaker 4>The Danish philosopher and writer was </v>
<v Speaker 4>really the first person who wrote about </v>

1106
01:00:02.981 --> 01:00:05.810
<v Speaker 4>phenomena like anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dread and,</v>

1107
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:06.311
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1108
01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:07.144
<v Speaker 4>and more particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was the first person to sort of </v>

1109
01:00:10.241 --> 01:00:11.074
<v Speaker 4>conceptualized it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as even as something akin to a </v>

1110
01:00:13.721 --> 01:00:16.330
<v Speaker 4>scientific phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that had existence.</v>

1111
01:00:16.331 --> 01:00:17.710
<v Speaker 4>And he wrote very much about that.</v>

1112
01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:20.613
<v Speaker 4>Nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course was the great prophet of the </v>

1113
01:00:22.331 --> 01:00:23.164
<v Speaker 4>death of God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And and a prognosticator of what the </v>

1114
01:00:26.531 --> 01:00:27.364
<v Speaker 4>psychological consequences of the demise</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this classic meaning structure that </v>

1115
01:00:32.831 --> 01:00:33.664
<v Speaker 4>was unbelievably ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What what the collapse of that actually </v>

1116
01:00:36.851 --> 01:00:37.684
<v Speaker 4>meant to meet you meet you can think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Christianity and then maybe you </v>

1117
01:00:39.731 --> 01:00:43.600
<v Speaker 4>could think about the Judaism that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>embedded in as it even an older system,</v>

1118
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:46.810
<v Speaker 4>but that judy is an emerged out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Middle East,</v>

1119
01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:47.644
<v Speaker 4>partly out of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was it immeshed and even an older </v>

1120
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:51.303
<v Speaker 4>belief system and that was in meshed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>something absolutely prehistoric that </v>

1121
01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:56.913
<v Speaker 4>and so it was a continuum in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>of adaptive structures that reigned </v>

1122
01:01:01.781 --> 01:01:06.730
<v Speaker 4>supreme essentially right until while </v>
<v Speaker 4>right until the scientific revolution,</v>

1123
01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.773
<v Speaker 4>and so we're outside of that now we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a different paradigm and there are </v>

1124
01:01:10.061 --> 01:01:10.894
<v Speaker 4>consequences to that and that was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of thing that Nisha was </v>

1125
01:01:13.691 --> 01:01:14.560
<v Speaker 4>concentrating on it.</v>

1126
01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:15.603
<v Speaker 4>He actually in some ways made it worse </v>
<v Speaker 4>because Nisha was an incredible critic </v>

1127
01:01:18.581 --> 01:01:19.810
<v Speaker 4>of Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1128
01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.033
<v Speaker 4>he wrote a book called the antichrist </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all he did in that book brilliantly </v>

1129
01:01:24.251 --> 01:01:27.670
<v Speaker 4>was take dogmatic Christianity to task.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1130
01:01:27.671 --> 01:01:28.504
<v Speaker 4>one of the things he did say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was very interesting was that </v>

1131
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:31.833
<v Speaker 4>Christianity died at its own hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so his notion was that because </v>

1132
01:01:35.861 --> 01:01:36.694
<v Speaker 4>Christianity say Judaeo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity had elevated truth to the </v>

1133
01:01:40.511 --> 01:01:44.770
<v Speaker 4>highest virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that search for truth then ended up</v>

1134
01:01:44.771 --> 01:01:47.470
<v Speaker 4>undermining the axioms of Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

1135
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:52.710
<v Speaker 4>So it developed a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an unbelievably powerful analytic tool,</v>

1136
01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.610
<v Speaker 4>and then used it to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1137
01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:57.970
<v Speaker 4>it's like we were sitting on a branch </v>
<v Speaker 4>and started off with the saw that we had</v>

1138
01:01:57.971 --> 01:02:01.690
<v Speaker 4>invented and then everyone fell and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky.</v>

1139
01:02:01.691 --> 01:02:04.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky was a orthodox Christian and,</v>

1140
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:05.630
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1141
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:09.880
<v Speaker 4>and also an extraordinarily brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 4>man and he was absolutely terrified at,</v>

1142
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:10.723
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at what the consequences of the </v>

1143
01:02:11.951 --> 01:02:16.120
<v Speaker 4>dissolution of that belief system was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to mean for Russia in particular.</v>

1144
01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 4>And Dostoevsky explored nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great unit to great degree in notes from</v>

1145
01:02:21.181 --> 01:02:22.014
<v Speaker 4>underground and in crime and punishment </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the murderer and crime and </v>

1146
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:28.800
<v Speaker 4>punishment is essentially nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a nihilistic narcissist,</v>

1147
01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:29.634
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what compels them to commit </v>

1148
01:02:31.231 --> 01:02:32.064
<v Speaker 4>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Dostoevsky also wrote a book called </v>

1149
01:02:34.561 --> 01:02:35.394
<v Speaker 4>the Devil's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is an amazing book where he </v>

1150
01:02:36.901 --> 01:02:37.734
<v Speaker 4>predicted that the death of the sudden </v>
<v Speaker 4>death of Christianity in the Soviet in </v>

1151
01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:46.860
<v Speaker 4>Russia was going to produce the </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic totalitarian horrors of the</v>

1152
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.990
<v Speaker 4>Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he predicted that in like 18,</v>

1153
01:02:48.991 --> 01:02:49.980
<v Speaker 4>80,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1890,</v>

1154
01:02:49.981 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 4>which was 30 years before the </v>
<v Speaker 4>revolution,</v>

1155
01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.520
<v Speaker 4>absolutely remarkable</v>

1156
01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:55.913
<v Speaker 4>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a genius nature was a full professor </v>

1157
01:02:59.191 --> 01:03:00.024
<v Speaker 4>when that was impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when he was 24 and that just </v>

1158
01:03:02.761 --> 01:03:05.580
<v Speaker 4>never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so his.</v>

1159
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:06.443
<v Speaker 4>His extraordinary genius was recognized </v>
<v Speaker 4>very early and but he was also </v>

1160
01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:13.560
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily ill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sick physically.</v>

1161
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:18.540
<v Speaker 4>His Dad died at about 40 something they </v>
<v Speaker 4>called a softening of the brain,</v>

1162
01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:21.900
<v Speaker 4>which was actually a fairly common </v>
<v Speaker 4>diagnostic category back then.</v>

1163
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:22.913
<v Speaker 4>No one really knows what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people have suggested that he had </v>

1164
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:30.270
<v Speaker 4>syphilis from one sexual encounter or </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was hereditary,</v>

1165
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.250
<v Speaker 4>but nobody really knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

1166
01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:33.084
<v Speaker 4>his father died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Young and nature died very young as </v>

1167
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:35.544
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went,</v>

1168
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:36.443
<v Speaker 4>he was very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was mentally incapacitated for the </v>

1169
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.040
<v Speaker 4>last few years of his life and died and </v>
<v Speaker 4>died after that.</v>

1170
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.413
<v Speaker 4>And so he could only serve as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>professor for a while because he </v>

1171
01:03:47.851 --> 01:03:48.684
<v Speaker 4>couldn't see very well and he was always</v>
<v Speaker 4>sick and he ended up living in this </v>

1172
01:03:51.571 --> 01:03:52.404
<v Speaker 4>little village,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in Switzerland where he wrote </v>

1173
01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:54.984
<v Speaker 4>his books and he could only write a </v>
<v Speaker 4>paragraph or two at a time without </v>

1174
01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.190
<v Speaker 4>before he became very ill.</v>

1175
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:03.210
<v Speaker 4>And so his writing is extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Condensed in dance and brilliant,</v>

1176
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.010
<v Speaker 4>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

1177
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.780
<v Speaker 4>I think he gave away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1178
01:04:06.781 --> 01:04:09.390
<v Speaker 4>beyond good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is his masterpiece,</v>

1179
01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:10.643
<v Speaker 4>although we had many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it only sold 500 copies in his </v>

1180
01:04:12.871 --> 01:04:14.550
<v Speaker 4>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>

1181
01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:16.830
<v Speaker 4>he also believed that he was only </v>
<v Speaker 4>writing for himself.</v>

1182
01:04:16.831 --> 01:04:17.664
<v Speaker 4>He didn't really know if anybody was </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever going to pay any attention to what </v>

1183
01:04:19.861 --> 01:04:21.270
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they certainly did.</v>

1184
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:22.523
<v Speaker 4>So I would say he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He ended up being certainly one of the </v>

1185
01:04:25.621 --> 01:04:30.210
<v Speaker 4>10 most influential people of the late </v>
<v Speaker 4>19th and early 20th century.</v>

1186
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:35.900
<v Speaker 4>This is an example of his writing of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what is great.</v>

1187
01:04:35.901 --> 01:04:38.840
<v Speaker 4>One must either be silent or speak with </v>
<v Speaker 4>greatness,</v>

1188
01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.810
<v Speaker 4>with greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means cynically and with innocence.</v>

1189
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:47.080
<v Speaker 4>What I relate is the history of the next</v>
<v Speaker 4>two centuries.</v>

1190
01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I described what is coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what can no longer come differently,</v>

1191
01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:55.740
<v Speaker 4>the advent of nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our whole European culture</v>

1192
01:04:57.630 --> 01:05:01.200
<v Speaker 4>is moving from some time now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving for some time now with a tortured</v>

1193
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.063
<v Speaker 4>tension that is growing from decade to </v>
<v Speaker 4>decade as towards a catastrophe </v>

1194
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:06.833
<v Speaker 4>restlessly violently headlong like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>river that wants to reach the end that </v>

1195
01:05:11.191 --> 01:05:14.550
<v Speaker 4>no longer reflects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's afraid to reflect.</v>

1196
01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:15.803
<v Speaker 4>He that speaks here has conversely </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing so far but to reflect as a </v>

1197
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 4>philosopher and solitary by instinct who</v>
<v Speaker 4>has found his advantage in standing,</v>

1198
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:25.174
<v Speaker 4>aside outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why has the advent of nihilism become </v>

1199
01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:31.954
<v Speaker 4>necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry about that because the values we </v>

1200
01:05:35.591 --> 01:05:36.424
<v Speaker 4>have had hitherto thus draw their final </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence because nihilism represents </v>

1201
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:47.170
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate logical conclusion of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>great values and ideals.</v>

1202
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:49.083
<v Speaker 4>Because we must experience nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 4>before we can find out what value those </v>

1203
01:05:53.561 --> 01:05:56.920
<v Speaker 4>values really had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We require at some time,</v>

1204
01:05:56.921 --> 01:05:59.350
<v Speaker 4>new values.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nihilism stands at the door.</v>

1205
01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:05.500
<v Speaker 4>Whence comes this uncanny of all guests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Point of departure.</v>

1206
01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.113
<v Speaker 4>This is a good example of how Nisha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nisha said he philosophized with a </v>

1207
01:06:10.791 --> 01:06:13.700
<v Speaker 4>hammer and and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1208
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:17.640
<v Speaker 4>it means that he spent hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>days,</v>

1209
01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:18.474
<v Speaker 4>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>months concentrating on how to make a </v>

1210
01:06:20.611 --> 01:06:21.444
<v Speaker 4>single sentence as packed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>significance as he could possibly </v>

1211
01:06:24.571 --> 01:06:25.404
<v Speaker 4>manage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so nature said it's the best </v>

1212
01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.940
<v Speaker 4>arrogant statement I've ever read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1213
01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:33.090
<v Speaker 4>I can say in a sentence</v>

1214
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:38.200
<v Speaker 4>what it takes other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a whole book to say,</v>

1215
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:41.980
<v Speaker 4>and then he said what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they can't say in a whole book.</v>

1216
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.330
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty good day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the first one's a real blow to</v>

1217
01:06:46.331 --> 01:06:49.450
<v Speaker 4>the solar plexus and the second one is </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1218
01:06:49.451 --> 01:06:52.480
<v Speaker 4>I can top that with no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Point of departure.</v>

1219
01:06:52.481 --> 01:06:53.314
<v Speaker 4>It is an error to consider social </v>
<v Speaker 4>distress or physiological degeneration </v>

1220
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:59.260
<v Speaker 4>or the corruption of all things as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause of nihilism.</v>

1221
01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:01.623
<v Speaker 4>That's a critique of the later Freudian </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas right there and then because what </v>

1222
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:05.263
<v Speaker 4>niches says would look if things are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going wrong for you or if they're going </v>

1223
01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:08.944
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In general,</v>

1224
01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:11.740
<v Speaker 4>it's really straightforward to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1225
01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:15.520
<v Speaker 4>there's something wrong with society </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be social distress or there's</v>

1226
01:07:15.521 --> 01:07:16.354
<v Speaker 4>some physiological degeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some thing wrong with you </v>

1227
01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:21.910
<v Speaker 4>physically or everything is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrupted.</v>

1228
01:07:21.911 --> 01:07:25.960
<v Speaker 4>Being itself is corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a classic explanation,</v>

1229
01:07:25.961 --> 01:07:26.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1230
01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.490
<v Speaker 4>You hear that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>

1231
01:07:27.491 --> 01:07:28.324
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are suffering for one reason or </v>

1232
01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:29.711
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1233
01:07:29.711 --> 01:07:30.580
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1234
01:07:30.581 --> 01:07:31.414
<v Speaker 4>there's something wrong biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or society is corrupted and everything </v>

1235
01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:35.710
<v Speaker 4>is unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nietzsche says,</v>

1236
01:07:35.711 --> 01:07:36.370
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1237
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:38.050
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to get away with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First.</v>

1238
01:07:38.051 --> 01:07:38.884
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ours is the most honest and </v>

1239
01:07:39.671 --> 01:07:43.450
<v Speaker 4>compassionate age comparing modern </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>

1240
01:07:43.451 --> 01:07:45.820
<v Speaker 4>Let's say to everything that that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>come before it,</v>

1241
01:07:45.821 --> 01:07:48.730
<v Speaker 4>so speaking of corruption is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>something you can do lightly,</v>

1242
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.360
<v Speaker 4>and then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is remarkable distress,</v>

1243
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:53.830
<v Speaker 4>whether psychic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>physical,</v>

1244
01:07:53.831 --> 01:07:56.590
<v Speaker 4>or intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>need not at all produced nihilism.</v>

1245
01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:59.770
<v Speaker 4>That is the radical rejection of value,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning and desirability.</v>

1246
01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:03.670
<v Speaker 4>Such distress always permits a variety </v>
<v Speaker 4>of interpretations.</v>

1247
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a rough one.</v>

1248
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.821
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1249
01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:09.430
<v Speaker 4>you had a rough childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1250
01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:12.520
<v Speaker 4>someone else who had your childhood </v>
<v Speaker 4>might not have drawn those conclusions.</v>

1251
01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:13.354
<v Speaker 4>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that most people who abuse </v>

1252
01:08:15.501 --> 01:08:18.230
<v Speaker 4>children were abused by chilled with as </v>
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>

1253
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1254
01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:20.323
<v Speaker 4>But most people who were abused as </v>
<v Speaker 4>children do not grow up to abuse </v>

1255
01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.750
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can figure that out,</v>

1256
01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.370
<v Speaker 4>arithmetically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if it was,</v>

1257
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:29.263
<v Speaker 4>if it was the case that everyone abused </v>
<v Speaker 4>grew up to abuse in about four </v>

1258
01:08:32.751 --> 01:08:35.300
<v Speaker 4>generations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone would be being beat to death in</v>

1259
01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:38.300
<v Speaker 4>childhood as a matter of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it would spread exponentially.</v>

1260
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:40.370
<v Speaker 4>That isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It dampens.</v>

1261
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.810
<v Speaker 4>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1262
01:08:41.811 --> 01:08:43.610
<v Speaker 4>if you're bullied as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could say,</v>

1263
01:08:43.611 --> 01:08:45.050
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could draw to conclusions.</v>

1264
01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:48.470
<v Speaker 4>Causal Conclusions being bullied caused </v>
<v Speaker 4>me to be a bully.</v>

1265
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.580
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1266
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:50.414
<v Speaker 4>That's an understandable story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about being bullied caused me not </v>

1267
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:55.520
<v Speaker 4>ever to be a bully?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1268
01:08:55.521 --> 01:08:58.160
<v Speaker 4>why is that any less reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 4>conclusion?</v>

1269
01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.473
<v Speaker 4>It's frequently one that people draw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and since the two opposite conclusions </v>

1270
01:09:02.451 --> 01:09:04.610
<v Speaker 4>can be drawn from the same set of </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences,</v>

1271
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:07.700
<v Speaker 4>you cannot say that the experience has </v>
<v Speaker 4>caused the conclusions.</v>

1272
01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.013
<v Speaker 4>And that's Nietzsche's critique of say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sociological or psychological </v>

1273
01:09:12.141 --> 01:09:16.310
<v Speaker 4>determinism with regards to the optimism</v>
<v Speaker 4>or pessimism.</v>

1274
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.173
<v Speaker 4>Pessimism of your worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Such distress always permits a variety </v>

1275
01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:23.030
<v Speaker 4>of interpretations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1276
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Rather it isn't one particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation.</v>

1277
01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:26.834
<v Speaker 4>The Christian moral one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that nihilism is rooted the end of </v>

1278
01:09:29.061 --> 01:09:33.650
<v Speaker 4>Christianity at the hands of its own </v>
<v Speaker 4>morality that was the development of the</v>

1279
01:09:33.651 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 4>sense of truth which cannot be replaced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which turns against the Christian God.</v>

1280
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 4>The sense of truthfulness highly </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed I Christianity is nauseated by</v>

1281
01:09:42.381 --> 01:09:43.214
<v Speaker 4>the falseness and mendacious ness of all</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian interpretations of the world </v>

1282
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.980
<v Speaker 4>and of history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A remarkable claim,</v>

1283
01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.860
<v Speaker 4>and then this one's even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely brilliant.</v>

1284
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:56.840
<v Speaker 4>I think rebound from God is truth to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fanatical faith.</v>

1285
01:09:56.841 --> 01:10:01.070
<v Speaker 4>All his false that's nihilism and active</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buddhism and Nietzsche.</v>

1286
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.590
<v Speaker 4>Nietzsche explains that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>

1287
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.083
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked to you guys a little bit about </v>

1288
01:10:06.141 --> 01:10:06.974
<v Speaker 4>the idea of the game and the metagame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the metagame being the set of all games </v>

1289
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:11.220
<v Speaker 4>niche.</v>

1290
01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:15.020
<v Speaker 4>It draws on a conception like that for </v>
<v Speaker 4>this criticism because he says,</v>

1291
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:16.063
<v Speaker 4>when you lose faith in something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that happens to people very </v>

1292
01:10:18.471 --> 01:10:22.280
<v Speaker 4>frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you lose faith in something because</v>

1293
01:10:22.281 --> 01:10:24.020
<v Speaker 4>you're human and because you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>abstract,</v>

1294
01:10:24.021 --> 01:10:27.260
<v Speaker 4>it's not only that you lose faith in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing,</v>

1295
01:10:27.261 --> 01:10:28.460
<v Speaker 4>that person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that system,</v>

1296
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.863
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you've lost faith in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>indicates to you that it's possible to </v>

1297
01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:37.991
<v Speaker 4>lose faith in anything in every system </v>
<v Speaker 4>and every person once burnt,</v>

1298
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:42.080
<v Speaker 4>forever shy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's nihilism.</v>

1299
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:46.910
<v Speaker 4>The fact that one thing can collapse on </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can make you completely unwilling to</v>

1300
01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:49.550
<v Speaker 4>manifest any faith in anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever,</v>

1301
01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:50.563
<v Speaker 4>and that's the emergence of nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The end of the moral interpretation of </v>

1302
01:10:54.921 --> 01:10:55.754
<v Speaker 4>the world which no longer has any </v>
<v Speaker 4>sanction after it has tried to escape </v>

1303
01:10:58.611 --> 01:10:59.444
<v Speaker 4>into beyond lie leads to nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another critique of Christianity </v>

1304
01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.490
<v Speaker 4>embedded in that sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

1305
01:11:04.491 --> 01:11:05.750
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christiana needed,</v>

1306
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.613
<v Speaker 4>needed to be destroyed even by itself </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it puts so much emphasis on the </v>

1307
01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.293
<v Speaker 4>afterworld on heaven that it forgot </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely about life now and here and </v>

1308
01:11:15.631 --> 01:11:16.464
<v Speaker 4>because of that needed to be destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 4>because life here is sufficiently rife </v>

1309
01:11:20.461 --> 01:11:21.294
<v Speaker 4>with suffering.</v>

1310
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:25.100
<v Speaker 4>So it needs to be addressed and people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1311
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.943
<v Speaker 4>it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's incorrect to inform people that </v>

1312
01:11:28.381 --> 01:11:32.520
<v Speaker 4>they should wait for some hereafter and </v>
<v Speaker 4>justify their suffering in that manner,</v>

1313
01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:36.990
<v Speaker 4>and so he would say in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 4>even the idea of compassion,</v>

1314
01:11:36.991 --> 01:11:37.824
<v Speaker 4>which is central to Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is also one of the reasons why </v>

1315
01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:42.690
<v Speaker 4>Christianity collapsed under its own </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight,</v>

1316
01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:46.650
<v Speaker 4>the untenable realty of one </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation of the world upon which a</v>

1317
01:11:46.651 --> 01:11:48.900
<v Speaker 4>tremendous amount of energy has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>lavished,</v>

1318
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:53.700
<v Speaker 4>awakens the suspicion that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretations of the world or false.</v>

1319
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:55.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what you might say,</v>

1320
01:11:55.741 --> 01:11:56.574
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what if you don't believe in </v>

1321
01:11:57.511 --> 01:11:58.344
<v Speaker 4>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1322
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:02.430
<v Speaker 4>I would take a neuro psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>approach to that.</v>

1323
01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:05.250
<v Speaker 4>Most of the positive emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>positive emotions,</v>

1324
01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:06.084
<v Speaker 4>dopaminergic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a consequence of the manifestation </v>

1325
01:12:08.461 --> 01:12:11.370
<v Speaker 4>of the exploratory system that has its </v>
<v Speaker 4>roots in the Hypothalamus,</v>

1326
01:12:11.371 --> 01:12:12.204
<v Speaker 4>a very ancient part of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same part of the brain that </v>

1327
01:12:14.281 --> 01:12:17.760
<v Speaker 4>cocaine and heroin and all the drugs </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people like to abuse,</v>

1328
01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.270
<v Speaker 4>the drugs that are exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the drugs that are calming.</v>

1329
01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.673
<v Speaker 4>It activates that system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the system that's activated when </v>

1330
01:12:24.781 --> 01:12:27.900
<v Speaker 4>something exciting happens to you or </v>
<v Speaker 4>when something novel happens to you,</v>

1331
01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:29.003
<v Speaker 4>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the system that's activated when </v>

1332
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:36.060
<v Speaker 4>you're pursuing a goal and you see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're moving towards the goal,</v>

1333
01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.000
<v Speaker 4>so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No goal,</v>

1334
01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:42.420
<v Speaker 4>no positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we say,</v>

1335
01:12:42.421 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have nothing to believe in,</v>

1336
01:12:43.981 --> 01:12:44.814
<v Speaker 4>if you have no value structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>laugh because value structure says this </v>

1337
01:12:47.461 --> 01:12:50.280
<v Speaker 4>is better than this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No value structure,</v>

1338
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:54.390
<v Speaker 4>no positive emotion while on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's the problem with that?</v>

1339
01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:57.420
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to get rid of your positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion.</v>

1340
01:12:57.450 --> 01:13:00.330
<v Speaker 4>That's not a problem because it's rather</v>
<v Speaker 4>fragile and tenuous.</v>

1341
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:02.250
<v Speaker 4>Try getting rid of your negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion.</v>

1342
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.070
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is not going to happen.</v>

1343
01:13:05.071 --> 01:13:08.010
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is that if your value </v>
<v Speaker 4>system collapses,</v>

1344
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:12.510
<v Speaker 4>then all you're left with is negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion and that is not a good thing.</v>

1345
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.981
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so neat.</v>

1346
01:13:12.981 --> 01:13:13.621
<v Speaker 4>You would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1347
01:13:13.621 --> 01:13:14.454
<v Speaker 4>why do people flee into the arms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarians from the specter of </v>

1348
01:13:17.551 --> 01:13:20.850
<v Speaker 4>nihilism?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because totalitarian certainty,</v>

1349
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:21.743
<v Speaker 4>even though it involves slavery and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice of the of reason and </v>

1350
01:13:24.451 --> 01:13:25.284
<v Speaker 4>intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarian certainty might be </v>

1351
01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:31.170
<v Speaker 4>preferable to nihilistic chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1352
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:32.970
<v Speaker 4>it's a big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1353
01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.230
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>

1354
01:13:34.231 --> 01:13:35.064
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling the story of the next 200 </v>

1355
01:13:36.091 --> 01:13:36.781
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1356
01:13:36.781 --> 01:13:37.770
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever since then,</v>

1357
01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.013
<v Speaker 4>for the entire 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we bounced between nihilism and </v>

1358
01:13:43.111 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 4>totalitarianism with deaths on both </v>
<v Speaker 4>sides,</v>

1359
01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:48.150
<v Speaker 4>constant and we're still doing exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>

1360
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.693
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky Dostoevsky was a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>influence on nature and it's very </v>

1361
01:13:54.541 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Speaker 4>interesting to read them in parallel </v>
<v Speaker 4>because nature Dostoevsky is of course a</v>

1362
01:13:58.861 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 4>dramatist and Nietzsche as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosopher,</v>

1363
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:05.250
<v Speaker 4>and it's almost as if Dostoevsky wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the drama and nature provided.</v>

1364
01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:09.210
<v Speaker 4>The philosophical commentary are very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very powerful to read together.</v>

1365
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:11.883
<v Speaker 4>This is from notes from underground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a very short book about this </v>

1366
01:14:14.531 --> 01:14:17.890
<v Speaker 4>character who was a bureaucrat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nasty sort of bureaucrat.</v>

1367
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.840
<v Speaker 4>He knows he's a nasty sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>bureaucrat.</v>

1368
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.793
<v Speaker 4>All he does is he spends his whole life </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to make life more miserable for </v>

1369
01:14:23.381 --> 01:14:27.460
<v Speaker 4>people because he's so resentful and and</v>
<v Speaker 4>crushed and weak,</v>

1370
01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:28.533
<v Speaker 4>and so he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just not did nothing but abuse is </v>

1371
01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:31.354
<v Speaker 4>bureaucratic position and used his </v>
<v Speaker 4>trivial bit of power to Lord it over </v>

1372
01:14:33.911 --> 01:14:34.744
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gets a little bit of an inheritance </v>

1373
01:14:36.011 --> 01:14:39.670
<v Speaker 4>and quits and this is his confession </v>
<v Speaker 4>notes from underground.</v>

1374
01:14:39.671 --> 01:14:40.900
<v Speaker 4>He's the underground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matt.</v>

1375
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.033
<v Speaker 4>It's brilliant book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's viciously funny and it's so </v>

1376
01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:47.590
<v Speaker 4>psychologically alive if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're interested in psychology.</v>

1377
01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:51.070
<v Speaker 4>It's a spectacular book and it's only </v>
<v Speaker 4>about 100 pages long.</v>

1378
01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.353
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's arrogant and nihilistic and </v>

1379
01:14:53.741 --> 01:14:54.574
<v Speaker 4>resentful and what he does is he tries </v>
<v Speaker 4>to justify his life to himself and does </v>

1380
01:14:58.121 --> 01:15:00.550
<v Speaker 4>a very poor job of it even though he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to be honest.</v>

1381
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:02.740
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of honesty in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At one point,</v>

1382
01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:03.574
<v Speaker 4>he meets a woman who's been forced out </v>
<v Speaker 4>onto the streets because there weren't </v>

1383
01:15:06.851 --> 01:15:09.850
<v Speaker 4>very many options for women in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Victorian period who,</v>

1384
01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:11.283
<v Speaker 4>who had fallen afoul of economic </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessity and he basically in a fit of </v>

1385
01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.413
<v Speaker 4>false messianism offers to save her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which he can't because he's completely </v>

1386
01:15:20.471 --> 01:15:22.130
<v Speaker 4>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't save himself even,</v>

1387
01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.390
<v Speaker 4>but he offers to save her and she more </v>
<v Speaker 4>or less accepts.</v>

1388
01:15:25.391 --> 01:15:29.800
<v Speaker 4>And then when she shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having sacrificed a tremendous amount to</v>

1389
01:15:29.801 --> 01:15:30.634
<v Speaker 4>do so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he basically tells her that he was </v>

1390
01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:35.190
<v Speaker 4>toying with her and joking and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1391
01:15:35.191 --> 01:15:36.024
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and makes her situation far worse than </v>

1392
01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 4>it was to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a brilliant book because you see,</v>

1393
01:15:41.981 --> 01:15:43.840
<v Speaker 4>he repents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says what he's like,</v>

1394
01:15:43.841 --> 01:15:47.050
<v Speaker 4>he's this horrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows that we can resentful.</v>

1395
01:15:47.051 --> 01:15:48.880
<v Speaker 4>And then he confesses and then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1396
01:15:48.881 --> 01:15:51.100
<v Speaker 4>now I've confessed I'm a better person.</v>

1397
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Then he tries to do something good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he hasn't changed a bloody bit,</v>

1398
01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:54.963
<v Speaker 4>not a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The confession was just to make himself </v>

1399
01:15:56.771 --> 01:15:57.604
<v Speaker 4>feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he offers to help someone and </v>

1400
01:15:59.111 --> 01:16:03.130
<v Speaker 4>pulls them right into the right under </v>
<v Speaker 4>the water where they drown.</v>

1401
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 4>It's an amazing book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is from notes from underground.</v>

1402
01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.593
<v Speaker 4>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one may say anything about the history </v>

1403
01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:10.264
<v Speaker 4>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that might enter the most </v>

1404
01:16:12.431 --> 01:16:13.264
<v Speaker 4>disordered imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing one can't say is that </v>

1405
01:16:16.181 --> 01:16:19.120
<v Speaker 4>it's rational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The very word sticks in one's throat.</v>

1406
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.133
<v Speaker 4>This is a good example of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>existential criticism of the idea of </v>

1407
01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.100
<v Speaker 4>rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky says,</v>

1408
01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:24.934
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lots of things operate according to </v>

1409
01:16:26.201 --> 01:16:27.034
<v Speaker 4>rational principles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's think about history for a </v>

1410
01:16:29.261 --> 01:16:30.094
<v Speaker 4>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially from the perspective of a </v>

1411
01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:35.080
<v Speaker 4>thinking and feeling bid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Being history is,</v>

1412
01:16:35.081 --> 01:16:36.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a slaughterhouse.</v>

1413
01:16:36.761 --> 01:16:37.594
<v Speaker 4>It's a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how would you ever consider that </v>

1414
01:16:40.811 --> 01:16:41.644
<v Speaker 4>something rational Dostoevsky's pointed </v>
<v Speaker 4>is rationality fails in its analysis of </v>

1415
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:48.310
<v Speaker 4>something as complex and terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his history,</v>

1416
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:52.600
<v Speaker 4>the only thing one can't say is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's rational.</v>

1417
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.480
<v Speaker 4>The very word sticks in one's throat in </v>
<v Speaker 4>short,</v>

1418
01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.360
<v Speaker 4>one may,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

1419
01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.680
<v Speaker 4>and indeed this is the odd thing that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>continually happening.</v>

1420
01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.890
<v Speaker 4>There are continually turning up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

1421
01:17:05.891 --> 01:17:08.980
<v Speaker 4>moral and rational persons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sages,</v>

1422
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:09.913
<v Speaker 4>lovers of humanity who make it their </v>
<v Speaker 4>object to live all their lives as </v>

1423
01:17:11.991 --> 01:17:16.670
<v Speaker 4>morally and rationally as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to be,</v>

1424
01:17:16.671 --> 01:17:17.600
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>

1425
01:17:17.601 --> 01:17:18.434
<v Speaker 4>a light to their neighbors simply in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order to show them that it is possible </v>

1426
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.200
<v Speaker 4>to live morally and rationally in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1427
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.110
<v Speaker 4>And you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all know that those very people,</v>

1428
01:17:27.111 --> 01:17:27.944
<v Speaker 4>sooner or later have been false to </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves playing some queer trick </v>

1429
01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:31.990
<v Speaker 4>often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1430
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.823
<v Speaker 4>most unseemly one net.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I asked you what can be expected of </v>

1431
01:17:37.161 --> 01:17:41.420
<v Speaker 4>man since he is a being endowed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>such strange qualities.</v>

1432
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:47.240
<v Speaker 4>This is a criticism of utopianism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what he's trying to do,</v>

1433
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:48.103
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the Utopian ideas were starting </v>

1434
01:17:49.101 --> 01:17:51.620
<v Speaker 4>to emerge in Russia at about this point </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the 18 eighties.</v>

1435
01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.880
<v Speaker 4>The idea that you could reorganize </v>
<v Speaker 4>society so that material privation would</v>

1436
01:17:55.881 --> 01:18:00.500
<v Speaker 4>disappear and that as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the paradise would be ushered in.</v>

1437
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky was no fool.</v>

1438
01:18:02.301 --> 01:18:04.910
<v Speaker 4>He knew perfectly well a that that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>never going to happen,</v>

1439
01:18:04.911 --> 01:18:09.290
<v Speaker 4>but even more importantly that if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>gave people exactly what they wanted,</v>

1440
01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:11.023
<v Speaker 4>even what they needed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason whatsoever to presume </v>

1441
01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:20.360
<v Speaker 4>that that would make them any more sane </v>
<v Speaker 4>than than they already are now.</v>

1442
01:18:20.361 --> 01:18:22.100
<v Speaker 4>And then he takes that further because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

1443
01:18:22.101 --> 01:18:22.934
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can give people cake and and </v>

1444
01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:26.253
<v Speaker 4>material goods until they're satiated </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they'll still be ungrateful and </v>

1445
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:31.250
<v Speaker 4>insane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you might think,</v>

1446
01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:32.210
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's pessimistic,</v>

1447
01:18:32.211 --> 01:18:32.961
<v Speaker 4>but then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1448
01:18:32.961 --> 01:18:33.794
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What makes you think that that insanity </v>

1449
01:18:35.571 --> 01:18:38.180
<v Speaker 4>isn't exactly what's valuable about </v>
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>

1450
01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:40.310
<v Speaker 4>What makes you think you would ever want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take that away?</v>

1451
01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:43.430
<v Speaker 4>And that's the case that he makes shower</v>
<v Speaker 4>upon him,</v>

1452
01:18:43.431 --> 01:18:44.264
<v Speaker 4>every earthly blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drowning in a sea of happiness so that </v>

1453
01:18:47.541 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 4>nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the surface,</v>

1454
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:55.100
<v Speaker 4>give them economic prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such that he should have nothing else to</v>

1455
01:18:55.101 --> 01:18:56.060
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sleep,</v>

1456
01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:00.620
<v Speaker 4>eat cakes and busy himself with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuation of his species.</v>

1457
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.760
<v Speaker 4>And even then out of sheer in gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man would play you some nasty trick.</v>

1458
01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:08.953
<v Speaker 4>He would even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Risk is cakes and we're deliberately </v>

1459
01:19:10.881 --> 01:19:11.714
<v Speaker 4>desire the most faithful rubbish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most uneconomical absurdity simply </v>

1460
01:19:15.981 --> 01:19:18.470
<v Speaker 4>to introduce into all this positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good sense,</v>

1461
01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:21.200
<v Speaker 4>his faithful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fantastic element.</v>

1462
01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.560
<v Speaker 4>It is just as fantastic dreams is </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulgar.</v>

1463
01:19:24.561 --> 01:19:25.394
<v Speaker 4>Folly that he will desire to retain </v>
<v Speaker 4>simply in order to prove to himself as </v>

1464
01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:30.014
<v Speaker 4>though that were so necessary that men </v>
<v Speaker 4>are still men and not the keys of a </v>

1465
01:19:33.951 --> 01:19:34.784
<v Speaker 4>piano,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which the laws of nature threatened to </v>

1466
01:19:36.531 --> 01:19:37.364
<v Speaker 4>control so completely that soon one will</v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to desire nothing but by the </v>

1467
01:19:41.391 --> 01:19:43.970
<v Speaker 4>calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is not all.</v>

1468
01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.900
<v Speaker 4>If even if men really were nothing but a</v>
<v Speaker 4>piano key,</v>

1469
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:51.290
<v Speaker 4>even if this was proved to him by </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural science and mathematics,</v>

1470
01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.273
<v Speaker 4>even then he would not become reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 4>but would purposely do something </v>

1471
01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:59.360
<v Speaker 4>perverse out of simply in gratitude </v>
<v Speaker 4>simply to gain his point,</v>

1472
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:01.363
<v Speaker 4>and if he does not find means he will </v>
<v Speaker 4>contrive destruction and chaos will </v>

1473
01:20:04.551 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 4>contrive suffering of all sorts just to </v>
<v Speaker 4>gain his point.</v>

1474
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:10.103
<v Speaker 2>He will launch a curse upon the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this as men is the only animal that </v>

1475
01:20:14.071 --> 01:20:15.570
<v Speaker 2>can curse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's his privilege.</v>

1476
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:18.240
<v Speaker 2>The primary distinction between him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other animals,</v>

1477
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.553
<v Speaker 2>maybe various curse alone he will attain</v>
<v Speaker 2>is object that is to convince himself </v>

1478
01:20:24.181 --> 01:20:25.014
<v Speaker 2>that he's a man and not a piano key,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you say that all of this too can </v>

1479
01:20:28.261 --> 01:20:29.094
<v Speaker 2>be calculated and tabulated chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>darkness and curses so that the mere </v>

1480
01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:36.210
<v Speaker 2>possibility of calculating it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand would stop.</v>

1481
01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:40.710
<v Speaker 2>It all and reason would reassert itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>than man would purposely go bad.</v>

1482
01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:43.170
<v Speaker 2>In order to be rid of reason and gain </v>
<v Speaker 2>his point.</v>

1483
01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:45.630
<v Speaker 2>I believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I answer for it.</v>

1484
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.153
<v Speaker 2>For the whole work of man really seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to consist in nothing but proving to </v>

1485
01:20:49.831 --> 01:20:52.350
<v Speaker 2>himself every minute that he's a man and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a piano key.</v>

1486
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.393
<v Speaker 2>It might be at the cost of his skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be by cannibalism and this </v>

1487
01:20:57.871 --> 01:20:58.704
<v Speaker 2>being so can can one help being tempted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to rejoice that it has not yet come off </v>

1488
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:03.623
<v Speaker 2>and that desire is still depends on </v>
<v Speaker 2>something we don't know are you will </v>

1489
01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:10.260
<v Speaker 2>scream at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is if you condescend to do so,</v>

1490
01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:11.213
<v Speaker 2>that no one is touching my freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all they're concerned with is that </v>

1491
01:21:13.561 --> 01:21:14.394
<v Speaker 2>my will should have of itself of its own</v>
<v Speaker 2>free will coincide with my own normal </v>

1492
01:21:18.151 --> 01:21:21.090
<v Speaker 2>interests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the laws of nature and arithmetic.</v>

1493
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Good Heavens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gentlemen,</v>

1494
01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:24.293
<v Speaker 2>what sort of free will is left when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to tabulation and arithmetic when </v>

1495
01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:30.930
<v Speaker 2>it will all be a matter of twice two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes four,</v>

1496
01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:33.300
<v Speaker 2>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two makes four without my will,</v>

1497
01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:35.580
<v Speaker 2>as if freewill meant that.</v>

1498
01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:39.973
<v Speaker 2>It's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of the most remarkable </v>

1499
01:21:42.801 --> 01:21:45.710
<v Speaker 2>criticisms of utopianism I've ever read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1500
01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:47.540
<v Speaker 2>and it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so intelligent.</v>

1501
01:21:47.541 --> 01:21:48.374
<v Speaker 2>It's like what makes you think that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had everything you asked for that </v>

1502
01:21:50.361 --> 01:21:53.230
<v Speaker 2>that would satisfy you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1503
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:56.360
<v Speaker 2>What if being dissatisfied is part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what satisfies you?</v>

1504
01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.990
<v Speaker 2>What if the fact that you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>limits and need them and that there's an</v>

1505
01:21:59.991 --> 01:22:00.824
<v Speaker 2>element of insanity in the world and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an element of insecurity and </v>

1506
01:22:03.681 --> 01:22:05.960
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if that's what you need?</v>

1507
01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:06.853
<v Speaker 2>What if it's what you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what if that's what gives your </v>

1508
01:22:08.901 --> 01:22:09.734
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning you're going to be like a lion </v>

1509
01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.193
<v Speaker 2>after it's eaten a zebra and do nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>but sleep that hardly constitutes the </v>

1510
01:22:15.321 --> 01:22:16.154
<v Speaker 2>appropriate human paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes people think that merely </v>

1511
01:22:19.011 --> 01:22:21.890
<v Speaker 2>providing economic security would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficient?</v>

1512
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Who wants that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what you.</v>

1513
01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:29.500
<v Speaker 2>It's what you offer a cow in its pen so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it remains calm and fat.</v>

1514
01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:32.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not something for human beings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's niches.</v>

1515
01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.673
<v Speaker 2>Fundamental point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he formulated that what 40 years </v>

1516
01:22:36.321 --> 01:22:37.154
<v Speaker 2>before the dam Soviet revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that sort of utopianism was put </v>

1517
01:22:40.191 --> 01:22:43.940
<v Speaker 2>into practice without absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic consequences.</v>

1518
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:45.783
<v Speaker 2>Kierkegaard,</v>

1519
01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.290
<v Speaker 2>it is now about four years ago that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got the notion</v>

1520
01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.860
<v Speaker 2>of wanting to try my luck as an author.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it quite clearly.</v>

1521
01:22:58.450 --> 01:23:00.160
<v Speaker 2>It was on a Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1522
01:23:00.161 --> 01:23:01.420
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Sunday afternoon,</v>

1523
01:23:01.421 --> 01:23:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I was seated at usual out of doors at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cafe in the Fredericksburg.</v>

1524
01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I had been a student for half a score of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1525
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:10.293
<v Speaker 2>although never lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my activity nevertheless was like a </v>

1526
01:23:13.871 --> 01:23:14.704
<v Speaker 2>glittering inactivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of occupation for which I still </v>

1527
01:23:17.441 --> 01:23:21.400
<v Speaker 2>have a great partiality and for which </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps are even have a little genius.</v>

1528
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I read much spending the remainder of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day idling and thinking</v>

1529
01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.520
<v Speaker 2>or thinking an idling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was all it came to,</v>

1530
01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.473
<v Speaker 2>so I sat there and smoke my cigar until </v>
<v Speaker 2>I lapsed into thought among other </v>

1531
01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:38.480
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember these you are going on.</v>

1532
01:23:38.481 --> 01:23:39.314
<v Speaker 2>I said to myself to become an old man </v>
<v Speaker 2>without being anything and without </v>

1533
01:23:42.711 --> 01:23:46.550
<v Speaker 2>really undertaking to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

1534
01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:49.400
<v Speaker 2>wherever you look about you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature and in life,</v>

1535
01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:51.620
<v Speaker 2>you see the celebrated names and </v>
<v Speaker 2>figures.</v>

1536
01:23:51.621 --> 01:23:52.454
<v Speaker 2>The precious had much heralded man who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are coming into prominence center much </v>

1537
01:23:55.281 --> 01:23:56.114
<v Speaker 2>talked about the many benefactors of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>age who know how to benefit mankind by </v>

1538
01:24:00.171 --> 01:24:04.040
<v Speaker 2>making life easier and easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some by railways,</v>

1539
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:07.460
<v Speaker 2>somebody omnibuses and steamboats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>others by the telegraph,</v>

1540
01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.473
<v Speaker 2>others by easily apprehended compendiums</v>
<v Speaker 2>and short recitals of everything worth </v>

1541
01:24:11.541 --> 01:24:12.374
<v Speaker 2>knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and finally the true benefactors of the </v>

1542
01:24:14.631 --> 01:24:19.100
<v Speaker 2>age you make spiritual existence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtue of thought easier and easier,</v>

1543
01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.900
<v Speaker 2>yet more and more significant.</v>

1544
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:25.610
<v Speaker 2>And what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My soliloquy boy was interrupted because</v>

1545
01:24:25.611 --> 01:24:28.910
<v Speaker 2>my cigarette was smoked out in a new one</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to be lit so I smoked again,</v>

1546
01:24:28.911 --> 01:24:31.190
<v Speaker 2>and then suddenly this thought flashed </v>
<v Speaker 2>through my mind.</v>

1547
01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.620
<v Speaker 2>You must do something about it as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>as with your limited capacities,</v>

1548
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:41.540
<v Speaker 2>it will be impossible to make anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier than it has already become.</v>

1549
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:42.583
<v Speaker 2>You must with the same humanitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm as the others undertake to </v>

1550
01:24:46.611 --> 01:24:47.444
<v Speaker 2>make something harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This notion pleased me immensely and at </v>

1551
01:24:50.991 --> 01:24:51.824
<v Speaker 2>the same time it flattered me to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I like the rest of them would be </v>

1552
01:24:54.171 --> 01:24:56.300
<v Speaker 2>loved and esteemed by the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

1553
01:24:56.570 --> 01:25:00.200
<v Speaker 2>for when all combined in every way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make everything easier,</v>

1554
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:05.830
<v Speaker 2>there remains only one possible danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely at the east becomes so great that</v>

1555
01:25:07.461 --> 01:25:08.294
<v Speaker 2>it becomes altogether too great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's only one left though it is </v>

1556
01:25:11.961 --> 01:25:12.794
<v Speaker 2>not yet a felt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Want when people will want difficulty </v>

1557
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:19.250
<v Speaker 2>out of love for mankind and how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>despair it.</v>

1558
01:25:19.251 --> 01:25:20.084
<v Speaker 2>My embarrassing situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing that I had accomplished nothing </v>

1559
01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:23.893
<v Speaker 2>and was unable to make anything easier </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it had already been made and moved </v>

1560
01:25:27.471 --> 01:25:30.320
<v Speaker 2>by a genuine interest in those who make </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything easy.</v>

1561
01:25:30.321 --> 01:25:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I conceived it as my task to create </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficulties everywhere.</v>

1562
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.823
<v Speaker 2>Kierkegaard again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a view of life which conceives </v>

1563
01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:50.010
<v Speaker 2>that where the crowd is there is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth and that in truth itself,</v>

1564
01:25:50.531 --> 01:25:52.600
<v Speaker 2>there is need of having the crowd on its</v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

1565
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:55.123
<v Speaker 2>There's another view of life which </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceives that wherever there is a </v>

1566
01:25:57.021 --> 01:25:57.854
<v Speaker 2>crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is immediately untruth so that to </v>

1567
01:26:01.041 --> 01:26:06.041
<v Speaker 2>consider for a moment the example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if every individual,</v>

1568
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:10.280
<v Speaker 2>each for himself in private were to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>in possession of the truth.</v>

1569
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Yet in the case they were all to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>together in a crowd.</v>

1570
01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:17.660
<v Speaker 2>A crowd to which any sort of decisive </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance is attributed to voting,</v>

1571
01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:18.494
<v Speaker 2>noisy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>audible crowd untruth would add once be </v>

1572
01:26:21.631 --> 01:26:26.631
<v Speaker 2>in evidence for a crowd is the untruth </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a godly sense.</v>

1573
01:26:28.191 --> 01:26:31.700
<v Speaker 2>It is true eternally Christianly as St </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul says,</v>

1574
01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:36.440
<v Speaker 2>that only one attains the goal which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not meant in a comparative sense because</v>

1575
01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:37.274
<v Speaker 2>a comparison takes others into account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that every man can be that one </v>

1576
01:26:41.031 --> 01:26:42.290
<v Speaker 2>God helping him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in,</v>

1577
01:26:42.291 --> 01:26:46.850
<v Speaker 2>but only one attains the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1578
01:26:46.851 --> 01:26:47.684
<v Speaker 2>this means that every band should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>careful about having to do with the </v>

1579
01:26:50.481 --> 01:26:51.314
<v Speaker 2>others and essentially should talk only </v>
<v Speaker 2>with God and with himself for only one </v>

1580
01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:58.100
<v Speaker 2>attains the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again this means that man or to be a</v>

1581
01:26:58.101 --> 01:26:58.934
<v Speaker 2>man is akin to daddy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a world in a worldly and temporal </v>

1582
01:27:04.681 --> 01:27:07.530
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be said by the man of bustle,</v>

1583
01:27:07.531 --> 01:27:09.360
<v Speaker 2>sociability and amicable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nis,</v>

1584
01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.313
<v Speaker 2>how unreasonable than only one attains </v>
<v Speaker 2>the goal for it is far more likely that </v>

1585
01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:14.694
<v Speaker 2>many by the strength of united effort </v>
<v Speaker 2>should attain the goal and when we are </v>

1586
01:27:17.701 --> 01:27:18.534
<v Speaker 2>many success is more certain and it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy and it is easier for each man </v>

1587
01:27:21.931 --> 01:27:26.310
<v Speaker 2>severally true enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is far more likely</v>

1588
01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:28.793
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true also with respect to all </v>

1589
01:27:29.761 --> 01:27:32.850
<v Speaker 2>earthly and material goods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it is allowed to have its way,</v>

1590
01:27:32.851 --> 01:27:33.684
<v Speaker 2>this becomes the only true point of view</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it does away with God and eternity </v>

1591
01:27:36.991 --> 01:27:38.720
<v Speaker 2>and with man's kinship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with dod.</v>

1592
01:27:39.670 --> 01:27:40.503
<v Speaker 2>It does away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transforms it into a fable and puts in </v>

1593
01:27:44.881 --> 01:27:45.714
<v Speaker 2>its place the modern or or we might </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather to say the old pagan notion that </v>

1594
01:27:49.291 --> 01:27:53.040
<v Speaker 2>to be a man is to belong to a race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>endowed with reason to belong to it as a</v>

1595
01:27:53.041 --> 01:27:58.041
<v Speaker 2>specimen so that the race or species is </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher than the individual.</v>

1596
01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:59.573
<v Speaker 2>Which is to say that there are no </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals but only specimens but </v>

1597
01:28:04.171 --> 01:28:09.171
<v Speaker 2>eternity which arches over and high </v>
<v Speaker 2>above the temporal tranquil as the story</v>

1598
01:28:09.241 --> 01:28:10.074
<v Speaker 2>vault at night and God in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who in the bliss of that sublime </v>

1599
01:28:12.781 --> 01:28:16.920
<v Speaker 2>tranquility holds in survey without the </v>
<v Speaker 2>least sense of dizziness,</v>

1600
01:28:16.921 --> 01:28:17.754
<v Speaker 2>etc. Height those countless multitudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>of men and knows each single individual </v>

1601
01:28:21.301 --> 01:28:25.560
<v Speaker 2>by name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He the great examiner says that only one</v>

1602
01:28:25.561 --> 01:28:30.561
<v Speaker 2>attains the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nisha a similar comment,</v>

1603
01:28:32.290 --> 01:28:33.123
<v Speaker 2>the traveler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a traveler who had seen many countries </v>

1604
01:28:37.161 --> 01:28:40.790
<v Speaker 2>and peoples in several continents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was asked what human traits he had found</v>

1605
01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:45.770
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and he answered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men are inclined to laziness,</v>

1606
01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:49.580
<v Speaker 2>some will feel he might've said with </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater justice.</v>

1607
01:28:49.581 --> 01:28:53.990
<v Speaker 2>They're all timid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hide behind customs and opinions</v>

1608
01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:56.973
<v Speaker 2>at bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every human being knows very well that </v>

1609
01:28:58.241 --> 01:29:00.670
<v Speaker 2>he is in this world just once as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something</v>

1610
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.203
<v Speaker 2>and that no accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however strange we'll throw together a </v>

1611
01:29:05.491 --> 01:29:09.520
<v Speaker 2>second time into a unity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a curious undiffuse,</v>

1612
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:11.750
<v Speaker 2>plurality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows that,</v>

1613
01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.080
<v Speaker 2>but he hides it like a bad conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1614
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:21.660
<v Speaker 2>From fear of his neighbor who insists on</v>
<v Speaker 2>convention and avails himself with it,</v>

1615
01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.333
<v Speaker 2>but what is it that compels the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual human being to fear his </v>

1616
01:29:25.411 --> 01:29:26.244
<v Speaker 2>neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think and act heard fashion and not </v>

1617
01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:32.760
<v Speaker 2>to be glad of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sense of shame.</v>

1618
01:29:32.761 --> 01:29:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps in a few rare cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the vast majority,</v>

1619
01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:40.560
<v Speaker 2>it is the desire for comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inertia in short,</v>

1620
01:29:40.561 --> 01:29:43.260
<v Speaker 2>that inclination to laziness of which </v>
<v Speaker 2>the traveler spoke.</v>

1621
01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.770
<v Speaker 2>He is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men are even lazier than they are timid,</v>

1622
01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:52.140
<v Speaker 2>and what they fear most is the troubles </v>
<v Speaker 2>with which any unconditional honesty and</v>

1623
01:29:52.141 --> 01:29:53.790
<v Speaker 2>nudity with burden them.</v>

1624
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:58.383
<v Speaker 2>Only artists hate this slovenly life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>borrowed manners and loosely fitting or </v>

1625
01:30:01.531 --> 01:30:05.350
<v Speaker 2>opinions and unveil the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's bad conscience.</v>

1626
01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.500
<v Speaker 2>The principle that every human being is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a unique wonder.</v>

1627
01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:10.963
<v Speaker 2>They dare to show us the human being as </v>
<v Speaker 2>he is down to the last muscle himself </v>

1628
01:30:15.191 --> 01:30:17.440
<v Speaker 2>and himself alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even more.</v>

1629
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:20.530
<v Speaker 2>That in this rigorous consistency of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>uniqueness,</v>

1630
01:30:20.531 --> 01:30:25.531
<v Speaker 2>he is beautiful and worth contemplating </v>
<v Speaker 2>as novel and incredible as every work of</v>

1631
01:30:25.571 --> 01:30:30.571
<v Speaker 2>nature and by no means dull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When a great thinker despises men,</v>

1632
01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:36.430
<v Speaker 2>it's their laziness that he despises for</v>
<v Speaker 2>days on account of this,</v>

1633
01:30:36.850 --> 01:30:37.683
<v Speaker 2>that they have the appearance of factory</v>
<v Speaker 2>products and seem indifferent and </v>

1634
01:30:40.751 --> 01:30:43.000
<v Speaker 2>unworthy of companionship or </v>
<v Speaker 2>instruction.</v>

1635
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:44.583
<v Speaker 2>The human being who does not wish to </v>
<v Speaker 2>belong to the mass must merely cease </v>

1636
01:30:47.831 --> 01:30:48.664
<v Speaker 2>being comfortable with himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let Him follow his conscience which </v>

1637
01:30:52.481 --> 01:30:55.000
<v Speaker 2>shouts at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be yourself,</v>

1638
01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.480
<v Speaker 2>what you are at present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

1639
01:30:59.570 --> 01:31:02.030
<v Speaker 2>opining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and desiring.</v>

1640
01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.273
<v Speaker 2>That's not really you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you so firmly and triumphantly </v>

1641
01:31:10.111 --> 01:31:12.870
<v Speaker 2>convinced that only the normal and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive?</v>

1642
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:17.100
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only what is conducive to welfare is for</v>

1643
01:31:17.101 --> 01:31:22.020
<v Speaker 2>the advantage of man is not reasoning in</v>
<v Speaker 2>error as regards in vantage does not man</v>

1644
01:31:22.021 --> 01:31:25.350
<v Speaker 2>perhaps loves something besides </v>
<v Speaker 2>wellbeing.</v>

1645
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.943
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps suffering is just as great a </v>

1646
01:31:31.911 --> 01:31:32.744
<v Speaker 2>benefit to him as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being man is sometimes extraordinarily </v>

1647
01:31:36.051 --> 01:31:39.500
<v Speaker 2>passionately in love with suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a fact.</v>

1648
01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:42.680
<v Speaker 2>There is no need to appeal to universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>history to prove that.</v>

1649
01:31:42.681 --> 01:31:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Ask yourself if you're a man and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived at all.</v>

1650
01:31:45.710 --> 01:31:49.970
<v Speaker 2>As far as my personal opinion is </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned to care only for wellbeing.</v>

1651
01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:55.120
<v Speaker 2>seems to me how positively ill bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's good or bad,</v>

1652
01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.120
<v Speaker 2>it's sometimes very pleasant to to smash</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1653
01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I hold no brooke brief for suffering nor</v>
<v Speaker 2>for wellbeing.</v>

1654
01:32:03.161 --> 01:32:03.994
<v Speaker 2>Either I'm standing for my caprice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>for its being guaranteed to me when </v>

1655
01:32:07.951 --> 01:32:10.390
<v Speaker 2>necessary suffering would be out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1656
01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:12.760
<v Speaker 2>At amusement parks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1657
01:32:12.761 --> 01:32:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I know that</v>

1658
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:17.423
<v Speaker 2>in the palace of crystal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is unthinkable now in the late 18 </v>

1659
01:32:21.571 --> 01:32:22.404
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a world exhibition in london </v>

1660
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.823
<v Speaker 2>and they've corrected a palace of </v>
<v Speaker 2>crystal at the world exhibition and it </v>

1661
01:32:28.471 --> 01:32:30.870
<v Speaker 2>was the first building made out of glass</v>
<v Speaker 2>and steel,</v>

1662
01:32:31.290 --> 01:32:35.040
<v Speaker 2>and so it was a representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dawning materialist utopia,</v>

1663
01:32:35.190 --> 01:32:38.940
<v Speaker 2>and that's the palace of crystal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dostoevsky is referring to in the palace</v>

1664
01:32:38.941 --> 01:32:41.610
<v Speaker 2>of crystal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crystal sufferiNg is unthinkable.</v>

1665
01:32:41.611 --> 01:32:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Suffering means doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negation,</v>

1666
01:32:44.010 --> 01:32:44.843
<v Speaker 2>and what would be the good of a palace </v>
<v Speaker 2>of crystal if there could be any doubt </v>

1667
01:32:47.431 --> 01:32:50.240
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet I think man will never renounced</v>

1668
01:32:50.241 --> 01:32:53.190
<v Speaker 2>real suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is destruction and chaos.</v>

1669
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:55.103
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suffering is the sole origin of </v>

1670
01:32:57.511 --> 01:32:58.344
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Though I did lay it down at the </v>

1671
01:33:01.901 --> 01:33:02.734
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that consciousness is the greatest </v>

1672
01:33:03.791 --> 01:33:04.624
<v Speaker 2>misfortune for man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet I know man prizes it and would not </v>

1673
01:33:07.781 --> 01:33:10.090
<v Speaker 2>give it up for any satisfaction.</v>

1674
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.073
<v Speaker 2>We're now in a position to see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crucial significance of the existential </v>

1675
01:33:16.421 --> 01:33:17.254
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is precisely the movement that </v>

1676
01:33:19.481 --> 01:33:20.314
<v Speaker 2>protests against the tendency to </v>
<v Speaker 2>identify psychotherapy with technical </v>

1677
01:33:23.741 --> 01:33:24.574
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have seen that character garden </v>

1678
01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:26.753
<v Speaker 2>nature as well as the representatives of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the existential cultural movement </v>

1679
01:33:29.711 --> 01:33:32.080
<v Speaker 2>following them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have seen that yes,</v>

1680
01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:36.550
<v Speaker 2>not only contributed far reaching and </v>
<v Speaker 2>penetrating psychological insights which</v>

1681
01:33:36.551 --> 01:33:37.384
<v Speaker 2>in themselves form a significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>contribution to anyone seeking </v>

1682
01:33:40.121 --> 01:33:43.180
<v Speaker 2>scientifically to understand modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological problems,</v>

1683
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.433
<v Speaker 2>but also did something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They placed these insights on an </v>

1684
01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:47.854
<v Speaker 2>ontological basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely the study of the individual as </v>

1685
01:33:52.331 --> 01:33:55.540
<v Speaker 2>the being who has these particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1686
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:57.303
<v Speaker 2>They believed that it was absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary that this be done and that </v>

1687
01:34:00.251 --> 01:34:01.084
<v Speaker 2>they feared that the subordination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason to technical problems would all </v>

1688
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:08.380
<v Speaker 2>to bluntly mean the making of man over </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the image of the machine.</v>

1689
01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:11.653
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1690
01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:14.580
<v Speaker 2>We'll see you on thursday.</v>

1691
01:34:17.410 --> 01:34:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1692
01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:24.800
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone accused me of youtube on youtube</v>

1693
01:34:24.801 --> 01:34:29.120
<v Speaker 2>of of a dubbing in applause at the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my lecturers.</v>
