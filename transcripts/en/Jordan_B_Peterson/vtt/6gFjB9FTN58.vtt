1
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked today and these lectures have </v>

3
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>now been watched by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been viewed a million times,</v>

4
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.500
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty amazing.</v>

5
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

6
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Or they've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been glanced at a million times </v>

7
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>that might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also possible.</v>

8
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

9
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>well let's get right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So last week,</v>

10
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think was mostly remarkable for the </v>

11
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>absolute dearth of content that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually biblically related.</v>

12
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just recap what I laid out so that </v>

14
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>it sets the frame properly for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss tonight.</v>

15
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:12.511
<v Speaker 1>And I presented you with an elaborated </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of,</v>

16
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>of this diagram essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I spent quite a lot of time </v>

17
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.190
<v Speaker 1>formulating for probably about 25 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

18
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:29.191
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kind of accounts for its graphic </v>

19
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:29.191
<v Speaker 1>primitiveness I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I was really pushing the limits of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>four 86 computer to produce that I can </v>

21
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

22
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

23
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a description representation of the</v>

24
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:45.541
<v Speaker 1>archetypical circumstances of life and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the archetypical circumstances are </v>

25
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:51.361
<v Speaker 1>the circumstances that are true under </v>
<v Speaker 1>all conditions for all time.</v>

26
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think about them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptively characteristic of the </v>

27
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.441
<v Speaker 1>nature of human experience that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same as the nature of </v>

28
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:05.140
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because you can,</v>

29
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>you can divide reality into it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective and objective elements and </v>

30
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.290
<v Speaker 1>there's utility in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these sorts of representations don't</v>

31
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:19.291
<v Speaker 1>play that game that they consider human </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience as constant constituted </v>

32
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 1>constitutive of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how we experienced it.</v>

33
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:30.931
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll just go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea basically is that we always </v>

34
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:35.311
<v Speaker 1>exist inside a damaged structure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that structure is partly biological and </v>

35
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly socio-cultural.</v>

36
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 1>It's partly what's been handed to us by </v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

37
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>by our ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both practically in terms of </v>

38
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also psychologically in terms of the</v>

39
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 1>active learning content of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our psyches,</v>

40
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.060
<v Speaker 1>and so that would include,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

41
00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:03.061
<v Speaker 1>our ability to do utilize language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the words that we use and the phrases </v>

42
00:03:03.061 --> 00:03:08.011
<v Speaker 1>that we use and the mutual understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we developed as a consequence of </v>

43
00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:08.011
<v Speaker 1>interacting with each other.</v>

44
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Architecturally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that structure is always.</v>

45
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.840
<v Speaker 1>It's always dad didn't corrupt and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason it's dead is because it was made </v>

46
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:23.851
<v Speaker 1>by people who are dead and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's corrupt is because things fall </v>

47
00:03:23.851 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>apart of their own accord and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people don't aim properly,</v>

48
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>let's say speeds along that process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>degeneration.</v>

49
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is something worth </v>

50
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.351
<v Speaker 1>knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll try standing back here and </v>

51
00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:42.000
<v Speaker 1>see if that problem goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.940
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>always have a reason to be upset and </v>

53
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:53.310
<v Speaker 1>cynical about the current state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>affairs and,</v>

54
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.670
<v Speaker 1>and it's that way forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

55
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>and so it's useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

56
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>to consider such consideration search </v>
<v Speaker 1>such conceptualizations as the,</v>

57
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.990
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the patriarchy in that light because </v>

58
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.460
<v Speaker 1>it's an archetypal truth that the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure is corrupt and incomplete.</v>

59
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that it's </v>

60
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>something that you have to contend with </v>
<v Speaker 1>every moment.</v>

61
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 1>It's some sense of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

62
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a permanent fact of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to be upset that</v>

63
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.280
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

64
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 1>structure is social structures or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biological structures within which </v>

65
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.121
<v Speaker 1>we live are incomplete and imperfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to not take that personally,</v>

66
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:40.121
<v Speaker 1>that that's the worst part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take that personnel personally is a </v>

67
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:43.751
<v Speaker 1>misreading of the existential condition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of humankind because it's always the </v>

68
00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:48.851
<v Speaker 1>case that what you have been given and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you live in is degenerate and </v>

69
00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:51.050
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and in need of repair.</v>

70
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's easier just to accept that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's also a positive element </v>

71
00:04:58.201 --> 00:05:03.201
<v Speaker 1>and the pause development as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been granted something rather </v>

72
00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:08.481
<v Speaker 1>than nothing and maybe you haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 1>granted pure hell because especially in </v>

73
00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>a culture like ours where many things </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually functioned quite well.</v>

74
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.630
<v Speaker 1>So there's room for gratitude there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's a broken machine,</v>

75
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:20.631
<v Speaker 1>it's not one that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastated and it's not absolutely hell </v>

76
00:05:20.631 --> 00:05:22.260
<v Speaker 1>bent on at every second on your misery </v>
<v Speaker 1>and destruction.</v>

77
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.680
<v Speaker 1>And it easily could be because many </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies are like that.</v>

78
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.040
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that we happen to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one that isn't corrupt beyond </v>

79
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 1>imagining is something to be eternally </v>
<v Speaker 1>grateful for.</v>

80
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.720
<v Speaker 1>While.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we live inside a damage structure and</v>

81
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.780
<v Speaker 1>we also bear responsibility for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage because we don't do everything we</v>

82
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:49.620
<v Speaker 1>can to constantly repair it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

83
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:51.420
<v Speaker 1>well that's actually one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental,</v>

84
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

85
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:53.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the meaning of life?</v>

86
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 1>What they really mean is what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive meeting of light?</v>

87
00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Because as we've already discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative</v>

88
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 4>meanings of life or more or less self </v>
<v Speaker 4>evident,</v>

89
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.440
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the positive meaning of life is to be </v>

90
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 4>found in noting the state of lack of </v>
<v Speaker 4>repair,</v>

91
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the walled city that you inhabit,</v>

92
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 4>and then sally being forced to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something about that,</v>

93
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:17.981
<v Speaker 4>to repair the breaches and to fix up the</v>
<v Speaker 4>walls and to make the structure that you</v>

94
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:23.291
<v Speaker 4>inhabit as secure and as productive as </v>
<v Speaker 4>it possibly can be.</v>

95
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

96
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.060
<v Speaker 4>there's no shortage of opportunities to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>

97
00:06:30.061 --> 00:06:34.620
<v Speaker 4>You can do that in your own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that in your own room.</v>

98
00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 4>You can do that in your own household,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your local community,</v>

99
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:41.160
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe if you get good at doing it at</v>

100
00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:43.680
<v Speaker 4>all those levels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can start to look beyond that.</v>

101
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 4>And so there's challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that's kind of </v>

102
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.651
<v Speaker 4>interesting about this insufficient </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure is that it has a set of </v>

103
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:54.921
<v Speaker 4>challenges built into it because of its </v>
<v Speaker 4>insufficiency and perhaps even because </v>

104
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:59.091
<v Speaker 4>of its corrupt nature that calls forth </v>
<v Speaker 4>the potential response from you of </v>

105
00:07:00.571 --> 00:07:05.571
<v Speaker 4>heroic adventure and the heroic </v>
<v Speaker 4>adventure is to man the barricades and </v>

106
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:09.930
<v Speaker 4>repair the city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can always do that.</v>

107
00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:13.050
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what what your </v>
<v Speaker 4>personal circumstances are.</v>

108
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.590
<v Speaker 4>There's always something that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>right near you,</v>

109
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.810
<v Speaker 4>isn't correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't laid out properly,</v>

110
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.030
<v Speaker 4>that you could just fix if you want it </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

111
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.160
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk about tonight is the idea that</v>

112
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.860
<v Speaker 4>if you adopt the attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an attitude that's like that,</v>

113
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 4>that the rule that you should play is to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make things better wherever you are.</v>

114
00:07:36.901 --> 00:07:40.500
<v Speaker 4>However you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That what would actually happen would be</v>

115
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:44.160
<v Speaker 4>that things would get better wherever </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are in all sorts of ways.</v>

116
00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:47.490
<v Speaker 4>And that we've really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a species you might say,</v>

117
00:07:47.491 --> 00:07:50.700
<v Speaker 4>or maybe even as singular individuals </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>

118
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.140
<v Speaker 4>we've explored that rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't something that's put forth as a</v>

119
00:07:55.141 --> 00:08:00.141
<v Speaker 4>proposition that often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's quite surprising to me and you </v>

120
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:03.761
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had an interesting experience the </v>

121
00:08:03.761 --> 00:08:05.070
<v Speaker 4>other day I went to the Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go there because I have food allergies</v>

122
00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:07.530
<v Speaker 4>and they're very careful with people who</v>
<v Speaker 4>have food allergies.</v>

123
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.860
<v Speaker 4>And the waiter took me to the table and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he said that he had been watching my </v>

124
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.151
<v Speaker 4>lectures and that's a very common </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and he was happy about that </v>

125
00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:23.181
<v Speaker 4>and he said that he'd had two promotions</v>
<v Speaker 4>out the keg in the last four months </v>

126
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:26.511
<v Speaker 4>because he'd been watching my lectures </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like I really found that in </v>

127
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:28.200
<v Speaker 4>affecting experience because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

128
00:08:28.201 --> 00:08:29.160
<v Speaker 4>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

129
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 4>he's working as a waiter at the keg and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing particularly heroic </v>

130
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>

131
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.820
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I disagree with that actually </v>

132
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.040
<v Speaker 4>because I don't care where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>located,</v>

133
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 4>you can do a hell of a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean that literally at whatever </v>

134
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 4>job you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

135
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.440
<v Speaker 4>you can take whatever job you have and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can make it a real nice little piece</v>

136
00:08:46.441 --> 00:08:49.740
<v Speaker 4>of absolute misery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you can do.</v>

137
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.840
<v Speaker 4>You can act like a civilized human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

138
00:08:51.841 --> 00:08:54.900
<v Speaker 4>And notice that no matter where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

139
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 4>there's a richness and a complexity </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's completely inexhaustible,</v>

140
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 4>right at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you can take that seriously and</v>

141
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 4>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

142
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 4>I happened to be a waiter at the keg and</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps that's not what I expected.</v>

143
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:13.581
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's a young guy and perhaps that </v>

144
00:09:13.581 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 4>isn't where I want to end up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not nothing,</v>

145
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 4>it's a rich environment and I can make </v>
<v Speaker 4>it a lot better if I want to.</v>

146
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.280
<v Speaker 4>I can get along properly with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>coworkers and not gossip behind their </v>

147
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.431
<v Speaker 4>back and I can treat my customers </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly and if an opportunity comes my </v>

148
00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 4>way I can take it and I can see what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

149
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.100
<v Speaker 4>And so he said that's what he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>started doing and that things were </v>

150
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.951
<v Speaker 4>working out much better for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was in a much better job than he was </v>

151
00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 4>three months ago in three months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nothing,</v>

152
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:40.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a nice trajectory.</v>

153
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:45.051
<v Speaker 4>It's an uphill trajectory and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you want really an uphill </v>

154
00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:48.940
<v Speaker 4>trajectory is actually even better than </v>
<v Speaker 4>being somewhere good as far as I'm </v>

155
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 4>concerned because one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>really makes your life meaningful is the</v>

156
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 4>clear realization that you're headed </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere better than you are now.</v>

157
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.750
<v Speaker 4>And then it's even better if you also </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that there's a direct causal </v>

158
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.261
<v Speaker 4>relationship between the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing and the steepness of that </v>

159
00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:03.261
<v Speaker 4>inclined.</v>

160
00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:05.970
<v Speaker 4>And so I get a lot of letters from </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like that and they're more,</v>

161
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 4>most frequently young men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although not always.</v>

162
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 4>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

163
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:14.841
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been listening to these lectures </v>

164
00:10:14.841 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 4>and I decided that I'm going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take responsibility for my life.</v>

165
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:20.331
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've started to stop doing all the </v>

166
00:10:20.331 --> 00:10:20.660
<v Speaker 4>stupid things that I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

167
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 4>that are stupid that I know I shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>be doing.</v>

168
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.280
<v Speaker 4>And I've started doing some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that aren't stupid that I know I </v>

169
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Speaker 4>should be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which seems pretty obvious really if you</v>

170
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:33.531
<v Speaker 4>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it obvious though it may be that </v>

171
00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:34.290
<v Speaker 4>isn't necessarily what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they write and say,</v>

172
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.930
<v Speaker 4>you can't believe what difference that </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes.</v>

173
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.050
<v Speaker 4>And they're thrilled about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm thrilled about it when I get </v>

174
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.811
<v Speaker 4>letters like that because I really don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience anything as better than a </v>

175
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:50.391
<v Speaker 4>letter like that or a message like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's so good to see things that </v>

176
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 4>aren't so good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>replaced by something better.</v>

177
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 4>And I really do think it's an open </v>
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>

178
00:10:55.861 --> 00:11:00.861
<v Speaker 4>I truly believe it's an open question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To what degree we could make things </v>

179
00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 4>better if that's what we actually aimed </v>
<v Speaker 4>at doing.</v>

180
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some of the stories that we've,</v>

181
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.950
<v Speaker 4>we've covered already that story of Cain</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Abel in particular is really an </v>

182
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 4>analysis of that problem which is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>remarkable that it occurs so,</v>

183
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.730
<v Speaker 4>so early in this document.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a,</v>

184
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:19.230
<v Speaker 4>such a foundational story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it basically says,</v>

185
00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two modes of being in the world,</v>

186
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:26.031
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one where you adopt the </v>

187
00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:29.151
<v Speaker 4>responsibility for living properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for being properly and you make the </v>

188
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:35.211
<v Speaker 4>sacrifices necessary for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then everything will flourish </v>

189
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:39.081
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other one is a pathway of </v>

190
00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 4>resentment and bitterness and rejection </v>
<v Speaker 4>and murder.</v>

191
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:43.920
<v Speaker 4>And genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that just seems exactly right to me.</v>

192
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.370
<v Speaker 4>And so if the positive path beckons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can actually see what it is,</v>

193
00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:54.531
<v Speaker 4>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can lower yourself enough to see </v>

194
00:11:54.531 --> 00:11:54.531
<v Speaker 4>what it is.</v>

195
00:11:54.531 --> 00:11:58.530
<v Speaker 4>Young Carl young set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once that modern people didn't see God </v>

196
00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.320
<v Speaker 4>because they didn't look low enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So phrase I really,</v>

197
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 4>really like because people denigrate the</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities that are right in front of</v>

198
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:08.371
<v Speaker 4>them and there's no reason to do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what's right in front of you is </v>

199
00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 4>the majesty of being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's right in front of you.</v>

200
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 4>It's inexhaustibly complex and full of </v>
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>

201
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:18.751
<v Speaker 4>And there's no reason to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever you happen to be isn't as good </v>

202
00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 4>as starting place as anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

203
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know some people have terrible,</v>

204
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:27.691
<v Speaker 4>terrible lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're in situations that are </v>

205
00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:29.521
<v Speaker 4>absolutely unbearable and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also do know that even situations </v>

206
00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Speaker 4>like that can be made a hell of a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>worse by the bat,</v>

207
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.570
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

208
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 4>by the worst kind of attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's for sure.</v>

209
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so anyways,</v>

210
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:38.440
<v Speaker 4>so that's where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in a damaged structure,</v>

211
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 4>you're a damaged structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in a damaged structure,</v>

212
00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 4>but you know at least it's got some </v>
<v Speaker 4>walls,</v>

213
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:47.680
<v Speaker 4>you know you're not being fed to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lions on a regular basis.</v>

214
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.040
<v Speaker 4>So that's a good thing and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can emerge forward,</v>

215
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>heroically,</v>

216
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.380
<v Speaker 4>magically to confront the chaos that </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly threatens the structure </v>

217
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 4>within which you live and you can free </v>
<v Speaker 4>something as a consequence of that.</v>

218
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 4>You can learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can strengthen yourself.</v>

219
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:09.151
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the way what you're actually </v>

220
00:13:09.151 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 4>made of in many ways that what informs </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

221
00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 4>what you're made of is what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounter when you voluntarily encounter</v>

222
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:19.261
<v Speaker 4>the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the more you voluntarily </v>

223
00:13:19.261 --> 00:13:21.571
<v Speaker 4>encountered the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you get made of and the more </v>

224
00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:24.481
<v Speaker 4>you get made of the more there is to you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the more you're good at </v>

225
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:28.040
<v Speaker 4>encountering the unknown and </v>
<v Speaker 4>restructuring order and calling forth </v>

226
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 4>proper order out of the potential of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being and God,</v>

227
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 4>you got to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't you do that?</v>

228
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 4>Since you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's an endless mystery.</v>

229
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think part of it is that people,</v>

230
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.070
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also encapsulated to some degree in</v>

231
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:47.071
<v Speaker 4>the story of Adam and Eve because what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens to Adam is when you become self </v>

232
00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:47.071
<v Speaker 4>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

233
00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:51.490
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he becomes ashamed of his self in </v>

234
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Speaker 4>regards himself as a lowly sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>creature and there's endless reasons why</v>

235
00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:57.721
<v Speaker 4>people would do that because of course </v>
<v Speaker 4>were rife with imperfection and so he </v>

236
00:13:57.721 --> 00:14:01.621
<v Speaker 4>hides from God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's actually the answer </v>

237
00:14:01.621 --> 00:14:03.640
<v Speaker 4>to the conundrum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that people don't aspire to the</v>

238
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:08.641
<v Speaker 4>highest good because they're deeply </v>
<v Speaker 4>ashamed of themselves and their </v>

239
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:12.190
<v Speaker 4>weaknesses and their insufficiencies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's,</v>

240
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.150
<v Speaker 4>it's not the only reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

241
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.280
<v Speaker 4>there's the desire to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility and there's all the </v>

242
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.951
<v Speaker 4>negative motivations as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like resentment and hatred and the </v>

243
00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:25.270
<v Speaker 4>desire to make things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>

244
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give us,</v>

245
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.170
<v Speaker 4>given us too much of a break,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

246
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:33.630
<v Speaker 4>but it's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's okay to not be in a very good </v>

247
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:39.481
<v Speaker 4>place if what you're trying to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that not very good place is make it </v>

248
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:39.481
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

249
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:42.960
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things I really have </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned as a clinical psychologist is </v>

250
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.270
<v Speaker 4>that you just cannot believe how </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful incremental progress is you.</v>

251
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 4>You can do the calculations like it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like compound interest,</v>

252
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:53.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you make your life a 10th of a </v>

253
00:14:53.581 --> 00:14:53.750
<v Speaker 4>percent better a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man in two or three years,</v>

254
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:58.751
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in such a better place than you </v>

255
00:14:58.751 --> 00:14:59.360
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it isn't even like the same domain.</v>

256
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 4>And if you keep that up for 10 years or </v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years,</v>

257
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're young and you start</v>

258
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:08.861
<v Speaker 4>early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start to straighten yourself out </v>

259
00:15:08.861 --> 00:15:08.861
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and fix the things that you can fix.</v>

260
00:15:08.861 --> 00:15:12.110
<v Speaker 4>You can transform your lives in ways </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are completely unimaginable.</v>

261
00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:17.111
<v Speaker 4>And God only knows what the upper limit </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that is in terms of human </v>

262
00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 4>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we are amazing creatures,</v>

263
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:24.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we really get our act together and </v>

264
00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:24.131
<v Speaker 4>stopped running at 10 percent of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>capacity.</v>

265
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.320
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

266
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.860
<v Speaker 4>so that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got,</v>

267
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that things aren't exactly the </v>

268
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:32.890
<v Speaker 4>way they should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least gives you something to do.</v>

269
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.340
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

270
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.080
<v Speaker 4>that's and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

271
00:15:35.081 --> 00:15:40.081
<v Speaker 4>and maybe something great to do because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no shortage of suffering and </v>

272
00:15:40.081 --> 00:15:43.211
<v Speaker 4>trouble that besets the world that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could conceivably ameliorate in some way</v>

273
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:48.851
<v Speaker 4>and the utility and meaning the utility </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that and the intrinsic meaning of </v>

274
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:54.251
<v Speaker 4>that is self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it also makes me curious about </v>

275
00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 4>nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

276
00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:59.891
<v Speaker 4>in despair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I mean I understand those </v>

277
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:01.250
<v Speaker 4>emotions and understand them deeply and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the intellectual mindset that goes along</v>

278
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 4>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they just see beside the point to me</v>

279
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:08.771
<v Speaker 4>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there are so many things that </v>

280
00:16:08.771 --> 00:16:11.321
<v Speaker 4>need doing that all you really have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do is open your eyes and look at them </v>

281
00:16:11.321 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 4>and then decide that you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to do something about them.</v>

282
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 4>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

283
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.700
<v Speaker 4>what's within my scope of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

284
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 4>of influence is so trivial that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>worth doing.</v>

285
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:23.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like it won't stay trivial for long</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do it not at all.</v>

286
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:25.670
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think it's trivial to begin </v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

287
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't believe that anything </v>

288
00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.131
<v Speaker 4>done right is trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my experience in my life has been </v>

289
00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:36.851
<v Speaker 4>that anything I actually did paid off it</v>
<v Speaker 4>did didn't pay off necessarily in the </v>

290
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 4>way that I expected it to pay off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole different story.</v>

291
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 4>But if it was genuine commitment to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

292
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:49.300
<v Speaker 4>even if it went sideways and the outcome</v>
<v Speaker 4>was really something other than what I </v>

293
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.511
<v Speaker 4>expected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the net consequence over time was </v>

294
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:55.151
<v Speaker 4>nothing but good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So every new frontier that can be </v>

295
00:16:55.151 --> 00:17:00.101
<v Speaker 4>conquered is an advance forward and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no shortage of frontier because </v>

296
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:01.130
<v Speaker 4>we're surrounded by the unknown.</v>

297
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:06.130
<v Speaker 4>We're surrounded by our own ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we can continually move into that </v>

298
00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 4>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the domain of chaos,</v>

299
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 4>or we can restructure pathological order</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

300
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 4>that's the secret to proper being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you encounter chaos.</v>

301
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:21.641
<v Speaker 4>That way you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you can regard yourself as the </v>

302
00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:21.641
<v Speaker 4>sort of entity that despite its </v>
<v Speaker 4>insufficiency,</v>

303
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.270
<v Speaker 4>has the capability to conquer chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Despite the danger of that.</v>

304
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:31.271
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the fact that you're fragile is </v>

305
00:17:31.271 --> 00:17:31.310
<v Speaker 4>actually a precondition for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>heroism.</v>

306
00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:36.311
<v Speaker 4>Because if you weren't fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there'd be nothing heroic about </v>

307
00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:36.311
<v Speaker 4>doing something difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

308
00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:40.181
<v Speaker 4>Because if you couldn't be hurt or </v>
<v Speaker 4>damaged or defeated or or end up in </v>

309
00:17:40.181 --> 00:17:41.360
<v Speaker 4>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then where's the.</v>

310
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.530
<v Speaker 4>Where's the moral courage in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>endeavor it had?</v>

311
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 4>It has to be that the fragility is built</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the courage and so it's not a.</v>

312
00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:54.381
<v Speaker 4>it's not a reason not to engage in it at</v>
<v Speaker 4>all and in fact quite the contrary and </v>

313
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

314
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.660
<v Speaker 4>well and so then you know what do you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>while you put the city back together and</v>

315
00:18:01.661 --> 00:18:06.661
<v Speaker 4>maybe the way you want it so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>functional and efficient and beautiful </v>

316
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:11.281
<v Speaker 4>and so the people can flourish there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>and and flourish in a manner that makes </v>

317
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:14.400
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes them what w?</v>

318
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 4>W,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say that makes them feel </v>

319
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.201
<v Speaker 4>that the unbearable catastrophe of being</v>
<v Speaker 4>is worth it for the experience.</v>

320
00:18:22.661 --> 00:18:26.080
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're aiming at and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not an impossibility.</v>

321
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.350
<v Speaker 4>It's not an impossibility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then not only that,</v>

322
00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:31.570
<v Speaker 4>not only do you repair the city when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>

323
00:18:31.571 --> 00:18:36.571
<v Speaker 4>but you make yourself the sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that continually repairs the city and </v>

324
00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:39.550
<v Speaker 4>that's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the end goal because it's not the</v>

325
00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.170
<v Speaker 4>repair of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the goal.</v>

326
00:18:41.171 --> 00:18:46.171
<v Speaker 4>It's the transformation of yourself into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that continually repairs the </v>

327
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:50.581
<v Speaker 4>city and so there's just no reason for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that not to happen and the more it can </v>

328
00:18:53.151 --> 00:18:53.990
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the better.</v>

329
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.540
<v Speaker 4>Well there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an under current to this story </v>

330
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.721
<v Speaker 4>and that is also the story of the flood </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the fact that you know the </v>

331
00:19:05.721 --> 00:19:10.251
<v Speaker 4>city that can become corrupt because </v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't engage in heroic endeavor </v>

332
00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 4>perhaps because they engage in precisely</v>
<v Speaker 4>the opposite of that,</v>

333
00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:16.881
<v Speaker 4>which is outright destructive behavior </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is also something that's worth </v>

334
00:19:16.881 --> 00:19:18.960
<v Speaker 4>considering too because if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

335
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.320
<v Speaker 4>if you consider your your own manner of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

336
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

337
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 4>you can say things to people like tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell the truth and be good.</v>

338
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.700
<v Speaker 4>And those are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are cliches obviously and so they </v>

339
00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:39.921
<v Speaker 4>lack power because they're cliches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can take them apart and utilize </v>

340
00:19:39.921 --> 00:19:44.901
<v Speaker 4>them in a manner that stops being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cliche and you do that by being more </v>

341
00:19:44.901 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Speaker 4>humble about them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say because maybe you can't tell</v>

342
00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:49.740
<v Speaker 4>the truth because you don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the truth is.</v>

343
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.770
<v Speaker 4>But one thing you can do is you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>start saying things that you know to be </v>

344
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.770
<v Speaker 4>untrue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you might say,</v>

345
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.550
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do I know that they're untrue?</v>

346
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.470
<v Speaker 4>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

347
00:19:58.471 --> 00:20:03.471
<v Speaker 4>you need a whole philosophy of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the elaboration of an entire philosophy </v>

348
00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 4>of truth to answer that question and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to bother answering that</v>

349
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:06.960
<v Speaker 4>question because in some sense at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>

350
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:09.000
<v Speaker 4>it's beside the point that isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>

351
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:14.210
<v Speaker 4>The issue is there are times in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life where you know that the thing that </v>

352
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.910
<v Speaker 4>you're saying is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a deception.</v>

353
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.940
<v Speaker 4>It's a lie of some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're using it to manipulate </v>

354
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.510
<v Speaker 4>yourself or another person or the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're also possessed,</v>

355
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:23.760
<v Speaker 4>fully possessed of the idea that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>get away with it.</v>

356
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.350
<v Speaker 4>And there's a satanic arrogance about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

357
00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:31.351
<v Speaker 4>If in fact that is the of arrogance </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's portrayed in the mythological </v>

358
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:35.010
<v Speaker 4>character of Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because Satan is precisely the archetype</v>

359
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.040
<v Speaker 4>of the element of the mind that believes</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it can twist and and banned the </v>

360
00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 4>structure reality without paying the </v>
<v Speaker 4>price for that.</v>

361
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.830
<v Speaker 4>And you can't imagine anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>more arrogant than not because really do</v>

362
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:52.831
<v Speaker 4>you really think that you can twist the </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of a reality and that that's </v>

363
00:20:52.831 --> 00:20:54.400
<v Speaker 4>going to work out for you without it </v>
<v Speaker 4>snapping back?</v>

364
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 4>It's so obvious that that can't work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

365
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 4>that everyone knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but anyways,</v>

366
00:20:58.661 --> 00:21:02.580
<v Speaker 4>back to the initial point is that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know by,</v>

367
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.890
<v Speaker 4>by the rules of the game that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself are playing,</v>

368
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:11.070
<v Speaker 4>that some of the Times you're violating </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rules of the game that you're </v>

369
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.800
<v Speaker 4>playing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the first issue with regards to say,</v>

370
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.870
<v Speaker 4>stating the truth or behaving in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible manner would be merely </v>

371
00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:23.770
<v Speaker 4>stopped cheating at whatever game it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you've chosen to play.</v>

372
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 4>That's a good start and that'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>straightened.</v>

373
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.830
<v Speaker 4>That'll straighten out your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll start in the street and start to </v>

374
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.471
<v Speaker 4>straighten out your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so well the flood.</v>

375
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.130
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does the flood tie into this?</v>

376
00:21:37.131 --> 00:21:38.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

377
00:21:38.001 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 4>we live in a corrupt structure were </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrupt as individuals.</v>

378
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.740
<v Speaker 4>We live in a corrupt structure and part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that corruption has just </v>

379
00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:45.740
<v Speaker 4>happenstance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the way things fall apart.</v>

380
00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.920
<v Speaker 4>But the other part of it is that not </v>
<v Speaker 4>only are we not aiming up,</v>

381
00:21:48.921 --> 00:21:53.921
<v Speaker 4>we're actually aiming down and the flood</v>
<v Speaker 4>story is a warning and it's a very clear</v>

382
00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:59.021
<v Speaker 4>warning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the warning is if you aim down </v>

383
00:21:59.021 --> 00:22:01.220
<v Speaker 4>enough and then if enough of you aimed </v>
<v Speaker 4>down at the same time,</v>

384
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.340
<v Speaker 4>everything will degenerate into </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's</v>

385
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 4>indistinguishable from the chaos from </v>
<v Speaker 4>which things emerged at the beginning of</v>

386
00:22:11.231 --> 00:22:13.150
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that because the,</v>

387
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:18.250
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cosmos that's presented in in </v>

388
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:18.700
<v Speaker 4>mythological representations is chaos </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus order.</v>

389
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:19.960
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The order is on top,</v>

390
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:24.961
<v Speaker 4>you might say in the chaos is always </v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath and the chaos can break </v>

391
00:22:24.961 --> 00:22:28.261
<v Speaker 4>through or the order can crumble and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can fall into the chaos and that chaos </v>

392
00:22:28.261 --> 00:22:28.840
<v Speaker 4>is intermingled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intermingled potential,</v>

393
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:34.080
<v Speaker 4>and the way that you destroy the order </v>
<v Speaker 4>and let the chaos rise back up,</v>

394
00:22:34.511 --> 00:22:39.511
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly how it's portrayed in </v>

395
00:22:39.511 --> 00:22:39.511
<v Speaker 4>the flood story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is by</v>

396
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by inhabiting the corpse of your father.</v>

397
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:46.861
<v Speaker 4>That's one mythological motif and </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding on the remains and with no </v>

398
00:22:46.861 --> 00:22:51.451
<v Speaker 4>gratitude and no attempt to replenish </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is that you're taking from and </v>

399
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:58.050
<v Speaker 4>the warning and the flood story is don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that for very long because things </v>

400
00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.881
<v Speaker 4>will happen that are so awful you cannot</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly imagine it and that'll happen </v>

401
00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:06.901
<v Speaker 4>to you personally and what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your family and it'll happen to your </v>

402
00:23:06.901 --> 00:23:09.331
<v Speaker 4>community and it's happened to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over throughout history and </v>

403
00:23:09.331 --> 00:23:12.440
<v Speaker 4>it's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know it's very soon after the story </v>

404
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.530
<v Speaker 4>of Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you see evil enter the world in the</v>

405
00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:18.160
<v Speaker 4>story of Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>along with self consciousness and evil,</v>

406
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 4>there is the ability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the knowledge of good and evil.</v>

407
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:24.150
<v Speaker 4>That's the ability to hurt other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>self-consciously,</v>

408
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.400
<v Speaker 4>to know what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then of course instantly cane takes </v>

409
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.791
<v Speaker 4>that to the absolute extreme and he uses</v>
<v Speaker 4>that capacity to to destroy really what </v>

410
00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:33.820
<v Speaker 4>he loves best.</v>

411
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.120
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets as close as a human being can to</v>

412
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:40.120
<v Speaker 4>destroying the divine ideal because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course his brother is able,</v>

413
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:43.090
<v Speaker 4>enabled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is favored by God and and destroys them,</v>

414
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 4>which cane tells God at the end of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>episode that his punishment is more than</v>

415
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 4>he can bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think the reason for that is where</v>

416
00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 4>are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you destroy your own ideal,</v>

417
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.330
<v Speaker 4>what's left for you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nowhere to go.</v>

418
00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.660
<v Speaker 4>There's no op and when there's no APP,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of down and you know </v>

419
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:06.140
<v Speaker 4>there's an idea that was put forth very </v>
<v Speaker 4>nicely in Milton's paradise lost when he</v>

420
00:24:06.141 --> 00:24:09.290
<v Speaker 4>was describing from a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

421
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:14.620
<v Speaker 4>Essentially what hell is hell is your </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhale to the degree that you're distant</v>

422
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:21.101
<v Speaker 4>from the good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that might be a good way of </v>

423
00:24:21.101 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you destroy your own ideal,</v>

424
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:27.130
<v Speaker 4>which you do with jealousy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentment and and the desire to pull </v>

425
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.190
<v Speaker 4>down people who you would like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

426
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.520
<v Speaker 4>then you end up in a situation that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>indistinguishable from hell and the way </v>

427
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.270
<v Speaker 4>the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biblical story unfolds as well.</v>

428
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.120
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

429
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.240
<v Speaker 4>it's Cain and then it's the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so kane adopts this mode of being </v>

430
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:45.140
<v Speaker 4>that's antithetical to being itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least a positive being itself.</v>

431
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:50.141
<v Speaker 4>He does it voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does it knowing full well what he's </v>

432
00:24:50.141 --> 00:24:53.411
<v Speaker 4>doing and the net consequence of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as it ripples through the entire </v>

433
00:24:53.411 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Speaker 4>social structure is that God stands back</v>
<v Speaker 4>and says,</v>

434
00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.420
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing has got so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing we can do is wipe it to </v>

435
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 4>the ground and that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is no joke.</v>

436
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:08.470
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly how things work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that's </v>

437
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.650
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily terrifying about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sequence of stories,</v>

438
00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:14.000
<v Speaker 4>and I believe this to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I realized this independently of</v>

439
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 4>any of the analysis that I was doing of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mythological stories because I looked at</v>

440
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:20.910
<v Speaker 4>what happened in places like the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 4>Union and miles,</v>

441
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:25.930
<v Speaker 4>China and in Nazi Germany and the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>penetrating observers of those </v>

442
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 4>societies.</v>

443
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:31.690
<v Speaker 4>The people who are most interested in </v>
<v Speaker 4>how it was that those absolute </v>

444
00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 4>catastrophes came about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All said the same thing.</v>

445
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.660
<v Speaker 4>It was rooted in the degeneration of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals who made up the society.</v>

446
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hear well,</v>

447
00:25:40.161 --> 00:25:45.161
<v Speaker 4>people will fault were following orders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like no that that explanation </v>

448
00:25:45.161 --> 00:25:46.640
<v Speaker 4>doesn't hold water or that you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 4>punished if you resisted.</v>

449
00:25:46.641 --> 00:25:49.310
<v Speaker 4>While there was some truth in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nowhere near as much as people might</v>

450
00:25:49.311 --> 00:25:54.311
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially at the beginning of the </v>

451
00:25:54.311 --> 00:25:55.931
<v Speaker 4>process more it was that people decided </v>
<v Speaker 4>each and every one of them to turn a </v>

452
00:25:55.971 --> 00:26:00.971
<v Speaker 4>blind eye to the catastrophes and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>participate in the lies and that worked </v>

453
00:26:00.971 --> 00:26:02.180
<v Speaker 4>the entire societies and they went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>

454
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:07.210
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they veered their way downward to </v>

455
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.660
<v Speaker 4>something as closely approximating hell </v>
<v Speaker 4>as you could hope to manage,</v>

456
00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:13.661
<v Speaker 4>especially in places like Nazi Germany </v>
<v Speaker 4>and well in all three of those places </v>

457
00:26:13.661 --> 00:26:15.170
<v Speaker 4>and in China and in the Soviet Union.</v>

458
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:20.170
<v Speaker 4>And so the thing that's so frightening </v>
<v Speaker 4>about one of the things that's so </v>

459
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.580
<v Speaker 4>frightening about the stories in genesis</v>
<v Speaker 4>is they say something very clear,</v>

460
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:27.581
<v Speaker 4>which is that your moral degeneration </v>
<v Speaker 4>contributes in no small way to the </v>

461
00:26:27.951 --> 00:26:31.910
<v Speaker 4>degeneration of the entire cosmos and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>

462
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:35.090
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like my life to be meaningful.</v>

463
00:26:35.091 --> 00:26:37.850
<v Speaker 4>People say that really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you really?</v>

464
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 4>You really would like your life to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful.</v>

465
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:43.100
<v Speaker 4>You think maybe people would trade a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little nihilism to not have to face that</v>

466
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 4>realization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think people do that all the time.</v>

467
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:51.050
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrible wait to to to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we are networked together in the </v>

468
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.290
<v Speaker 4>price of or let's say that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerability that's associated with our</v>

469
00:26:58.291 --> 00:27:03.291
<v Speaker 4>intense capacity to communicate and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is certainly possible that the ripples </v>

470
00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:10.221
<v Speaker 4>of our individual actions have </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences that are far beyond the </v>

471
00:27:10.221 --> 00:27:14.370
<v Speaker 4>limits of our immediate consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I also think people know that too.</v>

472
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 4>They know that in the way that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>know things when they don't want to know</v>

473
00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means they know them,</v>

474
00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:22.110
<v Speaker 4>embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can feel them,</v>

475
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 4>they can sense them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have an emotional response to them,</v>

476
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.660
<v Speaker 4>but there's no damn way they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>let them become articulate because they </v>

477
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.541
<v Speaker 4>don't want to know and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling guilty and ashamed about the </v>

478
00:27:32.541 --> 00:27:36.411
<v Speaker 4>things you've done or not done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know that can get out of hand as </v>

479
00:27:36.411 --> 00:27:39.591
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's often because there is a crooked </v>

480
00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:40.890
<v Speaker 4>little part of you that's aiming at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>worst possible outcome.</v>

481
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:46.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things you said about the </v>

482
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:46.480
<v Speaker 4>shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

483
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.131
<v Speaker 4>that young's famous idea that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a dark side and that that dark side </v>

484
00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:50.040
<v Speaker 4>needs to be incorporated and made </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious.</v>

485
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:54.660
<v Speaker 4>Young said to the shadow of the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

486
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.780
<v Speaker 4>reaches all the way to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he actually,</v>

487
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.960
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing that's so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>about interesting about reading Carl </v>

488
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.150
<v Speaker 4>young is he actually means what he says.</v>

489
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:08.100
<v Speaker 4>It's not a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the part of you that's twisted</v>

490
00:28:08.101 --> 00:28:12.540
<v Speaker 4>against being is aligned with the part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the cosmos.</v>

491
00:28:12.541 --> 00:28:17.541
<v Speaker 4>Let's say the conscious cosmos that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>aiming at making everything as terrible </v>

492
00:28:17.541 --> 00:28:21.570
<v Speaker 4>as it can possibly be and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a terrible shock to realize that.</v>

493
00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:26.571
<v Speaker 4>It's partly why people don't realize </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's something that people keep at </v>

494
00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:27.000
<v Speaker 4>an arm's length.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

495
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.260
<v Speaker 4>it's the same as recognizing yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Nazi concentration gap camp guard,</v>

496
00:28:31.261 --> 00:28:36.261
<v Speaker 4>which is a very useful exercise because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely no reason why you </v>

497
00:28:36.261 --> 00:28:39.810
<v Speaker 4>couldn't have been or still could be one</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

498
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:45.010
<v Speaker 4>And if you think otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then all the more reason for assuming </v>

499
00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:48.961
<v Speaker 4>that you would be unable to resist the </v>
<v Speaker 4>temptation if it wasn't in fact offered </v>

500
00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:53.011
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't think it's a </v>

501
00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:54.181
<v Speaker 4>temptation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the then there's so much that you </v>

502
00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:55.640
<v Speaker 4>don't know about human beings that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not even in the game.</v>

503
00:28:55.641 --> 00:29:00.641
<v Speaker 4>Because if it wasn't a temptation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then people bloody well wouldn't have </v>

504
00:29:00.641 --> 00:29:01.040
<v Speaker 4>done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And plenty of people did it.</v>

505
00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:03.290
<v Speaker 4>And it's no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

506
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.790
<v Speaker 4>So things get serious in genesis very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rapidly.</v>

507
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:16.360
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the depth of the seriousness is </v>

508
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:16.360
<v Speaker 4>ultimate archetipal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

509
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.650
<v Speaker 4>It gets as serious as it can get.</v>

510
00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:27.570
<v Speaker 4>The story of Noah and the flood opens in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fragmentary manner.</v>

511
00:29:28.361 --> 00:29:32.290
<v Speaker 4>And I believe that these passages are </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of a longer story,</v>

512
00:29:32.291 --> 00:29:37.291
<v Speaker 4>that we only have bits and pieces of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also one that's fragmented in its in</v>

513
00:29:37.481 --> 00:29:37.930
<v Speaker 4>its.</v>

514
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 4>It's parts of more than one story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it starts like this and it came to </v>

515
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:49.591
<v Speaker 4>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When men began to multiply on the face </v>

516
00:29:49.591 --> 00:29:51.481
<v Speaker 4>of the earth and daughters were born </v>
<v Speaker 4>unto them that the sons of God saw the </v>

517
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:56.551
<v Speaker 4>daughters of men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they were fair and they took them </v>

518
00:29:56.551 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 4>wives of all which they chose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's an idea there.</v>

519
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.900
<v Speaker 4>There's two ways of looking at the past </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can kind of see that in the </v>

520
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:09.810
<v Speaker 4>political landscape that we inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now on the more conservative end of the </v>

521
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.591
<v Speaker 4>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people regard the past as the land of </v>

522
00:30:13.591 --> 00:30:13.591
<v Speaker 4>giants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

523
00:30:13.591 --> 00:30:17.220
<v Speaker 4>They were the heroes of the past who </v>
<v Speaker 4>established the current conditions that </v>

524
00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:21.151
<v Speaker 4>we exist and then the people on the left</v>
<v Speaker 4>are more concerned perhaps with the,</v>

525
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.660
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a lineage of corruption that's come</v>

526
00:30:25.661 --> 00:30:29.230
<v Speaker 4>down through the centuries and both of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those perspectives are are are accurate.</v>

527
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.040
<v Speaker 4>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

528
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.220
<v Speaker 4>there were there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were the great heroes of the past </v>

529
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.971
<v Speaker 4>who established our modes of being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can think of them as competent </v>

530
00:30:38.971 --> 00:30:38.971
<v Speaker 4>beings if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>

531
00:30:38.971 --> 00:30:42.490
<v Speaker 4>That's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it and you can also think</v>

532
00:30:42.491 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 4>of the of the accumulation of corruption</v>
<v Speaker 4>and evil that's come along the centuries</v>

533
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:51.781
<v Speaker 4>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you see both of those reflected </v>

534
00:30:51.781 --> 00:30:52.210
<v Speaker 4>in these initial few lines that the sons</v>
<v Speaker 4>of gods,</v>

535
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:57.270
<v Speaker 4>so those are the heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the daughters of men that they were </v>

536
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:57.670
<v Speaker 4>fair and they took them wives of all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>which they chose.</v>

537
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.200
<v Speaker 4>Then this statement comes in as somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a non sequitur and the Lord said,</v>

538
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:10.480
<v Speaker 4>my spirit shall not always strive with </v>
<v Speaker 4>man for that he is also flesh.</v>

539
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:15.780
<v Speaker 4>Yet his days shall be 120 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I looked at a variety of </v>

540
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:20.191
<v Speaker 4>interpretations of that line because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't seem to follow so clearly from </v>

541
00:31:20.191 --> 00:31:22.300
<v Speaker 4>the previous line and exactly what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>means isn't obvious,</v>

542
00:31:22.301 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 4>but it seems to be.</v>

543
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:30.070
<v Speaker 4>The first line talks about the heroes of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the past and and this.</v>

544
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.340
<v Speaker 4>The second line says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

545
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:36.410
<v Speaker 4>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something corrupt about the </v>

546
00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.491
<v Speaker 4>human mode of being and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of that as far as God is </v>

547
00:31:38.491 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 4>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that there are conditions under which</v>

548
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 4>the divine spirit will not strive with </v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

549
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:50.910
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What that means is there are conditions </v>

550
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:53.251
<v Speaker 4>under which let's say the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's any other way of </v>

551
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:58.890
<v Speaker 4>putting it is the divine impulse towards</v>
<v Speaker 4>the good will abandon you because of </v>

552
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:03.331
<v Speaker 4>things that you've done and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>secondary consideration here is that </v>

553
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.340
<v Speaker 4>perhaps because of the disc degeneration</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people,</v>

554
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:09.100
<v Speaker 4>it's not so obvious here that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifespans are limited,</v>

555
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:10.070
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>

556
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 4>that the spirit that inhabits us will </v>
<v Speaker 4>only do so for a limited amount of time </v>

557
00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:19.600
<v Speaker 4>and that's tangled in a strange way in </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the idea of human moral culpability</v>

558
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 4>and that's posed against the notion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the giants of the past.</v>

559
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:27.160
<v Speaker 4>And then it returns to the giant idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That narrative returns to the giant idea</v>

560
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.400
<v Speaker 4>and reads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were giants in the earth in those </v>

561
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.281
<v Speaker 4>days and also after that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the sons of men came in unto the </v>

562
00:32:35.281 --> 00:32:35.410
<v Speaker 4>daughters of men and they bare children </v>
<v Speaker 4>to them.</v>

563
00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:39.470
<v Speaker 4>The same became mighty men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which were of old men of renown,</v>

564
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.430
<v Speaker 4>and that that's the end of that sequence</v>
<v Speaker 4>of fragments.</v>

565
00:32:43.431 --> 00:32:48.431
<v Speaker 4>It's very broken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can see a dual narrative </v>

566
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 4>underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

567
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.590
<v Speaker 4>and one of the narratives is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the kind of corruption despite </v>

568
00:32:56.841 --> 00:33:00.260
<v Speaker 4>the giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nature of the giants of the past.</v>

569
00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:05.261
<v Speaker 4>There's the kind of corruption lurking </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would cause God to withhold his </v>

570
00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 4>grace and allow men to deteriorate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

571
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.040
<v Speaker 4>and that sets the stage for Noah and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>flood.</v>

572
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.960
<v Speaker 4>And God saw that the wickedness of man </v>
<v Speaker 4>was great in the earth and that the,</v>

573
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:23.020
<v Speaker 4>and that every imagination of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts of his heart was only evil </v>

574
00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.540
<v Speaker 4>continually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

575
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:29.420
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I really didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>about going to church when I was a kid,</v>

576
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.390
<v Speaker 4>I went to a pretty moderate church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the United Church,</v>

577
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.340
<v Speaker 4>which has hardly even become a church </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

578
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:37.190
<v Speaker 4>It's so moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>

579
00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I didn't like was the </v>

580
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.371
<v Speaker 4>constant harping by the ministry on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sinful nature of human beings like it.</v>

581
00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.820
<v Speaker 4>It didn't speak to me properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>partly because I really didn't </v>

582
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:52.820
<v Speaker 4>understand what it meant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

583
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.140
<v Speaker 4>and partly because it seemed</v>

584
00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:00.870
<v Speaker 4>well sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say was self-flagellating</v>

585
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:05.970
<v Speaker 4>in an an attractive way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there is an attractive </v>

586
00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 4>way to be self-flagellating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was,</v>

587
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:11.880
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was something about it that </v>

588
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.030
<v Speaker 4>was also wrote and fake that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

589
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.630
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in later years I thought about that more</v>

590
00:34:16.631 --> 00:34:21.631
<v Speaker 4>and I started to understand that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was some real utility in asking people </v>

591
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
<v Speaker 4>to keep the evil that they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>clear and conscious in the forefront of </v>

592
00:34:28.781 --> 00:34:33.781
<v Speaker 4>their imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I mentioned to you guys last </v>

593
00:34:33.781 --> 00:34:36.990
<v Speaker 4>week that this little episode from what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we know of Mesopotamian culture </v>

594
00:34:37.421 --> 00:34:40.060
<v Speaker 4>surrounding the emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the New Year's festival,</v>

595
00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:44.560
<v Speaker 4>they would take the emperor outside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the walled city and strip him of his</v>

596
00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:51.050
<v Speaker 4>garb so that he was reduced to just an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ordinary man and then humiliate them </v>

597
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:56.031
<v Speaker 4>richly and then ask him how it was over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the last year that he wasn't a </v>

598
00:34:56.941 --> 00:35:01.941
<v Speaker 4>spectacular embodiment of Marduk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marduk was the Mesopotamian daddy who </v>

599
00:35:01.941 --> 00:35:06.050
<v Speaker 4>made order out of chaos essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the emperor was supposed to sit and </v>

600
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.050
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

601
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

602
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm emperor and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should be doing a good job.</v>

603
00:35:08.821 --> 00:35:13.821
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I should even be doing a great job</v>
<v Speaker 4>and probably I'm coming up short and a </v>

604
00:35:13.821 --> 00:35:17.931
<v Speaker 4>bunch of ways and that actually happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be important since I'm running the </v>

605
00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:17.940
<v Speaker 4>entire show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should be very,</v>

606
00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:22.941
<v Speaker 4>very cognizant of how I'm failing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>live up to the ideal.</v>

607
00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:27.990
<v Speaker 4>And that is what that call that constant</v>
<v Speaker 4>clarion call that's degenerated,</v>

608
00:35:27.991 --> 00:35:30.060
<v Speaker 4>I would say an institutional </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity.</v>

609
00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:32.340
<v Speaker 4>That was actually the idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

610
00:35:32.341 --> 00:35:37.341
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of ways that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>being everything you could be and it is </v>

611
00:35:37.341 --> 00:35:39.270
<v Speaker 4>not supposed to be a to try to knock you</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

612
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Although maybe it's a whip to knock down</v>
<v Speaker 4>your pride.</v>

613
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 4>The pride that stops you from being </v>
<v Speaker 4>aware of your insufficiencies.</v>

614
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 4>It's more like a call to the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

615
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.840
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should stop doing those things </v>

616
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 4>because you could be so much more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are and that would be so much better</v>

617
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:55.830
<v Speaker 4>for you and everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is just.</v>

618
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 4>It's just not good that you continue </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing these things.</v>

619
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Continue Breaking your own rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

620
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 4>because we could certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>

621
00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:09.741
<v Speaker 4>we could start this game by assuming </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you should at least play the game </v>

622
00:36:09.741 --> 00:36:12.531
<v Speaker 4>that you're playing straight and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it is the case that if you watch </v>

623
00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:16.080
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a terrifying thing to do.</v>

624
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.250
<v Speaker 4>But if you watch yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see you lie a lot.</v>

625
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 4>Like when I learned this to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in my twenties and I was.</v>

626
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:29.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm a smart person and I was very proud </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that because I was also a small </v>

627
00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:33.120
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was moved ahead one year in school and</v>

628
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.800
<v Speaker 4>I was a small person</v>

629
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:40.750
<v Speaker 4>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so as a very small person in my </v>

630
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.540
<v Speaker 4>classes and also very mouthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which might not come as much of a </v>

631
00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.470
<v Speaker 4>surprise and somewhat provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you know,</v>

632
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:47.650
<v Speaker 4>and I got pushed around a fair bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>because pete,</v>

633
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:52.690
<v Speaker 4>everybody gets pushed around and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>weapon was to be mouthy and it was a </v>

634
00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:53.300
<v Speaker 4>fairly effective weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although tended to backfire because,</v>

635
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're really effectively mouthy with</v>

636
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.460
<v Speaker 4>large,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obnoxious people,</v>

637
00:36:58.461 --> 00:37:01.910
<v Speaker 4>then they tend to respond in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relatively negative physical way.</v>

638
00:37:01.911 --> 00:37:06.440
<v Speaker 4>And so that sort of thing was happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me a fair bit and but I was quite,</v>

639
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:08.660
<v Speaker 4>I was quite proud of the fact that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

640
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:10.970
<v Speaker 4>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

641
00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I had some intellectual power</v>

642
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:14.090
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

643
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.420
<v Speaker 4>darn it was then in my twenties when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned about some of the danger of that</v>

644
00:37:20.421 --> 00:37:25.421
<v Speaker 4>because I started to read partly </v>
<v Speaker 4>Milton's paradise lost and I started to </v>

645
00:37:25.421 --> 00:37:29.591
<v Speaker 4>understand the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the danger of the intellect and the </v>

646
00:37:29.591 --> 00:37:30.890
<v Speaker 4>danger of the intellect as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell,</v>

647
00:37:30.891 --> 00:37:35.891
<v Speaker 4>is that it tends towards pride and </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrogance and it also tends to fall in </v>

648
00:37:35.891 --> 00:37:37.950
<v Speaker 4>love with its own productions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's actually Lucifer in,</v>

649
00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:38.380
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

650
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.040
<v Speaker 4>in paradise lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Lucifer.</v>

651
00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:45.041
<v Speaker 4>Lucifer is the intellect that falls in </v>
<v Speaker 4>love with its own productions and then </v>

652
00:37:45.041 --> 00:37:46.730
<v Speaker 4>assumes that there's nothing outside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it thinks.</v>

653
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.130
<v Speaker 4>That's the totalitarian mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

654
00:37:49.131 --> 00:37:54.131
<v Speaker 4>It's like we have a total system and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>know how everything works and we're </v>

655
00:37:54.131 --> 00:37:55.640
<v Speaker 4>gonna implement it and that'll bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>about heaven on earth.</v>

656
00:37:55.641 --> 00:37:57.400
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's that say that.</v>

657
00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:02.460
<v Speaker 4>That's the totalitarian mindset and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's associated with intellectual </v>

658
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.500
<v Speaker 4>arrogance and</v>

659
00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.900
<v Speaker 4>another at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another thing that was happening to me,</v>

660
00:38:08.901 --> 00:38:13.901
<v Speaker 4>so I was noticing that I started to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what that meant and I also </v>

661
00:38:13.901 --> 00:38:16.910
<v Speaker 4>started to understand that there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>more to life than the intellect,</v>

662
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:22.090
<v Speaker 4>much more because I smoked too much and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I drank too much and I weighed like 130 </v>

663
00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.690
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't in good physical shape and like</v>

664
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:28.870
<v Speaker 4>I had a lot of things to do when I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>to graduate school to put myself </v>

665
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.010
<v Speaker 4>together and at the same time I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to understand why things had gone</v>

666
00:38:31.011 --> 00:38:36.011
<v Speaker 4>so crazily wrong with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's encapsulation in the cold and what </v>

667
00:38:36.011 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 4>role I might be playing in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if any,</v>

668
00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 4>or what role any of us were playing in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

669
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:45.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the same time I was working at a </v>

670
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:50.980
<v Speaker 4>prison only a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked with this crazy psychologist.</v>

671
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

672
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.050
<v Speaker 4>he used to put jokes on is multiple </v>
<v Speaker 4>choice tests.</v>

673
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.300
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a really eccentric guy,</v>

674
00:38:58.301 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 4>but I really liked his courses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He and he,</v>

675
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:06.150
<v Speaker 4>he taught a course on creativity and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was also a prison psychologist and he </v>

676
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.111
<v Speaker 4>was an eccentric guy and he for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason liked me and maybe because I was </v>

677
00:39:10.111 --> 00:39:13.651
<v Speaker 4>eccentric to and he invited me to go out</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the Edmonton maximum security prison </v>

678
00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:14.170
<v Speaker 4>with them a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I did.</v>

679
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:19.200
<v Speaker 4>And that was a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience because I was trying to </v>

680
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.111
<v Speaker 4>figure out what role each individual's </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior bore to the pathology of the </v>

681
00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:31.681
<v Speaker 4>group with something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I went out there and I met a little </v>

682
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:36.400
<v Speaker 4>guy smaller than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a little bigger by then and he was</v>

683
00:39:36.401 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 4>a pretty innocuous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

684
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.250
<v Speaker 4>what had happened was I was out in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>gymnasium,</v>

685
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.080
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the prison,</v>

686
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:46.210
<v Speaker 4>which is really quite telling in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>estimation,</v>

687
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:51.211
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there were all these like monsters </v>

688
00:39:51.211 --> 00:39:51.211
<v Speaker 4>in their weight weightlifting and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were monsters.</v>

689
00:39:51.211 --> 00:39:56.130
<v Speaker 4>I remember one guy who was tattooed </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere and he had like a huge scar </v>

690
00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:59.101
<v Speaker 4>running down the middle of his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like someone had to hit them </v>

691
00:39:59.101 --> 00:39:59.101
<v Speaker 4>with an ax and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

692
00:39:59.101 --> 00:40:03.180
<v Speaker 4>and I was in there and I had this Weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cape that I used to wear that I bought </v>

693
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.781
<v Speaker 4>and Portugal and some boots that went </v>
<v Speaker 4>along with it and yeah,</v>

694
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 4>it was like an 1890 sherlock Holmes Cape</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was really like,</v>

695
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:15.571
<v Speaker 4>it was from the eighties and nineties </v>
<v Speaker 4>because this little village was up on a </v>

696
00:40:15.571 --> 00:40:18.601
<v Speaker 4>hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a walled city on a hill and they </v>

697
00:40:18.601 --> 00:40:19.240
<v Speaker 4>sold these things and I don't think they</v>
<v Speaker 4>changed the style since 1890.</v>

698
00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:21.700
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought they were really cool </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I was wearing that,</v>

699
00:40:21.701 --> 00:40:26.701
<v Speaker 4>which wasn't perhaps the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative garb to dawn if you're </v>

700
00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:35.011
<v Speaker 4>going to wear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to go to a maximum </v>

701
00:40:35.011 --> 00:40:35.011
<v Speaker 4>security prison.</v>

702
00:40:35.011 --> 00:40:37.590
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in the gymnasium and the </v>

703
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.470
<v Speaker 4>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychologist left and God only </v>

704
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.470
<v Speaker 4>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what he was like.</v>

705
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.900
<v Speaker 4>And all these guys came around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these guys came around me,</v>

706
00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:48.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were offering to trade their </v>

707
00:40:48.901 --> 00:40:51.300
<v Speaker 4>prison clothes for my cape and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

708
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:54.010
<v Speaker 4>I was being made an offer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't refuse,</v>

709
00:40:54.011 --> 00:40:54.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I didn't,</v>

710
00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.240
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really know what to do and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>this little guy said something like </v>

711
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.490
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychologist sent me to come and </v>

712
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:04.030
<v Speaker 4>take you away or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought,</v>

713
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:08.110
<v Speaker 4>well better this little guy then all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these monsters.</v>

714
00:41:08.111 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 4>So we went outside the gym through some </v>
<v Speaker 4>doors,</v>

715
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.420
<v Speaker 4>like school doors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had outside the gym into the exercise</v>

716
00:41:16.421 --> 00:41:21.421
<v Speaker 4>yard I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're wandering along and he was </v>

717
00:41:21.421 --> 00:41:21.421
<v Speaker 4>talking to me and he seemed like a kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of an innocuous guy.</v>

718
00:41:21.421 --> 00:41:25.000
<v Speaker 4>And then the psychologist showed up at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the door and motioned us back and so,</v>

719
00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:30.330
<v Speaker 4>which was kind of a relief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I went into his office and he </v>

720
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:30.330
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

721
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Speaker 4>that guy that you walked out in the yard</v>
<v Speaker 4>with?</v>

722
00:41:31.001 --> 00:41:31.690
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

723
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:33.130
<v Speaker 4>He said he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

724
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.860
<v Speaker 4>he took two cops one night and he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>them kneel down and while they were </v>

725
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 4>begging for their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he shot them both in the back</v>

726
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 5>they had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>

727
00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.020
<v Speaker 5>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

728
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:52.040
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that was so interesting was </v>

729
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.040
<v Speaker 4>that he was so innocuous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

730
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.960
<v Speaker 4>Because what you'd hope is that someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that would be very much unlike you,</v>

731
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:59.990
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and certainly wouldn't be like somewhat </v>

732
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.840
<v Speaker 4>innocuous that you'd met.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you'd want is that the guy would be</v>

733
00:42:00.841 --> 00:42:01.330
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

734
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.220
<v Speaker 4>half world wolf and half vampire so you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could just tell right away that he was a</v>

735
00:42:05.221 --> 00:42:06.960
<v Speaker 4>cold blooded killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

736
00:42:06.961 --> 00:42:11.961
<v Speaker 4>he was this sort of ineffectual little </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who was certainly not ineffectual if</v>

737
00:42:12.031 --> 00:42:13.890
<v Speaker 4>you gave him a revolver and the upper </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>

738
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.820
<v Speaker 4>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that made me think that made me think</v>

739
00:42:17.821 --> 00:42:22.560
<v Speaker 4>a lot about the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 4>being innocuous and being dangerous.</v>

740
00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:27.561
<v Speaker 4>And then another thing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met another guy out there and then a </v>

741
00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:31.050
<v Speaker 4>week or two later I heard that he and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend of his head held another guy down</v>

742
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:34.950
<v Speaker 4>and pulverized his left leg with a lead </v>
<v Speaker 4>pipe,</v>

743
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:35.910
<v Speaker 4>like just</v>

744
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:41.930
<v Speaker 4>pulverized it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that was that they </v>

745
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.930
<v Speaker 4>thought that he was a snitch and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was.</v>

746
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:47.120
<v Speaker 4>And that that time I did something </v>
<v Speaker 4>different instead of being shocked and </v>

747
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.360
<v Speaker 4>horrified by that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although I certainly was.</v>

748
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.690
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how in the world could you do that?</v>

749
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.400
<v Speaker 4>Because I didn't think I could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

750
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.680
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that there was a qualitative </v>

751
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.071
<v Speaker 4>distinction between me and those people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I spent about two weeks trying to</v>

752
00:43:01.921 --> 00:43:06.720
<v Speaker 4>see if I could figure out under what </v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions I could do that,</v>

753
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:11.930
<v Speaker 4>like what kind of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation I would have to undergo </v>

754
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.740
<v Speaker 4>to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that was a meditative exercise,</v>

755
00:43:13.741 --> 00:43:16.890
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it only took about 10 days for me to</v>

756
00:43:16.891 --> 00:43:21.891
<v Speaker 4>realize that not only could I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it would be a hell of a lot easier </v>

757
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:21.891
<v Speaker 4>than I thought it would be.</v>

758
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:26.990
<v Speaker 4>And that's sort of where that wall </v>
<v Speaker 4>between me and what you describe is the </v>

759
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:30.231
<v Speaker 4>shadow started to fall apart and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>also was very useful because I started </v>

760
00:43:30.631 --> 00:43:35.631
<v Speaker 4>to wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started to treat myself as somewhat </v>

761
00:43:35.631 --> 00:43:36.480
<v Speaker 4>different entity because I hadn't been </v>
<v Speaker 4>aware up to that point,</v>

762
00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:41.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I thought I was a good guy and </v>

763
00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:42.090
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason for me to think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're not a good guy unless you</v>

764
00:43:42.091 --> 00:43:43.950
<v Speaker 4>really made a bloody effort to be a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

765
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:49.010
<v Speaker 4>You're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy and so you're probably a </v>

766
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:52.580
<v Speaker 4>moderately bad guy and that's a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways from being an absolutely horrible </v>

767
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:57.351
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also a long ways from being a </v>

768
00:43:57.351 --> 00:43:59.781
<v Speaker 4>good guy and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I had a little more respect for </v>

769
00:43:59.781 --> 00:44:02.241
<v Speaker 4>myself after that because I also </v>
<v Speaker 4>understood that there was a monstrous </v>

770
00:44:02.311 --> 00:44:07.311
<v Speaker 4>element to the human psyche that re that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you needed to respect and that was part </v>

771
00:44:08.821 --> 00:44:12.270
<v Speaker 4>of you that you should regard yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sense as a loaded weapon.</v>

772
00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:17.420
<v Speaker 4>It's very useful around children to </v>
<v Speaker 4>regard yourself as a loaded weapon </v>

773
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.730
<v Speaker 4>because around children you are a loaded</v>
<v Speaker 4>weapon and the terrible experiences that</v>

774
00:44:20.731 --> 00:44:23.190
<v Speaker 4>many children have with their parents </v>
<v Speaker 4>are testament to that.</v>

775
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:26.690
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

776
00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:32.810
<v Speaker 4>about the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't exactly how these things were </v>

777
00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:36.801
<v Speaker 4>causally related.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it was because I was trying to </v>

778
00:44:36.801 --> 00:44:39.660
<v Speaker 4>figure out who I was and how that could </v>
<v Speaker 4>be fixed.</v>

779
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.840
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started to pay very careful attention </v>

780
00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:48.291
<v Speaker 4>to what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that happened </v>

781
00:44:48.291 --> 00:44:51.921
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily or involuntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I could feel a sort of split </v>

782
00:44:51.921 --> 00:44:54.831
<v Speaker 4>developing in my psyche and the split </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've actually had students tell me </v>

783
00:44:54.831 --> 00:44:58.641
<v Speaker 4>the same thing has happened to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>after they've listened to some of the </v>

784
00:44:58.641 --> 00:45:01.140
<v Speaker 4>material that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I've been describing to all of you,</v>

785
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:05.940
<v Speaker 4>but split into two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

786
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:11.780
<v Speaker 4>And one part was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say the old me that was talking a </v>

787
00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.951
<v Speaker 4>lot and that liked to argue and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>liked ideas and there was another part </v>

788
00:45:16.861 --> 00:45:21.861
<v Speaker 4>that was watching that part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just with it's eyes open and </v>

789
00:45:21.861 --> 00:45:26.480
<v Speaker 4>neutrally judging and the part that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>neutrally judging was watching the part </v>

790
00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:29.760
<v Speaker 4>that was talking and going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't your idea.</v>

791
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.530
<v Speaker 4>You don't really believe that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really know what you're talking about.</v>

792
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.440
<v Speaker 4>That isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

793
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.700
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really interesting.</v>

794
00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:43.701
<v Speaker 4>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was happening to like 95 </v>

795
00:45:43.701 --> 00:45:43.701
<v Speaker 4>percent of what I was saying and so then</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really know what to do.</v>

796
00:45:43.701 --> 00:45:44.160
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

797
00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:45.990
<v Speaker 4>this is strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so maybe I've,</v>

798
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.630
<v Speaker 4>I've fragmented and that's just not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good thing at all.</v>

799
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like it was hearing voices or </v>

800
00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:53.780
<v Speaker 4>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

801
00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:54.050
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

802
00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.700
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

803
00:45:55.710 --> 00:46:00.450
<v Speaker 4>people have multiple parts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then I had a weird conundrum.</v>

804
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:01.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

805
00:46:01.531 --> 00:46:06.531
<v Speaker 4>which of those two things are me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it the part that's listening and </v>

806
00:46:06.531 --> 00:46:06.960
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

807
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.240
<v Speaker 4>that's rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lie.</v>

808
00:46:09.241 --> 00:46:11.970
<v Speaker 4>That's you're doing that to impress </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

809
00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:13.800
<v Speaker 4>You're just trying to win the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

810
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:18.750
<v Speaker 4>was that me or was the part that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going about my normal verbal business?</v>

811
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Me and I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I decided I would go with the critic</v>

812
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:27.560
<v Speaker 4>and then what I tried to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I learned to do I think was to stop</v>

813
00:46:27.571 --> 00:46:32.571
<v Speaker 4>saying things that made me weak and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I mean I'm still trying to do that </v>

814
00:46:33.241 --> 00:46:38.241
<v Speaker 4>because I'm always feeling when I talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not the words that I'm saying</v>

815
00:46:38.761 --> 00:46:41.850
<v Speaker 4>are either making me a align or making </v>
<v Speaker 4>me come apart,</v>

816
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.710
<v Speaker 4>and I think the alignment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do think the alignment is.</v>

817
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:50.930
<v Speaker 4>I think alignment is the right way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptualizing it because I think if </v>

818
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 4>you say things that are as true as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can say them,</v>

819
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:55.290
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they come up,</v>

820
00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:01.190
<v Speaker 4>they come out of the depths inside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you because we don't know where it </v>

821
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:04.300
<v Speaker 4>thoughts come from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know how far down into your </v>

822
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:04.300
<v Speaker 4>substructure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thoughts emerge.</v>

823
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:09.080
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what processes have </v>
<v Speaker 4>physiological alignment are necessary </v>

824
00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 4>for you to speak from the core of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

825
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.080
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't even conceptualize that,</v>

826
00:47:13.081 --> 00:47:16.680
<v Speaker 4>but I believe that you can feel that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned some of that from reading Carl</v>

827
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.070
<v Speaker 4>Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

828
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:22.071
<v Speaker 4>who's a great clinician because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about mental health in part as a </v>

829
00:47:22.071 --> 00:47:23.480
<v Speaker 4>coherence between the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

830
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:28.630
<v Speaker 4>the spiritual or the or the abstract and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the physical that the two things were </v>

831
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:32.811
<v Speaker 4>aligned and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a lot of idea of alignment </v>

832
00:47:32.811 --> 00:47:33.010
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in psychoanalytic and clinical thinking.</v>

833
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.820
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I decided that I would start practicing </v>

834
00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:39.970
<v Speaker 4>not saying things that would make me </v>
<v Speaker 4>weak.</v>

835
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:45.240
<v Speaker 4>And what happened was that I had to stop</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying almost everything that I was </v>

836
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:49.411
<v Speaker 4>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say 95 percent of it as a hell </v>

837
00:47:49.411 --> 00:47:50.770
<v Speaker 4>of a shock to wake up and mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was over a few months,</v>

838
00:47:50.771 --> 00:47:55.771
<v Speaker 4>but it's a hell of a shock to wake up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and realize that you're mostly dead </v>

839
00:47:55.771 --> 00:47:55.771
<v Speaker 4>wood.</v>

840
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.390
<v Speaker 4>It's a shock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

841
00:47:58.391 --> 00:47:59.170
<v Speaker 4>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

842
00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 4>do you really want all of that to burn </v>
<v Speaker 4>off?</v>

843
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:01.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

844
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a little husk,</v>

845
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 4>five percent of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

846
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:07.840
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that five percent is solid,</v>

847
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.020
<v Speaker 4>then maybe that's exactly what you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have happen.</v>

848
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I told you that story is an </v>

849
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.831
<v Speaker 4>elaboration of this line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and God saw that the wickedness of man </v>

850
00:48:19.831 --> 00:48:22.621
<v Speaker 4>was great in the earth and that every </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine have the imagination of the </v>

851
00:48:22.621 --> 00:48:25.711
<v Speaker 4>thoughts of his heart was only evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>continually to question worth asking </v>

852
00:48:25.711 --> 00:48:29.290
<v Speaker 4>just exactly what are your motives?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

853
00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:34.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they're purer than mine were and </v>

854
00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.781
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that I'm naturally a </v>

855
00:48:36.781 --> 00:48:37.900
<v Speaker 4>particularly good person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I have to work at it very,</v>

856
00:48:37.901 --> 00:48:41.800
<v Speaker 4>very hard and I don't necessarily think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that everyone is like that,</v>

857
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:45.730
<v Speaker 4>but some people are worse than that.</v>

858
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:51.630
<v Speaker 4>And everyone's like that to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's worth thinking about just how </v>

859
00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:55.840
<v Speaker 4>much trouble are you trying to cause,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

860
00:48:55.841 --> 00:49:00.841
<v Speaker 4>and the other thing you might think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about is that if you're not doing </v>

861
00:49:00.841 --> 00:49:00.970
<v Speaker 4>something important with your life by </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own definition,</v>

862
00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:02.800
<v Speaker 4>because that's the game that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing,</v>

863
00:49:02.801 --> 00:49:05.290
<v Speaker 4>you get to define the terms at least </v>
<v Speaker 4>initially,</v>

864
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:11.070
<v Speaker 4>maybe you're prone to cause trouble just</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you don't have anything better </v>

865
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.390
<v Speaker 4>to do because at least it's trouble is </v>
<v Speaker 4>more interesting than boring.</v>

866
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:18.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something you learn if you read </v>

867
00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:18.930
<v Speaker 4>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does Tsq knew that extraordinarily well?</v>

868
00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:23.610
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're not doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not pushing yourself to the </v>

869
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:24.790
<v Speaker 4>limits of your capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have plenty of leftover.</v>

870
00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:31.380
<v Speaker 4>What would you say will power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>energy and resources to devote to </v>

871
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.310
<v Speaker 4>causing interesting trouble?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so well.</v>

872
00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:36.910
<v Speaker 4>So I would say this is also an </v>
<v Speaker 4>archetypal scenario.</v>

873
00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:42.210
<v Speaker 4>God saw that the wickedness of man was </v>
<v Speaker 4>great in the earth and that every </v>

874
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:43.360
<v Speaker 4>imagination of the thoughts of his heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>was only evil continually.</v>

875
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:49.530
<v Speaker 4>That's something to meditate on and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not self destructive because what it is,</v>

876
00:49:50.191 --> 00:49:53.080
<v Speaker 4>is an attempt to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the diagnosis of an illness.</v>

877
00:49:53.081 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like if that does happen to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>case for you or to some degree,</v>

878
00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:58.390
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's only 10 percent of you or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

879
00:49:58.391 --> 00:50:03.391
<v Speaker 4>or maybe it's 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then coming to terms with that is </v>

880
00:50:03.391 --> 00:50:07.021
<v Speaker 4>excellent because then maybe you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>start doing it and what would be the </v>

881
00:50:07.021 --> 00:50:09.700
<v Speaker 4>downside to that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to give up your resentment,</v>

882
00:50:09.701 --> 00:50:11.380
<v Speaker 4>obviously in your hatred and all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

883
00:50:11.381 --> 00:50:13.870
<v Speaker 4>and that's really annoying because those</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotions are very.</v>

884
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:19.110
<v Speaker 4>They're easy to engage in in there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're engaging and they have this </v>

885
00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:22.270
<v Speaker 4>feeling of self righteousness with them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that goes along with them,</v>

886
00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:26.290
<v Speaker 4>but you're not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In order to put yourself down.</v>

887
00:50:26.291 --> 00:50:31.291
<v Speaker 4>You're doing this in order to separate </v>
<v Speaker 4>the wheat from the chaff and to leave </v>

888
00:50:31.291 --> 00:50:32.690
<v Speaker 4>everything that you don't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind,</v>

889
00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:43.060
<v Speaker 4>and it repented the Lord that he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>made man on the earth and it grieved him</v>

890
00:50:43.061 --> 00:50:45.100
<v Speaker 4>at his heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Lord said,</v>

891
00:50:45.101 --> 00:50:48.070
<v Speaker 4>I will destroy man whom I've created </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the face of the earth,</v>

892
00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:53.550
<v Speaker 4>both man and beast and the creeping </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and the fowls of the air for </v>

893
00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:53.550
<v Speaker 4>repentance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me That I've made them.</v>

894
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:55.570
<v Speaker 4>What's the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

895
00:50:55.571 --> 00:50:59.350
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that the cosmos that God </v>
<v Speaker 4>created has become corrupt,</v>

896
00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:04.800
<v Speaker 4>and that's a funny thing because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know this is the other thing about </v>

897
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.480
<v Speaker 4>genesis that always hits me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that that's also true.</v>

898
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:11.440
<v Speaker 4>I told you that the Mesopotamians </v>
<v Speaker 4>believed that human beings were made out</v>

899
00:51:11.441 --> 00:51:14.920
<v Speaker 4>of the blood of king,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knew who was the worst monster monster.</v>

900
00:51:14.921 --> 00:51:19.090
<v Speaker 4>That the dragon of chaos could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty harsh diagnosis,</v>

901
00:51:19.091 --> 00:51:24.091
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reason the Mesopotamians </v>

902
00:51:24.091 --> 00:51:25.330
<v Speaker 4>believed that is because they knew as </v>
<v Speaker 4>did the authors of Genesis,</v>

903
00:51:25.331 --> 00:51:30.280
<v Speaker 4>that human beings are the only creatures</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the cosmos.</v>

904
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:34.870
<v Speaker 4>Let's say the cosmos of being who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually capable of deceit,</v>

905
00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:36.850
<v Speaker 4>conscious deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and malevolence,</v>

906
00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:42.810
<v Speaker 4>and the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to what degree does the expression of </v>

907
00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:46.381
<v Speaker 4>that conscious deceit and malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrupt things so badly that it would be</v>

908
00:51:46.511 --> 00:51:48.730
<v Speaker 4>better that they didn't exist at all?</v>

909
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see stories.</v>

910
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:56.510
<v Speaker 4>There's a story associated with this in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the epic of Gilgamesh,</v>

911
00:51:56.511 --> 00:52:01.511
<v Speaker 4>associated with the flood that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the same underlying narrative </v>

912
00:52:01.511 --> 00:52:01.511
<v Speaker 4>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

913
00:52:01.511 --> 00:52:02.840
<v Speaker 4>some people think the story of Noah was </v>
<v Speaker 4>derived from it,</v>

914
00:52:02.841 --> 00:52:07.841
<v Speaker 4>where the gods who created repented of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their creation and determined that </v>

915
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.410
<v Speaker 4>erasing it would be better than allowing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it to propagate.</v>

916
00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.200
<v Speaker 4>And you see the same thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mesopotamian creation myth.</v>

917
00:52:15.201 --> 00:52:20.170
<v Speaker 4>Enuma elish because the early gods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're representatives of,</v>

918
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:22.880
<v Speaker 4>of the giants of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

919
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:28.450
<v Speaker 4>make so much noise and are so careless </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the original creator God timeout in</v>

920
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:34.210
<v Speaker 4>her concert time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matt decides to wipe them from the face </v>

921
00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:37.471
<v Speaker 4>of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you read something like </v>

922
00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:45.191
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you read it from an informed </v>

923
00:52:45.191 --> 00:52:47.861
<v Speaker 4>historical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts to have a depth that makes it </v>

924
00:52:47.861 --> 00:52:52.630
<v Speaker 4>transcend the sort of archaic and fairy </v>
<v Speaker 4>tale like element of the story.</v>

925
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:58.271
<v Speaker 4>It's like I've read some very terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about what happened in Nazi </v>

926
00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:03.720
<v Speaker 4>Germany and what happened when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Japanese invaded China and just what </v>

927
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.250
<v Speaker 4>happened generally in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mankind.</v>

928
00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:12.420
<v Speaker 4>Things can get so bad that it takes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagination of a very bad person to </v>

929
00:53:12.551 --> 00:53:17.530
<v Speaker 4>conceptualize them and when they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>that bad,</v>

930
00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.230
<v Speaker 4>this is the only kind of language that </v>
<v Speaker 4>works to describe them.</v>

931
00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:25.860
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's another thing that I've </v>

932
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.870
<v Speaker 4>discovered working with my clinical </v>
<v Speaker 4>clients is when their lives are really </v>

933
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.640
<v Speaker 4>not going well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

934
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:35.660
<v Speaker 4>when they're close to suicide or when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're close to homicide or when there </v>

935
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:40.671
<v Speaker 4>are things going on in the family that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are so corrupt and terrible that they </v>

936
00:53:40.671 --> 00:53:44.031
<v Speaker 4>reached back generations and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>aimed at nothing but misery and </v>

937
00:53:44.031 --> 00:53:47.241
<v Speaker 4>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only language that suffices has a </v>

938
00:53:47.241 --> 00:53:50.640
<v Speaker 4>religious tone because there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>else that's available to describe what's</v>

939
00:53:50.641 --> 00:53:53.010
<v Speaker 4>happening with the proper level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>seriousness.</v>

940
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:58.310
<v Speaker 4>And it might be that you've never </v>
<v Speaker 4>encountered a situation that required </v>

941
00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:02.211
<v Speaker 4>that level of seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that those </v>

942
00:54:02.211 --> 00:54:02.211
<v Speaker 4>situations don't exist.</v>

943
00:54:02.211 --> 00:54:07.160
<v Speaker 4>They exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You generally do everything you can to </v>

944
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.971
<v Speaker 4>avoid being ensconced in them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they certainly do exist in the </v>

945
00:54:10.971 --> 00:54:12.240
<v Speaker 4>probability that you'll encounter a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation like that.</v>

946
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:17.241
<v Speaker 4>Or two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at some point in your life is </v>

947
00:54:17.241 --> 00:54:19.161
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll tangle with someone who's </v>

948
00:54:19.161 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 4>malevolent right to the core,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe it'll be you that is,</v>

949
00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 4>and that'll be a big shock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then these sorts of things,</v>

950
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:29.040
<v Speaker 4>these sorts of poetic descriptors start </v>
<v Speaker 4>to become much more real.</v>

951
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Speaker 4>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord.</v>

952
00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:39.170
<v Speaker 4>These are the generations of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Noah was a just man and perfect in his </v>

953
00:54:39.331 --> 00:54:41.550
<v Speaker 4>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Noah walked with God.</v>

954
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:46.940
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting line because if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you remember back in the story of Adam </v>

955
00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:50.331
<v Speaker 4>and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens to Adam once he eats the </v>

956
00:54:50.331 --> 00:54:54.710
<v Speaker 4>fruit of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the knowledge of good and evil and </v>

957
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:55.320
<v Speaker 4>wakes up the scales fall from his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>become self conscious,</v>

958
00:54:55.321 --> 00:54:59.040
<v Speaker 4>develops the knowledge of good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>is he won't walk with God when God calls</v>

959
00:54:59.041 --> 00:55:04.041
<v Speaker 4>him in the garden and so noah is Adam </v>
<v Speaker 4>without the fall essentially,</v>

960
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.590
<v Speaker 4>and there's something that Noah was </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing right that</v>

961
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:15.340
<v Speaker 4>motivates God to spare him or maybe to </v>
<v Speaker 4>show him a pathway through the emergent </v>

962
00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.160
<v Speaker 4>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

963
00:55:16.161 --> 00:55:21.161
<v Speaker 4>and that's worth thinking about a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there will be situations in your</v>

964
00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:26.351
<v Speaker 4>life where what you face is the emergent</v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos and maybe that'll be some terrible</v>

965
00:55:26.361 --> 00:55:30.410
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe inside your family or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll be something that's occurring on a</v>

966
00:55:30.411 --> 00:55:35.411
<v Speaker 4>much broader social level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the chaos is coming and what you're </v>

967
00:55:35.871 --> 00:55:38.120
<v Speaker 4>going to want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you want to be a dentist and have</v>

968
00:55:38.121 --> 00:55:41.330
<v Speaker 4>the chaos or even a contributor to it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and perhaps that is what you want.</v>

969
00:55:41.331 --> 00:55:44.600
<v Speaker 4>Because many people under those </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances choose that.</v>

970
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:51.910
<v Speaker 4>What you want is to know how you build </v>
<v Speaker 4>an Ark and get through it.</v>

971
00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.680
<v Speaker 4>That's what you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're,</v>

972
00:55:57.681 --> 00:56:01.730
<v Speaker 4>if you're interested in life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're interested in proper being and</v>

973
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.870
<v Speaker 4>you're disinclined to produce any more </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering,</v>

974
00:56:05.871 --> 00:56:10.871
<v Speaker 4>the necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you want to know how to conduct </v>

975
00:56:10.871 --> 00:56:13.031
<v Speaker 4>yourself when the catastrophe comes so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have a reasonable possibility </v>

976
00:56:13.031 --> 00:56:17.560
<v Speaker 4>of of moving through it and starting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>new.</v>

977
00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.920
<v Speaker 4>So when when this old story says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

978
00:56:23.211 --> 00:56:25.430
<v Speaker 4>God's not happy and he's going to wipe </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything out.</v>

979
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.540
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

980
00:56:26.541 --> 00:56:28.310
<v Speaker 4>you might want to take that seriously</v>

981
00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 4>and then when it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's one person who had a motive </v>

982
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.001
<v Speaker 4>being that protected him from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's also something you might want to </v>

983
00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:43.181
<v Speaker 4>take seriously because you might want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>know what that mode of being is because </v>

984
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:46.900
<v Speaker 4>you might need to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so these sorts of things are </v>

985
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.751
<v Speaker 4>practical in the deepest possible sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're real in the deepest possible </v>

986
00:56:49.751 --> 00:56:51.710
<v Speaker 4>sense and practical in the deepest </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible sense.</v>

987
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.760
<v Speaker 4>So Noah walked with God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm going to switch way ahead here </v>

988
00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:03.370
<v Speaker 4>because I said at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lecture series that the Bible is a </v>

989
00:57:06.171 --> 00:57:11.171
<v Speaker 4>hyperlinked text and everything refers </v>
<v Speaker 4>to everything else and so there's </v>

990
00:57:11.721 --> 00:57:14.990
<v Speaker 4>utility in reading it in linear order,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a linear document.</v>

991
00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.070
<v Speaker 4>It's a document that</v>

992
00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:20.390
<v Speaker 4>that you can move through in an infinite</v>
<v Speaker 4>number of.</v>

993
00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:26.560
<v Speaker 4>There's an infinite number of pathways </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can use to walk through it and </v>

994
00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:31.300
<v Speaker 4>all of the document expands upon and </v>
<v Speaker 4>refers to all of the rest of the </v>

995
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.940
<v Speaker 4>document and so I'm going to search </v>
<v Speaker 4>switch to the sermon on the mount,</v>

996
00:57:34.941 --> 00:57:39.941
<v Speaker 4>which I think is probably the key </v>
<v Speaker 4>document in the New Testament and I'm </v>

997
00:57:39.941 --> 00:57:44.321
<v Speaker 4>going to switch to it because I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the closest thing we have to a </v>

998
00:57:44.481 --> 00:57:49.481
<v Speaker 4>fully articulated description of what it</v>
<v Speaker 4>would mean to walk with God so that </v>

999
00:57:50.421 --> 00:57:52.850
<v Speaker 4>you're in the Ark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the flood comes.</v>

1000
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:58.630
<v Speaker 4>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the most fully articulated </v>

1001
00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:00.920
<v Speaker 4>realization of that idea that that leaps</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the metaphorical.</v>

1002
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:02.220
<v Speaker 4>Because if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1003
00:58:02.221 --> 00:58:03.980
<v Speaker 4>you should conduct yourself like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1004
00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:08.981
<v Speaker 4>and walk with God and build an Ark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously those are poetic and </v>

1005
00:58:08.981 --> 00:58:13.070
<v Speaker 4>metaphorical suggestions and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>that easy to bring them into practice,</v>

1006
00:58:13.071 --> 00:58:13.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1007
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:18.370
<v Speaker 4>It's the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a big distance between you and </v>

1008
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.491
<v Speaker 4>the archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't obvious how to manifest it in </v>

1009
00:58:21.491 --> 00:58:24.071
<v Speaker 4>your own life and what has to happen is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the archetype has to be differentiated </v>

1010
00:58:24.071 --> 00:58:28.661
<v Speaker 4>in articulated so that it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 4>sufficiently practical and personal so </v>

1011
00:58:28.661 --> 00:58:33.521
<v Speaker 4>that you can actually implement it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to take apart some of the </v>

1012
00:58:33.521 --> 00:58:36.371
<v Speaker 4>sermon on the mount.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It starts in Matthew five and I'm not </v>

1013
00:58:36.371 --> 00:58:39.911
<v Speaker 4>going to talk about Matthew Five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to talk about the end of </v>

1014
00:58:39.911 --> 00:58:42.671
<v Speaker 4>Matthew six and most of matthew seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Consider the lilies of the field,</v>

1015
00:58:43.581 --> 00:58:45.290
<v Speaker 4>how they grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They toil.</v>

1016
00:58:45.291 --> 00:58:50.291
<v Speaker 4>Not Neither do they spin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yet I say unto you that even Solomon</v>

1017
00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:53.930
<v Speaker 4>in all his glory was not arrayed like </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of these.</v>

1018
00:58:55.750 --> 00:59:00.750
<v Speaker 4>Wherefore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if God so clothes the grass of the </v>

1019
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.750
<v Speaker 4>field,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which today is and tomorrow is cast into</v>

1020
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:03.730
<v Speaker 4>the oven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shall he not much more clothe you.</v>

1021
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh Ye of little faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Therefore,</v>

1022
00:59:05.801 --> 00:59:10.801
<v Speaker 4>take no thought saying what shall we eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>or what shall we drink or wherewithal </v>

1023
00:59:10.801 --> 00:59:14.941
<v Speaker 4>shall we be closed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are famous lines and that sort of </v>

1024
00:59:14.941 --> 00:59:16.090
<v Speaker 4>Christ the Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1025
00:59:16.091 --> 00:59:17.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1026
00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.350
<v Speaker 4>let it all hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an old phrase,</v>

1027
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:26.590
<v Speaker 4>do your thing and everything will come </v>
<v Speaker 4>to you and these lines have been </v>

1028
00:59:27.711 --> 00:59:32.711
<v Speaker 4>interpreted in that manner many times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's seriously not the proper </v>

1029
00:59:34.881 --> 00:59:39.881
<v Speaker 4>interpretation because there's a kicker </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this injunction and the kicker is </v>

1030
00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:45.941
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for your heavenly father knows that you </v>

1031
00:59:46.601 --> 00:59:51.160
<v Speaker 4>have need of all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but seek ye first the Kingdom of God and</v>

1032
00:59:51.161 --> 00:59:53.620
<v Speaker 4>his righteousness and all these things </v>
<v Speaker 4>shall be added unto you.</v>

1033
00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:55.900
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot different than the hippie </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

1034
00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there's a very,</v>

1035
00:59:58.571 --> 01:00:00.550
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very interesting idea here.</v>

1036
01:00:00.551 --> 01:00:05.551
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly one of the most profound </v>

1037
01:00:05.551 --> 01:00:07.360
<v Speaker 4>ideas that I've ever encountered and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea is this,</v>

1038
01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:12.450
<v Speaker 4>is that if you configure your life so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that what you are genuinely doing is </v>

1039
01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:18.720
<v Speaker 4>aiming at the highest possible good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the things that you need to</v>

1040
01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:25.850
<v Speaker 4>to survive and to thrive on a day to day</v>
<v Speaker 4>basis will deliver themselves to you.</v>

1041
01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:32.040
<v Speaker 4>That's a hypothesis and it's not some </v>
<v Speaker 4>simple hypothesis,</v>

1042
01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:34.290
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because what it basically says is if you</v>

1043
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:37.290
<v Speaker 4>dare to do the most difficult thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can conceptualize,</v>

1044
01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.840
<v Speaker 4>your life will work out better than it </v>
<v Speaker 4>will.</v>

1045
01:00:39.841 --> 01:00:42.060
<v Speaker 4>If you do anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1046
01:00:42.061 --> 01:00:43.470
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to find out if that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>true?</v>

1047
01:00:43.471 --> 01:00:45.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a Kierkegaardian leap of faith.</v>

1048
01:00:45.751 --> 01:00:50.751
<v Speaker 4>There is no way you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find out whether or not that's true </v>

1049
01:00:50.751 --> 01:00:52.701
<v Speaker 4>unless you do it so no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one can tell you either because just </v>

1050
01:00:52.951 --> 01:00:56.670
<v Speaker 4>because it works for someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's interesting and all that,</v>

1051
01:00:56.671 --> 01:00:58.380
<v Speaker 4>but it's no proof that it'll work for </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1052
01:00:58.381 --> 01:01:03.381
<v Speaker 4>You have to be all in in this game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the idea is seek ye first the </v>

1053
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:09.200
<v Speaker 4>Kingdom of God and his righteousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's actually a fairly </v>

1054
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.231
<v Speaker 4>important caution when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about not having to pay attention to </v>

1055
01:01:12.811 --> 01:01:17.811
<v Speaker 4>what you're going to eat or what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to where it's like what it's </v>

1056
01:01:17.811 --> 01:01:21.381
<v Speaker 4>essentially saying is that those </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems are trivial in comparison and </v>

1057
01:01:21.381 --> 01:01:24.180
<v Speaker 4>the probability is that if you manifest </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself properly in the world,</v>

1058
01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:28.710
<v Speaker 4>that those things will come your way is </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily high and I believe,</v>

1059
01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.450
<v Speaker 4>I believe that that's exactly right.</v>

1060
01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:31.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1061
01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:33.600
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've watched people operate in the world</v>

1062
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:38.630
<v Speaker 4>and I would say that there is no more </v>
<v Speaker 4>effective way of operating in the world </v>

1063
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:45.230
<v Speaker 4>then to conceptualize the highest good </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can and then strive to attain </v>

1064
01:01:45.331 --> 01:01:50.331
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no more practical pathway to the</v>

1065
01:01:50.401 --> 01:01:55.050
<v Speaker 4>kind of success that you could have if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually knew what success was.</v>

1066
01:01:56.430 --> 01:02:01.430
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what this sermon is attempting </v>

1067
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.430
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1068
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:05.920
<v Speaker 4>to pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like in,</v>

1069
01:02:05.921 --> 01:02:10.921
<v Speaker 4>in the story of Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what happens at the beginning </v>

1070
01:02:10.921 --> 01:02:12.720
<v Speaker 4>of the story of Pinocchio is that Japan </v>
<v Speaker 4>auto wishes on a star.</v>

1071
01:02:12.721 --> 01:02:17.721
<v Speaker 4>We talked about that a little bit and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you pedal does is align himself </v>

1072
01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:21.890
<v Speaker 4>with the metaphorical manifestation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the highest good he can conceptualize </v>

1073
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:27.260
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says he makes sure he makes a </v>

1074
01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.470
<v Speaker 4>commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say he aims at the star and for </v>

1075
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:33.570
<v Speaker 4>him the star is the possibility that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>can take his creation,</v>

1076
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:38.780
<v Speaker 4>a puppet whose strings are being pulled </v>
<v Speaker 4>by unseen forces and have it transform </v>

1077
01:02:39.431 --> 01:02:42.660
<v Speaker 4>into something that's our economists and</v>
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

1078
01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1079
01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.880
<v Speaker 4>well that's a hell of an ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when we're wise enough to put </v>

1080
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.481
<v Speaker 4>that into children's movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but too foolish to understand what it </v>

1081
01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:56.351
<v Speaker 4>means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such an interesting juxtaposition </v>

1082
01:02:56.351 --> 01:02:56.630
<v Speaker 4>that that we can both know that and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>know it.</v>

1083
01:02:56.631 --> 01:02:58.640
<v Speaker 4>At the same time you can go to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>

1084
01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:03.641
<v Speaker 4>you can watch it and it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that you can go </v>

1085
01:03:03.641 --> 01:03:03.641
<v Speaker 4>home and think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1086
01:03:03.641 --> 01:03:05.360
<v Speaker 4>I know what that meant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While people are complicated,</v>

1087
01:03:05.361 --> 01:03:07.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We exist at different levels and all the</v>

1088
01:03:07.161 --> 01:03:08.750
<v Speaker 4>levels don't communicate with one </v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

1089
01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:13.751
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the movie is a hypothesis and the </v>

1090
01:03:13.751 --> 01:03:17.471
<v Speaker 4>hypothesis is there's no better pathway </v>
<v Speaker 4>to self realization and the enablement </v>

1091
01:03:18.501 --> 01:03:23.501
<v Speaker 4>of being than to pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The highest good that you can conceive </v>

1092
01:03:23.501 --> 01:03:26.510
<v Speaker 4>of and commit yourself to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you might also ask yourself,</v>

1093
01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:30.320
<v Speaker 4>and this is definitely worth asking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is do you really have anything better to</v>

1094
01:03:30.321 --> 01:03:32.090
<v Speaker 4>do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't,</v>

1095
01:03:32.091 --> 01:03:37.091
<v Speaker 4>well why would you do anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Therefore take no thought for the </v>

1096
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:39.630
<v Speaker 4>morrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the moral shall take thought for the</v>

1097
01:03:39.631 --> 01:03:42.780
<v Speaker 4>things of itself sufficient unto the day</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the evil thereof.</v>

1098
01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:49.120
<v Speaker 4>I spend a long time trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that man to because it's another </v>

1099
01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:49.120
<v Speaker 4>one of those lines</v>

1100
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:55.150
<v Speaker 4>can easily be read as pro grasshopper </v>
<v Speaker 4>and anti amped.</v>

1101
01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:01.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you remember the old fable of the </v>

1102
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:01.380
<v Speaker 4>grasshopper and the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not,</v>

1103
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to tell it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that works.</v>

1104
01:04:04.721 --> 01:04:08.200
<v Speaker 4>And the grasshopper fiddles and the aunt</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a pretty good time in the winter and</v>

1105
01:04:08.201 --> 01:04:13.201
<v Speaker 4>the grasshopper dies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this is like a pro grasshopper </v>

1106
01:04:13.201 --> 01:04:16.771
<v Speaker 4>line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not because it says something </v>

1107
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:19.021
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says that if you orient yourself </v>

1108
01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:19.021
<v Speaker 4>properly</v>

1109
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:24.370
<v Speaker 4>and then pay attention to what you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>every day that works and it.</v>

1110
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:29.470
<v Speaker 4>I actually think that that's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>accordance with what with what we have </v>

1111
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:32.441
<v Speaker 4>come to understand about human </v>
<v Speaker 4>perception because what happens is that </v>

1112
01:04:32.441 --> 01:04:36.230
<v Speaker 4>the world shifts itself around your aim </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're.</v>

1113
01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:41.290
<v Speaker 4>You're a creature that has an aim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have an ame in order to do </v>

1114
01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:41.290
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're aiming creature.</v>

1115
01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:44.030
<v Speaker 4>You look at a point and you move towards</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1116
01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:47.180
<v Speaker 4>It's built right into you and so you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a name.</v>

1117
01:04:47.181 --> 01:04:52.181
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say your aim is the highest </v>

1118
01:04:52.181 --> 01:04:53.621
<v Speaker 4>possible ame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then so that sets up the world </v>

1119
01:04:53.621 --> 01:04:53.621
<v Speaker 4>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

1120
01:04:53.621 --> 01:04:58.290
<v Speaker 4>it organizes all of your perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It organizes what you see and you don't </v>

1121
01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:02.171
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It organizes your emotions and your </v>

1122
01:05:02.171 --> 01:05:02.360
<v Speaker 4>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you organize yourself around that aim</v>

1123
01:05:02.361 --> 01:05:07.361
<v Speaker 4>and then what happens is the day </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifests itself as a set of challenges </v>

1124
01:05:07.361 --> 01:05:09.620
<v Speaker 4>and problems and if you solve them </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>

1125
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:14.890
<v Speaker 4>then you stay on the pathway towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>that eighth and you can concentrate on </v>

1126
01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:14.890
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>

1127
01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:19.330
<v Speaker 4>on the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that way you get to have your </v>

1128
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:19.330
<v Speaker 4>cake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And eat it because you can,</v>

1129
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:23.490
<v Speaker 4>you can point into the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the far distance and you can live in the</v>

1130
01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:23.650
<v Speaker 4>day</v>

1131
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:30.630
<v Speaker 4>and it seems to me that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes every moment of the day </v>

1132
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:34.231
<v Speaker 4>supercharged with meaning that that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if everything that you're doing </v>

1133
01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:36.070
<v Speaker 4>everyday is related to the highest </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible aim,</v>

1134
01:05:36.071 --> 01:05:37.870
<v Speaker 4>that you can conceptualize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1135
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:42.871
<v Speaker 4>that's the very definition of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning that would sustain you in your </v>

1136
01:05:42.871 --> 01:05:43.750
<v Speaker 4>life well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the issue is well back to Noah,</v>

1137
01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 4>well all hell is about to break loose </v>
<v Speaker 4>and chaos is coming.</v>

1138
01:05:46.751 --> 01:05:48.370
<v Speaker 4>It's like when that's happening in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

1139
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:53.610
<v Speaker 4>you might want to be doing something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you regard as truly worthwhile </v>

1140
01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:55.710
<v Speaker 4>because that's what will keep you afloat</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1141
01:05:55.830 --> 01:06:00.830
<v Speaker 4>when everything is flooded and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to wait until the flood comes to </v>

1142
01:06:02.111 --> 01:06:07.111
<v Speaker 4>start doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you're arcs half built and </v>

1143
01:06:07.111 --> 01:06:11.041
<v Speaker 4>you don't know how to captain it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probability is very high that that </v>

1144
01:06:11.041 --> 01:06:15.940
<v Speaker 4>you'll drown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take therefore no thought for the moral,</v>

1145
01:06:18.431 --> 01:06:21.640
<v Speaker 4>but for the morrow shall take thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the things of itself,</v>

1146
01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:24.910
<v Speaker 4>sufficient unto the day is the evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>thereof.</v>

1147
01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:29.960
<v Speaker 4>That's not a particularly optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>formulation,</v>

1148
01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:36.330
<v Speaker 4>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that you be not judged for with what</v>

1149
01:06:36.331 --> 01:06:41.331
<v Speaker 4>judgment you judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shall be judged and with what </v>

1150
01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:41.331
<v Speaker 4>measure you meet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shall be measured to you.</v>

1151
01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:41.331
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1152
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:48.360
<v Speaker 4>to sensible piece of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a sensible description.</v>

1153
01:06:48.361 --> 01:06:53.361
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't call it a piece of advice </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't think that any of this </v>

1154
01:06:53.361 --> 01:06:55.981
<v Speaker 4>is advice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a description of the structure of </v>

1155
01:06:55.981 --> 01:06:58.041
<v Speaker 4>reality that's not the same as advice </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it basically says that you'll be </v>

1156
01:06:58.041 --> 01:07:01.590
<v Speaker 4>held accountable by the rules of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game that you choose to play</v>

1157
01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:08.500
<v Speaker 4>and that I also think is perfectly in </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping with what we understand about </v>

1158
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.910
<v Speaker 4>human psychology because you you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing.</v>

1159
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:15.970
<v Speaker 4>You have to play a game that other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people will allow you to play and that </v>

1160
01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:18.851
<v Speaker 4>will cooperate with you while you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing and that will compete with you </v>

1161
01:07:18.851 --> 01:07:21.461
<v Speaker 4>while you're playing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have a fair bit of flexibility </v>

1162
01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:21.461
<v Speaker 4>in setting up the parameters of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>

1163
01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:26.530
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have any choice about </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you're going to be in a </v>

1164
01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:29.141
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in a game and you're going to be </v>

1165
01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:32.531
<v Speaker 4>held accountable by the rules of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game because that's how the game works </v>

1166
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:37.510
<v Speaker 4>and so you might want to pick a game by </v>
<v Speaker 4>whose rules you would be willing to be </v>

1167
01:07:38.481 --> 01:07:43.481
<v Speaker 4>held accountable and why be hold us Dow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moat that isn't my brother's eye,</v>

1168
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:49.321
<v Speaker 4>but consider it's not the beam that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>in dire or how will you say to that,</v>

1169
01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:54.631
<v Speaker 4>I brother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me pull out the motive out of the </v>

1170
01:07:54.631 --> 01:07:54.631
<v Speaker 4>Nih and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a beam is in nine Onei.</v>

1171
01:07:54.631 --> 01:07:56.710
<v Speaker 4>What you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a b medicine,</v>

1172
01:07:57.970 --> 01:08:02.970
<v Speaker 4>a moat is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dust speck and a beam is a very </v>

1173
01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:06.070
<v Speaker 4>large piece of lumber and so the issue </v>
<v Speaker 4>is</v>

1174
01:08:07.210 --> 01:08:12.210
<v Speaker 4>not so much the blindness of others even</v>
<v Speaker 4>though there's as much blindness among </v>

1175
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:17.911
<v Speaker 4>others as there is as there is for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the issue here,</v>

1176
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:24.310
<v Speaker 4>the advice here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the description here is you should be </v>

1177
01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:27.671
<v Speaker 4>concerned about what's interfering with </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own vision first and you should </v>

1178
01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:29.720
<v Speaker 4>leave other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hell alone in relationship to that.</v>

1179
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:34.100
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're a mode of being in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world is if you would just act better,</v>

1180
01:08:34.101 --> 01:08:39.101
<v Speaker 4>things would improve for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if you identify the evil and the </v>

1181
01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:44.621
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe is something that's outside </v>
<v Speaker 4>that someone else needs to fix or that </v>

1182
01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.550
<v Speaker 4>someone's responded to someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible for,</v>

1183
01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:51.820
<v Speaker 4>then then you're not going to fix that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're going to remain blind to the </v>

1184
01:08:59.231 --> 01:09:02.620
<v Speaker 4>things that you're doing and not doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that make things not go well.</v>

1185
01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.650
<v Speaker 4>And so it's just better to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1186
01:09:05.651 --> 01:09:10.651
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably blind in many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many ways and maybe there are some ways </v>

1187
01:09:10.651 --> 01:09:15.060
<v Speaker 4>that I could rectify that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>highly probable that you're blind and </v>

1188
01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:15.060
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

1189
01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:20.051
<v Speaker 4>it's in fact it's virtually certain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's just more useful to think,</v>

1190
01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:24.120
<v Speaker 4>how is it that I'm wrong in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation?</v>

1191
01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.990
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you something that I learned </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do when I was arguing with my wife,</v>

1192
01:09:27.991 --> 01:09:32.991
<v Speaker 4>which happened quite frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when you actually communicate </v>

1193
01:09:33.001 --> 01:09:38.001
<v Speaker 4>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find out that there's many things </v>

1194
01:09:38.001 --> 01:09:39.951
<v Speaker 4>that you don't agree on and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you are actually different </v>

1195
01:09:39.951 --> 01:09:42.801
<v Speaker 4>creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're actually going to have </v>

1196
01:09:42.801 --> 01:09:45.531
<v Speaker 4>a truthful conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to find out that you </v>

1197
01:09:45.531 --> 01:09:48.441
<v Speaker 4>don't see things the same way and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can either pretend that that's not </v>

1198
01:09:48.441 --> 01:09:52.581
<v Speaker 4>the case in gloss over it and then ended</v>
<v Speaker 4>up in a 30 year silent war or you can or</v>

1199
01:09:54.721 --> 01:09:59.721
<v Speaker 4>you can have the damn fight when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>need to have it and see if you can </v>

1200
01:09:59.721 --> 01:10:02.901
<v Speaker 4>straighten it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now and then we'd get into a </v>

1201
01:10:02.901 --> 01:10:06.731
<v Speaker 4>situation where we were at loggerheads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't move and it would spiral up </v>

1202
01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:09.080
<v Speaker 4>into hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1203
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:14.400
<v Speaker 4>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone laughs because they know they </v>

1204
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:14.930
<v Speaker 4>manifest plenty of hate speech towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>those they love.</v>

1205
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:20.500
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things we learned to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>was when we hit an impasse was to </v>

1206
01:10:20.661 --> 01:10:25.040
<v Speaker 4>separate and to go our own ways and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go sit and think,</v>

1207
01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1208
01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:26.840
<v Speaker 4>we're at this</v>

1209
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.010
<v Speaker 4>unpleasant situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't figure out how to move forward.</v>

1210
01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I'd always think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course it's her fault.</v>

1211
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Obviously it's her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Least Ninety five percent.</v>

1212
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:44.500
<v Speaker 4>But maybe there was something I did that</v>
<v Speaker 4>contributed like five percent to it.</v>

1213
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:50.090
<v Speaker 4>And so I would sit and think and ask </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself a question,</v>

1214
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:55.570
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there anything I did in the last six </v>

1215
01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:57.770
<v Speaker 4>months that increase the probability </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this impasse would manifest itself?</v>

1216
01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:00.980
<v Speaker 4>And I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have no idea how fast your mind will</v>

1217
01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:05.981
<v Speaker 4>generate an answer to a question like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because there's undoubtedly some </v>

1218
01:11:05.981 --> 01:11:07.010
<v Speaker 4>idiotic thing that you did that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1219
01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:12.011
<v Speaker 4>that you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that increased the probability that </v>

1220
01:11:12.011 --> 01:11:12.800
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have your hands around </v>
<v Speaker 4>the throat of the person that you love.</v>

1221
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.160
<v Speaker 4>And then you can go tell them that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can have a conversation,</v>

1222
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:19.020
<v Speaker 4>especially if they do the same thing.</v>

1223
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:19.770
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1224
01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:24.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's how I'm an idiot in this </v>

1225
01:11:24.771 --> 01:11:24.780
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there person says,</v>

1226
01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:25.590
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1227
01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:27.030
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's how I'm an idiot,</v>

1228
01:11:27.031 --> 01:11:29.730
<v Speaker 4>and then your two idiots and then maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can have a conversation.</v>

1229
01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.860
<v Speaker 4>So thou hypocrite first cast out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beam of light out of I know,</v>

1230
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:39.861
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then shalt thou see clearly to cast </v>

1231
01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:39.861
<v Speaker 4>out the mote of my brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1232
01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:44.430
<v Speaker 4>that's pay hard to argue with that ask.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it shall be given you.</v>

1233
01:11:44.491 --> 01:11:49.491
<v Speaker 4>Seek and Ye shall find knock and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>shall be opened unto you for everyone </v>

1234
01:11:49.491 --> 01:11:53.061
<v Speaker 4>that Asketh receive it and he that </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeketh findeth and to him that hath it </v>

1235
01:11:53.061 --> 01:11:55.770
<v Speaker 4>shall be opened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sounded pretty optimistic again,</v>

1236
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.170
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

1237
01:11:58.171 --> 01:12:02.110
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a description of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of existential reality and and</v>

1238
01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.050
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by which I mean</v>

1239
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:12.350
<v Speaker 4>when I'm in my clinical practice and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>observe and this is also the case with </v>

1240
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:15.531
<v Speaker 4>my students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is let's say people's lives aren't what </v>

1241
01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:17.580
<v Speaker 4>they would like them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you ask why?</v>

1242
01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:23.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forget about tragedy and catastrophe </v>

1243
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:24.090
<v Speaker 4>because that's self evident and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not gonna discuss that.</v>

1244
01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:29.450
<v Speaker 4>Although the degree to which you bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>about your own tragedy is always </v>

1245
01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:33.400
<v Speaker 4>indeterminant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would never say that every </v>

1246
01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:36.210
<v Speaker 4>terrible thing that is visited on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person is something they deserved.</v>

1247
01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:39.240
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's a very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 4>presupposition,</v>

1248
01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:42.480
<v Speaker 4>especially because everyone gets sick </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone dies,</v>

1249
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.490
<v Speaker 4>but one of the main reasons that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get what they want is because they</v>

1250
01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:55.491
<v Speaker 4>don't actually figure out what it is and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you're going to </v>

1251
01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.060
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would be good for you.</v>

1252
01:12:57.061 --> 01:12:58.800
<v Speaker 4>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which would even be better than what you</v>

1253
01:12:58.801 --> 01:12:59.550
<v Speaker 4>want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1254
01:12:59.551 --> 01:13:04.551
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might be wrong about what you want </v>

1255
01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:04.620
<v Speaker 4>easily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you could get.</v>

1256
01:13:04.621 --> 01:13:08.320
<v Speaker 4>What would really be good for you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1257
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:10.260
<v Speaker 4>why don't you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1258
01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.900
<v Speaker 4>because you don't try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't think,</v>

1259
01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:13.380
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1260
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:19.830
<v Speaker 4>here's what I would like if I could have</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and I don't mean I don't mean in a </v>

1261
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:24.811
<v Speaker 4>way that you manipulate the world to </v>
<v Speaker 4>force it to deliver you good for status </v>

1262
01:13:24.811 --> 01:13:26.590
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That isn't what I mean.</v>

1263
01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:31.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean something like imagine that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were taking care of yourself like you </v>

1264
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.550
<v Speaker 4>were someone you actually cared for and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you thought,</v>

1265
01:13:33.551 --> 01:13:35.410
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am caring for this person.</v>

1266
01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:38.170
<v Speaker 4>I would like things to go as well for </v>
<v Speaker 4>them as possible.</v>

1267
01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:43.440
<v Speaker 4>What would their life have to be like in</v>
<v Speaker 4>order for that to be the case where </v>

1268
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.070
<v Speaker 4>people don't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't sit down and think,</v>

1269
01:13:45.071 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1270
01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:46.750
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's figure it out.</v>

1271
01:13:46.751 --> 01:13:47.650
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a life.</v>

1272
01:13:47.651 --> 01:13:49.180
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously.</v>

1273
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:52.660
<v Speaker 4>It's like three years from now you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>have what you need.</v>

1274
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.590
<v Speaker 4>You got to be careful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have everything you can have,</v>

1275
01:13:57.591 --> 01:14:02.591
<v Speaker 4>what would be good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to figure out what it is </v>

1276
01:14:02.591 --> 01:14:02.591
<v Speaker 4>and then you have to aim at it.</v>

1277
01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:06.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my experience with people as being as if</v>

1278
01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:09.890
<v Speaker 4>they figure out what it is that would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>good for them and then they aim at it,</v>

1279
01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.290
<v Speaker 4>then they get it and it's strange </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they don't know.</v>

1280
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.600
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not quite that simple because you </v>

1281
01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.871
<v Speaker 4>know you may formulate an idea about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what would be good for you and then you </v>

1282
01:14:21.871 --> 01:14:24.751
<v Speaker 4>take 10 steps towards that and you find </v>
<v Speaker 4>out that your formulation was a bit off </v>

1283
01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:25.210
<v Speaker 4>and so you have to reformulate your </v>
<v Speaker 4>goal.</v>

1284
01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:29.290
<v Speaker 4>So you're kind of going like this as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>move towards the goal.</v>

1285
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:34.590
<v Speaker 4>But a huge part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people fail is because they don't ever </v>

1286
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:38.730
<v Speaker 4>set up the criteria for success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so since success is a very narrow </v>

1287
01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:43.351
<v Speaker 4>line in very unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you're going to </v>

1288
01:14:43.351 --> 01:14:45.841
<v Speaker 4>stumble on it randomly is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if there's a proposition here in </v>

1289
01:14:45.971 --> 01:14:49.870
<v Speaker 4>the proposition is if you actually want </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1290
01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.100
<v Speaker 4>you can have it.</v>

1291
01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.140
<v Speaker 4>Now the question then would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1292
01:14:55.141 --> 01:15:00.141
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean by actually want?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is that you reorient your</v>

1293
01:15:00.481 --> 01:15:05.481
<v Speaker 4>life in every possible way to make the </v>
<v Speaker 4>probability that that will occur as </v>

1294
01:15:07.171 --> 01:15:10.050
<v Speaker 4>certain as possible and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrificial idea,</v>

1295
01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't get everything.</v>

1296
01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Obviously you obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you can have what you need and</v>

1297
01:15:18.361 --> 01:15:21.120
<v Speaker 4>maybe all you have to do to get it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>ask,</v>

1298
01:15:21.570 --> 01:15:26.570
<v Speaker 4>but asking isn't a whim or today's wish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you have to be deadly serious </v>

1299
01:15:29.551 --> 01:15:30.510
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to think,</v>

1300
01:15:30.511 --> 01:15:34.020
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm taking stock of myself and if I</v>

1301
01:15:34.021 --> 01:15:39.021
<v Speaker 4>was going to live properly in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was going to set myself up such </v>

1302
01:15:39.091 --> 01:15:42.540
<v Speaker 4>that being would justify itself in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>estimation,</v>

1303
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.950
<v Speaker 4>and I don't mean as a harsh judge </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what is it that I would aim at?</v>

1304
01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:52.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've found is that in </v>

1305
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:56.600
<v Speaker 4>test of this theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say you can try this.</v>

1306
01:15:57.850 --> 01:16:02.850
<v Speaker 4>This is a form of prayer knocking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sit on your bed one day and ask </v>

1307
01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:07.501
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's what remarkably stupid things am </v>

1308
01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:11.410
<v Speaker 4>I doing on a regular basis to absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 4>screw up my life,</v>

1309
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:15.730
<v Speaker 4>and if you actually asked that question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to want to know the answer,</v>

1310
01:16:15.731 --> 01:16:20.731
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's actually what asking the </v>

1311
01:16:20.731 --> 01:16:20.731
<v Speaker 4>question means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean just mouthing the words.</v>

1312
01:16:20.731 --> 01:16:22.750
<v Speaker 4>It means you have to decide that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to know.</v>

1313
01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.870
<v Speaker 4>You'll figure that out so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll make your hair curl.</v>

1314
01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.290
<v Speaker 4>It's as if young thought about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he saw it.</v>

1315
01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:36.560
<v Speaker 4>He thought that people had two poles of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness in one was the individual </v>

1316
01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.290
<v Speaker 4>consciousness that we each identify </v>
<v Speaker 4>within.</v>

1317
01:16:37.291 --> 01:16:39.890
<v Speaker 4>The other was something he called the </v>
<v Speaker 4>self and the self is the.</v>

1318
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:42.510
<v Speaker 4>You might think about it as the divine </v>
<v Speaker 4>within.</v>

1319
01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:47.720
<v Speaker 4>That's close enough approximation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the universal part of your </v>

1320
01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:48.510
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's your conscience.</v>

1321
01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:52.260
<v Speaker 4>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever your conscience is,</v>

1322
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.650
<v Speaker 4>but it's something that you can consult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the Socratic Damon.</v>

1323
01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:00.800
<v Speaker 4>Socrates said that the thing that made </v>
<v Speaker 4>him different than everyone else in </v>

1324
01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.150
<v Speaker 4>Greece was that he consulted his demon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his genius.</v>

1325
01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:07.770
<v Speaker 4>He asked himself how it was that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>should conduct himself in the world,</v>

1326
01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:09.950
<v Speaker 4>and then he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>

1327
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.450
<v Speaker 4>he didn't try to force a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1328
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.960
<v Speaker 4>he didn't try to force a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Selfishly,</v>

1329
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:18.140
<v Speaker 4>he asked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to manifest myself in the best</v>

1330
01:17:18.141 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 4>possible manner in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to do that.</v>

1331
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:25.930
<v Speaker 4>What would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>While you're perfectly capable of </v>

1332
01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:29.711
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God only knows how you're perfectly </v>

1333
01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:32.651
<v Speaker 4>capable of immense feats of imagination </v>
<v Speaker 4>and dreams and fantasies.</v>

1334
01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:38.560
<v Speaker 4>God only knows how you do all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would happen if you consulted </v>

1335
01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.200
<v Speaker 4>yourself about the best possible outcome</v>
<v Speaker 4>for you?</v>

1336
01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.690
<v Speaker 4>You might get an answer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1337
01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:43.190
<v Speaker 4>that's what this proposition is</v>

1338
01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:52.910
<v Speaker 4>have or what man is the review.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who if his son asks for bread,</v>

1339
01:17:52.911 --> 01:17:55.040
<v Speaker 4>will give him a stone or if he asks for </v>
<v Speaker 4>a fish,</v>

1340
01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:58.730
<v Speaker 4>will give him a serpent if he then being</v>
<v Speaker 4>evil,</v>

1341
01:17:58.731 --> 01:18:00.740
<v Speaker 4>know how to give good gifts unto your </v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

1342
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:02.960
<v Speaker 4>How much more shall your father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is in heaven,</v>

1343
01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:06.740
<v Speaker 4>give good things to them that ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1344
01:18:06.741 --> 01:18:09.380
<v Speaker 4>this is a question about the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature of being,</v>

1345
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:15.100
<v Speaker 4>I suppose and one of the hypotheses in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the new testament which is different.</v>

1346
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:22.760
<v Speaker 4>It's a different hypothesis in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense than the one that structures the </v>

1347
01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.631
<v Speaker 4>old testament is that faith bakes being </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1348
01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:32.040
<v Speaker 4>It's a very interesting proposition and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so the notion would be,</v>

1349
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:34.800
<v Speaker 4>and it it's an action oriented issue as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1350
01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:39.420
<v Speaker 4>You act out the proposition that if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>act properly in the world,</v>

1351
01:18:39.421 --> 01:18:41.730
<v Speaker 4>that being will reveal itself to you as </v>
<v Speaker 4>benevolent,</v>

1352
01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.450
<v Speaker 4>but you will not know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll never know unless you do it.</v>

1353
01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:51.170
<v Speaker 4>So this is a call to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Act out the proposition that if you act </v>

1354
01:18:51.181 --> 01:18:54.090
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that being itself is benevolent.</v>

1355
01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:03.330
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason to assume the </v>
<v Speaker 4>contrary.</v>

1356
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:08.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean to assume the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be to be as cynical and bitter </v>

1357
01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.870
<v Speaker 4>as possible and it's not like we don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have reason for that.</v>

1358
01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.720
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I don't understand why </v>
<v Speaker 4>that happens to people.</v>

1359
01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:19.620
<v Speaker 4>Therefore all things whatsoever you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would that men should do to you.</v>

1360
01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:24.650
<v Speaker 4>Do you even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to them for this as the law and the </v>

1361
01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:26.640
<v Speaker 4>prophets and that's a reciprocity issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1362
01:19:26.641 --> 01:19:31.641
<v Speaker 4>It's like while imagine what would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is another thing I learned from </v>

1363
01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:34.080
<v Speaker 4>young because young reverse this because</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is often read,</v>

1364
01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:37.950
<v Speaker 4>it's the golden rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's often read is be nice to be nice to</v>

1365
01:19:37.951 --> 01:19:42.951
<v Speaker 4>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that is not what this rule </v>

1366
01:19:42.951 --> 01:19:44.901
<v Speaker 4>means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that even a little bit </v>

1367
01:19:44.901 --> 01:19:47.540
<v Speaker 4>it means something like and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>reverse it so that will concentrate on </v>

1368
01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:50.060
<v Speaker 4>you rather than the other person to </v>
<v Speaker 4>begin with.</v>

1369
01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:55.240
<v Speaker 4>It means something like conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 4>how things could be great if they were </v>

1370
01:19:58.071 --> 01:20:03.071
<v Speaker 4>great for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were taking care of yourself and </v>

1371
01:20:03.071 --> 01:20:03.290
<v Speaker 4>then work to make that the case for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone else.</v>

1372
01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:09.760
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that in Buddhism because Buddha </v>

1373
01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:09.760
<v Speaker 4>reached Nirvana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1374
01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.850
<v Speaker 4>That's the theory and then he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was tempted with offer to stay there </v>

1375
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:19.400
<v Speaker 4>and he rejected that offer and came back</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the profane world because he felt </v>

1376
01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:24.210
<v Speaker 4>that the attainment of nirvana was </v>
<v Speaker 4>insufficient unless everyone attained it</v>

1377
01:20:24.211 --> 01:20:27.000
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously and so it's something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

1378
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:32.390
<v Speaker 4>but it's treat yourself properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a hard thing to do because you're</v>

1379
01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:36.750
<v Speaker 4>a fallen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shameful,</v>

1380
01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.030
<v Speaker 4>cowardly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deceitful,</v>

1381
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.200
<v Speaker 4>malevolent,</v>

1382
01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.890
<v Speaker 4>mortal creature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it's not easy and you know it and</v>

1383
01:20:45.891 --> 01:20:49.800
<v Speaker 4>it's not easy to treat something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that properly and and,</v>

1384
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:55.220
<v Speaker 4>and it isn't obvious that people treat </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves better than they treat other </v>

1385
01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:55.460
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's obvious at all,</v>

1386
01:20:55.670 --> 01:20:57.500
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you could start with yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>and think,</v>

1387
01:20:57.501 --> 01:21:00.080
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take care of myself as if I</v>

1388
01:21:00.081 --> 01:21:05.081
<v Speaker 4>have value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would that look like and then I'm </v>

1389
01:21:05.081 --> 01:21:05.660
<v Speaker 4>going to work to extend that courtesy to</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone else.</v>

1390
01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.520
<v Speaker 4>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1391
01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:13.180
<v Speaker 4>the hypothesis here is that if you take </v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the moral wisdom that mankind has</v>

1392
01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:17.300
<v Speaker 4>generated over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's millennia of struggle,</v>

1393
01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:23.740
<v Speaker 4>evolved and then manifested metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>story and then codified into law,</v>

1394
01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:30.400
<v Speaker 4>articulated law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you pick one principle that </v>

1395
01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.880
<v Speaker 4>dominated all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This would be the principal</v>

1396
01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 4>and it's interesting too because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the law and the prophets and the law is </v>

1397
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.060
<v Speaker 4>the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the prophets or the process by which</v>

1398
01:21:43.061 --> 01:21:45.030
<v Speaker 4>the rules are being updated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1399
01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:50.060
<v Speaker 4>So the profits are a superordinate in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sense to the law and the </v>

1400
01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:54.031
<v Speaker 4>proposition that set forth in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular statement is that this maxim </v>

1401
01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:59.100
<v Speaker 4>which is optimize your own mode of being</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then work to do the same for </v>

1402
01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:02.170
<v Speaker 4>everyone around you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not only the thing that's at the core</v>

1403
01:22:02.171 --> 01:22:04.360
<v Speaker 4>of the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's at the core of the process that</v>

1404
01:22:04.361 --> 01:22:06.130
<v Speaker 4>generates it updates the law</v>

1405
01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:14.380
<v Speaker 4>to hell of a thing for someone to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enter ye in at the narrow gate,</v>

1406
01:22:14.691 --> 01:22:19.691
<v Speaker 4>because that's what straight means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Enter ye in at the straight gate for </v>

1407
01:22:19.691 --> 01:22:20.930
<v Speaker 4>wide is the gate and broad is the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that leads to destruction.</v>

1408
01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:26.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who in the world could possibly argue </v>

1409
01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:26.140
<v Speaker 4>with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every one in their right mind knows that</v>

1410
01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:30.281
<v Speaker 4>there's a million ways of doing things </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong and one way if you're lucky to do </v>

1411
01:22:30.281 --> 01:22:32.090
<v Speaker 4>things right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the notion that it's a very,</v>

1412
01:22:32.091 --> 01:22:35.780
<v Speaker 4>very narrow pathway that you tread upon </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're doing things right.</v>

1413
01:22:35.781 --> 01:22:37.790
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's wisdom.</v>

1414
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:44.500
<v Speaker 4>That's the line between chaos and order </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're supposed to be on </v>

1415
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:44.500
<v Speaker 4>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1416
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:48.611
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very thin line because if you're a </v>

1417
01:22:48.611 --> 01:22:48.830
<v Speaker 4>little bit too far in one direction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's too much chaos and if you're a</v>

1418
01:22:48.831 --> 01:22:53.831
<v Speaker 4>little too far in the other direction </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's too much order and both of </v>

1419
01:22:53.831 --> 01:22:53.831
<v Speaker 4>those aren't good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has the balance,</v>

1420
01:22:53.831 --> 01:22:58.421
<v Speaker 4>has to be exactly right and you can feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and I truly believe you can feel </v>

1421
01:22:58.421 --> 01:22:59.570
<v Speaker 4>that and I think it's your deepest </v>
<v Speaker 4>instinct.</v>

1422
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:01.790
<v Speaker 4>It's your deepest instinct that I mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1423
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:05.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean that biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean that metaphorically.</v>

1424
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:10.350
<v Speaker 4>I think that your psyche is arranged to </v>
<v Speaker 4>exist in a cosmos that's composed of </v>

1425
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:15.990
<v Speaker 4>chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's why you have the </v>

1426
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:15.990
<v Speaker 4>hemispheric structure that you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1427
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:20.160
<v Speaker 4>This is deeper than metaphor and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you feel as if you're meaningfully </v>

1428
01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:24.520
<v Speaker 4>engaged in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the terror of your mortality strips</v>

1429
01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:28.180
<v Speaker 4>away and you're engaged and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>timeless,</v>

1430
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:33.630
<v Speaker 4>that's the deepest instinct you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling you that you're in the right </v>

1431
01:23:33.630 --> 01:23:38.101
<v Speaker 4>place at the right time and then what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you do is practice being their practice </v>

1432
01:23:38.101 --> 01:23:42.901
<v Speaker 4>being there and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That narrow spot that's so difficult to </v>

1433
01:23:42.901 --> 01:23:42.901
<v Speaker 4>find.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wander around it,</v>

1434
01:23:42.901 --> 01:23:44.410
<v Speaker 4>maybe if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can watch,</v>

1435
01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.120
<v Speaker 4>you can watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an experiment.</v>

1436
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:51.360
<v Speaker 4>Watch yourself for two weeks like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know who you are because you </v>

1437
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:51.360
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

1438
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.440
<v Speaker 4>So watch yourself for two weeks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>notice there's gonna be times when </v>

1439
01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.510
<v Speaker 4>things are proper there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>raid properly for you.</v>

1440
01:23:57.010 --> 01:23:59.470
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy to notice because when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're arrayed like that,</v>

1441
01:23:59.471 --> 01:24:01.670
<v Speaker 4>you're so engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't exactly notice,</v>

1442
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:02.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you'll see,</v>

1443
01:24:02.921 --> 01:24:04.150
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the right place.</v>

1444
01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:04.900
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1445
01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:07.810
<v Speaker 4>how'd I get here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I doing right?</v>

1446
01:24:08.630 --> 01:24:13.630
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is it that this could happen more </v>

1447
01:24:13.630 --> 01:24:13.630
<v Speaker 4>often?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like this to happen more often.</v>

1448
01:24:13.630 --> 01:24:15.550
<v Speaker 4>How would I have to conduct myself in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order for that to happen more often,</v>

1449
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
<v Speaker 4>and then you practice that and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe instead of 10 minutes a month or </v>

1450
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.330
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like 15 minutes a day and then it's</v>

1451
01:24:22.331 --> 01:24:25.540
<v Speaker 4>half an hour a day and then it's an hour</v>
<v Speaker 4>a day and then it's four hours a day and</v>

1452
01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:28.270
<v Speaker 4>maybe if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're extraordinarily careful,</v>

1453
01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:33.220
<v Speaker 4>then you get to a point where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that a good proportion of the time,</v>

1454
01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:40.520
<v Speaker 4>because straight is the gate and narrow </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the way which leadeth unto life and </v>

1455
01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.641
<v Speaker 4>few there be that find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were a false prophets which come to </v>

1456
01:24:45.091 --> 01:24:47.880
<v Speaker 4>you in sheep's clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</v>

1457
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:51.420
<v Speaker 4>That's particularly good advice for </v>
<v Speaker 4>today's political situation.</v>

1458
01:24:51.421 --> 01:24:52.080
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you,</v>

1459
01:24:54.570 --> 01:24:58.310
<v Speaker 4>you shall know them by their fruits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do men gather grapes,</v>

1460
01:24:58.311 --> 01:25:03.311
<v Speaker 4>have thorns or figs of thistles even so </v>
<v Speaker 4>every good tree bringeth forth good </v>

1461
01:25:03.471 --> 01:25:08.471
<v Speaker 4>fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a corrupt tree bring forth evil </v>

1462
01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:08.471
<v Speaker 4>fruit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1463
01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:13.271
<v Speaker 4>that's what I learned from studying the </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of totalitarianism in the 20th </v>

1464
01:25:13.271 --> 01:25:17.291
<v Speaker 4>century is that a corrupt tree brings </v>
<v Speaker 4>forth evil fruit and that's for sure.</v>

1465
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:25.550
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know people who think when they're </v>

1466
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:28.640
<v Speaker 4>thinking about the relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>divinity or their relationship with God,</v>

1467
01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.270
<v Speaker 4>they think it's a primitive and childish</v>
<v Speaker 4>way of thinking.</v>

1468
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:37.570
<v Speaker 4>What if a miracle just manifest?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why kind a miracle just manifest itself </v>

1469
01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:38.390
<v Speaker 4>and I would be convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the funny thing is,</v>

1470
01:25:38.391 --> 01:25:41.270
<v Speaker 4>is first of all actually you wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a miracle actually happened,</v>

1471
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:43.790
<v Speaker 4>you would actually forget about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>about six months,</v>

1472
01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.710
<v Speaker 4>that's I mean you'd think that's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>

1473
01:25:45.711 --> 01:25:50.711
<v Speaker 4>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would actually forget about it </v>

1474
01:25:50.711 --> 01:25:51.320
<v Speaker 4>because that's what people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are negative miracles that are</v>

1475
01:25:51.321 --> 01:25:55.010
<v Speaker 4>happening all the time which actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>lend some credence to my supposition and</v>

1476
01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:00.160
<v Speaker 4>we don't pay any attention to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we can't learn from what happened in </v>

1477
01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.311
<v Speaker 4>the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we are absolutely incapable of </v>

1478
01:26:03.311 --> 01:26:06.131
<v Speaker 4>learning because what in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 4>century was as bitter a set of lessons </v>

1479
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:11.270
<v Speaker 4>as you could possibly imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's associated precisely with this.</v>

1480
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:13.940
<v Speaker 4>A corrupt tree bringeth forth evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>fruit.</v>

1481
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:16.100
<v Speaker 4>A good tree cannot bring forth evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>fruit.</v>

1482
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.590
<v Speaker 4>Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth </v>
<v Speaker 4>good fruit.</v>

1483
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Every tree that bringeth forth that </v>
<v Speaker 4>bringith not forth good fruit is hewn </v>

1484
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:31.390
<v Speaker 4>down and cast into the fire will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a flood motif right there.</v>

1485
01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:35.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're constantly the archetype</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the tree.</v>

1486
01:26:35.531 --> 01:26:38.570
<v Speaker 4>That's the archetype of being the </v>
<v Speaker 4>architect.</v>

1487
01:26:38.571 --> 01:26:39.640
<v Speaker 4>Of the self often,</v>

1488
01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.040
<v Speaker 4>what's the warning here is that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're mostly dead wood,</v>

1489
01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:52.640
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to burn up and you can </v>

1490
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:52.640
<v Speaker 4>think about that metaphysical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>

1491
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.530
<v Speaker 4>You can project that into eternity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can think about that as a form of </v>

1492
01:26:57.530 --> 01:27:01.341
<v Speaker 4>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the funny thing is is that when </v>

1493
01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:03.501
<v Speaker 4>that's happening to you in real time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is like an eternity in hell.</v>

1494
01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:05.970
<v Speaker 4>It's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it,</v>

1495
01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:09.000
<v Speaker 4>but you can strip the metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 4>elements off and you can say,</v>

1496
01:27:09.001 --> 01:27:11.670
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're mostly dead wood,</v>

1497
01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:16.650
<v Speaker 4>then a spark will light you on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's also very much worth thinking</v>

1498
01:27:16.651 --> 01:27:19.560
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wherefore by their fruits shall you know</v>

1499
01:27:19.561 --> 01:27:22.410
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not everyone that say a fun to me,</v>

1500
01:27:22.411 --> 01:27:27.030
<v Speaker 4>Lord shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he that doeth the will of my father,</v>

1501
01:27:27.031 --> 01:27:32.031
<v Speaker 4>which is in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting line.</v>

1502
01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:32.640
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1503
01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:36.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean one of the proper critiques of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Traditional Christianity.</v>

1504
01:27:36.901 --> 01:27:41.901
<v Speaker 4>Maybe this is the sort of critique that </v>
<v Speaker 4>needs you to put forth was that </v>

1505
01:27:41.901 --> 01:27:44.250
<v Speaker 4>Christianity had degenerated and its </v>
<v Speaker 4>moral mission.</v>

1506
01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:47.640
<v Speaker 4>Young was a little bit more sympathetic </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll tell you why in a minute,</v>

1507
01:27:47.641 --> 01:27:52.641
<v Speaker 4>but niches idea was that Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 4>had lost its way when it generated the </v>

1508
01:27:53.911 --> 01:27:58.911
<v Speaker 4>presupposition that humanity was saved </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some final sense by the sacrifice of </v>

1509
01:28:01.501 --> 01:28:06.501
<v Speaker 4>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It meant that the work was already done </v>

1510
01:28:06.501 --> 01:28:06.501
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm,</v>

1511
01:28:06.501 --> 01:28:11.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm being harsh in my judgment for the </v>

1512
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:15.831
<v Speaker 4>purpose of rhetorical simplification,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the idea was that if you just </v>

1513
01:28:15.901 --> 01:28:18.180
<v Speaker 4>professed faith that that had already </v>
<v Speaker 4>occurred,</v>

1514
01:28:18.181 --> 01:28:22.410
<v Speaker 4>then you were granted eternal salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1515
01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:28.640
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not so straightforward and I think </v>

1516
01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:28.640
<v Speaker 4>that that's what this line actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>represents.</v>

1517
01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:32.391
<v Speaker 4>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you enter into the Kingdom of </v>

1518
01:28:32.391 --> 01:28:33.880
<v Speaker 4>Heaven?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

1519
01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:38.940
<v Speaker 4>you can think about that under the </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspect of eternity or you can think </v>

1520
01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:41.580
<v Speaker 4>about it as a psychological statement </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the answer is quite straightforward,</v>

1521
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.980
<v Speaker 4>is that</v>

1522
01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:43.570
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

1523
01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:50.900
<v Speaker 4>do what Noah did to make him immune from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the flood and that's to walk with God </v>

1524
01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:57.380
<v Speaker 4>and that's what this sermon is about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's laying out the practical elements </v>

1525
01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:02.271
<v Speaker 4>of that and the practical elements are </v>
<v Speaker 4>aim at the highest possible.</v>

1526
01:29:03.391 --> 01:29:07.380
<v Speaker 4>Good and play that out in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then</v>

1527
01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:13.530
<v Speaker 4>you may have the opportunity to inhabit </v>
<v Speaker 4>the highest possible good that you're </v>

1528
01:29:13.530 --> 01:29:16.270
<v Speaker 4>positing into existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps not,</v>

1529
01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:19.870
<v Speaker 4>but you can't think of any more </v>
<v Speaker 4>practical way of going about that.</v>

1530
01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:25.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you build a house that maybe you can </v>

1531
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.110
<v Speaker 4>live in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't build a house,</v>

1532
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.110
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be able to live in </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1533
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.310
<v Speaker 4>If you build a good house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you'll be able to live in a house.</v>

1534
01:29:27.311 --> 01:29:32.311
<v Speaker 4>And if you build a perfect house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then maybe you can live in a perfect </v>

1535
01:29:32.311 --> 01:29:35.071
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you just say that the house has </v>

1536
01:29:35.071 --> 01:29:37.771
<v Speaker 4>already been built for you and that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can just say that the house is being </v>

1537
01:29:37.771 --> 01:29:42.241
<v Speaker 4>built for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then the probability that you're </v>

1538
01:29:42.241 --> 01:29:45.751
<v Speaker 4>going to be able to live where you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>to live is there's no probability that </v>

1539
01:29:45.751 --> 01:29:46.210
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be able to live where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to live.</v>

1540
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:49.390
<v Speaker 4>Many will say to me in that day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the judgment day.</v>

1541
01:29:49.391 --> 01:29:54.391
<v Speaker 4>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have we not prophesied in thy name and </v>

1542
01:29:54.391 --> 01:29:56.840
<v Speaker 4>the name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have cast out devils in the [inaudible] </v>

1543
01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:56.840
<v Speaker 4>name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>done many wonderful works.</v>

1544
01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.750
<v Speaker 4>And then I will profess unto them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never knew you,</v>

1545
01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:02.020
<v Speaker 4>depart from me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you that work iniquity.</v>

1546
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:05.660
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's judgment day.</v>

1547
01:30:05.661 --> 01:30:10.661
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an archetypal idea and partly </v>

1548
01:30:10.661 --> 01:30:15.631
<v Speaker 4>it's archetipal because everyday is </v>
<v Speaker 4>judgment day and the part of you that </v>

1549
01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.070
<v Speaker 4>the part of you that's equivalent to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>logo,</v>

1550
01:30:19.071 --> 01:30:21.650
<v Speaker 4>say the part of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your own ideal,</v>

1551
01:30:22.190 --> 01:30:26.060
<v Speaker 4>sits in eternal judgment on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequity,</v>

1552
01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:30.030
<v Speaker 4>and that's the con.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the source of guilt and shame and</v>

1553
01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:35.480
<v Speaker 4>and and withdrawal and then resentment </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then murderousness and then </v>

1554
01:30:37.081 --> 01:30:42.081
<v Speaker 4>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because you can intuit the ideal </v>

1555
01:30:43.481 --> 01:30:48.481
<v Speaker 4>and the problem with intuiting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ideal is that an ideal is always a </v>

1556
01:30:48.481 --> 01:30:48.481
<v Speaker 4>judge.</v>

1557
01:30:48.630 --> 01:30:53.630
<v Speaker 4>There are no difference between an ideal</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the judge and so you're eternally </v>

1558
01:30:53.630 --> 01:30:53.790
<v Speaker 4>judged by your own ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have no idea,</v>

1559
01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:56.370
<v Speaker 4>well then you've got no direction and no</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning in your life.</v>

1560
01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:59.280
<v Speaker 4>And then of course the more extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ideal,</v>

1561
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:03.690
<v Speaker 4>the harsher the judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's actually why young young was very</v>

1562
01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:08.691
<v Speaker 4>curious about why the book of revelation</v>
<v Speaker 4>was tacked onto the Bible because the </v>

1563
01:31:08.691 --> 01:31:11.910
<v Speaker 4>book of revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a very weird book and you know in</v>

1564
01:31:11.911 --> 01:31:12.930
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Gospels,</v>

1565
01:31:12.931 --> 01:31:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Christ is I would say perhaps primarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>merciful.</v>

1566
01:31:15.931 --> 01:31:20.931
<v Speaker 4>There,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a maybe a war in his character </v>

1567
01:31:20.931 --> 01:31:24.231
<v Speaker 4>between truth and mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of the two perhaps mercy </v>

1568
01:31:24.231 --> 01:31:27.740
<v Speaker 4>and Young's observation was the gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ was to merciful and that's why </v>

1569
01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:31.800
<v Speaker 4>the book of revelation was tapped on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tacked onto the new testament because in</v>

1570
01:31:31.801 --> 01:31:33.510
<v Speaker 4>the book of revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ,</v>

1571
01:31:33.511 --> 01:31:35.790
<v Speaker 4>who's the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's above the pyramid,</v>

1572
01:31:35.791 --> 01:31:40.791
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The transcendent ideal is nothing but a </v>

1573
01:31:40.791 --> 01:31:43.521
<v Speaker 4>judge and everyone fails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course the ultimate ideal is the </v>

1574
01:31:43.521 --> 01:31:48.291
<v Speaker 4>ultimate judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the archetypal reality </v>

1575
01:31:48.291 --> 01:31:48.291
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can say,</v>

1576
01:31:48.291 --> 01:31:51.711
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be judged and so I'll </v>

1577
01:31:51.711 --> 01:31:51.711
<v Speaker 4>dispense with the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then your cane,</v>

1578
01:31:51.711 --> 01:31:54.000
<v Speaker 4>because cane is exactly the person who </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispenses with the ideal.</v>

1579
01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:59.660
<v Speaker 4>And so there's no escaping from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no escaping from eternal </v>

1580
01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.060
<v Speaker 4>judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the archetypal story.</v>

1581
01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:08.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people put a lot of work into these </v>

1582
01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:08.300
<v Speaker 4>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1583
01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:09.630
<v Speaker 4>and there's thousands of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't messing around.</v>

1584
01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:13.030
<v Speaker 4>These are serious pieces of work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1585
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:18.120
<v Speaker 4>we don't understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that the people </v>

1586
01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:18.120
<v Speaker 4>who created them didn't know what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were doing.</v>

1587
01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.820
<v Speaker 4>These were geniuses who created these </v>
<v Speaker 4>pieces of work.</v>

1588
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:26.000
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they understood in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>articulated manner exactly what they </v>

1589
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.270
<v Speaker 4>were trying to represent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what they were representing,</v>

1590
01:32:27.271 --> 01:32:30.030
<v Speaker 4>where the metaphor is at the core of our</v>
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>

1591
01:32:30.031 --> 01:32:32.850
<v Speaker 4>to the degree that our culture is </v>
<v Speaker 4>functional and good.</v>

1592
01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:38.300
<v Speaker 4>These are the metaphors upon which it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>founded and they're not for the faint of</v>

1593
01:32:39.121 --> 01:32:39.920
<v Speaker 4>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1594
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:42.600
<v Speaker 4>you say religion is the opiate of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>masses.</v>

1595
01:32:42.601 --> 01:32:43.170
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1596
01:32:43.171 --> 01:32:46.130
<v Speaker 4>Then how do you explain this exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1597
01:32:46.150 --> 01:32:49.680
<v Speaker 4>because if it was opiates hereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might just get rid of that panel.</v>

1598
01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:59.520
<v Speaker 4>Especially when.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing that's so interesting </v>

1599
01:32:59.520 --> 01:32:59.520
<v Speaker 4>about the proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at revelations,</v>

1600
01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.000
<v Speaker 4>revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you look at the judgment,</v>

1601
01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:06.070
<v Speaker 4>almost everyone ends up on the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>side of this panel.</v>

1602
01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:10.540
<v Speaker 4>So if you were just conjuring up some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of pathetic wish fulfillment,</v>

1603
01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:16.260
<v Speaker 4>why in the world would you tilt the </v>
<v Speaker 4>scales in that manner you think that's </v>

1604
01:33:16.751 --> 01:33:19.360
<v Speaker 4>supposed to make people feel good?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

1605
01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:24.420
<v Speaker 4>There's almost nothing about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>picture that should make people feel </v>

1606
01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:26.500
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should if you understand it properly,</v>

1607
01:33:26.501 --> 01:33:29.020
<v Speaker 4>it should terrify you to the depths of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your soul.</v>

1608
01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:33.100
<v Speaker 4>That's what the picture is for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Therefore,</v>

1609
01:33:33.101 --> 01:33:35.410
<v Speaker 4>whoever hears these sayings of mine and </v>
<v Speaker 4>do with them,</v>

1610
01:33:35.411 --> 01:33:39.580
<v Speaker 4>I will liken him unto a wise man which </v>
<v Speaker 4>built his house upon a rock and the rain</v>

1611
01:33:39.581 --> 01:33:44.581
<v Speaker 4>descended and the winds blew and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>floods came and beat upon the house and </v>

1612
01:33:44.581 --> 01:33:48.781
<v Speaker 4>it fell not for it was founded upon a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rock and everyone that hears these </v>

1613
01:33:50.881 --> 01:33:55.881
<v Speaker 4>sayings of mine and do with them not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'll be likened unto a foolish man </v>

1614
01:33:55.881 --> 01:33:59.120
<v Speaker 4>which built his house upon the sand and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rain descended and the floods came </v>

1615
01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:00.690
<v Speaker 4>and the winds blew and beat upon that </v>
<v Speaker 4>house and it,</v>

1616
01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:02.670
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1617
01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.880
<v Speaker 4>I made a mistake and it fell for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was founded upon the sand and it came</v>

1618
01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:11.970
<v Speaker 4>to pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a very interesting line.</v>

1619
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.340
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really know now,</v>

1620
01:34:14.341 --> 01:34:19.341
<v Speaker 4>and then you run across lines in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly happens in biblical </v>

1621
01:34:19.951 --> 01:34:24.951
<v Speaker 4>settings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You run across lines that you cannot </v>

1622
01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:27.351
<v Speaker 4>believe actually exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot imagine how someone could </v>

1623
01:34:27.351 --> 01:34:31.331
<v Speaker 4>have imagined up and conjured up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>line and and these two lines are like </v>

1624
01:34:31.331 --> 01:34:32.910
<v Speaker 4>that as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it came to pass when Jesus had ended</v>

1625
01:34:32.911 --> 01:34:36.540
<v Speaker 4>these sayings that people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>astonished at his doctrine for he taught</v>

1626
01:34:36.541 --> 01:34:39.510
<v Speaker 4>them as one having authority and not as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the scribes.</v>

1627
01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.080
<v Speaker 4>And that's something so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that was another thing that </v>

1628
01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.710
<v Speaker 4>really I didn't really appreciate about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the churches that I attended to and that</v>

1629
01:34:46.711 --> 01:34:51.711
<v Speaker 4>would be that the lessons were taught by</v>
<v Speaker 4>scribes and the words were mouthed,</v>

1630
01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:54.450
<v Speaker 4>but there was no power in them.</v>

1631
01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:56.130
<v Speaker 4>There was no meaning in them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1632
01:34:56.330 --> 01:34:58.340
<v Speaker 4>it was as if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1633
01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.160
<v Speaker 4>it was like when I was 20 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I was saying all these things,</v>

1634
01:35:01.161 --> 01:35:02.360
<v Speaker 4>I didn't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1635
01:35:02.361 --> 01:35:04.070
<v Speaker 4>they were words that sounded good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

1636
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:08.120
<v Speaker 4>like gilded cloth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose that you can that you can wrap</v>

1637
01:35:08.121 --> 01:35:13.121
<v Speaker 4>around yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there no substance to them and </v>

1638
01:35:13.121 --> 01:35:16.151
<v Speaker 4>there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>listening to something that has </v>

1639
01:35:16.151 --> 01:35:19.100
<v Speaker 4>substance and listening to something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is spoken because it sounds like it</v>

1640
01:35:19.101 --> 01:35:24.101
<v Speaker 4>should sound good and this line says </v>
<v Speaker 4>that whoever spoke the lines that we </v>

1641
01:35:24.101 --> 01:35:29.051
<v Speaker 4>just described was someone who sounded </v>
<v Speaker 4>like he knew what he was talking about </v>

1642
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:34.670
<v Speaker 4>and not someone who is just repeating </v>
<v Speaker 4>something for the sake of sounding good,</v>

1643
01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:40.240
<v Speaker 4>and it certainly seems to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lines that we just reviewed have the </v>

1644
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 4>awesome impact of authority</v>

1645
01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:48.970
<v Speaker 3>act to noah,</v>

1646
01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:51.710
<v Speaker 4>but Noah found grace in the eyes of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord.</v>

1647
01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:57.130
<v Speaker 4>These are the generations of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Noah was a just man and perfect in his </v>

1648
01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:57.980
<v Speaker 4>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Noah walked with God,</v>

1649
01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:00.080
<v Speaker 4>and Noah begat three sons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shem,</v>

1650
01:36:00.081 --> 01:36:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Ham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Japheth.</v>

1651
01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:05.840
<v Speaker 4>The Earth was also corrupt before God </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the earth was full of violence,</v>

1652
01:36:05.841 --> 01:36:10.220
<v Speaker 4>filled with violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any of you see the new NRA ad?</v>

1653
01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.360
<v Speaker 4>You might want to look that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's the most shocking </v>

1654
01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:22.360
<v Speaker 4>manifestation of political polarization </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the United States that I've yet seen.</v>

1655
01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:25.420
<v Speaker 4>Most of it I've seen on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real.</v>

1656
01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.670
<v Speaker 4>What's shocked me mostly has been on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

1657
01:36:28.150 --> 01:36:31.300
<v Speaker 4>but the new NRA ad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a whole new thing.</v>

1658
01:36:31.301 --> 01:36:35.500
<v Speaker 4>So it's this attractive woman doing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>voiceover.</v>

1659
01:36:35.501 --> 01:36:38.230
<v Speaker 4>She kind of looks like Demi Moore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although she's Kinda tough looking.</v>

1660
01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:43.440
<v Speaker 4>I guess Demi Moore could look tough now </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then and she has contempt on her </v>

1661
01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.701
<v Speaker 4>face and that's a dangerous thing and in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the background there's nothing but </v>

1662
01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:55.060
<v Speaker 4>images of antifa riots and Berkeley </v>
<v Speaker 4>riots and fire and protest and she's </v>

1663
01:36:59.151 --> 01:37:04.151
<v Speaker 4>describing that is a conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially a conspiracy that involves </v>

1664
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:07.310
<v Speaker 4>the intellectual elite including </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood,</v>

1665
01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:12.311
<v Speaker 4>which is named by name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The accusation is that there is a cabal </v>

1666
01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:14.590
<v Speaker 4>of</v>

1667
01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.020
<v Speaker 4>corrupt intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1668
01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.790
<v Speaker 4>who are bringing the country to its </v>
<v Speaker 4>knees and that it's time to get your God</v>

1669
01:37:23.791 --> 01:37:28.791
<v Speaker 4>damn guns and so look up that and see </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you think because</v>

1670
01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:37.860
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of people who would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfectly happy if that was the </v>

1671
01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:39.160
<v Speaker 4>direction in which we're headed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I'm hoping is</v>

1672
01:37:39.161 --> 01:37:41.620
<v Speaker 4>that we might be able to talk our way </v>
<v Speaker 4>through it,</v>

1673
01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:46.610
<v Speaker 4>but we're in a situation where every act</v>
<v Speaker 4>of interview,</v>

1674
01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.760
<v Speaker 4>individual idiocy will push us one iota </v>
<v Speaker 4>closer to the break and that'll make the</v>

1675
01:37:54.671 --> 01:37:59.671
<v Speaker 4>15 of the population or 30 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the population who would love to see </v>

1676
01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:04.791
<v Speaker 4>everything degenerated into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfectly happy because that's their </v>

1677
01:38:04.791 --> 01:38:07.100
<v Speaker 4>aim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Theory.</v>

1678
01:38:07.110 --> 01:38:12.110
<v Speaker 4>Salsa was corrupt before God and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth was filled with violence and God </v>

1679
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:15.411
<v Speaker 4>looked upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And behold it was corrupt for all flesh </v>

1680
01:38:15.411 --> 01:38:15.900
<v Speaker 4>is corrupted his way upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Noah said,</v>

1681
01:38:15.901 --> 01:38:19.110
<v Speaker 4>and God said unto Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the end of all flesh has come before me.</v>

1682
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:21.240
<v Speaker 4>For the earth is filled with violence </v>
<v Speaker 4>through them.</v>

1683
01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:23.280
<v Speaker 4>And behold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will destroy them with the earth.</v>

1684
01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:28.740
<v Speaker 4>Make the an ark of gopher wood rooms </v>
<v Speaker 4>shalt thou make in the arch,</v>

1685
01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:32.100
<v Speaker 4>and then pitch it within and without </v>
<v Speaker 4>with pitch.</v>

1686
01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:34.530
<v Speaker 4>And this is the fashion which thou shalt</v>
<v Speaker 4>make of it.</v>

1687
01:38:34.650 --> 01:38:35.770
<v Speaker 4>The length of the Ark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shelby,</v>

1688
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:37.380
<v Speaker 4>300 cubits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the breadth of it.</v>

1689
01:38:37.381 --> 01:38:40.990
<v Speaker 4>50 cubits and the height of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 cubits and window shelf.</v>

1690
01:38:40.991 --> 01:38:45.991
<v Speaker 4>They'll make to the arc in a cubit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shelldale finishing above and the door </v>

1691
01:38:45.991 --> 01:38:49.401
<v Speaker 4>and the art shelters set in the side </v>
<v Speaker 4>there or with lower second and third </v>

1692
01:38:49.401 --> 01:38:50.670
<v Speaker 4>stories shall make it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and behold,</v>

1693
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:56.660
<v Speaker 4>I even I do bring a flood of waters upon</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth to destroy all flesh wherein </v>

1694
01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:00.800
<v Speaker 4>is the breath of life from under heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything that is in the earth shall </v>

1695
01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.731
<v Speaker 4>die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with the I will establish my </v>

1696
01:39:04.731 --> 01:39:05.160
<v Speaker 4>covenant and now she'll come into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ark,</v>

1697
01:39:05.161 --> 01:39:08.090
<v Speaker 4>thou and thy sons and a wife and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>sons wives with the.</v>

1698
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:12.270
<v Speaker 4>That's a fairly optimistic twist on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>story because not only is it noah,</v>

1699
01:39:12.271 --> 01:39:17.271
<v Speaker 4>but he gets to save his whole family and</v>
<v Speaker 4>down a couple of generations and so </v>

1700
01:39:17.271 --> 01:39:21.030
<v Speaker 4>that's a good thing to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like as things you know,</v>

1701
01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:26.330
<v Speaker 4>I had this client and she had a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard upbringing.</v>

1702
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:32.990
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a lot of encouragement to say the </v>

1703
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:35.631
<v Speaker 4>least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say a fair bit of discouragement </v>

1704
01:39:35.631 --> 01:39:38.630
<v Speaker 4>and she had a son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what was really interesting about </v>

1705
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:44.390
<v Speaker 4>her in relationship to her son is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the things that she could have </v>

1706
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:47.841
<v Speaker 4>learned to do to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given her extensive experience with </v>

1707
01:39:47.841 --> 01:39:52.460
<v Speaker 4>being made as miserable as possible by </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who was hell bent on bringing </v>

1708
01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:53.010
<v Speaker 4>her to her knees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she refused to do,</v>

1709
01:39:53.011 --> 01:39:54.390
<v Speaker 4>to respond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1710
01:39:54.391 --> 01:39:58.290
<v Speaker 4>She learned the opposite lesson from all</v>
<v Speaker 4>her misery and tournament,</v>

1711
01:39:58.291 --> 01:40:00.900
<v Speaker 4>which was not to move that forward down </v>
<v Speaker 4>the generations.</v>

1712
01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:05.900
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea here is that if you walk</v>
<v Speaker 4>properly and aimed properly and act </v>

1713
01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:10.170
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you walk with God in this manner that</v>

1714
01:40:10.171 --> 01:40:13.080
<v Speaker 4>we've been discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that perhaps that isn't only good for</v>

1715
01:40:13.081 --> 01:40:18.081
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps it's also the thing that will </v>

1716
01:40:18.081 --> 01:40:20.001
<v Speaker 4>save your family and then by implication</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps save society because that's </v>

1717
01:40:20.001 --> 01:40:21.660
<v Speaker 4>exactly what happens with Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1718
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:24.690
<v Speaker 4>First attempt and then it's his family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everything else goes.</v>

1719
01:40:25.110 --> 01:40:30.110
<v Speaker 4>And so by saving himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by acting properly and by saving his </v>

1720
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:31.770
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he actually saves the world.</v>

1721
01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:34.110
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1722
01:40:34.111 --> 01:40:39.111
<v Speaker 4>like the most profound people that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>read who've meditated deeply on the </v>

1723
01:40:39.111 --> 01:40:41.400
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say of totalitarian catastrophe.</v>

1724
01:40:41.401 --> 01:40:44.100
<v Speaker 4>And I would put Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the top of that list,</v>

1725
01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:46.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit the his,</v>

1726
01:40:46.530 --> 01:40:50.850
<v Speaker 4>his entire Corpus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three volume 700 pages long.</v>

1727
01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:55.880
<v Speaker 4>Each in tiny type is a long scream about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the absolute necessity of individual,</v>

1728
01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:05.960
<v Speaker 4>the absolute necessity of individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>honesty and ethical behavior as the only</v>

1729
01:41:07.441 --> 01:41:10.170
<v Speaker 4>bulwark against totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe.</v>

1730
01:41:10.730 --> 01:41:15.730
<v Speaker 4>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've read many writers who've </v>

1731
01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:18.560
<v Speaker 4>attempted to diagnose the problems of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 20th century and I think units.</v>

1732
01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:19.700
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1733
01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:26.690
<v Speaker 4>he came to the same conclusions that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Victor Frankel came to as a consequence </v>

1734
01:41:26.690 --> 01:41:29.730
<v Speaker 4>of his experiences in the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentration camps and Frankel.</v>

1735
01:41:30.170 --> 01:41:35.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm also an admirer of Frankl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but soldier knits and takes it to an </v>

1736
01:41:35.170 --> 01:41:38.451
<v Speaker 4>entire different level of profundity and</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes an extraordinarily strong case </v>

1737
01:41:38.451 --> 01:41:42.771
<v Speaker 4>that not only do societies deteriorate </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the people within the societies </v>

1738
01:41:43.921 --> 01:41:48.921
<v Speaker 4>become individually corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that the only way to stave that off </v>

1739
01:41:48.921 --> 01:41:53.000
<v Speaker 4>is for the individuals within that </v>
<v Speaker 4>society to reject that corruption in </v>

1740
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.921
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the confines of their own personal </v>

1741
01:41:56.921 --> 01:41:58.671
<v Speaker 4>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he tells endless stories of people </v>

1742
01:41:58.671 --> 01:41:59.670
<v Speaker 4>that he met in the Gulag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the work camps,</v>

1743
01:41:59.671 --> 01:42:02.070
<v Speaker 4>in the death camps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Soviet Union of people.</v>

1744
01:42:02.071 --> 01:42:07.071
<v Speaker 4>And this is what he learned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If people who are so incredibly tough </v>

1745
01:42:07.071 --> 01:42:10.470
<v Speaker 4>that even under conditions the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible extreme conditions,</v>

1746
01:42:11.010 --> 01:42:16.010
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't a chance that they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to step off that straight narrow </v>

1747
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.010
<v Speaker 4>line.</v>

1748
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:20.390
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing the authorities could </v>
<v Speaker 4>do to move them and just watching that </v>

1749
01:42:21.331 --> 01:42:26.331
<v Speaker 4>was enough to transform soldier knits </v>
<v Speaker 4>and because of course one of the things </v>

1750
01:42:26.331 --> 01:42:29.301
<v Speaker 4>he wondered was after spending a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of time in the work camps was </v>

1751
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.140
<v Speaker 4>well just exactly how did I get here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't well,</v>

1752
01:42:34.170 --> 01:42:36.120
<v Speaker 4>it was Hitler's fault and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] fault.</v>

1753
01:42:36.121 --> 01:42:41.121
<v Speaker 4>Although it was definitely the fault of </v>
<v Speaker 4>both of them for social incident was </v>

1754
01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:44.800
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was also his fault because he was </v>

1755
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:44.850
<v Speaker 4>playing the same game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just wasn't as good at it.</v>

1756
01:42:46.770 --> 01:42:51.770
<v Speaker 4>And of every living thing of all flesh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two of every sort shall they'll bring </v>

1757
01:42:51.770 --> 01:42:51.770
<v Speaker 4>into the ark to keep them alive with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1758
01:42:51.770 --> 01:42:55.010
<v Speaker 4>They shall be male and female.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the they.</v>

1759
01:42:55.320 --> 01:43:00.320
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's another message in this story </v>

1760
01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.181
<v Speaker 4>which is that it isn't only Noah and his</v>
<v Speaker 4>family and human society that's </v>

1761
01:43:02.861 --> 01:43:07.210
<v Speaker 4>dependent on Noah's appropriate actions </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>

1762
01:43:07.450 --> 01:43:12.450
<v Speaker 4>It's the entire living planet and in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>era of excessive and extreme and </v>

1763
01:43:16.001 --> 01:43:21.001
<v Speaker 4>genuinely disingenuous environmental </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophizing,</v>

1764
01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:24.540
<v Speaker 4>that's something to consider very </v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously.</v>

1765
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:30.510
<v Speaker 4>Think perhaps there's nothing better </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can do for everything.</v>

1766
01:43:35.071 --> 01:43:40.071
<v Speaker 4>All things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including those things that are outside </v>

1767
01:43:40.071 --> 01:43:42.990
<v Speaker 4>the confines of human society than to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get your act together and align yourself</v>

1768
01:43:42.991 --> 01:43:46.500
<v Speaker 4>properly along all of the dimensions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your being,</v>

1769
01:43:46.501 --> 01:43:47.610
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

1770
01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:52.400
<v Speaker 4>from the tiniest microcosm to the to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>macrocosm,</v>

1771
01:43:52.401 --> 01:43:55.130
<v Speaker 4>and that's the way that all of being is </v>
<v Speaker 4>redeemed.</v>

1772
01:43:56.650 --> 01:44:01.130
<v Speaker 4>That's what the story suggests and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>read it.</v>

1773
01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:03.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cynical modern people.</v>

1774
01:44:03.381 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 4>We read it as if it was written by </v>
<v Speaker 4>primitive people who thought that it was</v>

1775
01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:12.290
<v Speaker 4>really the case that someone could build</v>
<v Speaker 4>a boat and put two of every kind into it</v>

1776
01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.090
<v Speaker 4>and thereby save the world.</v>

1777
01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:21.110
<v Speaker 4>It's embarrassing to see things </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpreted in a manner that shallow,</v>

1778
01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:25.400
<v Speaker 4>especially by people who don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>ignorance as a justification.</v>

1779
01:44:25.610 --> 01:44:30.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these stories have to appeal to </v>

1780
01:44:30.610 --> 01:44:30.610
<v Speaker 4>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1781
01:44:30.610 --> 01:44:33.220
<v Speaker 4>And there's lots of people in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>who aren't very bright and so they tend </v>

1782
01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:35.780
<v Speaker 4>to take things concretely like a child </v>
<v Speaker 4>would take things concretely if you read</v>

1783
01:44:35.781 --> 01:44:38.360
<v Speaker 4>them a story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this story can be taken concretely,</v>

1784
01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:41.240
<v Speaker 4>but it has to be because the stories </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to be for everyone.</v>

1785
01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:46.241
<v Speaker 4>But if you're a sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean that you should </v>

1786
01:44:46.241 --> 01:44:46.910
<v Speaker 4>dismiss it as if it's written for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>child.</v>

1787
01:44:46.911 --> 01:44:50.330
<v Speaker 4>It's maybe you have the obligation to </v>
<v Speaker 4>look a bit deeper and think for a moment</v>

1788
01:44:50.331 --> 01:44:55.331
<v Speaker 4>that it wouldn't be conserved for these </v>
<v Speaker 4>many thousands of years if there wasn't </v>

1789
01:44:55.331 --> 01:44:58.751
<v Speaker 4>something more to it than a casual </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual dismissal would indicate </v>

1790
01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.440
<v Speaker 4>and take the onto the of all food that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is eaten and thou shalt gather it to the</v>

1791
01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:06.110
<v Speaker 4>shelby food for the end for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thus did noah.</v>

1792
01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:10.580
<v Speaker 4>According to all that God commanded him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So did he.</v>

1793
01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:14.900
<v Speaker 4>And the Lord said unto Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come down and all the house into the arc</v>

1794
01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:19.400
<v Speaker 4>for the I've seen righteous before me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In this generation of every clean beast,</v>

1795
01:45:20.530 --> 01:45:25.530
<v Speaker 4>thou shalt take to the by sevens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The male and female and obesity are </v>

1796
01:45:25.530 --> 01:45:26.470
<v Speaker 4>clean but not cleaned by to the male and</v>
<v Speaker 4>female and,</v>

1797

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>follows also of the error by sevens,</v>

1798
01:45:28.571 --> 01:45:33.400
<v Speaker 4>the male and the female to keep seed </v>
<v Speaker 4>alive upon the face of all the earth for</v>

1799
01:45:33.401 --> 01:45:36.460
<v Speaker 4>yet seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will cause it to rain upon the earth.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Forty days and 40 nights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And every living substance that I have </v>

1801
01:45:41.461 --> 01:45:41.461

<v Speaker 4>the earth.</v>

1802
01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:44.950
<v Speaker 4>And Noah did according unto all that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord commanded him.</v>

1803
01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:50.140
<v Speaker 4>And Noah was 600 years old when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>flood of waters was upon the earth.</v>

1804
01:45:51.010 --> 01:45:56.010
<v Speaker 4>And Noah went in and his sons and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>wife and his sons wives with them into </v>

<v Speaker 4>of clean beasts and obese that are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>cleaning the fouls and have everything </v>

1807

<v Speaker 4>were opened and the rain was upon the </v>

1815

<v Speaker 1>the one that keeps you afloat during the</v>

<v Speaker 1>waters increased and bear up the ark and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was lifted up above the earth and the</v>

1830
01:47:27.501 --> 01:47:30.620
<v Speaker 1>waters prevailed and were increased </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly upon the earth.</v>

1831

<v Speaker 1>and all in whose nostrils was the breath</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life of all that was in the dry land,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Both man and cattle and the creeping </v>

1837
01:48:01.301 --> 01:48:04.961
<v Speaker 1>things in the fall of the heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were destroyed from the earth </v>

1838
01:48:04.961 --> 01:48:06.680
<v Speaker 1>and no only remained alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they that were with him in the Ark.</v>

1839
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:08.840
<v Speaker 1>And the water's prevailed upon the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

1840
01:48:09.090 --> 01:48:10.430
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 50 days.</v>

1841
01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:17.460
<v Speaker 1>And God remembered no on every living </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and all the capital that was with </v>

1842
01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:20.341
<v Speaker 1>him in the Ark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God made a wind to pass over the </v>

1843
01:48:20.341 --> 01:48:23.161
<v Speaker 1>earth and the waters receded the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fountains also of the deep and the </v>

1844
01:48:23.161 --> 01:48:28.141
<v Speaker 1>windows of heaven were stopped in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rain from heaven was restrained and </v>

1845
01:48:28.141 --> 01:48:28.141
<v Speaker 1>the water's returned from off the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually.</v>

1846
01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And after the end of 150 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waters were abated.</v>

1847
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:35.860
<v Speaker 1>And the Ark rested in the seventh month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Seventeenth Day of the month upon</v>

1848
01:48:35.861 --> 01:48:40.861
<v Speaker 1>the mountains of air rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the water's decreased continually </v>

1849
01:48:40.861 --> 01:48:43.711
<v Speaker 1>until the 10th month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10th month on the first day of the </v>

1850
01:48:43.711 --> 01:48:43.900
<v Speaker 1>month where the tops of the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

1851
01:48:45.490 --> 01:48:50.490
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass at the end of 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>days that Noah opened the window of the </v>

1852
01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Ark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he had made.</v>

1853
01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:54.481
<v Speaker 1>And he sent forth a raven which went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fro until the waters were dried up </v>

1854
01:48:54.481 --> 01:48:58.530
<v Speaker 1>from off the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also sent forth a dove from him </v>

1855
01:48:58.530 --> 01:48:59.620
<v Speaker 1>to see if the waters were abated from </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the face of the ground.</v>

1856
01:48:59.830 --> 01:49:02.110
<v Speaker 1>But the dove found no rest for the sole </v>
<v Speaker 1>of her foot.</v>

1857
01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:07.320
<v Speaker 1>And she returned unto him in the Ark for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waters on the face of the whole </v>

1858
01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:10.090
<v Speaker 1>earth that he put forth his hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>took her and pulled her in unto him into</v>

1859
01:49:10.091 --> 01:49:12.670
<v Speaker 1>the Ark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he stayed yet another seven days.</v>

1860
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sent forth the dove out of the Ark.</v>

1861
01:49:16.150 --> 01:49:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And the devil came into him in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evening and low in her mouth was an </v>

1862
01:49:21.150 --> 01:49:23.791
<v Speaker 1>olive leaf plucked off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no one knew that the waters were </v>

1863
01:49:23.791 --> 01:49:26.731
<v Speaker 1>abated from off the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he stayed there yet another seven </v>

1864
01:49:26.731 --> 01:49:30.701
<v Speaker 1>days and sent forth the dove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which returned not again onto him any </v>

1865
01:49:30.701 --> 01:49:33.611
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass in the 600th and </v>

1866
01:49:33.611 --> 01:49:36.611
<v Speaker 1>first year in the first month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first day of the month of waters </v>

1867
01:49:36.611 --> 01:49:40.090
<v Speaker 1>were dried up from off the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Noah removed the covering of the </v>

1868
01:49:40.090 --> 01:49:40.160
<v Speaker 1>orchid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked up and behold,</v>

1869
01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:41.930
<v Speaker 1>the face of the ground was dry.</v>

1870
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:47.680
<v Speaker 1>And in the second month on the seventh </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 20th day of the month was the dried.</v>

1871
01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:49.900
<v Speaker 1>And God spake unto Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1872
01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:55.140
<v Speaker 1>go forth of the arc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thou and thy wife and they sons and </v>

1873
01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:55.140
<v Speaker 1>their sons waves with the</v>

1874
01:49:55.530 --> 01:49:59.270
<v Speaker 1>bring forth with the every living thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is with the of all flesh,</v>

1875
01:49:59.510 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 1>both of fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of cattle and over every creeping </v>

1876
01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:06.851
<v Speaker 1>thing that creepeth upon the earth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they may breed abundantly in the earth </v>

1877
01:50:06.851 --> 01:50:08.030
<v Speaker 1>and be fruitful and multiply upon the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

1878
01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:11.210
<v Speaker 1>And Noah went forth and his sons and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and his sons wives with him.</v>

1879
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Every beast creeping thing every fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth </v>

1880
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:17.600
<v Speaker 1>after their kinds went forth out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ark.</v>

1881
01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:24.010
<v Speaker 1>And Noah building an altar unto the Lord</v>
<v Speaker 1>and took of every clean beast and of </v>

1882
01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:26.360
<v Speaker 1>every clean foul and offered burnt </v>
<v Speaker 1>offerings on the altar.</v>

1883
01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Immediate return to the sacrificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>motif.</v>

1884
01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord smelled a sweet savor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's new as proper sacrifice.</v>

1885
01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:43.800
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord said into his heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not again curse the ground </v>

1886
01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:47.221
<v Speaker 1>anymore for man's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the imagination of Man's heart is </v>

1887
01:50:47.221 --> 01:50:49.900
<v Speaker 1>evil from his youth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither will I again smite anymore.</v>

1888
01:50:49.901 --> 01:50:54.901
<v Speaker 1>Every living thing has I have done while</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Earth remaineth seed time and </v>

1889
01:50:54.901 --> 01:50:55.960
<v Speaker 1>harvest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold and heat in summer and winter,</v>

1890
01:50:56.470 --> 01:51:01.470
<v Speaker 1>day and night shall not cease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and God blessed Noah and his sons and </v>

1891
01:51:01.541 --> 01:51:06.541
<v Speaker 1>said unto them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fruitful and multiply and replenish </v>

1892
01:51:06.541 --> 01:51:09.361
<v Speaker 1>the earth and the fear of you and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dread of you shall be upon every beast </v>

1893
01:51:09.361 --> 01:51:13.471
<v Speaker 1>of the earth and upon every fowl of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>air upon all that moveth upon the earth,</v>

1894
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:16.870
<v Speaker 1>upon all the fishes of the sea into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand or they delivered.</v>

1895
01:51:25.630 --> 01:51:29.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard commentators,</v>

1896
01:51:29.741 --> 01:51:31.270
<v Speaker 1>David Suzuki,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1897
01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:39.760
<v Speaker 1>who claim that the substructure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western culture in lines such as this</v>

1898
01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:49.860
<v Speaker 1>deliver the earth over to human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and justify our ravaging of the,</v>

1899
01:51:52.110 --> 01:51:53.410
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being,</v>

1900
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:59.550
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful reading and it seems to me that </v>

1901
01:52:01.330 --> 01:52:06.330
<v Speaker 1>given such matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the importance of such matters </v>

1902
01:52:06.330 --> 01:52:07.000
<v Speaker 1>that are very close reading is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

1903
01:52:08.290 --> 01:52:13.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the story of Adam and Eve when Adam </v>

1904
01:52:13.290 --> 01:52:16.471
<v Speaker 1>and eve are thrown out of the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God tells eve that she's going to be </v>

1905
01:52:16.471 --> 01:52:18.940
<v Speaker 1>subordinated to her husband.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't say that.</v>

1906
01:52:18.941 --> 01:52:23.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what should happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that's what's going to happen,</v>

1907
01:52:23.890 --> 01:52:28.890
<v Speaker 1>and the same thing as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned is contained in lines like </v>

1908
01:52:28.890 --> 01:52:31.030
<v Speaker 1>this isn't necessarily that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that should happen.</v>

1909
01:52:31.031 --> 01:52:34.660
<v Speaker 1>It's something that did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite remarkable.</v>

1910
01:52:34.690 --> 01:52:39.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about how long ago these lions </v>

1911
01:52:39.690 --> 01:52:43.231
<v Speaker 1>were penned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't obvious until perhaps the 19 </v>

1912
01:52:43.231 --> 01:52:45.830
<v Speaker 1>sixties that we had dominated the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>so completely that it's very</v>

1913
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:51.340
<v Speaker 4>future existence was in our hands and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a prophetic element of this tale </v>

1914
01:52:55.220 --> 01:53:00.220
<v Speaker 4>and the fear of you and the dread of you</v>
<v Speaker 4>shall be upon every beast of the earth </v>

1915
01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:03.191
<v Speaker 4>and upon every fowl of the air and upon </v>
<v Speaker 4>all that moveth upon the earth and upon </v>

1916
01:53:03.191 --> 01:53:04.550
<v Speaker 4>all the fishes of the sea into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>

1917
01:53:04.551 --> 01:53:06.380
<v Speaker 4>Are they delivered?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1918
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:11.410
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every moving thing that lives shall be </v>

1919
01:53:11.410 --> 01:53:16.101
<v Speaker 4>meat for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even as the green herb I've given you </v>

1920
01:53:16.101 --> 01:53:18.441
<v Speaker 4>all things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have I given you all things but flesh </v>

1921
01:53:18.441 --> 01:53:18.570
<v Speaker 4>with the life therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the blood thereof,</v>

1922
01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:24.020
<v Speaker 4>shall you not eat and surely your blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>of your lives will I require at the hand</v>

1923
01:53:25.731 --> 01:53:30.731
<v Speaker 4>of every beast will I required in at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand of man at the hand of every man's </v>

1924
01:53:30.731 --> 01:53:33.320
<v Speaker 4>brother will I require the life of man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a hard section to interpret,</v>

1925
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:35.240
<v Speaker 4>but what it means is something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1926
01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:41.530
<v Speaker 4>God describes the dominion over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>planet that revivified humanity will </v>

1927
01:53:42.561 --> 01:53:47.561
<v Speaker 4>have and notes the power that goes along</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that and then puts a limitation on </v>

1928
01:53:48.711 --> 01:53:53.711
<v Speaker 4>it and the limitation is maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sanctity of life despite your power.</v>

1929
01:53:56.210 --> 01:54:01.210
<v Speaker 4>And although it's not easy to extract </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the manner in which this has been </v>

1930
01:54:01.521 --> 01:54:06.521
<v Speaker 4>translated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What God is telling Noah is that if you </v>

1931
01:54:06.521 --> 01:54:08.300
<v Speaker 4>kill yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you kill someone else,</v>

1932
01:54:08.301 --> 01:54:13.301
<v Speaker 4>and if any animal kills a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there will be a price to pay for </v>

1933
01:54:13.301 --> 01:54:17.501
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a an opportunity which is </v>

1934
01:54:17.501 --> 01:54:20.450
<v Speaker 4>that the descendants of Noah can </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominate the earth,</v>

1935
01:54:20.451 --> 01:54:23.570
<v Speaker 4>but there's a moral limitation placed on</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1936
01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:28.690
<v Speaker 4>Which is nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life itself is to be regarded as </v>

1937
01:54:28.730 --> 01:54:30.230
<v Speaker 4>sanctified and sacred.</v>

1938
01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:38.920
<v Speaker 4>Whoever shared with man's blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by man shall his blood be shed for in </v>

1939
01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:42.290
<v Speaker 4>the image of God made he man and you be </v>
<v Speaker 4>fruitful and multiply.</v>

1940
01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:47.380
<v Speaker 4>Bring forth abundantly in the earth and </v>
<v Speaker 4>multiply their in and God spake to Noah </v>

1941
01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:53.760
<v Speaker 4>and to his sons with him saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I behold I establish my covenant </v>

1942
01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:57.631
<v Speaker 4>with you and with your seat after you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and with every living creature that is </v>

1943
01:54:57.631 --> 01:54:57.790
<v Speaker 4>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have the fall in the cattle and to every</v>

1944
01:54:57.791 --> 01:55:00.560
<v Speaker 4>beast of earth that is with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For all that.</v>

1945
01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:02.620
<v Speaker 4>Go out of the Ark to every beast of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>

1946
01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.580
<v Speaker 4>And I will establish my covenant with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1947
01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:12.120
<v Speaker 4>Neither shall all flesh be cut off </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore by the waters of the flood.</v>

1948
01:55:12.150 --> 01:55:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Neither shall there be any more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A flood to destroy the earth.</v>

1949
01:55:16.810 --> 01:55:21.810
<v Speaker 4>And God said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the token of the covenant which </v>

1950
01:55:21.810 --> 01:55:23.941
<v Speaker 4>I make between me and you and every </v>
<v Speaker 4>living creature that is with you for </v>

1951
01:55:23.941 --> 01:55:26.551
<v Speaker 4>perpetual generations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do set my bow in the cloud and it </v>

1952
01:55:26.551 --> 01:55:30.271
<v Speaker 4>shall be for a token of a covenant </v>
<v Speaker 4>between me and the Earth and it shall </v>

1953
01:55:30.271 --> 01:55:33.391
<v Speaker 4>come to pass when I bring a cloud over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth that the Hoa shall be seen in </v>

1954
01:55:33.391 --> 01:55:36.160
<v Speaker 4>the cloud and I will remember my </v>
<v Speaker 4>covenant which is between me and you and</v>

1955
01:55:36.161 --> 01:55:41.161
<v Speaker 4>every living creature of all flesh and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the waters shall no more become a flood </v>

1956
01:55:41.161 --> 01:55:44.401
<v Speaker 4>to destroy all flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a negotiated agreement there of </v>

1957
01:55:44.401 --> 01:55:44.401
<v Speaker 4>sorts</v>

1958
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:49.550
<v Speaker 1>and then negotiated agreement is as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I can tell to the degree that </v>

1959
01:55:51.601 --> 01:55:55.050
<v Speaker 1>humanity agrees to act in the manner of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Noah.</v>

1960
01:55:55.860 --> 01:56:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Then the threat of catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction will remain at bay and the </v>

1961
01:56:10.351 --> 01:56:15.351
<v Speaker 1>bowl shall be in the cloud and I will </v>
<v Speaker 1>look upon it that I may remember the </v>

1962
01:56:15.351 --> 01:56:18.051
<v Speaker 1>everlasting covenant between God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every living creature of all flesh that </v>

1963
01:56:18.051 --> 01:56:18.720
<v Speaker 1>is upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God said unto Noah,</v>

1964
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:23.960
<v Speaker 1>this is the token of the covenant which </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've established between me and all </v>

1965
01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:27.621
<v Speaker 1>flesh that is upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the token of the covenant which </v>

1966
01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I have established between me and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>flesh.</v>

1967
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:38.870
<v Speaker 1>That is upon the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good place to stop and </v>

1968
01:56:42.170 --> 01:56:47.170
<v Speaker 1>there's no lecture next week by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the theater was booked so </v>

1969
01:56:47.170 --> 01:56:50.771
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a one week break and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we get back we'll finish the story </v>

1970
01:56:50.771 --> 01:56:52.190
<v Speaker 1>of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not much left of it.</v>

1971
01:56:52.990 --> 01:56:55.550
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about the tower of Babel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very short story,</v>

1972
01:56:55.551 --> 01:56:56.990
<v Speaker 1>but a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting one.</v>

1973
01:56:57.350 --> 01:57:02.350
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll move on to the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham and so thank you very much for </v>

1974
01:57:02.541 --> 01:57:03.430
<v Speaker 1>coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you again</v>

1975
01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:08.460
<v Speaker 3>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1976
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Now is the person who has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>notification for the meetup after this </v>

1977
01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:30.070
<v Speaker 1>here and do they have the notification?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1978
01:57:30.071 --> 01:57:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Because if you give that to me this </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1979
01:57:31.721 --> 01:57:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember to read it before everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves.</v>

1980
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:38.410
<v Speaker 1>So do you want to start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1981
01:57:38.411 --> 01:57:43.411
<v Speaker 1>So see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see if the mic is working because </v>

1982
01:57:43.411 --> 01:57:45.280
<v Speaker 1>lots of people will listen to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>question and so.</v>

1983
01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1984
01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:50.850
<v Speaker 1>So you said on a recent live stream that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were two,</v>

1985
01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:52.800
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have enough energy to answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>this question,</v>

1986
01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:57.860
<v Speaker 1>but you said it was intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was wondering if you had the energy</v>

1987
01:57:58.231 --> 01:58:03.231
<v Speaker 1>to answer how someone might help someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has borderline personality disorder</v>

1988
01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:11.360
<v Speaker 1>by example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by example.</v>

1989
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.340
<v Speaker 1>You have an example?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1990
01:58:15.730 --> 01:58:16.180
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1991
01:58:16.181 --> 01:58:16.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1992
01:58:16.781 --> 01:58:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that the.</v>

1993
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's not take borderline personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder precisely as the example.</v>

1994
01:58:24.251 --> 01:58:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the question.</v>

1995
01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:32.340
<v Speaker 1>The question to some degree is how do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you help someone that's lost and the </v>

1996
01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:35.440
<v Speaker 1>answer to that is if they aren't willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not be lost,</v>

1997
01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:39.310
<v Speaker 1>you cannot help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say that as a clinician</v>

1998
01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's an.</v>

1999
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:47.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a statement that's informed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say by my mythological </v>

2000
01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:50.290
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also by straight clinical wisdom,</v>

2001
01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:55.460
<v Speaker 1>not mine particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things that Carl </v>

2002
01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Rogers pointed out was that there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary preconditions for entering </v>

2003
01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:01.921
<v Speaker 1>into a therapeutic relationship and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be really any relationship </v>

2004
01:59:01.921 --> 01:59:04.870
<v Speaker 1>where the mutual flourishing of the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>people involved was the paramount goal.</v>

2005
01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And one of the preconditions was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>both people have to want that to happen </v>

2006
01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:14.880
<v Speaker 1>and Rogers believed he didn't know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the horse to drink.</v>

2007
01:59:15.730 --> 01:59:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Once you had brought it to the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've thought about that a lot </v>

2008
01:59:20.730 --> 01:59:24.300
<v Speaker 1>because when people are really lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're so lost that they </v>

2009
01:59:25.181 --> 01:59:30.181
<v Speaker 1>can't be found and I think the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you can do in a situation </v>

2010
01:59:30.181 --> 01:59:34.261
<v Speaker 1>like that is get your life together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she and manifest the reality of an </v>

2011
01:59:36.101 --> 01:59:39.070
<v Speaker 1>alternative motive being that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got.</v>

2012
01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:44.880
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the only way I knew of to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve an intractable problem and I would</v>

2013
01:59:46.751 --> 01:59:51.751
<v Speaker 1>say the reason that I went down that </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction with regards to borderline </v>

2014
01:59:51.751 --> 01:59:56.221
<v Speaker 1>personality disorders because it's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most serious of the personality </v>

2015
01:59:56.221 --> 01:59:58.540
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to treat and so I'll</v>

2016
01:59:58.541 --> 02:00:03.541
<v Speaker 1>generalize from that to situations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very difficult to deal with.</v>

2017
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:05.980
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a statement too,</v>

2018
02:00:05.981 --> 02:00:09.250
<v Speaker 1>and this has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>borderline personality disorder per se.</v>

2019
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a statement in the new testament</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really vicious.</v>

2020
02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:13.450
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of them,</v>

2021
02:00:13.451 --> 02:00:18.451
<v Speaker 1>but this is a particularly vicious one </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is don't cast pearls before </v>

2022
02:00:18.451 --> 02:00:23.371
<v Speaker 1>swine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is if you're trying </v>

2023
02:00:23.371 --> 02:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>to help and it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then stop helping.</v>

2024
02:00:26.770 --> 02:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not helping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2025
02:00:28.781 --> 02:00:32.530
<v Speaker 1>It may be just wasting your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be making things worse.</v>

2026
02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're.</v>

2027
02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>If you're offering something and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not taken,</v>

2028
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>then perhaps you should be offering it </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else and sometimes if you </v>

2029
02:00:42.311 --> 02:00:44.140
<v Speaker 1>offer hand in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person won't take it.</v>

2030
02:00:44.141 --> 02:00:49.141
<v Speaker 1>You have to stop offering the hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you do is you go off and you </v>

2031
02:00:49.450 --> 02:00:52.540
<v Speaker 1>have your life and sometimes that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>in people's lives,</v>

2032
02:00:52.541 --> 02:00:57.541
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have to leave their family </v>

2033
02:00:57.541 --> 02:00:57.541
<v Speaker 1>members behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a scene in the new testament.</v>

2034
02:00:57.541 --> 02:00:59.980
<v Speaker 1>This is another very hard scene where </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ is walking down the road with his</v>

2035
02:00:59.981 --> 02:01:00.670
<v Speaker 1>disciples.</v>

2036
02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>I hope I've got this story right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've got it essentially right,</v>

2037
02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>and his mother calls to him and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that he's supposed to come </v>

2038
02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:13.831
<v Speaker 1>back to the home because his uncle has </v>
<v Speaker 1>died and that there's going to be a </v>

2039
02:01:14.171 --> 02:01:19.171
<v Speaker 1>funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he turns to his mother and says </v>

2040
02:01:19.171 --> 02:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the dead bury their dead.</v>

2041
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm about my father's business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

2042
02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.620
<v Speaker 1>And you read that and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

2043
02:01:27.190 --> 02:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>that should have been edited out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2044
02:01:29.770 --> 02:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>but it shouldn't have been edited out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's exactly right because </v>

2045
02:01:34.770 --> 02:01:37.591
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the thing you do is walk away </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no other solution and if</v>

2046
02:01:39.921 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

2047
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:45.220
<v Speaker 4>are trapped in pathological </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships and you see no way out of </v>

2048
02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:45.220
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

2049
02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:49.120
<v Speaker 4>if someone who is sinking has their </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands around your neck and is pulling </v>

2050
02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:50.540
<v Speaker 4>you down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not obligated to drown with them.</v>

2051
02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:52.460
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a rule to.</v>

2052
02:01:52.461 --> 02:01:53.900
<v Speaker 4>If you're a lifeguard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2053
02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:58.960
<v Speaker 4>some of you have had lifeguard training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you approach someone who's </v>

2054
02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:00.800
<v Speaker 4>drowning and panicking in the water feed</v>
<v Speaker 4>out?</v>

2055
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this.</v>

2056
02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:07.420
<v Speaker 4>It's like all save you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean you get to drown </v>

2057
02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:10.580
<v Speaker 4>me while I'm doing it and if it's you </v>
<v Speaker 4>drown or both of us drown.</v>

2058
02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:14.540
<v Speaker 4>It's you drown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's wisdom.</v>

2059
02:02:14.930 --> 02:02:18.140
<v Speaker 4>That's not cruelty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2060
02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:20.740
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2061
02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:31.040
<v Speaker 1>couple of questions about dialogue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in dialogue with people.</v>

2062
02:02:31.041 --> 02:02:36.041
<v Speaker 1>So the first issue that I face is I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very high need for intellectual </v>

2063
02:02:36.051 --> 02:02:40.070
<v Speaker 1>stimulation and I don't get that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people.</v>

2064
02:02:40.090 --> 02:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2065
02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:44.300
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a dialogue for a time,</v>

2066
02:02:44.301 --> 02:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>but then it</v>

2067
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:48.040
<v Speaker 4>titrate openness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2068
02:02:48.610 --> 02:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>And and now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they started run out of ideas </v>

2069
02:02:53.610 --> 02:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>or they can keep up and it sort of falls</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart and okay,</v>

2070
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>this is a problem that intellectuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>have quite frequently.</v>

2071
02:02:58.041 --> 02:02:59.900
<v Speaker 1>You said they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of,</v>

2072
02:02:59.901 --> 02:03:02.300
<v Speaker 1>once they start reading difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>devoting stuff,</v>

2073
02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>they stopped wanting to talk to regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and I think that contributes to </v>

2074
02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:12.401
<v Speaker 1>the disconnect that you see between </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals and working class people </v>

2075
02:03:12.401 --> 02:03:12.530
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

2076
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:14.790
<v Speaker 1>And the other question I had was about,</v>

2077
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 4>okay wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's the question.</v>

2078
02:03:18.250 --> 02:03:19.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean I believe there's a question in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

2079
02:03:19.791 --> 02:03:19.950
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

2080
02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:21.530
<v Speaker 1>the question is how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

2081
02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:24.540
<v Speaker 1>how should we address that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should I address it?</v>

2082
02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:27.480
<v Speaker 1>And is that something that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dressed?</v>

2083
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:28.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of,</v>

2084
02:03:28.111 --> 02:03:30.930
<v Speaker 4>part of the answer to that is that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the universities were for.</v>

2085
02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:32.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2086
02:03:32.221 --> 02:03:37.221
<v Speaker 4>not everybody is equipped to or </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in engaging in high level </v>

2087
02:03:37.711 --> 02:03:39.840
<v Speaker 4>discussion of abstract and creative </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

2088
02:03:40.020 --> 02:03:45.020
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hear this idea that everyone's </v>

2089
02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:45.020
<v Speaker 4>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lie.</v>

2090
02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:46.260
<v Speaker 4>It's a straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that true?</v>

2091
02:03:46.261 --> 02:03:48.330
<v Speaker 4>Creativity is very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rare.</v>

2092
02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:53.780
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you happen to be a creative </v>

2093
02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:54.690
<v Speaker 4>person or if you happen to be someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's profoundly interested in ideas,</v>

2094
02:03:54.691 --> 02:03:57.840
<v Speaker 4>you are in a pronounced minority,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just as you are,</v>

2095
02:03:57.841 --> 02:04:01.110
<v Speaker 4>if you happen to be extremely </v>
<v Speaker 4>extroverted or extremely agreeable,</v>

2096
02:04:01.111 --> 02:04:03.900
<v Speaker 4>are extremely conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are minority issues.</v>

2097
02:04:03.901 --> 02:04:08.901
<v Speaker 4>And what you do is you find likeminded </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are capable of engaging that </v>

2098
02:04:08.901 --> 02:04:13.880
<v Speaker 4>we know a heavyweight heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 4>weightlifters compete with heavy weight </v>

2099
02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:17.100
<v Speaker 4>weight lifters for a reason and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks that's fine.</v>

2100
02:04:17.101 --> 02:04:20.240
<v Speaker 4>And the same thing applies to </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual and creative endeavors.</v>

2101
02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:25.050
<v Speaker 4>So what you do is you try to find a </v>
<v Speaker 4>community where that's,</v>

2102
02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:31.340
<v Speaker 4>that's the nature of the community and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you likely have to find a relationship </v>

2103
02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:31.670
<v Speaker 4>like that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2104
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:36.830
<v Speaker 4>So I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what contributes to the siloing </v>

2105
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:39.330
<v Speaker 4>is the arrogance goes along with it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you're,</v>

2106
02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:43.440
<v Speaker 4>you can be interested in ideas and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can be creative.</v>

2107
02:04:44.090 --> 02:04:45.750
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the arrogance of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellect,</v>

2108
02:04:45.751 --> 02:04:47.430
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing the Catholic Church had</v>

2109
02:04:47.431 --> 02:04:50.010
<v Speaker 4>warned about for centuries is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrogance of the intellect.</v>

2110
02:04:50.490 --> 02:04:55.490
<v Speaker 4>So because if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're wise as well as smart and </v>

2111
02:04:55.490 --> 02:04:56.910
<v Speaker 4>there is no relationship between being </v>
<v Speaker 4>smart and being wise,</v>

2112
02:04:56.911 --> 02:05:01.911
<v Speaker 4>they are not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no quick pathway from smart to </v>

2113
02:05:01.911 --> 02:05:05.601
<v Speaker 4>wise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And many of the people who I've known </v>

2114
02:05:05.601 --> 02:05:08.421
<v Speaker 4>who were very wise were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them were intellectually </v>

2115
02:05:08.421 --> 02:05:11.580
<v Speaker 4>impaired and we're still wise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's the arrogance that brings up the</v>

2116
02:05:11.581 --> 02:05:12.030
<v Speaker 4>block.</v>

2117
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:17.030
<v Speaker 4>And I see this for example happening in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States in particular because </v>

2118
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.910
<v Speaker 4>the last time I went down there for </v>
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>

2119
02:05:17.911 --> 02:05:22.911
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had friends down there and some of </v>

2120
02:05:22.911 --> 02:05:25.581
<v Speaker 4>those friends are very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very smart people and some of them were </v>

2121
02:05:25.581 --> 02:05:28.080
<v Speaker 4>talking about the trump voters and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were talking about the trump voters with</v>

2122
02:05:28.081 --> 02:05:33.081
<v Speaker 4>contempt and I thought you better watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because that's 50 percent of the </v>

2123
02:05:33.090 --> 02:05:38.090
<v Speaker 4>population and it might be convenient to</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that they're stupid and beneath </v>

2124
02:05:38.090 --> 02:05:40.230
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not conducive to a civil state.</v>

2125
02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:45.440
<v Speaker 4>And there's no evidence that it's true </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there isn't a straight line </v>

2126
02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:48.570
<v Speaker 4>between intelligent and wise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think that if your.</v>

2127
02:05:49.110 --> 02:05:52.410
<v Speaker 4>If your character is developed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're intelligent,</v>

2128
02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:55.620
<v Speaker 4>you can have your siloed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>creative community,</v>

2129
02:05:56.010 --> 02:06:01.010
<v Speaker 4>but you develop enough wisdom so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see all the things that people </v>

2130
02:06:01.010 --> 02:06:04.701
<v Speaker 4>can do that or have high ethical utility</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are outside the intellectual </v>

2131
02:06:04.701 --> 02:06:04.701
<v Speaker 4>domain.</v>

2132
02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:10.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's why in the New </v>

2133
02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's why Christ is a </v>

2134
02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:12.440
<v Speaker 4>carpenter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2135
02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2136
02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:17.130
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>carpenter is one of those jobs that when</v>

2137
02:06:17.131 --> 02:06:22.131
<v Speaker 4>you're dishonest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it manifests itself immediately because </v>

2138
02:06:22.131 --> 02:06:22.920
<v Speaker 4>what you build falls down and so if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're an honest carpenter,</v>

2139
02:06:22.921 --> 02:06:25.380
<v Speaker 4>you build a good house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a nice metaphor there,</v>

2140
02:06:25.381 --> 02:06:29.550
<v Speaker 4>but it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also a warning in some sense,</v>

2141
02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:34.640
<v Speaker 4>against the the equation of intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliance with moral superiority.</v>

2142
02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:42.380
<v Speaker 4>And so if the intellects would drop </v>
<v Speaker 4>their moral superiority and fat chance </v>

2143
02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:46.641
<v Speaker 4>there is of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that divide between the working </v>

2144
02:06:46.641 --> 02:06:50.421
<v Speaker 4>class say and the elite would would </v>
<v Speaker 4>resolve.</v>

2145
02:06:52.110 --> 02:06:56.460
<v Speaker 4>And there's every reason to have respect</v>
<v Speaker 4>for decent working class people.</v>

2146
02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:02.480
<v Speaker 4>It's on their labor as the left wingers </v>
<v Speaker 4>at least hypothetically agree that the </v>

2147
02:07:03.931 --> 02:07:07.680
<v Speaker 4>entire edifice of the culture is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is resting.</v>

2148
02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:10.650
<v Speaker 4>So you can have your cake and eat it </v>
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

2149
02:07:10.651 --> 02:07:15.651
<v Speaker 4>but you have to not assume that your </v>
<v Speaker 4>niche makes you superior.</v>

2150
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 4>And it's very difficult for smart </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2151
02:07:18.721 --> 02:07:21.750
<v Speaker 4>especially smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this scene in niches.</v>

2152
02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:26.850
<v Speaker 4>Sins thus spake Zarathustra Zarathustra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The prophet comes down from the mountain</v>

2153
02:07:26.851 --> 02:07:31.851
<v Speaker 4>and he comes into a public square and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this crowd around this little </v>

2154
02:07:31.851 --> 02:07:36.051
<v Speaker 4>midget who was only about this high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who has a gigantic ear and everyone is </v>

2155
02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:38.350
<v Speaker 4>marveling at him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2156
02:07:38.351 --> 02:07:40.330
<v Speaker 4>that's what the moderate intellect is </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

2157
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:45.570
<v Speaker 4>It's a midget with a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well mouth generally not an ear and the </v>

2158
02:07:45.570 --> 02:07:50.350
<v Speaker 4>being is underdeveloped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the intellect is hyper activated and</v>

2159
02:07:50.490 --> 02:07:53.140
<v Speaker 4>it makes the person extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbalanced.</v>

2160
02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:58.380
<v Speaker 4>And it's partly because a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't compete outside the </v>

2161
02:07:58.380 --> 02:07:59.350
<v Speaker 4>intellectual realm and that makes them </v>
<v Speaker 4>very bitter because they tend to think,</v>

2162
02:07:59.351 --> 02:08:00.370
<v Speaker 4>well God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so smart.</v>

2163
02:08:00.371 --> 02:08:01.780
<v Speaker 4>Everything should just come to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2164
02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:03.400
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not how the world works.</v>

2165
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:05.480
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

2166
02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:07.150
<v Speaker 4>it also that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2167
02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:08.680
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2168
02:08:08.681 --> 02:08:13.150
<v Speaker 4>that attitude is immediately evident to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that they're talking to when they</v>

2169
02:08:13.151 --> 02:08:18.151
<v Speaker 4>talk in the manner that they talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they are arrogant intellectuals of </v>

2170
02:08:18.151 --> 02:08:21.241
<v Speaker 4>that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that in the simpsons did a good </v>

2171
02:08:21.241 --> 02:08:23.821
<v Speaker 4>job of that with Comic Book Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he completely useless in every </v>

2172
02:08:24.131 --> 02:08:28.670
<v Speaker 4>possible dimension with an Iq of about </v>
<v Speaker 4>160 and it's very annoying to people who</v>

2173
02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:31.960
<v Speaker 4>have an Iq of 160 that they can also be </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely useless,</v>

2174
02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:35.320
<v Speaker 4>but it happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

2175
02:08:37.670 --> 02:08:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2176
02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2177
02:08:45.831 --> 02:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>see how are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

2178
02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:51.740
<v Speaker 1>So I was at first going to ask about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts on a very popular TV show.</v>

2179
02:08:51.741 --> 02:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Rick and Morty</v>

2180
02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:59.060
<v Speaker 4>just recommended that to me and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>said they thought I would find it funny </v>

2181
02:08:59.060 --> 02:09:02.161
<v Speaker 4>and that makes me nervous because I like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the simpsons and I liked the trailer </v>

2182
02:09:02.161 --> 02:09:04.770
<v Speaker 4>park boys for actually liked the Turner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really liked the trailer park boys.</v>

2183
02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:07.800
<v Speaker 4>And so if someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's so sad,</v>

2184
02:09:08.170 --> 02:09:12.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they said that I would like rick and</v>

2185
02:09:12.691 --> 02:09:15.030
<v Speaker 4>Morty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm kind of afraid to even watch it.</v>

2186
02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:18.750
<v Speaker 1>It does have a nihilistic theme to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

2187
02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:23.760
<v Speaker 1>So that was just quite telling of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>young population which say falling in </v>

2188
02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:24.840
<v Speaker 1>love with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's talking about it,</v>

2189
02:09:24.841 --> 02:09:25.110
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2190
02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:30.700
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I'll definitely watch it because </v>

2191
02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:30.700
<v Speaker 4>I'd been looking for something to watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm brain dead at night.</v>

2192
02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:30.700
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2193
02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:36.300
<v Speaker 1>but I just had to tell him my question </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a different angle if I,</v>

2194
02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:37.380
<v Speaker 1>if I may.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2195
02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:39.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2196
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:41.480
<v Speaker 1>the case that governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

2197
02:09:41.481 --> 02:09:46.481
<v Speaker 1>such as Russia and Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are even more extreme cases like </v>

2198
02:09:46.481 --> 02:09:50.831
<v Speaker 1>isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do not want to conform to a </v>

2199
02:09:50.831 --> 02:09:51.680
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic aspects of the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>

2200
02:09:51.681 --> 02:09:56.681
<v Speaker 1>they've taken an anti western approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>as someone with a Middle Eastern </v>

2201
02:09:56.681 --> 02:09:56.700
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2202
02:09:56.710 --> 02:10:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to figure out where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>origins of this hostility more precisely</v>

2203
02:10:02.001 --> 02:10:04.790
<v Speaker 1>comes from and why things are the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

2204
02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I recently found out that certain key </v>
<v Speaker 1>uranium philosophers and political </v>

2205
02:10:10.641 --> 02:10:14.240
<v Speaker 1>activist who are partially </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually responsible for the 19,</v>

2206
02:10:14.241 --> 02:10:19.241
<v Speaker 1>79 and renowned revolution were highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by the anti western </v>

2207
02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Heideggerian philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is partially why they believe </v>

2208
02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:25.250
<v Speaker 1>that an Islamic state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2209
02:10:25.251 --> 02:10:28.550
<v Speaker 1>would it be be unnecessary counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

2210
02:10:28.830 --> 02:10:29.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

2211
02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>to the nihilistic western thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2212
02:10:32.290 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you also found there with</v>

2213
02:10:34.570 --> 02:10:38.030
<v Speaker 4>Aleksandr Dugin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a puddings advisor,</v>

2214
02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:41.570
<v Speaker 4>except Dougan doesn't really seem to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a coherent answer.</v>

2215
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:46.830
<v Speaker 4>He says that an answer like that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary and that hypothetically it's </v>

2216
02:10:46.830 --> 02:10:48.080
<v Speaker 4>something that Russia might be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>offer,</v>

2217
02:10:48.081 --> 02:10:51.020
<v Speaker 4>but the details seem to me somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 4>obscure.</v>

2218
02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:55.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean the Russians may be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russians are doing what Solzhenitsyn</v>

2219
02:10:55.641 --> 02:10:57.890
<v Speaker 4>suggested in returning to Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>

2220
02:10:57.891 --> 02:11:02.891
<v Speaker 4>although Russia's corrupt enough so that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to tell from the </v>

2221
02:11:02.891 --> 02:11:06.671
<v Speaker 4>outside if that's mirror collusion </v>
<v Speaker 4>between a corrupt church and a corrupt </v>

2222
02:11:06.671 --> 02:11:07.130
<v Speaker 4>state or if there's something genuine </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on there.</v>

2223
02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:08.420
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2224
02:11:08.580 --> 02:11:09.160
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2225
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:14.470
<v Speaker 4>I would say there's a question under </v>
<v Speaker 4>your question which is tyranny or </v>

2226
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:15.190
<v Speaker 4>nihilism?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2227
02:11:15.191 --> 02:11:17.720
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

2228
02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:23.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lots of people would pick tyranny over </v>

2229
02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:25.781
<v Speaker 4>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if that's the only choice that </v>

2230
02:11:25.781 --> 02:11:28.661
<v Speaker 4>people are offered then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I also think that tyranny is </v>

2231
02:11:28.661 --> 02:11:28.661
<v Speaker 4>stronger than nihilism because what are </v>
<v Speaker 4>you going to do?</v>

2232
02:11:28.661 --> 02:11:31.190
<v Speaker 4>Organize nihilists hardly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2233
02:11:31.191 --> 02:11:32.960
<v Speaker 4>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at what happened to,</v>

2234
02:11:32.961 --> 02:11:35.510
<v Speaker 4>what was that thing in central park,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2235
02:11:35.511 --> 02:11:37.310
<v Speaker 4>against the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

2236
02:11:37.311 --> 02:11:39.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a dismal affair that was.</v>

2237
02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:45.160
<v Speaker 4>We'd like things to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How well we don't know.</v>

2238
02:11:47.950 --> 02:11:48.260
<v Speaker 4>It's like</v>

2239
02:11:49.410 --> 02:11:53.550
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

2240
02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:58.740
<v Speaker 4>So you know your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can just run over that if you're a </v>

2241
02:11:58.740 --> 02:12:01.891
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical and organized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can just run over that like there's </v>

2242
02:12:01.891 --> 02:12:04.441
<v Speaker 4>nothing there at all and that I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a danger and I do think that </v>

2243
02:12:04.441 --> 02:12:09.121
<v Speaker 4>were enticing Islamofascism let's say by</v>
<v Speaker 4>our nihilistic weakness and I think more</v>

2244
02:12:11.711 --> 02:12:16.711
<v Speaker 4>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that we're doing something more </v>

2245
02:12:16.711 --> 02:12:16.711
<v Speaker 4>than that because one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been curious about,</v>

2246
02:12:16.711 --> 02:12:20.970
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going way out on limb here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is I've been really interested in the </v>

2247
02:12:20.970 --> 02:12:24.421
<v Speaker 4>alliance between the Neo Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 4>denialists suspicious or the Neo </v>

2248
02:12:24.421 --> 02:12:24.421
<v Speaker 4>Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodern,</v>

2249
02:12:24.421 --> 02:12:26.810
<v Speaker 4>especially the feminists and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Islamofascism.</v>

2250
02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.280
<v Speaker 4>I just don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's something very,</v>

2251
02:12:30.281 --> 02:12:34.270
<v Speaker 4>very interesting going on there and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think part of it is that when you,</v>

2252
02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:39.010
<v Speaker 4>when you drift too far into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nihilistic substructure,</v>

2253
02:12:39.170 --> 02:12:44.170
<v Speaker 4>there is a huge call for tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 4>order that manifests itself </v>

2254
02:12:44.170 --> 02:12:47.731
<v Speaker 4>unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the dynamic that I see </v>

2255
02:12:47.731 --> 02:12:50.731
<v Speaker 4>playing out in that peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship between the modern neo </v>

2256
02:12:50.731 --> 02:12:53.440
<v Speaker 4>Marxist feminists in the Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascists.</v>

2257
02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:58.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2258
02:12:58.271 --> 02:13:03.271
<v Speaker 4>That's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's very interesting that that's a </v>

2259
02:13:03.271 --> 02:13:04.240
<v Speaker 4>very interesting idea that you brought </v>
<v Speaker 4>to mind.</v>

2260
02:13:04.241 --> 02:13:09.241
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship between heidegger and what </v>

2261
02:13:09.241 --> 02:13:12.931
<v Speaker 4>happened in Iran in the 19 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could send me a citation about </v>

2262
02:13:12.931 --> 02:13:15.310
<v Speaker 4>that or something to read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be very interested in doing that.</v>

2263
02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:16.420
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2264
02:13:16.690 --> 02:13:17.350
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2265
02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

2266
02:13:26.730 --> 02:13:29.720
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2267
02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 4>that's the closest thing</v>

2268
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll experience to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Arnold Schwartzenegger actually </v>

2269
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:37.010
<v Speaker 1>delivering that line.</v>

2270
02:13:50.010 --> 02:13:54.550
<v Speaker 6>April titled the Case for Free Speech</v>

2271
02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2272
02:14:03.970 --> 02:14:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Not Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

2273
02:14:07.090 --> 02:14:12.090
<v Speaker 6>Whereby I guess the square root of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>number of people involved in some sort </v>

2274
02:14:12.090 --> 02:14:12.220
<v Speaker 6>of productive endeavor</v>

2275
02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:13.630
<v Speaker 1>do half the work</v>

2276
02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:15.890
<v Speaker 6>would result in half the production.</v>

2277
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nasty,</v>

2278
02:14:17.370 --> 02:14:18.390
<v Speaker 1>nasty law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2279
02:14:18.391 --> 02:14:19.890
<v Speaker 1>It was also known as price's law.</v>

2280
02:14:20.810 --> 02:14:24.610
<v Speaker 6>Four hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 6>500 people we've all cleaned up.</v>

2281
02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

2282
02:14:28.410 --> 02:14:33.410
<v Speaker 6>What you're saying is that if you say </v>
<v Speaker 6>that this Perrino distribution </v>

2283
02:14:33.410 --> 02:14:37.570
<v Speaker 6>approximates a natural law,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we all understand the force of gravity </v>

2284
02:14:38.530 --> 02:14:41.090
<v Speaker 6>and there's no escaping the influence of</v>
<v Speaker 6>gravity,</v>

2285
02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:47.030
<v Speaker 6>that means that there's 20 people in </v>
<v Speaker 6>this room who are going to be,</v>

2286
02:14:47.410 --> 02:14:52.410
<v Speaker 6>I guess candidates to accomplishing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess the goal of being the next </v>

2287
02:14:52.521 --> 02:14:53.330
<v Speaker 6>Jordan Peterson.</v>

2288
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully there's fewer of them.</v>

2289
02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is if it isn't obvious what </v>

2290
02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:10.101
<v Speaker 1>the population would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would compare this population </v>

2291
02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:10.530
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2292
02:15:10.531 --> 02:15:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Because you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2293
02:15:11.551 --> 02:15:13.470
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 400 people in this room,</v>

2294
02:15:13.471 --> 02:15:17.550
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't necessarily the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 400 people in this room might be the</v>

2295
02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:20.940
<v Speaker 1>square root of the broader population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're interested in this sort of thing.</v>

2296
02:15:20.941 --> 02:15:25.941
<v Speaker 1>But with the prieto distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you also see is that it's itself </v>

2297
02:15:25.941 --> 02:15:27.120
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2298
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:32.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's 400 people doing </v>

2299
02:15:32.510 --> 02:15:33.180
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 of them are doing half the work,</v>

2300
02:15:33.181 --> 02:15:36.810
<v Speaker 1>but if you take 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those 24 of them are doing half the work</v>

2301
02:15:36.811 --> 02:15:39.750
<v Speaker 1>of the 20 and one of the forest doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>half the work of the four.</v>

2302
02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

2303
02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:42.670
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2304
02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:47.470
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why am I telling you that it's it,</v>

2305
02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:48.540
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2306
02:15:48.541 --> 02:15:50.610
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that there isn't useful work to</v>

2307
02:15:50.611 --> 02:15:54.870
<v Speaker 1>be done at multiple slices of the prieto</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

2308
02:15:54.871 --> 02:15:59.871
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is it's also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case that there's not only one prieto </v>

2309
02:15:59.871 --> 02:15:59.871
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2310
02:15:59.871 --> 02:16:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Because he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2311
02:16:00.931 --> 02:16:05.931
<v Speaker 1>if it's just the square root of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people in a domain that are </v>

2312
02:16:05.931 --> 02:16:06.030
<v Speaker 1>doing half the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what do you do with the rest of the</v>

2313
02:16:06.031 --> 02:16:11.031
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that might be while </v>

2314
02:16:11.031 --> 02:16:11.250
<v Speaker 1>they're in a pre to a different prieto </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution as well,</v>

2315
02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:12.840
<v Speaker 1>where they're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

2316
02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:13.860
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2317
02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good question.</v>

2318
02:16:24.601 --> 02:16:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2319
02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:26.030
<v Speaker 1>we don't exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2320
02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:28.140
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the basic rule is the look,</v>

2321
02:16:28.141 --> 02:16:33.141
<v Speaker 1>the basic rule is example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take 100 scientists in a given </v>

2322
02:16:33.141 --> 02:16:37.141
<v Speaker 1>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 of them will have published half the </v>

2323
02:16:37.141 --> 02:16:37.390
<v Speaker 1>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this works with everything.</v>

2324
02:16:37.391 --> 02:16:40.270
<v Speaker 1>It works with every creative domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rule applies.</v>

2325
02:16:40.810 --> 02:16:45.810
<v Speaker 1>So now the question is why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the answer to that seems to </v>

2326
02:16:45.810 --> 02:16:49.801
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've watched people who've become </v>

2327
02:16:49.801 --> 02:16:51.301
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly successful and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is that zero is a really bad </v>

2328
02:16:51.881 --> 02:16:53.290
<v Speaker 1>place to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2329
02:16:53.291 --> 02:16:58.291
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to get out of zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's often why people are trapped </v>

2330
02:16:58.291 --> 02:17:02.671
<v Speaker 1>in poverty because if you have nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to something is virtually </v>

2331
02:17:02.671 --> 02:17:04.270
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you have something,</v>

2332
02:17:04.271 --> 02:17:06.910
<v Speaker 1>getting to a little more of something is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually quite a bit easier.</v>

2333
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:12.270
<v Speaker 1>And so what seems to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also called the matthew </v>

2334
02:17:13.091 --> 02:17:14.560
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2335
02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:18.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the same principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a new testament citation.</v>

2336
02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the matthew principle is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who have everything more will be </v>

2337
02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:27.580
<v Speaker 1>given from those who have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything will be taken.</v>

2338
02:17:27.730 --> 02:17:32.730
<v Speaker 1>That's another one of those lines in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>new testament that you'd think that a </v>

2339
02:17:32.730 --> 02:17:33.180
<v Speaker 1>good editor would have just got rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So but,</v>

2340
02:17:33.181 --> 02:17:38.181
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what it is is that every </v>

2341
02:17:38.181 --> 02:17:40.411
<v Speaker 1>time you make a step forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll be able to </v>

2342
02:17:40.411 --> 02:17:44.161
<v Speaker 1>take the next step forward increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to increase in a nonlinear </v>

2343
02:17:44.161 --> 02:17:44.161
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2344
02:17:44.161 --> 02:17:48.650
<v Speaker 1>the world that the matthew principal </v>
<v Speaker 1>describes is nonlinear.</v>

2345
02:17:48.730 --> 02:17:49.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might say,</v>

2346
02:17:49.571 --> 02:17:54.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your trajectory if you're moving </v>

2347
02:17:54.571 --> 02:17:54.571
<v Speaker 1>upward?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2348
02:17:54.571 --> 02:17:55.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this.</v>

2349
02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:58.150
<v Speaker 1>What's your trajectory if you're moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>downward,</v>

2350
02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:01.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this,</v>

2351
02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:02.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Fall,</v>

2352
02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:04.330
<v Speaker 1>you fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you plummet,</v>

2353
02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:06.730
<v Speaker 1>you rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rise,</v>

2354
02:18:06.850 --> 02:18:11.850
<v Speaker 1>you transcend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and you might </v>

2355
02:18:11.850 --> 02:18:11.850
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a hell of a world,</v>

2356
02:18:11.850 --> 02:18:15.661
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be run by some principle and </v>

2357
02:18:15.661 --> 02:18:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the principle that it appears to be run </v>
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>

2358
02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2359
02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:25.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2360
02:18:25.851 --> 02:18:27.200
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that at all.</v>

2361
02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:31.040
<v Speaker 1>What it means is that every truth claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make,</v>

2362
02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:34.340
<v Speaker 1>including those that are implicit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your actions,</v>

2363
02:18:34.670 --> 02:18:39.670
<v Speaker 1>carries with it an ethic that justifies </v>
<v Speaker 1>or doesn't justify the action.</v>

2364
02:18:40.220 --> 02:18:45.220
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say I have a tool and I say it's </v>

2365
02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:46.880
<v Speaker 1>an ax and I go out in the forest and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut down.</v>

2366
02:18:46.881 --> 02:18:49.400
<v Speaker 1>I tried to cut down a tree with it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>

2367
02:18:49.850 --> 02:18:52.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not an ax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something else.</v>

2368
02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:54.020
<v Speaker 1>And so what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the.</v>

2369
02:18:54.170 --> 02:18:58.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a good book on pragmatism called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the metaphysical club,</v>

2370
02:18:58.431 --> 02:19:03.431
<v Speaker 1>a history of American ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one I would really recommend and </v>

2371
02:19:03.431 --> 02:19:06.400
<v Speaker 1>what the pragmatists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't give you a full answer because </v>

2372
02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:09.011
<v Speaker 1>this is such a complicated issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the pragmatist we're wrestling </v>

2373
02:19:09.011 --> 02:19:11.930
<v Speaker 1>with back in the late 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the late 18 hundreds.</v>

2374
02:19:12.050 --> 02:19:14.960
<v Speaker 1>This was William James and his crew in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in Boston.</v>

2375
02:19:15.330 --> 02:19:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm including a philosopher named CS </v>
<v Speaker 1>purse,</v>

2376
02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:20.330
<v Speaker 1>who is perhaps America's greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher.</v>

2377
02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:26.740
<v Speaker 1>They were wrestling with the same issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the postmodernist would wrestle </v>

2378
02:19:26.740 --> 02:19:26.740
<v Speaker 1>with 100 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>

2379
02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:31.190
<v Speaker 4>things are indefinitely complex and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not very bright.</v>

2380
02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:36.520
<v Speaker 4>So how is it that we can make claims to </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth about anything and what they were,</v>

2381
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:41.210
<v Speaker 4>what their hypothesis essentially was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that with every action and with every</v>

2382
02:19:41.211 --> 02:19:46.211
<v Speaker 4>truth claim you similar demarcate a </v>
<v Speaker 4>territory within which that claim is </v>

2383
02:19:46.211 --> 02:19:50.060
<v Speaker 4>valid and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you determine whether the claim is valid</v>

2384
02:19:50.061 --> 02:19:55.061
<v Speaker 4>by noting whether your prediction about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the outcome of your action or your or </v>

2385
02:19:55.061 --> 02:19:59.651
<v Speaker 4>your belief is commensurate is in </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping with so if the outcome is in </v>

2386
02:20:01.041 --> 02:20:06.041
<v Speaker 4>keeping with the prediction than what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've said or done is true or good </v>

2387
02:20:06.041 --> 02:20:10.640
<v Speaker 4>enough and that's as good as you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the pragmatic perspective.</v>

2388
02:20:10.641 --> 02:20:12.260
<v Speaker 4>And then when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2389
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:16.910
<v Speaker 4>when the pragmatists encountered Charles</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dark Charles Darwin's works works,</v>

2390
02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:22.330
<v Speaker 4>they immediately recognized that Darwin </v>
<v Speaker 4>had generated a pragmatic solution to </v>

2391
02:20:22.330 --> 02:20:24.050
<v Speaker 4>the problem of the impossibility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

2392
02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:29.530
<v Speaker 4>The impossibility of being is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's way more cosmos than there is </v>

2393
02:20:29.530 --> 02:20:29.810
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2394
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:35.230
<v Speaker 4>You are going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot generate a sufficient </v>

2395
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:37.610
<v Speaker 4>solution to the problem of you're being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one can.</v>

2396
02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:38.540
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cat,</v>

2397
02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:42.860
<v Speaker 4>it's like the environment is a snake </v>
<v Speaker 4>that moves unpredictably across time and</v>

2398
02:20:42.861 --> 02:20:45.080
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to stay on its back while </v>
<v Speaker 4>I was how to,</v>

2399
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:47.600
<v Speaker 4>how does the Darwinian process deal with</v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

2400
02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:51.020
<v Speaker 4>It produces infinite variance roughly </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking,</v>

2401
02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:56.380
<v Speaker 4>almost all of which die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how it solves the problem </v>

2402
02:20:56.380 --> 02:20:57.900
<v Speaker 4>across time and the things that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

2403
02:20:57.980 --> 02:21:00.950
<v Speaker 4>the things that stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our true enough,</v>

2404
02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:03.710
<v Speaker 4>and that's the best you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the argument I was trying to have</v>

2405
02:21:03.711 --> 02:21:06.850
<v Speaker 4>with Sam Harris because Harris doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>take his evolutionary cycle,</v>

2406
02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:08.780
<v Speaker 4>his evolutionary theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously enough,</v>

2407
02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:11.030
<v Speaker 4>but we get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We kept getting bogged down.</v>

2408
02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2409
02:21:12.980 --> 02:21:17.900
<v Speaker 4>that's the best answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to agree with that,</v>

2410
02:21:17.901 --> 02:21:18.770
<v Speaker 4>but it's not true.</v>

2411
02:21:23.050 --> 02:21:27.710
<v Speaker 6>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yup,</v>

2412
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:32.710
<v Speaker 6>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

2413
02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:39.170
<v Speaker 6>True scientific.</v>

2414
02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:42.160
<v Speaker 4>You really do like to ask hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>questions,</v>

2415
02:21:42.161 --> 02:21:43.520
<v Speaker 4>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2416
02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:45.580
<v Speaker 4>I think it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2417
02:21:45.581 --> 02:21:48.850
<v Speaker 4>this is also why like the Piagetian take</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say on,</v>

2418
02:21:48.970 --> 02:21:53.970
<v Speaker 4>on pragmatism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think that pragmatism as a </v>

2419
02:21:53.970 --> 02:21:56.020
<v Speaker 4>philosophy has the limitation that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just described,</v>

2420
02:21:56.860 --> 02:21:59.170
<v Speaker 4>but only if you think about the Games is</v>
<v Speaker 4>limited.</v>

2421
02:21:59.860 --> 02:22:02.380
<v Speaker 4>If you have to play the game in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>iterative way,</v>

2422
02:22:02.530 --> 02:22:07.530
<v Speaker 4>then that issue resolves itself and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game theorists have done a good job of </v>

2423
02:22:07.530 --> 02:22:09.730
<v Speaker 4>mapping that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you could say,</v>

2424
02:22:09.731 --> 02:22:14.731
<v Speaker 4>let's say pragmatically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no reason I shouldn't deceive </v>

2425
02:22:14.731 --> 02:22:14.731
<v Speaker 4>you once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I can get what I want,</v>

2426
02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:15.730
<v Speaker 4>it's yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2427
02:22:15.790 --> 02:22:19.270
<v Speaker 4>Except that I'm probably not only going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to interact with you once.</v>

2428
02:22:19.450 --> 02:22:24.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to interact with you a lot and</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it isn't you that I interact </v>

2429
02:22:24.450 --> 02:22:27.781
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be a bunch of beings that </v>

2430
02:22:27.781 --> 02:22:27.781
<v Speaker 4>are so much you that it might as well </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

2431
02:22:27.781 --> 02:22:30.300
<v Speaker 4>You might as well be you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be me if nothing else.</v>

2432
02:22:30.301 --> 02:22:35.301
<v Speaker 4>And so the pragmatic game stretched </v>
<v Speaker 4>across time would include the necessity </v>

2433
02:22:36.211 --> 02:22:41.211
<v Speaker 4>of interability in relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>validations of the truth claims.</v>

2434
02:22:41.370 --> 02:22:45.070
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how it looks to me when you.</v>

2435
02:22:46.010 --> 02:22:46.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

2436
02:22:46.890 --> 02:22:48.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

2437
02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:53.720
<v Speaker 4>Stop you say that again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Denied on several occasions.</v>

2438
02:22:54.780 --> 02:22:57.510
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're good at rhetoric.</v>

2439
02:22:57.780 --> 02:22:59.910
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2440
02:23:01.470 --> 02:23:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's not all I am.</v>

2441
02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:13.460
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so this is on behalf of somebody,</v>

2442
02:23:13.550 --> 02:23:18.550
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dr Peterson having listened to your </v>

2443
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:20.421
<v Speaker 7>expositions on the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 7>evolution and amalgamation of religion </v>

2444
02:23:20.421 --> 02:23:24.020
<v Speaker 7>and keeping in mind your working </v>
<v Speaker 7>definitions of belief and truth and </v>

2445
02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:27.060
<v Speaker 7>despite the obvious reasons for somebody</v>
<v Speaker 7>of your background to identify most with</v>

2446
02:23:27.061 --> 02:23:32.061
<v Speaker 7>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my understanding is that you believe </v>

2447
02:23:32.061 --> 02:23:34.880
<v Speaker 7>Christianity to be the most complete and</v>
<v Speaker 7>articulated form of many of the </v>

2448
02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:36.120
<v Speaker 7>metaphysical ideas that proceeded.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It led up to that.</v>

2449
02:23:36.750 --> 02:23:41.750
<v Speaker 7>Keeping that in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 7>would it also be accurate to therefore </v>

2450
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.750
<v Speaker 7>say that you're not only a believer in </v>
<v Speaker 7>Christianity,</v>

2451
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:45.650
<v Speaker 7>but also if to a lesser degree also </v>
<v Speaker 7>believer in,</v>

2452
02:23:45.940 --> 02:23:50.940
<v Speaker 7>in Marta,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the ancient Egyptian gods and the </v>

2453
02:23:50.940 --> 02:23:50.940
<v Speaker 7>subsequent gods that you've spoken of </v>
<v Speaker 7>here,</v>

2454
02:23:50.940 --> 02:23:52.140
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that lead up and contributed to the form</v>

2455
02:23:52.141 --> 02:23:55.500
<v Speaker 7>of Christianity that you're discussing </v>
<v Speaker 7>and that you identify with.</v>

2456
02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:01.960
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to take that one apart a little </v>

2457
02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:03.801
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm bounded in my judgment with regards </v>

2458
02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:08.571
<v Speaker 4>to Christianity by my ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm no student of Hinduism so I can't </v>

2459
02:24:12.061 --> 02:24:17.061
<v Speaker 4>make the claim forthrightly that there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something intrinsically superior to the </v>

2460
02:24:17.881 --> 02:24:22.080
<v Speaker 4>Judeo Christian tradition because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know enough to make that claim.</v>

2461
02:24:23.130 --> 02:24:28.130
<v Speaker 4>The claim I can make is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's dreadfully right about </v>

2462
02:24:28.130 --> 02:24:32.690
<v Speaker 4>this core elements of the Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian tradition and I've seen </v>

2463
02:24:32.690 --> 02:24:33.180
<v Speaker 4>analogs to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the things I'd like to do,</v>

2464
02:24:33.181 --> 02:24:38.181
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to do a a short series on the Tao Te </v>

2465
02:24:38.181 --> 02:24:40.710
<v Speaker 4>Ching because that is one remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 4>document.</v>

2466
02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:43.440
<v Speaker 4>Once you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially you might want to read it,</v>

2467
02:24:43.470 --> 02:24:45.180
<v Speaker 4>you can go online and read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very short.</v>

2468
02:24:45.181 --> 02:24:50.181
<v Speaker 4>Tao Te Ching t a o,</v>
<v Speaker 4>t h I C H I n g,</v>

2469
02:24:50.850 --> 02:24:55.850
<v Speaker 4>and it's the fundamental texts of Taoism</v>
<v Speaker 4>and once you know that the world of </v>

2470
02:24:55.850 --> 02:25:00.141
<v Speaker 4>being is made of chaos and order and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know that that's represented by the Yin </v>

2471
02:25:00.141 --> 02:25:04.581
<v Speaker 4>and the Yang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden you can understand the </v>

2472
02:25:04.581 --> 02:25:04.581
<v Speaker 4>Tao te Ching and it's just.</v>

2473
02:25:04.581 --> 02:25:08.160
<v Speaker 4>It's brilliantly simple and </v>
<v Speaker 4>straightforward in new sex position,</v>

2474
02:25:08.250 --> 02:25:11.550
<v Speaker 4>but it also seems to me to be entirely </v>
<v Speaker 4>commensurate with the line of,</v>

2475
02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:14.910
<v Speaker 4>of let's call it logic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more like a,</v>

2476
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:19.740
<v Speaker 4>the the mode of description of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's encapsulated in these stories.</v>

2477
02:25:20.190 --> 02:25:22.800
<v Speaker 4>Now with regards to being a believer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people ask me all the time,</v>

2478
02:25:22.801 --> 02:25:23.590
<v Speaker 4>two thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2479
02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:25.900
<v Speaker 4>do you believe in God and are you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian?</v>

2480
02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:28.150
<v Speaker 4>And they answered without both of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>is actually.</v>

2481
02:25:28.210 --> 02:25:33.210
<v Speaker 4>There's two answers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is what the hell makes you think </v>

2482
02:25:33.210 --> 02:25:33.220
<v Speaker 4>it's any of your business?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first answer.</v>

2483
02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:38.340
<v Speaker 4>And the second is why do you think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you mean the same thing with those </v>

2484
02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:39.760
<v Speaker 4>questions that I would mean with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>answer.</v>

2485
02:25:40.450 --> 02:25:42.030
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>

2486
02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:44.920
<v Speaker 4>it's such a funny thing because I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>spent like three.</v>

2487
02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:48.420
<v Speaker 4>This is no accusation with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your questions in the least.</v>

2488
02:25:48.430 --> 02:25:48.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2489
02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:53.700
<v Speaker 8>I think it's more about trying to track </v>
<v Speaker 8>the development of these ideas and you </v>

2490
02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:53.700
<v Speaker 8>know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the residual truths and psych,</v>

2491
02:25:53.890 --> 02:25:56.530
<v Speaker 8>psychological significance of all these </v>
<v Speaker 8>other traditions that team.</v>

2492
02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2493
02:25:57.690 --> 02:25:58.550
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

2494
02:25:58.700 --> 02:26:03.700
<v Speaker 4>I've been floored by either mythological</v>
<v Speaker 4>structures like when I first understood </v>

2495
02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:10.120
<v Speaker 4>or thought I understood the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Mesopotamian creation method,</v>

2496
02:26:10.121 --> 02:26:13.270
<v Speaker 4>just I've never recovered from that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would say,</v>

2497
02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:18.420
<v Speaker 4>and the same thing is true of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigations I did into the Egyptian </v>

2498
02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:21.040
<v Speaker 4>myths of Horus and Isis and Osiris and </v>
<v Speaker 4>seth.</v>

2499
02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:24.700
<v Speaker 4>It's just they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so relevant.</v>

2500
02:26:24.701 --> 02:26:26.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are so unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 4>relevant.</v>

2501
02:26:26.921 --> 02:26:31.921
<v Speaker 4>And how do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do see this is a problem that none </v>

2502
02:26:31.921 --> 02:26:33.250
<v Speaker 4>of us really know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to solve.</v>

2503
02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:36.100
<v Speaker 4>It's like there are sources of wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 4>all over the world,</v>

2504
02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:41.280
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they need to be made commensurate </v>

2505
02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:44.971
<v Speaker 4>with one another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which isn't to say that they need to be </v>

2506
02:26:44.971 --> 02:26:45.670
<v Speaker 4>turned into a fast food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A mall,</v>

2507
02:26:45.690 --> 02:26:46.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2508
02:26:46.241 --> 02:26:47.710
<v Speaker 4>that's like multiculturalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2509
02:26:47.711 --> 02:26:52.711
<v Speaker 4>It's like all the food of the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>served in the most terrible possible </v>

2510
02:26:52.711 --> 02:26:55.060
<v Speaker 4>manner all in one place and something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2511
02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:57.250
<v Speaker 4>And you don't want to do that with </v>
<v Speaker 4>comparative religion.</v>

2512
02:26:57.640 --> 02:26:59.650
<v Speaker 4>It's just water everything down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2513
02:26:59.651 --> 02:27:00.670
<v Speaker 4>it's all nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2514
02:27:00.671 --> 02:27:01.840
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is not nice.</v>

2515
02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:07.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or that it's all the same because it's </v>

2516
02:27:07.380 --> 02:27:08.971
<v Speaker 4>not all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the job of communicating between </v>

2517
02:27:09.941 --> 02:27:13.660
<v Speaker 4>those domains of wisdom is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuing.</v>

2518
02:27:13.661 --> 02:27:18.661
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been a problem ever since the </v>

2519
02:27:18.661 --> 02:27:21.420
<v Speaker 4>beginning of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's continuing and I would say the </v>

2520
02:27:21.420 --> 02:27:22.330
<v Speaker 4>psychoanalysts too young in particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a huge,</v>

2521
02:27:22.331 --> 02:27:27.331
<v Speaker 4>huge steps in the direction of doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in an extraordinarily positive way </v>

2522
02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:31.420
<v Speaker 4>and not a simple minded way at all and </v>
<v Speaker 4>not just hand waving that.</v>

2523
02:27:31.421 --> 02:27:36.421
<v Speaker 4>Oh well it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone has one in all shall have </v>

2524
02:27:36.421 --> 02:27:36.421
<v Speaker 4>prizes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that.</v>

2525
02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:36.910
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2526
02:27:37.450 --> 02:27:42.450
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

2527
02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:43.930
<v Speaker 4>Last question</v>

2528
02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:50.600
<v Speaker 8>actually is a kind of in the same vein,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's in regards to another kind of </v>

2529
02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:54.161
<v Speaker 8>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So in terms of I guess Carl Jung's own </v>

2530
02:27:54.161 --> 02:27:54.280
<v Speaker 8>those,</v>
<v Speaker 8>sorry to mix.</v>

2531
02:27:54.290 --> 02:27:57.050
<v Speaker 8>Certainly tall,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but a lot of the.</v>

2532
02:27:57.770 --> 02:28:01.250
<v Speaker 8>I actually found some kind of archetypes</v>
<v Speaker 8>like for example,</v>

2533
02:28:01.251 --> 02:28:03.980
<v Speaker 8>in my own life,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but also I've noticed in European life.</v>

2534
02:28:04.310 --> 02:28:09.310
<v Speaker 8>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in regards to Odin and norse mythology </v>

2535
02:28:09.310 --> 02:28:12.770
<v Speaker 8>with Carl Jung's essay,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've only been able to touch you skim it</v>

2536
02:28:12.771 --> 02:28:14.970
<v Speaker 8>because I've been trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 8>something like.</v>

2537
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.000
<v Speaker 8>Because it felt like there's always this</v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of psyche that was almost </v>

2538
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:20.000
<v Speaker 8>underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I guess,</v>

2539
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.701
<v Speaker 8>Western civilization and we've seen it </v>
<v Speaker 8>really like embodied in this specific </v>

2540
02:28:24.951 --> 02:28:25.850
<v Speaker 8>figure,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this deity,</v>

2541
02:28:25.860 --> 02:28:27.800
<v Speaker 8>the wanderer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the knowledge,</v>

2542
02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:30.860
<v Speaker 8>gather the seeker,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he's also a war.</v>

2543
02:28:30.861 --> 02:28:35.861
<v Speaker 8>God is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he is all these different aspects that </v>

2544
02:28:35.861 --> 02:28:38.270
<v Speaker 8>are an accumulation of what seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 8>something that's distinctly western.</v>

2545
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:43.070
<v Speaker 8>And I feel this is almost like the </v>
<v Speaker 8>symbol in a way.</v>

2546
02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:45.110
<v Speaker 8>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not always positive.</v>

2547
02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:48.890
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there seems to be something.</v>

2548
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I do think that the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual has been articulated most </v>

2549
02:28:53.961 --> 02:28:56.840
<v Speaker 1>fully in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's really a,</v>

2550
02:28:57.170 --> 02:29:00.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a contentious claim</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

2551
02:29:00.570 --> 02:29:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that the latent </v>

2552
02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:09.040
<v Speaker 1>structures from which that idea might </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge weren't also many other places </v>

2553
02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:13.811
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing from let's say from </v>

2554
02:29:13.811 --> 02:29:16.811
<v Speaker 1>a biological perspective is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>only talking about differences of a few </v>

2555
02:29:16.811 --> 02:29:18.770
<v Speaker 1>hundred years in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of these ideas.</v>

2556
02:29:18.771 --> 02:29:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>From A,</v>

2557
02:29:19.610 --> 02:29:21.410
<v Speaker 1>from an evolutionary perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2558
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:23.270
<v Speaker 1>it's instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2559
02:29:23.271 --> 02:29:25.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new idea has to arise somewhere.</v>

2560
02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:28.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to be somewhere first and </v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

2561
02:29:28.341 --> 02:29:30.650
<v Speaker 1>it's spreading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity for example,</v>

2562
02:29:30.651 --> 02:29:35.651
<v Speaker 1>spreads so rapidly that it's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond belief and it is actually </v>

2563
02:29:35.651 --> 02:29:36.530
<v Speaker 1>spreading more rapidly in China now than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did in ancient Rome.</v>

2564
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:37.430
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2565
02:29:37.700 --> 02:29:42.700
<v Speaker 8>Well in regards to that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's also been seen like almost in the </v>

2566
02:29:42.700 --> 02:29:46.451
<v Speaker 8>wake of a dying Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've noticed that like there's been a </v>

2567
02:29:46.451 --> 02:29:47.540
<v Speaker 8>tendency to go towards I guess paganism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

2568
02:29:47.810 --> 02:29:49.360
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm understand the lake.</v>

2569
02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:51.520
<v Speaker 8>Some people love at off.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>

2570
02:29:51.540 --> 02:29:56.540
<v Speaker 8>you have waco,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which was mainly a manifestation of all </v>

2571
02:29:56.540 --> 02:29:58.880
<v Speaker 8>Alistair Crowley has it works which were</v>
<v Speaker 8>then handed off to whoever actually made</v>

2572
02:29:58.881 --> 02:30:02.360
<v Speaker 8>the actual ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then next thing you know,</v>

2573
02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:07.280
<v Speaker 8>we're finding something almost more </v>
<v Speaker 8>stable in I guess norse mythology and it</v>

2574
02:30:07.281 --> 02:30:12.200
<v Speaker 8>seems like it's acting almost as a </v>
<v Speaker 8>pendulum swing from something that.</v>

2575
02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are like.</v>

2576
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:15.010
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when,</v>

2577
02:30:15.011 --> 02:30:15.560
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2578
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:17.930
<v Speaker 1>when one mythological structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses,</v>

2579
02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:22.160
<v Speaker 1>it's going to collapse into another </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological structure or another set of</v>

2580
02:30:22.161 --> 02:30:25.070
<v Speaker 1>mythological structures and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because you,</v>

2581
02:30:25.071 --> 02:30:27.530
<v Speaker 1>you can't get out of the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>

2582
02:30:27.531 --> 02:30:29.800
<v Speaker 1>there's no possible way of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2583
02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And so I wouldn't say necessarily that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that other belief systems </v>

2584
02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:37.880
<v Speaker 1>emerge in the aftermath of the collapse </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the overarching belief system,</v>

2585
02:30:37.881 --> 02:30:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's necessarily a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad idea.</v>

2586
02:30:40.220 --> 02:30:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that it has its attendant </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangers.</v>

2587
02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:48.700
<v Speaker 1>And so I should stop because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to get tired and I'm not going </v>

2588
02:30:48.700 --> 02:30:50.520
<v Speaker 1>to be able to formulate any clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>answers than that.</v>

2589
02:30:50.521 --> 02:30:53.380
<v Speaker 1>And it's also 10:00.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we also do have to start.</v>

2590
02:30:57.970 --> 02:30:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

2591
02:31:01.460 --> 02:31:06.460
<v Speaker 1>There is an unofficial meetup and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion group at Hemingway's </v>

2592
02:31:06.460 --> 02:31:06.650
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second floor,</v>

2593
02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:11.330
<v Speaker 1>142 cumberland street.</v>
