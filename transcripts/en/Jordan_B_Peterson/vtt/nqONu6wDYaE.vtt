1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>This title I didn't really realize I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>be speaking to an audience that actually</v>

2
00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:07.280
<v Speaker 1>included witches and wizards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well probably I'll probably meet them in</v>

4
00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>question period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be my guess.</v>

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.670
<v Speaker 1>So can you all hear me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of you can hear me.</v>

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.140
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's better.</v>

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

9
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can plainly see,</v>

10
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.950
<v Speaker 1>the title of this talk is dragon's</v>
<v Speaker 1>divined parents,</v>

11
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>heroes in adversaries are complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmology of being</v>

12
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.000
<v Speaker 1>sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreadfully new age to me,</v>

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

14
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

15
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 1>new age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are very creative but they can't</v>

16
00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 1>think critically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can think critically.</v>

17
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>So this is a creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical enterprise,</v>

18
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 1>conjoined with the capacity to tell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between bad ideas and good</v>

19
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully what I'm going to talk to</v>

20
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:15.520
<v Speaker 1>you about are the greatest ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity has ever produced.</v>

21
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>There are also ideas that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand well and</v>

22
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>who's highest level of formal</v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

23
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>We risk forgetting because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing things that we,</v>

24
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 1>we invented as a species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that we cannot understand rationally</v>

25
00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:42.811
<v Speaker 1>and we're predisposed to believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that we can't understand</v>

26
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>rationally have to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that's true,</v>

27
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes we're just not smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to understand them.</v>

28
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.093
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

29
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're not really smart enough to</v>

30
00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not really smart enough to</v>

31
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>understand why people would line up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>four nights for 10 blocks to watch star</v>

32
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 1>wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't do that for a lecture</v>

34
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 1>and they wouldn't pay money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

35
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>the star wars for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is naturally,</v>

36
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it's naturally interesting and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take that for granted.</v>

37
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.490
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that people will line up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>engage voluntary voluntarily in a ritual</v>

38
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:36.431
<v Speaker 1>activity of that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a manifestation of something that's</v>

39
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>very deep in the human psyche that we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>not comprehend.</v>

40
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:44.621
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to talk to you about what I</v>

41
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>like to think of as the grammar of</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

42
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.823
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

43
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>I got interested in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in the mid eighties was driven</v>

44
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:58.731
<v Speaker 1>mostly by an interest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>global that was ideologically</v>

45
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.490
<v Speaker 2>motivated and also atrocity warfare was</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so difficult to understand in some</v>

46
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 2>sense because you can map it onto animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>territoriality.</v>

47
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.620
<v Speaker 2>But atrocity in the service of videology</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a whole different thing there.</v>

48
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly clear that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

49
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 2>in World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Nazis had to make a choice</v>

50
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 2>perhaps between winning the war and</v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerating the rate at which they were</v>

51
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 2>killing Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they chose the latter and it's very</v>

52
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 2>difficult to understand that using a</v>
<v Speaker 2>model based on animal territory quality.</v>

53
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I started reading about belief systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>widely</v>

54
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.353
<v Speaker 2>in</v>

55
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>in political writings and economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>writings and religious writings.</v>

56
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.520
<v Speaker 1>The psychological writings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere I could find a thread that I</v>

57
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>thought was promising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot of young.</v>

58
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot of Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of the great clinical</v>

59
00:03:56.671 --> 00:03:59.460
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of soldier units and a lot of</v>

60
00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:04.461
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all people,</v>

61
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>lot of Dostoevsky and niche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're all people who,</v>

62
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have something very original to say</v>

63
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.540
<v Speaker 2>and</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of that</v>

64
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>are you learned to understand why people</v>
<v Speaker 1>need belief,</v>

65
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>why it's actually inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why faith and faith is inevitable.</v>

66
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Faith is inevitable in part because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is finite and so you have to</v>

67
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>take some things for granted or you fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>into an infinite regress</v>

68
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.810
<v Speaker 1>and what maybe constituted the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between pathological belief</v>

69
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:42.660
<v Speaker 1>and non pathological belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are terms by the way,</v>

70
00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:44.370
<v Speaker 1>which I think can be defined</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically,</v>

71
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 1>which is a statement that runs contrary</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the presuppositions,</v>

72
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>say of moral relativism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not a moral relativist.</v>

73
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it constitutes A.</v>

74
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.880
<v Speaker 1>I think the motivation for moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>relativism fundamentally is the desire</v>

75
00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:04.380
<v Speaker 1>to abdicate responsibility even though</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make very strong intellectual</v>

76
00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:07.380
<v Speaker 1>cases for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for why moral relativism is correct.</v>

77
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800
<v Speaker 1>The intellectual case and the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation have nothing to do with one</v>

78
00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:13.670
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

79
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I've also found out something else which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is quite interesting and I don't know</v>

80
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:24.870
<v Speaker 1>how much I can touch on it tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that Newton and Darwin</v>

81
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:25.790
<v Speaker 1>are commensurate.</v>

82
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.530
<v Speaker 1>I think that most modern people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>newtonians not Darwinians.</v>

83
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.660
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you can understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar of belief,</v>

84
00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:39.500
<v Speaker 1>which is religious in nature using</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian principles,</v>

85
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.450
<v Speaker 1>but it means that you have to give up</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Newtonian presuppositions.</v>

86
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>And so I think I can make that argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicitly with what I'm doing as I</v>

87
00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:51.980
<v Speaker 1>progressed tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I'm going to tell you</v>

88
00:05:51.981 --> 00:05:56.810
<v Speaker 1>is that it's necessary for you to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the world through a limited frame of</v>

89
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is you're not very</v>

90
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your consciousness can only handle about</v>

91
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>four bits of information per second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not very much given that the number</v>

92
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>of bits of information coming at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from next year and world are for all</v>

93
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.630
<v Speaker 1>practical purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>

94
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.240
<v Speaker 1>You're like eldest Huxley suggested your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain seemed to be primarily a reducing</v>

95
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body's a reducing agent as well</v>

96
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>because there are lots of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't detect and then the room</v>

97
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>that you're sitting in is a reducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>agent because it's keeping all sorts of</v>

98
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>things out that you would otherwise have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with.</v>

99
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 1>And the stability of this city as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing agent.</v>

100
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Because we're not going to be stampeded</v>
<v Speaker 1>by barbarians with any luck at every</v>

101
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:41.170
<v Speaker 1>moment or any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>

102
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>We deal with the complexity of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part by inhabiting a sequence of</v>

103
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:50.891
<v Speaker 1>reducing structures until the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced enough so that we can actually</v>

104
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.030
<v Speaker 1>deal with the minute elements of it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can comprehend at any one moment and</v>

105
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>those elements we comprehend</v>

106
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 1>are not the familiar objects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective reality.</v>

107
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.710
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and people included are much</v>

108
00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:12.711
<v Speaker 1>interested in objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're interested in pragmatic reality</v>

109
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.720
<v Speaker 1>and pragmatic reality is the reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you act on,</v>

110
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.380
<v Speaker 1>not that you perceive and because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in bodies and because we are</v>

111
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:28.090
<v Speaker 1>biological organisms and because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with survival and reproduction</v>

112
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.810
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to act is a much more important,</v>

113
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.850
<v Speaker 1>much more important question for us then</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the world constituted of</v>

114
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 1>how to act in some senses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also the Prime Darwinian question,</v>

115
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you act</v>

116
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>wrongly from a Darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up dead before you can</v>

117
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:55.211
<v Speaker 1>reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So darwinism is a pragmatic</v>

118
00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.860
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

119
00:07:59.861 --> 00:08:04.861
<v Speaker 1>the has eat the American pragmatists on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the North American east coast recognize</v>

120
00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>very short period of time after Darwin</v>

121
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:13.420
<v Speaker 1>studies were published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They recognize the connection between</v>

122
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.690
<v Speaker 1>pragmatism as a theory and Darwinian</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory instantaneously,</v>

123
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.160
<v Speaker 1>so the world that we inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that we're alive and given what's</v>

124
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.770
<v Speaker 1>selected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selected us to act is actually a</v>

125
00:08:29.771 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the objects of pragmatic worlds</v>

126
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:38.950
<v Speaker 1>aren't objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are tools and obstacles and they</v>

127
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.890
<v Speaker 1>have valence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a priority there.</v>

128
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.650
<v Speaker 1>They have value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a priority from the Newtonian</v>

129
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:46.090
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at the world</v>

130
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>and then you think about the world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the objects of the world that</v>

131
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 1>you see and then you evaluate them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you act,</v>

132
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 1>and that is not how your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just wrong.</v>

133
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>You might see the value of things before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the object itself.</v>

134
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

135
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 1>who are blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have blind sight.</v>

136
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>They can recognize emotions on faces</v>
<v Speaker 1>without knowing.</v>

137
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 1>They can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's partly because their retinas</v>

138
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 1>are attached to the Amygdala.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your retina is attached to a lot of your</v>

139
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just your visual cortex.</v>

140
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>It's attached to your spinal cord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's attached to your nervous system at</v>

141
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 1>multiple levels of analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and so you can use your</v>

142
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:31.611
<v Speaker 1>eyes to detect things that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you're seeing so and what is in</v>

143
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.200
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you often detect under those</v>

144
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>circumstances is valence value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're very good.</v>

145
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:43.281
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at detecting teeth and predatory eyes</v>

146
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.530
<v Speaker 1>and the reasons for that are self</v>
<v Speaker 1>evident.</v>

147
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.393
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

148
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.320
<v Speaker 1>this is the smallest unit of meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes up a referential frame.</v>

149
00:09:55.321 --> 00:10:00.321
<v Speaker 1>I think it has three elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of which links the mind to the body.</v>

150
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Actually the mind body problem isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>that difficult to solve if once you take</v>

151
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 1>a pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you look at how the brain works</v>

152
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 1>from a pragmatic perspective because</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your consciousness is fundamentally</v>

153
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>something that's grounded in action and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can understand the transition</v>

154
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 1>between consciousness and action as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of of analysis that are</v>

155
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 1>increasingly action oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you about that a little bit</v>

156
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the basic framework is something</v>

157
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:29.520
<v Speaker 1>like this and you're always looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world through this framework and the</v>

158
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>framework has as one pole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you are and what you're doing,</v>

159
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.240
<v Speaker 1>where you are now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's quite a.</v>

160
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 1>you're always trying to get from point a</v>
<v Speaker 1>to point b because you're a linear</v>

161
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>creature and your embodied so you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving and so fundamentally what you're</v>

162
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:47.850
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world through is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of maps and maps tell you how</v>

163
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 1>to get to where you want to go and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>the map specifies where you are because</v>

164
00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 1>obviously you can't get anywhere if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know where you are.</v>

165
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.540
<v Speaker 1>And many people of course are confused</v>
<v Speaker 1>about where they are so they don't get</v>

166
00:10:57.541 --> 00:11:02.541
<v Speaker 1>anywhere and you also have to know where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going and that's point a and</v>

167
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 1>point b and every time you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

168
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 1>you're looking through a framework that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has those two valued points.</v>

169
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:13.131
<v Speaker 1>Implicit in your cognitive structure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally what you think is where you're</v>

170
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>going is better than where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise,</v>

171
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:18.540
<v Speaker 1>why would you go there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

172
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>some people do choose to go to places</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are worse than where they are,</v>

173
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:24.510
<v Speaker 1>but they're a special case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably live with some of them.</v>

174
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're going from point a to</v>
<v Speaker 1>point B,</v>

175
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.460
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally you have to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

176
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 1>movement is not abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movement is what you do with your body,</v>

177
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.700
<v Speaker 1>and so once your abstract representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>transforms itself into action,</v>

178
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 1>you're no longer in the realm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>

179
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.100
<v Speaker 1>So in order to get from one place to</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

180
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you have to know where you are and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to know where you're going and then</v>

181
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:54.370
<v Speaker 1>you have walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly,</v>

182
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 1>run role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to perform some sort of</v>

183
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 1>embodied action to get there and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course you have conscious control over</v>

184
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>your voluntary muscular system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but underneath that you don't really</v>

185
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:06.760
<v Speaker 1>have anything at all right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can move your arm,</v>

186
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.770
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea what muscles you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>

187
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So your conscious representation of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body grounds out basically at voluntary</v>

188
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:19.111
<v Speaker 1>movement of the larger muscle systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might ask,</v>

189
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:22.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does specify where you're going?</v>

190
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.520
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that in large part is</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology,</v>

191
00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 1>but biology in a complex manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where higher order morality</v>

192
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:33.361
<v Speaker 1>starts to become a concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You share with other animals all the way</v>

193
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:39.091
<v Speaker 1>down the phylogenetic chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various forms of of implicit motivation.</v>

194
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And you know you can kind of lump those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's arbitrary.</v>

195
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I lumped them into self maintenance</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations and self propagation</v>

196
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:47.030
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

197
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 1>you can cut that in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

198
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 1>it's more conceptual than than based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>say know anatomy.</v>

199
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 1>But it'll do self maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to get too hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get too cold.</v>

201
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Your hypothalamus deals with that very</v>
<v Speaker 1>old part of the brain.</v>

202
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 1>It's way more important than your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>

203
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.290
<v Speaker 1>You can take the whole cortex off a</v>
<v Speaker 1>female cat and as long as you keep it in</v>

204
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 1>a cage and it has its hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can pretty much behave like a cat</v>

205
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.820
<v Speaker 1>except that it's hyper exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the last thing you'd expect</v>

206
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 1>from an animal with no brain.</v>

207
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't be too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be too cold.</v>

208
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.910
<v Speaker 1>You got to regulate your water intake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to eat,</v>

209
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.880
<v Speaker 1>you have to deal with the consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>of eating,</v>

210
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.760
<v Speaker 1>you have to be with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a place circuit,</v>

211
00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:34.510
<v Speaker 1>a specialized place circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a specialized erotic circuit,</v>

212
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a specialized circuit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>

213
00:13:37.481 --> 00:13:40.300
<v Speaker 1>which is about half of what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus does by the way.</v>

214
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>

215
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.370
<v Speaker 1>those systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've often been conceptualized as</v>

216
00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Speaker 1>drives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really that.</v>

217
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 1>They're more like isolated one I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>

218
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 1>They're like cyclops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want one thing now they're not</v>

219
00:13:56.171 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not very amenable to</v>

220
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:03.040
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're hungry and you're hungry</v>

221
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.680
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another motivational system might object</v>

222
00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

223
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.760
<v Speaker 1>and that happens frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why people are often</v>

224
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:13.160
<v Speaker 1>confused and also why you need a cortex</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

225
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:18.070
<v Speaker 1>you need a cortex to allow the competing</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems to array themselves</v>

226
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.840
<v Speaker 1>properly and harmoniously across time so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they all get their due instead of</v>

227
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:26.170
<v Speaker 1>fighting like two year olds in a room</v>
<v Speaker 1>because two year olds are basically</v>

228
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:27.550
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:14:27.551 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 1>and so there are lots of fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not organized and they're</v>

230
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:31.210
<v Speaker 1>not social at all.</v>

231
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 1>So what happens with the motivational</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

232
00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:38.821
<v Speaker 1>very deep in your brain is they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they specify the value of where you are</v>

233
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:41.130
<v Speaker 1>so that one of the values might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

234
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they tune your perception so</v>

235
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Speaker 1>that things that are associated with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quenching of thirst are much more likely</v>

236
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:55.081
<v Speaker 1>to be picked up by your system and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>bias your perceptual processing and your</v>

237
00:14:55.711 --> 00:15:00.711
<v Speaker 1>evaluation towards the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards improvement of that motivation,</v>

238
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 1>lack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

239
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 1>and so you can't really think of them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>drives because they're way more</v>

240
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 1>complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They specify where you are.</v>

241
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 1>So there's an element of self</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that's associated with</v>

242
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:14.240
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thirsty and they specify a target.</v>

243
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Usually using fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

244
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.600
<v Speaker 1>you get thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

245
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:18.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would I like to drink?</v>

246
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:22.610
<v Speaker 1>And you get little fantasy about maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass of juice or a bit of water or</v>

247
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

248
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 1>And then your nervous system is tuned in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you walk into the kitchen and you</v>

249
00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:31.580
<v Speaker 1>ignore everything that's irrelevant to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the search for liquid.</v>

250
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 1>And you focus in on everything that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant to the search for liquid.</v>

251
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:38.570
<v Speaker 1>And that means you're so blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot believe it.</v>

252
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been many experiments now that</v>

253
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:45.200
<v Speaker 1>have shown that you can do things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some of you have seen this,</v>

254
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 1>you can introduce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gorilla into a basketball game and</v>

255
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:52.340
<v Speaker 1>60 or 70 percent of the people watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as they're paying attention to</v>

256
00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 1>the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't see the gorilla.</v>

257
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like a little tiny gorilla</v>
<v Speaker 1>that somewhere off in the corner,</v>

258
00:15:56.271 --> 00:15:59.930
<v Speaker 1>it's like main center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six feet high beating its chest.</v>

259
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 1>And even when you know that if something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else changes in the background,</v>

260
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:05.570
<v Speaker 1>you won't see that either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as far as you guys know,</v>

261
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.950
<v Speaker 1>that carpet could be changing colors 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 times a minute.</v>

262
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.400
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't even notice it unless you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had some weird obsession with carpets.</v>

263
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

264
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 1>so that's the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense of a universal system</v>

265
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:20.820
<v Speaker 1>of values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

266
00:16:20.821 --> 00:16:22.520
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you how universal this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

267
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I always have to tell this story because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so damn funny.</v>

268
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I just can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that your brain is</v>

269
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:32.770
<v Speaker 1>very concerned with his relative status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're doing,</v>

270
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why relative poverty is</v>

271
00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 1>often such a social problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People hate me and low in status,</v>

272
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.520
<v Speaker 1>especially men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old male status hierarchies a bit</v>

273
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:46.070
<v Speaker 1>different than women and women are</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty sensitive to status too,</v>

274
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:51.020
<v Speaker 1>but they use different markers anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part what happens when your status goes</v>

275
00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 1>up as your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin levels go up and when your</v>

276
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:55.070
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin levels go up,</v>

277
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.960
<v Speaker 1>your last irritable and you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience less negative emotion per</v>

278
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 1>unit of uncertainty or threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so when you know when you demean</v>

279
00:17:03.891 --> 00:17:08.891
<v Speaker 1>someone and you interfere with and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowered the presumed status as far as</v>

280
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:12.350
<v Speaker 1>their very primordial circuit is</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

281
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 1>you alter the system that regulates</v>
<v Speaker 1>their emotions and they hate that.</v>

282
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.260
<v Speaker 1>People hate that more than anything and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an unbelievably archaic circuit.</v>

283
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.950
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of tell this because</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed people basically act like</v>

284
00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:29.060
<v Speaker 1>they're low status and depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are depressed about everything</v>

285
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to be depressed about</v>

286
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.080
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

287
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:37.100
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that that's the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that what's ever gone astray has</v>

288
00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 1>to be very primordial because it affects</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything anyways.</v>

289
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.800
<v Speaker 1>People often use antidepressants to cure</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

290
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:51.580
<v Speaker 1>hence their name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm and antidepressants decrease the</v>

291
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:55.410
<v Speaker 1>rate at which Serotonin is taken back up</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the neurons that produce it.</v>

292
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 million years ago,</v>

293
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:06.020
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans emerged and crustaceans live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in dominance hierarchies even though</v>

294
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:10.030
<v Speaker 1>they're not particularly social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if one lobster fights with another</v>

295
00:18:10.031 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Speaker 1>and gets defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he won't fight with another</v>

296
00:18:11.881 --> 00:18:14.910
<v Speaker 1>lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when he beat for 20 minutes less,</v>

297
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:18.750
<v Speaker 1>you give them antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case he'll fight again right</v>

298
00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:20.970
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm telling you this is</v>

299
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:25.971
<v Speaker 1>because the status structure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlies your being not just your</v>

300
00:18:28.201 --> 00:18:31.890
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your being is is so old.</v>

301
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>You share it with crustaceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you mess with it at your peril.</v>

302
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not learned by no means.</v>

303
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.320
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wander around inside one of these</v>

304
00:18:46.321 --> 00:18:49.320
<v Speaker 1>little frames going from point a to</v>
<v Speaker 1>point b all the time.</v>

305
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:50.850
<v Speaker 1>And one of the annoying things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

306
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:54.240
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of this is a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that as soon as you climb from point</v>

307
00:18:54.241 --> 00:18:57.780
<v Speaker 1>a to point b and you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's another point and another</v>

308
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.810
<v Speaker 1>point b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty interesting too,</v>

309
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that suggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that getting somewhere isn't really</v>

310
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>what people want because as soon as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get somewhere,</v>

311
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:09.600
<v Speaker 1>then you're done going there and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get somewhere else.</v>

312
00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:12.440
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense it seems it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment,</v>

313
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.050
<v Speaker 1>another sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the next rock up the mountain.</v>

314
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Now you all know this because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you graduated from university and that</v>

315
00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 1>was a good day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the next day you weren't a</v>

316
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:23.100
<v Speaker 1>university student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were some unemployed,</v>

317
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 1>loser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

318
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's uh,</v>

319
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sets up a whole new set of</v>

320
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:28.381
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

321
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how the frame shifts and when the</v>

322
00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 1>frame shifts like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the value of everything shifts</v>

323
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 1>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out that people are actually</v>

324
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Speaker 1>more interested in getting from point a</v>
<v Speaker 1>to point b,</v>

325
00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:46.161
<v Speaker 1>then they are in actually being at point</v>
<v Speaker 1>b and almost all of the positive emotion</v>

326
00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:48.750
<v Speaker 1>that you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is related to dopaminergic</v>

327
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:53.700
<v Speaker 1>circuitry by the way you experienced in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the pursuit of a value</v>

328
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.550
<v Speaker 1>goal rather than to the attainment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal.</v>

329
00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.430
<v Speaker 1>The attainment of the goal actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfies you,</v>

330
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 1>or more specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it satisfies that motivational circuit,</v>

331
00:20:02.581 --> 00:20:06.150
<v Speaker 1>but then the damn thing just shuts off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another one starts yelling at you,</v>

332
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:11.570
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a perverse form of victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one answer to that.</v>

333
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:15.690
<v Speaker 1>That's universal in some senses that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should establish a relationship with a</v>

334
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:20.400
<v Speaker 1>transcendent value because it never runs</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of motivational power.</v>

335
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 1>You can see an example of that popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>example in Popular Culture in the</v>

336
00:20:24.511 --> 00:20:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio Movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are.</v>

337
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.470
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Is anybody not seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

339
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.480
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

340
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.290
<v Speaker 1>in the Pinocchio Movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens is when</v>

341
00:20:37.291 --> 00:20:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Japan wishes that his son becomes a full</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed individual instead of a damn</v>

342
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:43.560
<v Speaker 1>puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good thing for a parent to</v>

343
00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:48.561
<v Speaker 1>wish by the way he wishes upon a star</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the star something of transcendent</v>

344
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:52.060
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the meaning of that fundamentally</v>

345
00:20:52.061 --> 00:20:54.940
<v Speaker 1>is that if you want to raise your child</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an independent being,</v>

346
00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:57.460
<v Speaker 1>that you better set your sights on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something transcended or it won't</v>

347
00:20:57.461 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>

348
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:04.050
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of times it doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the utility of a transcendent</v>

349
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 1>value is that never loses it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational effectiveness.</v>

350
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

351
00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 1>that's no proof that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent values.</v>

352
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.051
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

353
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:13.450
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's more to the story.</v>

354
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you're in one of these little</v>

355
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically what they are,</v>

356
00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 1>they're the simplest story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one place I went by this means to</v>

357
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 1>another place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the simplest story.</v>

358
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not that exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much more exciting story is I was going</v>

359
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 1>from point a to b and something weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and then I didn't know where I</v>

360
00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:36.260
<v Speaker 1>was and then I was like in chaos for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.280
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I figured out how to climb out</v>

362
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:40.690
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody likes that story,</v>

363
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:43.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a death and rebirth story by the</v>

364
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:46.300
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a fall from paradise story with a</v>

365
00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:48.450
<v Speaker 1>regaining of paradise at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

366
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 1>it's an archetypal story because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone lives it.</v>

367
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.240
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in one of these little</v>

368
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.000
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frames of reference,</v>

369
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 1>what you see in front of you are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that one of the best scientists,</v>

370
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:07.951
<v Speaker 1>whoever studied visual perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the book's called ecological</v>

371
00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 1>approach to visual perception.</v>

372
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 1>He called them affordances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Affordance is something that affords you</v>

373
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Speaker 1>something and affordances can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive or negative.</v>

374
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I like to think about them as tools or</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles.</v>

375
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.700
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I need to make a beeline for that</v>

376
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:27.760
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are all instantly obstacles.</v>

377
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And the way I would respond to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicitly is that you'd all be</v>

378
00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:34.930
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine we just said fire.</v>

379
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Well you were people the minute before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

380
00:22:37.781 --> 00:22:41.800
<v Speaker 1>but the second after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your obstacles and your emotional</v>

381
00:22:41.801 --> 00:22:44.950
<v Speaker 1>reactions to the people that are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you are going to reflect that.</v>

382
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Now you all know that because you drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:52.441
<v Speaker 1>and once you're encapsulated in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>little insectoid shell and don't have to</v>

384
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.970
<v Speaker 1>deal with the immediate responses of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

385
00:22:54.971 --> 00:22:59.050
<v Speaker 1>you're going to treat them like</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles and like demonic obstacles at</v>

386
00:22:59.051 --> 00:23:01.090
<v Speaker 1>the drop of a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

387
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:03.040
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much automatic behavior.</v>

388
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.340
<v Speaker 1>So tools are things that get you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you want to go.</v>

389
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.300
<v Speaker 1>And you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

390
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:10.270
<v Speaker 1>human beings are tool using animals par</v>
<v Speaker 1>exsalonce,</v>

391
00:23:10.271 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so tool using that.</v>

392
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:15.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what we see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's built right into us.</v>

393
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 1>We're always scanning the world for</v>
<v Speaker 1>tools.</v>

394
00:23:17.201 --> 00:23:19.120
<v Speaker 1>When you look at gravel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

395
00:23:19.121 --> 00:23:22.600
<v Speaker 1>what you actually see are throwing sized</v>
<v Speaker 1>rocks.</v>

396
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.740
<v Speaker 1>That's why they manifest themselves as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of object in the environment.</v>

397
00:23:26.741 --> 00:23:30.220
<v Speaker 1>You know you're built at a certain level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of resolution and the way your nervous</v>

398
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:34.810
<v Speaker 1>system parts parses up the world is into</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are useful for you and</v>

399
00:23:34.811 --> 00:23:37.600
<v Speaker 1>things that aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are not objects.</v>

400
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:43.380
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea of object is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very modern derivative of that much more</v>

401
00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:47.990
<v Speaker 1>primordial system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's by no means clear at all that</v>

402
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:52.010
<v Speaker 1>our notion of object is more real than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of affordance.</v>

403
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as your brain is concerned,</v>

404
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.710
<v Speaker 1>objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one cares about objects.</v>

405
00:23:57.711 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 1>What your brain cares about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>affordances and what your brain is</v>

406
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 1>adapted to is the world as a set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>affordances,</v>

407
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:06.800
<v Speaker 1>as obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a Darwinian,</v>

408
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:11.950
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to escape the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that what selected you is</v>

409
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:16.400
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if the reality that selected you</v>

410
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:20.780
<v Speaker 1>shaped you so that what you see are</v>
<v Speaker 1>affordances and obstacles or you die,</v>

411
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.970
<v Speaker 1>then it's perfectly real proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly reasonable proposition to</v>

412
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 1>state that what reality is in fact is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>set of affordances,</v>

413
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:34.100
<v Speaker 1>tools and obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is how your brain works.</v>

414
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:35.570
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at,</v>

415
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.410
<v Speaker 1>say I look at that projector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm thinking about picking it up.</v>

416
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.190
<v Speaker 1>What happens is my eyes activate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of my motor cortex that would</v>

417
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:45.380
<v Speaker 1>adjust my hand to grip it like that.</v>

418
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.560
<v Speaker 1>And so part of what I understand as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>projector is grippable object and that's</v>

419
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:54.830
<v Speaker 1>not a secondary derivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see the object and then think</v>

420
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.770
<v Speaker 1>this is how I would grip it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that would take forever.</v>

421
00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd never catch a baseball if that's</v>

422
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:01.700
<v Speaker 1>what you were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

423
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.640
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a round object is punk.</v>

424
00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:04.640
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

425
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.760
<v Speaker 1>that's just not gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really,</v>

426
00:25:06.761 --> 00:25:08.390
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your nervous system is nowhere fast</v>

427
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 1>enough to do that consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're using reptile circuitry to catch</v>

428
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.890
<v Speaker 1>baseball's the mammalian stuff is too</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn slow.</v>

429
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.250
<v Speaker 1>So you catch the ball often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if someone pitches it fast</v>

430
00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:22.380
<v Speaker 1>before you could even see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just think you saw it.</v>

431
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.540
<v Speaker 1>You see it after you caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The case with tennis players too,</v>

432
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.850
<v Speaker 1>they went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to do is judge where the</v>

433
00:25:28.851 --> 00:25:31.880
<v Speaker 1>ball's going to go by the angle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>racket because if they wait until the</v>

434
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:35.540
<v Speaker 1>ball is off the racket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't move fast enough to hit it</v>

435
00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:36.374
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

436
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.790
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the reflexes for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can't move the neural messages</v>

437
00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:43.250
<v Speaker 1>fast enough to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

438
00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:47.990
<v Speaker 1>So basically the world lays itself out</v>
<v Speaker 1>as tools and obstacles and you know,</v>

439
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:52.040
<v Speaker 1>obstacles make you feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like let's say I'm looking at this</v>

440
00:25:52.041 --> 00:25:54.080
<v Speaker 1>room and I'm thinking of you guys as</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles.</v>

441
00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.330
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how bad does that make me feel?</v>

442
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.860
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

443
00:25:57.861 --> 00:25:59.600
<v Speaker 1>not very bad because all I have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

444
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:01.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a circuitous route and I can get to</v>

445
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:05.210
<v Speaker 1>the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the fact that your obstacles is</v>

446
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:08.570
<v Speaker 1>a very minor impediment to the execution</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my plant,</v>

447
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 1>and as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will produce a correspondingly low</v>

448
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 1>level of negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think of those of known</v>

449
00:26:16.761 --> 00:26:20.900
<v Speaker 1>unknowns in Rumsfeld's terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one unknowns aren't that big a</v>

450
00:26:20.901 --> 00:26:24.020
<v Speaker 1>problem because you can plan for them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might have a plan that's an</v>

451
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 1>alternative plant that you can put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>place in case they show up.</v>

452
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.510
<v Speaker 1>What people really don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our unknown unknowns and unknown</v>

453
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:34.910
<v Speaker 1>unknowns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't walk around those man,</v>

454
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:38.150
<v Speaker 1>they blow your whole map and your maps</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite complicated.</v>

455
00:26:38.151 --> 00:26:41.810
<v Speaker 1>It's actually hierarchical in structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll get to that because you know,</v>

456
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 1>you go from point a to point B so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to a bigger point,</v>

457
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:47.160
<v Speaker 1>a to point b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 1>you crossed the road to get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>library,</v>

459
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 1>to study for an exam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pass the exam,</v>

460
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Speaker 1>to get your degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a job,</v>

461
00:26:52.951 --> 00:26:54.420
<v Speaker 1>to be a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a citizen,</v>

462
00:26:54.421 --> 00:26:56.250
<v Speaker 1>to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a good life.</v>

463
00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 1>So then if someone gets in your way</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're crossing the road,</v>

464
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:02.940
<v Speaker 1>then to some degree they're interfering</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you getting a good life.</v>

465
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very much,</v>

466
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:08.070
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you'll react like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That certainly happens when you're</v>

467
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 1>dealing with an intimate partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 1>because they'll make some little mistake</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll say you always do that.</v>

469
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.290
<v Speaker 1>You're always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've always done that.</v>

470
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:18.480
<v Speaker 1>You always do it and you're always going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>

471
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.390
<v Speaker 1>which is really not a good way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct an argument.</v>

472
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.370
<v Speaker 1>So unknown unknowns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

473
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.230
<v Speaker 1>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown unknowns,</v>

474
00:27:28.231 --> 00:27:32.550
<v Speaker 1>leap at you from places that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't expect because otherwise you</v>

475
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 1>would have planned for the damn things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are the things that are always</v>

476
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.910
<v Speaker 1>poking their beak off at you when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>least expect it.</v>

477
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:41.430
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say serpents in the garden of Eden.</v>

478
00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 1>That might be one way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

479
00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:46.740
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep the damn snakes out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the garden and that's because you can't</v>

480
00:27:46.741 --> 00:27:49.920
<v Speaker 1>make a bounded area and keep the</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity out of it.</v>

481
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.000
<v Speaker 1>The complexity always sneaks back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try protecting your children from the</v>

482
00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>

483
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.490
<v Speaker 1>You can't make a bounded circumstance</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get rid of all the complexity.</v>

484
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.480
<v Speaker 1>It always comes sneaking back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would be an unknown?</v>

485
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good one.</v>

486
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an intimate relationship.</v>

487
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.660
<v Speaker 1>You've had it for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Trust your partner,</v>

488
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:12.450
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where you are,</v>

489
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.430
<v Speaker 1>you know who you are and you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good idea of who of where you're</v>

490
00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:21.680
<v Speaker 1>going and then one day you find out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your partner has been cheating on you.</v>

491
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Not with one person but with three</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and for the whole 10 years.</v>

492
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Well hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes as a shock.</v>

493
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Although you may have ignored many</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimations that such might be the case</v>

494
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.710
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it comes as a shock.</v>

495
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to you?</v>

496
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where you are.</v>

497
00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:46.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting gay because you think</v>

498
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.060
<v Speaker 1>you know where you've been because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already been there,</v>

499
00:28:49.061 --> 00:28:53.740
<v Speaker 1>but all of a sudden something can happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you are so flipped over that you</v>

500
00:28:53.741 --> 00:28:57.070
<v Speaker 1>don't even know where you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means in some sense,</v>

501
00:28:57.071 --> 00:29:01.750
<v Speaker 1>the past is dependent on the present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very peculiar thing.</v>

502
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.790
<v Speaker 1>You also have no idea where you're going</v>

503
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:10.690
<v Speaker 1>in terms of not knowing where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Deep Bay because you might think,</v>

504
00:29:10.691 --> 00:29:12.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was in a marriage that</v>

505
00:29:12.971 --> 00:29:16.150
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I knew who my wife or husband</v>

506
00:29:16.151 --> 00:29:21.151
<v Speaker 1>was that turns out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I concluded on the basis that I knew my</v>

507
00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:24.220
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I knew something about women that</v>

508
00:29:24.221 --> 00:29:27.760
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was in a relationship with</v>

509
00:29:27.761 --> 00:29:31.840
<v Speaker 1>someone I could trust that is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about trust.</v>

510
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously too gullible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that does is throw virtually</v>

511
00:29:36.071 --> 00:29:39.010
<v Speaker 1>everything that's ever happened to me in</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe doubt.</v>

512
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the emergence of chaos.</v>

513
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's</v>

514
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.970
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're going from point a to</v>

515
00:29:48.971 --> 00:29:52.900
<v Speaker 1>point b and something you don't expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself in the middle of your</v>

516
00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:55.120
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not such a catastrophe because</v>

517
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:59.440
<v Speaker 1>you can just work around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sometimes something pops up and</v>

518
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:01.960
<v Speaker 1>like you just do not have a plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

519
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask yourself just</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly where you are,</v>

520
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:10.591
<v Speaker 1>you when you don't know where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that's a place and it's</v>

521
00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:14.560
<v Speaker 1>actually a place that's well documented</v>
<v Speaker 1>in plastic,</v>

522
00:30:14.561 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 1>religious and mythological stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

523
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.090
<v Speaker 1>The Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

524
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:22.780
<v Speaker 1>they believe that the world is made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos and order order.</v>

525
00:30:22.781 --> 00:30:25.540
<v Speaker 1>That's where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When what you do gets you what you want,</v>

526
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you are.</v>

527
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:31.720
<v Speaker 1>When you have no idea what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might ask,</v>

528
00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:34.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a way that you should act when</v>

529
00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:34.930
<v Speaker 1>you're in chaos?</v>

530
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is there better</v>
<v Speaker 1>be because it's a place you're going to</v>

531
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:43.300
<v Speaker 1>visit several times during your life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone visits that.</v>

532
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.590
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's an archetypal story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dissent to the underground.</v>

533
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Underground is that horrible place that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lurks underneath all of our</v>

534
00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:56.530
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the frigid lake underneath the thin</v>

535
00:30:56.531 --> 00:31:00.430
<v Speaker 1>ice that everybody's skating on and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that can manifest itself at</v>

536
00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 1>any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why in the Dallas</v>

537
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Assemble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Black Paisley is chaos by the way,</v>

538
00:31:05.411 --> 00:31:09.070
<v Speaker 1>and the White Paisley is ordered in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>order Paisley.</v>

539
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.900
<v Speaker 1>There's a little black dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

540
00:31:10.901 --> 00:31:14.440
<v Speaker 1>that's because order can turn into chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and does at any moment,</v>

541
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.080
<v Speaker 1>and the reverse is also true chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paternity to order at any moment and</v>

542
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:22.300
<v Speaker 1>insight will do that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

543
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.850
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics report that when they hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>

544
00:31:24.851 --> 00:31:27.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a capella system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look at the world in a different</v>

545
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:28.390
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

546
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.750
<v Speaker 1>You know now there are a new person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're back from the underground.</v>

547
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 1>They've risen from the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

548
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because what looks like</v>

549
00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:41.230
<v Speaker 1>your right hemisphere is pretty good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>inferring patterns in,</v>

550
00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:43.930
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in novel and chaotic places.</v>

551
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:46.810
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of keeping track of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened to you that are anomalous</v>

552
00:31:46.811 --> 00:31:51.370
<v Speaker 1>and it makes alternative maps of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that are there for you to rely on,</v>

553
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.160
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree if that ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes necessary.</v>

554
00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Or you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how upset should you be when something</v>

555
00:31:59.231 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Speaker 1>that you don't expect happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>

556
00:32:00.941 --> 00:32:04.420
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that that is really a</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult question to answer because</v>

557
00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:08.020
<v Speaker 1>what the problem is is that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you don't expect happens,</v>

558
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then he might say,</v>

559
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:12.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how upset should you get an answer to</v>

560
00:32:12.401 --> 00:32:15.610
<v Speaker 1>that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know,</v>

561
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.210
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

562
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.550
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got some built in approximators.</v>

563
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.320
<v Speaker 1>One would be your</v>

564
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.510
<v Speaker 1>genetically determined level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

565
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.790
<v Speaker 1>which is basically sensitivity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>

566
00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.190
<v Speaker 1>If you're more sensitive to negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

567
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.990
<v Speaker 1>you're going to manifest more</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiological preparation per unit</v>

568
00:32:37.991 --> 00:32:41.090
<v Speaker 1>of threat or uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say some people get more</v>

569
00:32:41.091 --> 00:32:43.820
<v Speaker 1>upset about the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then other people do.</v>

570
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Now who's right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well who knows?</v>

571
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 1>You wake up in the morning and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little ache in your side.</v>

572
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:49.941
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

573
00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:53.450
<v Speaker 1>what is that is sore muscle or cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know,</v>

574
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 1>and if you're hypochondriacal well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be cancer and sometimes</v>

575
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 1>the hypochondriac is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he's the one that lives when he</v>

576
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:04.010
<v Speaker 1>goes to the emergency room and finds out</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what's going on.</v>

577
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.830
<v Speaker 1>So it's an unanswerable question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

578
00:33:06.831 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 1>the other way that your brain determines</v>
<v Speaker 1>how upset you should be is by</v>

579
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:13.310
<v Speaker 1>calculating your position in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy because the higher</v>

580
00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:16.010
<v Speaker 1>you are in the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more resources you have at your</v>

581
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:18.680
<v Speaker 1>disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the less upset you have to get</v>

582
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:20.770
<v Speaker 1>with anything horrible happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're bad,</v>

583
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.480
<v Speaker 1>you're barely clinging to the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social structure.</v>

584
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Speaker 1>You can be sure that your brain is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to estimate any anomalous occurrence as</v>

585
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:30.290
<v Speaker 1>a catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why people don't like being at</v>

586
00:33:30.291 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also why people who were there</v>

587
00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:38.501
<v Speaker 1>die a lot sooner and they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They die a lot sooner regardless of</v>

588
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:44.240
<v Speaker 1>their absolute level of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's relative deprivation that counts.</v>

589
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's a bit of a clue about how else</v>

590
00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:49.730
<v Speaker 1>your brain might calculate how upset you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

591
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Here's a little map of me when I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I frequently do,</v>

592
00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:56.660
<v Speaker 1>which is to write a manuscript.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

593
00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing when you're writing a</v>

594
00:33:58.371 --> 00:34:00.440
<v Speaker 1>manuscript?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that turns out to be a very</v>

595
00:34:00.441 --> 00:34:01.970
<v Speaker 1>complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

596
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.310
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing when you read it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read a book.</v>

597
00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:05.523
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

598
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:11.450
<v Speaker 1>you're writing letters or typing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're typing words and phrases.</v>

599
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.090
<v Speaker 1>You typing sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're typing paragraphs,</v>

600
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.120
<v Speaker 1>you're typing the structure that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraphs fit into.</v>

601
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:19.670
<v Speaker 1>That would be the essay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

602
00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Then you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

603
00:34:23.821 --> 00:34:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm practicing science because I usually</v>

604
00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:30.270
<v Speaker 1>write scientific manuscripts and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of embodying my pref professorial</v>

605
00:34:30.271 --> 00:34:33.690
<v Speaker 1>role and then that's part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically being a productive</v>

606
00:34:33.691 --> 00:34:36.240
<v Speaker 1>citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although some of you might differ with</v>

607
00:34:36.241 --> 00:34:38.610
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that I'm a professor and then</v>

608
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.510
<v Speaker 1>perhaps on outside of that or this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think is on outside of that is</v>

609
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm confronting the unknown and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

610
00:34:45.871 --> 00:34:46.704
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

611
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.480
<v Speaker 1>what are you really doing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing a sentence and the answer to</v>

612
00:34:50.481 --> 00:34:53.390
<v Speaker 1>that is you're doing all of these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>better or worse and if you're doing a</v>

613
00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:56.600
<v Speaker 1>really good job of writing a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing all of them at once and</v>

614
00:34:56.601 --> 00:34:58.910
<v Speaker 1>that would be one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make the sentence particularly</v>

615
00:34:58.911 --> 00:35:00.410
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

616
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.260
<v Speaker 1>if something anomalous occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

617
00:35:03.261 --> 00:35:06.110
<v Speaker 1>let's say the tee on my typewriter gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck,</v>

618
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.620
<v Speaker 1>well that's gonna irritate me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can't type a sentence now,</v>

619
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:11.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to irritate me too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

620
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:15.200
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really interfere with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to be a productive citizen.</v>

621
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.980
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to estimate the magnitude</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how upset I should be when something</v>

622
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:27.520
<v Speaker 1>unknown occurs by estimating where in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy of action that normally is</v>

623
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.220
<v Speaker 1>disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

624
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:32.870
<v Speaker 1>so let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me run you through this again.</v>

625
00:35:32.871 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 1>So let's say</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a good person and you might think</v>

626
00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 1>of that from an objective perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that would be a mistake because our</v>

627
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:47.211
<v Speaker 1>quality like good is a pragmatic quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's based on action not on object.</v>

628
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.640
<v Speaker 1>So here's how you decompose being a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

629
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:52.103
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

630
00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.750
<v Speaker 1>a good person is a good parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than that,</v>

631
00:35:56.751 --> 00:36:00.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a subcomponent right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And good parent is someone who has a job</v>

632
00:36:00.411 --> 00:36:03.500
<v Speaker 1>and takes care of their family and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who takes care of their</v>

633
00:36:03.501 --> 00:36:06.440
<v Speaker 1>family is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can play with the baby or they can</v>

634
00:36:06.441 --> 00:36:08.960
<v Speaker 1>complete a meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are abstract concepts.</v>

635
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell a four year old make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>meal and the reason you can't,</v>

636
00:36:12.441 --> 00:36:15.110
<v Speaker 1>just because they don't know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate components of making a meal,</v>

637
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.690
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that fork.</v>

638
00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully they know what a fork is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that fork?</v>

639
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up that work and bring that forth</v>

640
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.370
<v Speaker 1>to the table and put it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can do that because their nervous</v>

641
00:36:28.371 --> 00:36:31.730
<v Speaker 1>system is organized enough to operate at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that level of abstraction,</v>

642
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:34.550
<v Speaker 1>but they can't do something like make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>meal,</v>

643
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.661
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

644
00:36:35.661 --> 00:36:37.820
<v Speaker 1>if you've got a three year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't put them in their room and you</v>

645
00:36:37.821 --> 00:36:39.140
<v Speaker 1>say clean up your room.</v>

646
00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.390
<v Speaker 1>He'll just look at you and then when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come back,</v>

647
00:36:41.391 --> 00:36:44.060
<v Speaker 1>when you come back in half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll look at you again.</v>

648
00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.580
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey kid,</v>

649
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.890
<v Speaker 1>see that teddy bear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

650
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:53.510
<v Speaker 1>pick up the teddy bear and put it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that space in the wall and then once you</v>

651
00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:57.050
<v Speaker 1>teach the three year old how to do 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things and they got it,</v>

652
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:59.360
<v Speaker 1>they've got a little motor routines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

653
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.420
<v Speaker 1>clean the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can encapsulate that entire set of</v>

654
00:37:02.421 --> 00:37:04.460
<v Speaker 1>motor routines within the higher order</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept,</v>

655
00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:07.340
<v Speaker 1>so if you're being a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that is,</v>

656
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're making a meal and part of</v>

657
00:37:09.351 --> 00:37:11.810
<v Speaker 1>that would be while you're cutting up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vegetables,</v>

658
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.560
<v Speaker 1>but then things get interesting because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're cutting up the vegetables,</v>

659
00:37:15.561 --> 00:37:19.220
<v Speaker 1>what you're actually doing is gripping</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and moving and then that's no</v>

660
00:37:19.221 --> 00:37:20.780
<v Speaker 1>longer abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

661
00:37:20.781 --> 00:37:25.190
<v Speaker 1>That's where your conceptual</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical presuppositions like be a</v>

662
00:37:25.191 --> 00:37:30.191
<v Speaker 1>good person hit the roof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the hit the level of embodied</v>

663
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:34.250
<v Speaker 1>material reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the disillusion of the mind into</v>

664
00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:36.500
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

665
00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.750
<v Speaker 1>if someone says to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should cut those vegetables more</v>

666
00:37:41.751 --> 00:37:44.570
<v Speaker 1>thinly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might irritate you,</v>

667
00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:50.020
<v Speaker 1>but if they say you're a bad parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe observing the same phenomena,</v>

668
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.780
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to get into a fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and so,</v>

669
00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.410
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is obviously if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of cutting the</v>

670
00:37:57.411 --> 00:37:58.680
<v Speaker 1>vegetables thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

671
00:37:58.681 --> 00:38:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you have to do is make a minor</v>
<v Speaker 1>modification in the hierarchy that</v>

672
00:38:02.001 --> 00:38:03.350
<v Speaker 1>constitutes yourself</v>

673
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.090
<v Speaker 1>representation or really yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a representation,</v>

674
00:38:08.091 --> 00:38:11.900
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if that's true,</v>

675
00:38:11.901 --> 00:38:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you've got a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of repair work to do,</v>

676
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:19.490
<v Speaker 1>a lot of your world is fallen apart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as things fall apart,</v>

677
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.310
<v Speaker 1>which they always do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in chaos and as soon as you're in</v>

678
00:38:22.311 --> 00:38:25.520
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your body defaults to emergency</v>

679
00:38:25.521 --> 00:38:28.580
<v Speaker 1>preparation and you're stressed and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stressed long enough then you</v>

680
00:38:28.581 --> 00:38:31.910
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't like that stress.</v>

681
00:38:31.911 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Say when your body gets stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is because it doesn't</v>

682
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:38.200
<v Speaker 1>really know what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it prepares for everything.</v>

683
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the generalized stress response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cortisol production does that.</v>

684
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Cortisol production is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wakes you up in the morning,</v>

685
00:38:44.741 --> 00:38:49.741
<v Speaker 1>but if it's chronic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get old like it's so general and</v>

686
00:38:50.711 --> 00:38:55.711
<v Speaker 1>it's negative actions that the best way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to conceptualize it's detrimental</v>

687
00:38:55.991 --> 00:38:58.280
<v Speaker 1>longterm effect is that it accelerates</v>
<v Speaker 1>aging,</v>

688
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.050
<v Speaker 1>so it makes you more likely to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease and cancer and depression</v>

689
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:07.051
<v Speaker 1>and Alzheimer's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes and obesity.</v>

690
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:11.300
<v Speaker 1>That'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enough.</v>

691
00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Any of those that are enough to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

692
00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.220
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a hierarchy.</v>

693
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:19.490
<v Speaker 1>That's a hierarchy of values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The higher the value,</v>

694
00:39:19.491 --> 00:39:22.370
<v Speaker 1>the more the less you want to have it</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupted.</v>

695
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.233
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

696
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:29.760
<v Speaker 1>was it a psychologist named piaget?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you might know about him.</v>

697
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Piaget was very interested in what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to value structures and their</v>

698
00:39:39.231 --> 00:39:44.231
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical organization once they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to apply outside of the confines of a</v>

699
00:39:44.871 --> 00:39:45.704
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

700
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two year olds basically hypothalamic.</v>

701
00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.710
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First they're happy,</v>

702
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.970
<v Speaker 1>they're sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're hungry,</v>

703
00:39:52.971 --> 00:39:53.970
<v Speaker 1>then they're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

704
00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:59.000
<v Speaker 1>they just zipped from one pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward and rather are inspiring</v>

705
00:39:59.001 --> 00:40:03.020
<v Speaker 1>motivational state to another and but at</v>
<v Speaker 1>two they can't play.</v>

706
00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.400
<v Speaker 1>They can play with by themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't play with other children.</v>

707
00:40:07.401 --> 00:40:11.150
<v Speaker 1>They can't get that until they're three</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they need to get it by the time</v>

708
00:40:11.151 --> 00:40:13.790
<v Speaker 1>they're three because if they don't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it by the time they're four,</v>

709
00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.730
<v Speaker 1>they will never get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have an antisocial kid</v>

710
00:40:16.731 --> 00:40:20.360
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be an outsider for his</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire life and there isn't anything you</v>

711
00:40:20.361 --> 00:40:21.194
<v Speaker 1>can do about it.</v>

712
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.420
<v Speaker 1>So that has to happen between two and</v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

713
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.660
<v Speaker 1>So what happens at about age three is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the kid learns how to play a game</v>

714
00:40:26.661 --> 00:40:28.890
<v Speaker 1>with another person and what that game</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

715
00:40:28.891 --> 00:40:33.260
<v Speaker 1>it's fundamentally the development of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to share a frame of</v>

716
00:40:33.261 --> 00:40:35.450
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you're doing when you play</v>

717
00:40:35.451 --> 00:40:38.300
<v Speaker 1>monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's stupid to play monopoly.</v>

718
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares if you have a whole pile of</v>

719
00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.160
<v Speaker 1>counterfeit paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

720
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:48.290
<v Speaker 1>But doesn't matter because the way your</v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted is that your brain will</v>

721
00:40:48.291 --> 00:40:53.291
<v Speaker 1>treat anything you act like constitutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a valuable goal as if it's a valid</v>

722
00:40:54.441 --> 00:40:56.480
<v Speaker 1>framework of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it couldn't do that,</v>

723
00:40:56.481 --> 00:41:00.170
<v Speaker 1>a you couldn't abstract and B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could not get along with other</v>

724
00:41:00.171 --> 00:41:02.420
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can sit around the table and you</v>

725
00:41:02.421 --> 00:41:06.620
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's pretend that monopoly is a</v>

726
00:41:06.621 --> 00:41:09.740
<v Speaker 1>reasonable facsimile of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you wouldn't say,</v>

727
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's what you mean.</v>

728
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.380
<v Speaker 1>And everybody says yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a music.</v>

729
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:19.910
<v Speaker 1>And so then you set your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to get all the little hotels</v>

730
00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and all the money and play with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

731
00:41:22.491 --> 00:41:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Go along for the ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's so interesting about that is</v>

732
00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:28.460
<v Speaker 1>you can get everybody into the game and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that's really</v>

733
00:41:28.461 --> 00:41:32.300
<v Speaker 1>interesting about people is that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish a shared fictional frame of</v>

734
00:41:32.301 --> 00:41:34.820
<v Speaker 1>reference and it organizes all our</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

735
00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 1>So they're predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also why we can watch movies.</v>

736
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.730
<v Speaker 1>You go to a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you identify the hero,</v>

737
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:43.030
<v Speaker 1>you figure out what the hero wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

738
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:47.000
<v Speaker 1>you're the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that works is you don't look</v>

739
00:41:47.001 --> 00:41:50.990
<v Speaker 1>at the hero and think about what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and evaluated emotionally and then</v>

740
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:53.840
<v Speaker 1>feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you specify the hero's</v>

741
00:41:53.841 --> 00:41:58.160
<v Speaker 1>goal and then you map them onto your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body and you read off the emotional</v>

742
00:41:58.161 --> 00:41:59.510
<v Speaker 1>responses of your own body.</v>

743
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you understand the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an embodied,</v>

744
00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.670
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're using your,</v>

745
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:11.030
<v Speaker 1>your embodiment as a computational</v>
<v Speaker 1>device that can run simulations of other</v>

746
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 1>consciousnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it does that with the body.</v>

747
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.040
<v Speaker 1>And we like doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to a movie and you know</v>

748
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:20.840
<v Speaker 1>you're Brad Pitt for an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

749
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 1>when you're Brad Pitt doing remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

750
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:26.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's also how we understand other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were very good at that.</v>

751
00:42:26.751 --> 00:42:28.760
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have these shared frames of reference</v>

752
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 1>like when we were playing monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

753
00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:34.580
<v Speaker 1>So children at three learn how to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>games and that means they learn how to</v>

754
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:39.581
<v Speaker 1>organize their own internal motivational</v>
<v Speaker 1>states into a hierarchy that includes</v>

755
00:42:39.921 --> 00:42:43.850
<v Speaker 1>the motivational states of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means they can play.</v>

756
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you guys do when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the world.</v>

757
00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Like we're playing a game right now.</v>

758
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.050
<v Speaker 1>We all know the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we can all sit in this room</v>

759
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.240
<v Speaker 1>and play the game without fighting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

760
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the room is set up like a theater and</v>

761
00:42:55.941 --> 00:43:00.290
<v Speaker 1>we all know the theater game and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the chairs are always facing this</v>

762
00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 1>way at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a hint that you should</v>

763
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:04.690
<v Speaker 1>look forward and this is raised so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

764
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:08.840
<v Speaker 1>the room is basically telling you what</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do because it's a stage like all</v>

765
00:43:08.841 --> 00:43:11.240
<v Speaker 1>rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because you're smart and socially</v>

766
00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can walk into a stage,</v>

767
00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:17.300
<v Speaker 1>grew and your body knows what to do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're civilized in social,</v>

768
00:43:17.301 --> 00:43:19.730
<v Speaker 1>you just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all the other primates can predict</v>

769
00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:21.950
<v Speaker 1>what you're up to and they won't kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

770
00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's what it means to be part of</v>

771
00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:28.670
<v Speaker 1>the same tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when people are very peculiar</v>

772
00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:30.830
<v Speaker 1>creatures and God only knows what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're up to,</v>

773
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.440
<v Speaker 1>but as long as they're playing the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>game you are.</v>

774
00:43:33.441 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to know what they're up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to because you can predict what they're</v>

775
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 1>going to do and you understand their</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational states and so part of the</v>

776
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:43.250
<v Speaker 1>building and constructing of higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>order motive,</v>

777
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:48.490
<v Speaker 1>higher order moral goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the establishment of joint frames of</v>

778
00:43:50.691 --> 00:43:54.710
<v Speaker 1>reference that allow multiple people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue the goals that they're interested</v>

779
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:58.010
<v Speaker 1>in simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what you have to think about</v>

780
00:43:58.011 --> 00:44:02.300
<v Speaker 1>with regards to that is that not all</v>
<v Speaker 1>shared frames of reference can manage</v>

781
00:44:02.301 --> 00:44:04.940
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a small subset of them that are</v>

782
00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:08.570
<v Speaker 1>optimized so that not only can multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>people play them,</v>

783
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:11.690
<v Speaker 1>but multiple people can play them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy them.</v>

784
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.200
<v Speaker 1>And do it repeatedly across a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>

785
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:19.970
<v Speaker 1>so it's integratability that partly</v>
<v Speaker 1>defines the utility of a higher order</v>

786
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Speaker 1>moral structure and that is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>

787
00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.050
<v Speaker 1>It's an emergent property of biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions and you might say,</v>

788
00:44:27.051 --> 00:44:29.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of arbitrary because people</v>

789
00:44:29.091 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>can do what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not arbitrary at all because a</v>

790
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:36.690
<v Speaker 1>lot of what's constraining your games is</v>
<v Speaker 1>your motivational substructure and those</v>

791
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:40.560
<v Speaker 1>ancient circuits that are status</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented and they operate within</v>

792
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 1>virtually every animal has a status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Counter creatures organize themselves</v>

793
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:50.040
<v Speaker 1>into dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason they do that is because that</v>

794
00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:52.320
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a solution.</v>

795
00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:55.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a solution to the Darwinian problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>of existence.</v>

796
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not just an empathy phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the real thing.</v>

797
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your environment,</v>

798
00:45:01.891 --> 00:45:05.910
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally a huge chunk of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment is dominance hierarchy plus</v>

799
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.360
<v Speaker 1>God only knows where you are and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>order and chaos.</v>

800
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.750
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that people fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>to preserve their dominance hierarchies</v>

801
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:17.100
<v Speaker 1>is because it's better to be a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what the hell is going on than</v>

802
00:45:17.101 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 1>someone who's thrown screaming and naked</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the jungle at night.</v>

803
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:23.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's the difference between order</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaos,</v>

804
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:27.660
<v Speaker 1>and we like order better than chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder now we'll invite a little</v>

805
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 1>chaos in for entertainment now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it has to be done voluntarily.</v>

806
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:36.240
<v Speaker 1>And generally you don't want the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos that upsets your entire conceptual</v>

807
00:45:36.241 --> 00:45:37.290
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

808
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to fool around on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fringes a little bit,</v>

809
00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:41.490
<v Speaker 1>but you know when the going gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>

810
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:44.490
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty much likely to bail out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder.</v>

811
00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Now I wanted to tell you a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about</v>

812
00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:53.800
<v Speaker 1>this chaotic domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you a couple of things about</v>

813
00:45:53.801 --> 00:45:54.634
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

814
00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.860
<v Speaker 1>It's the underworld of mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's kind of</v>

815
00:45:59.861 --> 00:46:03.130
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the underworld is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a suburb and one of the suburbs</v>

816
00:46:03.131 --> 00:46:07.840
<v Speaker 1>of the underworld is hell and hell is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place where you end up when</v>

817
00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:13.860
<v Speaker 1>everything that you know falls apart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get resentful and bitter about it.</v>

818
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:15.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I.</v>

819
00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.330
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've noticed in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>work as a clinical psychologist,</v>

820
00:46:19.331 --> 00:46:23.380
<v Speaker 1>that there's two things that really do</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in three lying.</v>

821
00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.400
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apart from that resentment and</v>

822
00:46:27.401 --> 00:46:29.920
<v Speaker 1>arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get resentful enough,</v>

823
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:34.750
<v Speaker 1>you end up like Elliot Rogers and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those other people who go on random</v>

824
00:46:34.751 --> 00:46:38.200
<v Speaker 1>shooting sprees because they have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreement about the structure of the</v>

825
00:46:38.201 --> 00:46:41.770
<v Speaker 1>exist of existence and the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ended up hypothetically at the</v>

826
00:46:41.771 --> 00:46:45.190
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the heap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are real places and people get</v>

827
00:46:45.191 --> 00:46:49.390
<v Speaker 1>stuck in them and they are not places</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would voluntarily choose to go</v>

828
00:46:49.391 --> 00:46:51.190
<v Speaker 1>if you had any sense at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you,</v>

829
00:46:51.191 --> 00:46:55.660
<v Speaker 1>if you read the accounts of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do random mass murder,</v>

830
00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:59.470
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you exactly where they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll tell you exactly what</v>

831
00:46:59.471 --> 00:47:03.280
<v Speaker 1>they're motivated to do and what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated to do is take as much revenge</v>

832
00:47:03.281 --> 00:47:04.960
<v Speaker 1>on existence as they possibly could.</v>

833
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Imagine in the most unfair possible way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fast as they can possibly manage it,</v>

834
00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.760
<v Speaker 1>and that's their conscious aim and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

835
00:47:12.761 --> 00:47:16.240
<v Speaker 1>not a form of insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know exactly what they're doing.</v>

836
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.270
<v Speaker 1>They have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a precise idea of what they're</v>

837
00:47:19.271 --> 00:47:23.140
<v Speaker 1>in the APP and it's a deep archetypal</v>
<v Speaker 1>possession,</v>

838
00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.640
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word.</v>

839
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.273
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

840
00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you how some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are mapped</v>

841
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.340
<v Speaker 1>symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not really symbols in my</v>

842
00:47:40.341 --> 00:47:45.341
<v Speaker 1>estimation because assemble implies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>something is being represented.</v>

843
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:49.580
<v Speaker 1>You know that there's a reality behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>the representation that's broader than</v>

844
00:47:49.581 --> 00:47:52.010
<v Speaker 1>the representation and assemble is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shadow of it.</v>

845
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.700
<v Speaker 1>These aren't symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their representations that are as</v>

846
00:47:55.701 --> 00:48:00.701
<v Speaker 1>accurate as they can possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with something that's rather</v>

847
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:10.650
<v Speaker 1>easy to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's try.</v>

848
00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you look at her</v>

849
00:48:18.511 --> 00:48:19.344
<v Speaker 1>Medusa?</v>

850
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.700
<v Speaker 1>You turned to stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when your rabbit sees a</v>

851
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:27.550
<v Speaker 1>wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

852
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:29.230
<v Speaker 1>It turns to stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

853
00:48:29.231 --> 00:48:34.231
<v Speaker 1>The Medusa is a symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a representation of all those</v>

854
00:48:34.601 --> 00:48:37.000
<v Speaker 1>things that make you turn to stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at them.</v>

855
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:38.403
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

856
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:41.020
<v Speaker 1>animals can deal with threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

857
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 1>They have instincts to deal with threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but zebras,</v>

858
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:48.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a bunch of zebras and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out there and heard and there's</v>

859
00:48:48.641 --> 00:48:50.200
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of lines and they're right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

860
00:48:50.201 --> 00:48:51.700
<v Speaker 1>and the zebras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>

861
00:48:51.701 --> 00:48:53.380
<v Speaker 1>They're grazing and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

862
00:48:53.381 --> 00:48:55.780
<v Speaker 1>those zebras aren't very bright because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of lions,</v>

863
00:48:55.781 --> 00:48:56.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't they,</v>

864
00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the forest building a Fort Pete Lyons</v>

865
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.630
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

866
00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:03.850
<v Speaker 1>the reason they're not doing that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because although they can react to</v>

867
00:49:03.851 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cannot conceive to the of the class</v>

868
00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:12.040
<v Speaker 1>of threatening objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now human beings can conceive of the</v>

869
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:17.070
<v Speaker 1>class of threatening objects and so what</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization is in large part is an</v>

870
00:49:17.111 --> 00:49:20.980
<v Speaker 1>attempt to find a remedy for the class</v>
<v Speaker 1>of threatening objects.</v>

871
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Now there are representations of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things.</v>

872
00:49:23.651 --> 00:49:26.680
<v Speaker 1>The Medusa is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason it's feminine is very</v>

873
00:49:26.681 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 1>difficult to explain and I don't think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the time unfortunately,</v>

874
00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:34.240
<v Speaker 1>but you'll have to take my word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the little cartoon of Robert</v>

875
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Crumb off to the left there and he's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big eatable problem,</v>

876
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:41.130
<v Speaker 1>old rob chrome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with him fundamentally</v>

877
00:49:41.131 --> 00:49:44.620
<v Speaker 1>as his mother was something like a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>spider and did everything she possibly</v>

878
00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:46.930
<v Speaker 1>could to crush the life out of him</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

879
00:49:46.931 --> 00:49:50.820
<v Speaker 1>his remaining relationship with women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the reason why the</v>

880
00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:55.830
<v Speaker 1>femininity can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that turns you to stone.</v>

881
00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.770
<v Speaker 1>It's an experience that many men are</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with by the way,</v>

882
00:49:59.771 --> 00:50:03.760
<v Speaker 1>because the average man is rejected far</v>
<v Speaker 1>more often than he's accepted.</v>

883
00:50:03.761 --> 00:50:06.790
<v Speaker 1>And since women are the gateway to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction,</v>

884
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:12.090
<v Speaker 1>they constitute nature itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Nature itself tells most men you</v>

885
00:50:12.371 --> 00:50:17.371
<v Speaker 1>should go home and stay under your bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of experiments done about</v>

886
00:50:18.401 --> 00:50:19.450
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

887
00:50:19.451 --> 00:50:23.110
<v Speaker 1>psychologists have an undergraduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman go out into the concourse and see</v>

888
00:50:23.111 --> 00:50:25.810
<v Speaker 1>how long it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone heard to find someone who agrees</v>

889
00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>to sleep with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it takes like,</v>

890
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:28.814
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

891
00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:33.480
<v Speaker 1>two seconds after she asks the first man</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

892
00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:36.180
<v Speaker 1>and then they flip it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

893
00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:39.160
<v Speaker 1>and they get your random undergraduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy to do the same thing.</v>

894
00:50:39.161 --> 00:50:40.930
<v Speaker 1>It's well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine the consequences of</v>

895
00:50:40.931 --> 00:50:43.840
<v Speaker 1>that since many of you men have lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>

896
00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.240
<v Speaker 1>mother nature with a woman wears the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face of Mother Nature and the face his</v>

897
00:50:51.911 --> 00:50:54.190
<v Speaker 1>generally rejecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially to men who are low in the</v>

898
00:50:54.191 --> 00:50:56.560
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that</v>

899
00:50:56.561 --> 00:51:00.010
<v Speaker 1>irritates guys like Elliot Rogers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that motivates their</v>

900
00:51:00.011 --> 00:51:03.010
<v Speaker 1>desire to take revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a universal phenomenon,</v>

901
00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:08.290
<v Speaker 1>so that's part of the reason that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine is nature and why nature.</v>

902
00:51:08.291 --> 00:51:10.330
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mother nature is like,</v>

903
00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:15.010
<v Speaker 1>it's diagnosis of your status is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>good enough and no wonder</v>

904
00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:23.860
<v Speaker 1>what seems to have happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally is that these domains that</v>

905
00:51:23.861 --> 00:51:26.980
<v Speaker 1>I talked to you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can be represented as chaos and</v>

906
00:51:26.981 --> 00:51:30.700
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say an r from the that was perspective</v>

907
00:51:30.701 --> 00:51:33.160
<v Speaker 1>can also be represented as masculine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

908
00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.220
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is that</v>

909
00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.000
<v Speaker 1>human beings are fundamentally social</v>
<v Speaker 1>primates,</v>

910
00:51:40.001 --> 00:51:40.691
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very,</v>

911
00:51:40.691 --> 00:51:45.610
<v Speaker 1>very social and we know that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlates of brain size in primates,</v>

912
00:51:45.611 --> 00:51:48.880
<v Speaker 1>the social group size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also know that most primates say</v>

913
00:51:48.881 --> 00:51:52.930
<v Speaker 1>chimps who were quite closely related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like go out and investigate</v>

914
00:51:52.931 --> 00:51:55.060
<v Speaker 1>leaves and you know period things</v>
<v Speaker 1>through microscopes.</v>

915
00:51:55.061 --> 00:51:58.150
<v Speaker 1>They spend all their time interacting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other chimpanzees.</v>

916
00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Although they're chewing all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it because they have a</v>

917
00:52:00.731 --> 00:52:02.730
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously ineffective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

918
00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:07.740
<v Speaker 1>digestive and an eating system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their brain is adapted</v>

919
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.200
<v Speaker 1>to the social circumstances as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary reality.</v>

920
00:52:14.201 --> 00:52:15.011
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

921
00:52:15.011 --> 00:52:18.840
<v Speaker 1>tribe is the primary reality and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a secondary reality which is all</v>

922
00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:23.260
<v Speaker 1>that which is outside tribe and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>corresponds to chaos and order.</v>

923
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Order in contradiction to chaos is</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolized by masculine symbols.</v>

924
00:52:31.211 --> 00:52:36.211
<v Speaker 1>And that's for example why etiologies</v>
<v Speaker 1>like radical feminism presume the</v>

925
00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:40.040
<v Speaker 1>existence of a patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fits into the symbolic structure of</v>

926
00:52:40.041 --> 00:52:41.150
<v Speaker 1>our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That idea,</v>

927
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's true in some sense because just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in chimpanzee troops,</v>

928
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.430
<v Speaker 1>the primary or Metta hierarchy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes up human civilization is</v>

929
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:54.050
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally masculine in its origin</v>
<v Speaker 1>and structure and so masculine is</v>

930
00:52:54.051 --> 00:52:58.010
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally the dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Feminine is some fundamentally all</v>

931
00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:01.880
<v Speaker 1>the things that are outside or that</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged the dominance hierarchy and</v>

932
00:53:01.881 --> 00:53:03.530
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a perfectly reasonable,</v>

933
00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:08.531
<v Speaker 1>it's weird a because our brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized to fundamentally apprehend the</v>

934
00:53:09.681 --> 00:53:12.950
<v Speaker 1>world in terms of personalities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly because you know,</v>

935
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.680
<v Speaker 1>as we've emerged over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>

936
00:53:15.681 --> 00:53:19.010
<v Speaker 1>it's been relatively constant that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were males around and that there were</v>

937
00:53:19.011 --> 00:53:22.850
<v Speaker 1>females around and that the males were</v>
<v Speaker 1>fathers and that the females were</v>

938
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>mothers and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were both mates as well.</v>

939
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a constant of the evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape and that's what our brains</v>

940
00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:32.550
<v Speaker 1>evolved to process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happened when we developed</v>

941
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:37.790
<v Speaker 1>the capacity to abstract is we use this</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying social cognitive abstraction</v>

942
00:53:39.591 --> 00:53:43.830
<v Speaker 1>structure to start to represent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of being itself.</v>

943
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:45.210
<v Speaker 1>So we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

944
00:53:45.211 --> 00:53:48.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a dominance hierarchy in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>society and that's masculine and there's</v>

945
00:53:48.781 --> 00:53:52.020
<v Speaker 1>all the things that challenge the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy and they're outside</v>

946
00:53:52.021 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 1>in their feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weirdest thing about that,</v>

947
00:53:55.171 --> 00:53:57.480
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it actually works.</v>

948
00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got away with that for some</v>

949
00:54:00.391 --> 00:54:02.670
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be perfectly reasonable to</v>

950
00:54:02.671 --> 00:54:05.640
<v Speaker 1>map the world in that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keeps us going.</v>

951
00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:19.500
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to explain this.</v>

952
00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:24.501
<v Speaker 1>This is nail chemical symbol</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of the symbol.</v>

953
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:32.090
<v Speaker 1>There's this round thing with wings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see Harry Potter?</v>

954
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the game quidditch.</v>

955
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:39.720
<v Speaker 1>You remember what they chase chase a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold one of those.</v>

956
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.960
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they call that the snitch,</v>

957
00:54:42.961 --> 00:54:44.930
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's little fragment of soil and</v>

958
00:54:44.931 --> 00:54:48.030
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting idea because for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alchemists,</v>

959
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:51.750
<v Speaker 1>the primary element of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that was could be</v>

960
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as this thing is round</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and what it was conceptualized</v>

961
00:54:56.281 --> 00:54:57.510
<v Speaker 1>have in part was</v>

962
00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:02.920
<v Speaker 1>it was a container from which matter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit could emerge and what you might</v>

963
00:55:02.921 --> 00:55:03.251
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

964
00:55:03.251 --> 00:55:06.400
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it means.</v>

965
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:13.210
<v Speaker 1>When a child experiences something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't predict.</v>

966
00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:18.850
<v Speaker 1>It does the thing that led to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertain outcome over and over and over</v>

967
00:55:18.851 --> 00:55:21.820
<v Speaker 1>and over until it can map it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>

968
00:55:21.821 --> 00:55:23.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did the child do?</v>

969
00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:28.350
<v Speaker 1>What the child did was take the domain</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that which it did not understand and</v>

970
00:55:28.541 --> 00:55:31.990
<v Speaker 1>it transformed it into matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the predictable world of</v>

971
00:55:31.991 --> 00:55:35.470
<v Speaker 1>entities and spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the internal psychological</v>

972
00:55:35.471 --> 00:55:39.070
<v Speaker 1>structure that's adapted to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what the alchemists basically</v>

973
00:55:39.071 --> 00:55:44.071
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exists outside of your conceptual</v>

974
00:55:45.991 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 1>framework is something like unrealized</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential,</v>

975
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.620
<v Speaker 1>and when you interact with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>unrealized potential,</v>

976
00:55:52.621 --> 00:55:55.890
<v Speaker 1>you actualize it and you actualize it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into two component elements,</v>

977
00:55:55.891 --> 00:55:59.700
<v Speaker 1>one being the material world and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other being your own psychological</v>

978
00:55:59.701 --> 00:56:02.580
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they conceptualized matter</v>

979
00:56:02.581 --> 00:56:05.730
<v Speaker 1>and spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>container of matter and spirit as the</v>

980
00:56:05.731 --> 00:56:08.340
<v Speaker 1>ultimate reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and out of that emerged something that</v>

981
00:56:08.341 --> 00:56:10.440
<v Speaker 1>was quite primordial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the dragon.</v>

982
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we know</v>

983
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:17.660
<v Speaker 1>you remember in the genesis story,</v>

984
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 1>it's the snake that gives people vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>

985
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:27.010
<v Speaker 1>It gives him wisdom and it also produces</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfconsciousness.</v>

986
00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a woman named Lynn Isabelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an anthropologist in La and she</v>

987
00:56:33.751 --> 00:56:36.630
<v Speaker 1>was very interested in human being site</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we can really see,</v>

988
00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:39.990
<v Speaker 1>we can see better than any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>creature except predatory birds.</v>

989
00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:42.450
<v Speaker 1>We can see way better than most</v>
<v Speaker 1>primates.</v>

990
00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Isabelle knew that our tree dwelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors,</v>

991
00:56:46.941 --> 00:56:50.510
<v Speaker 1>some 60 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged at about the same time as</v>

992
00:56:50.511 --> 00:56:53.570
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're younger than lizards by the way,</v>

993
00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:58.160
<v Speaker 1>and that we were preyed on quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely by snakes for tens of millions</v>

994
00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.810
<v Speaker 1>of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she also knew that we were good at</v>

995
00:56:59.811 --> 00:57:02.120
<v Speaker 1>detecting snakes in the bottom of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual field,</v>

996
00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:05.900
<v Speaker 1>and then we were particularly good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting the camouflage patterns of</v>

997
00:57:05.901 --> 00:57:07.640
<v Speaker 1>snakes and the bottom of our visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

998
00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:12.680
<v Speaker 1>So she did a series of field experiments</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that primate visual acuity was</v>

999
00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:16.430
<v Speaker 1>correlated strongly with the presence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory snakes in the immediate</v>

1000
00:57:16.431 --> 00:57:21.431
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that snakes gave us vision</v>

1001
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:24.590
<v Speaker 1>is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that relevant to this?</v>

1002
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:30.860
<v Speaker 1>We were preyed upon for a very long</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time and we developed a neural</v>

1003
00:57:30.861 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 1>circuit to deal with predators and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the neural circuit that's</v>

1004
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:38.230
<v Speaker 1>activated and children when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified about monsters at night.</v>

1005
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:43.060
<v Speaker 1>So the Predator entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this dragon,</v>

1006
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.780
<v Speaker 1>it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an amalgam of predatory forces</v>

1007
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.190
<v Speaker 1>is one of the manifestations of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that exist outside of the</v>

1008
00:57:51.191 --> 00:57:52.700
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a.</v>

1009
00:57:52.701 --> 00:57:56.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of primordial reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not abstract anymore like the</v>

1010
00:57:56.411 --> 00:57:59.860
<v Speaker 1>matter and spirit container.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the first practical</v>

1011
00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:04.270
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of what's terrifying and</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening concretely outside that,</v>

1012
00:58:04.271 --> 00:58:08.980
<v Speaker 1>and so remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals can respond to threat,</v>

1013
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:11.590
<v Speaker 1>but they can't conceptualize threat as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

1014
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the conceptualization of threat</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a category.</v>

1015
00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It emerges from the absolute unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It manifests itself as threat.</v>

1016
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hear a loud noise behind you or a</v>

1017
00:58:22.901 --> 00:58:26.350
<v Speaker 1>grow when you're in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens is you</v>

1018
00:58:26.351 --> 00:58:29.800
<v Speaker 1>don't know what's going on and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the initial state of contact with</v>

1019
00:58:29.801 --> 00:58:33.220
<v Speaker 1>potential and then if you turn around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you look,</v>

1020
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:36.910
<v Speaker 1>that potential manifests itself into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's predatory and you have</v>

1021
00:58:36.911 --> 00:58:41.110
<v Speaker 1>a circuit for that and that's the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit that we now use to assess</v>

1022
00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:44.980
<v Speaker 1>anything unexpected that it occurs to us</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that circuit had become from</v>

1023
00:58:44.981 --> 00:58:45.814
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

1024
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:50.800
<v Speaker 1>And so our capacity to respond to</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising entities is an elaboration</v>

1025
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:55.870
<v Speaker 1>elaboration up into abstraction of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to identify predators.</v>

1026
00:58:56.170 --> 00:59:01.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's the next level of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And out of that chaotic circumstance</v>

1027
00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:07.590
<v Speaker 1>comes something that's more human and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that is the emergence of</v>

1028
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:12.010
<v Speaker 1>masculinity and femininity out out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that more primordial element.</v>

1029
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:22.343
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1030
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Let me show you two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a map of</v>

1031
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.490
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic territory as far as I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

1032
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 1>It's the territory that people actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit at the first level.</v>

1033
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:47.930
<v Speaker 1>It's the square I called that the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos.</v>

1034
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:53.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the unknown as such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the thing that you fall into</v>

1035
00:59:53.991 --> 00:59:56.060
<v Speaker 1>when you're conceptual schemes fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

1036
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.500
<v Speaker 1>What manifests itself out of that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>femininity and femininity comes in two</v>

1037
01:00:04.181 --> 01:00:06.610
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is benevolent femininity.</v>

1038
01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Example would be</v>

1039
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.453
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1040
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>You see Mary on the left there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's in a structure called a man door</v>

1041
01:00:15.901 --> 01:00:18.890
<v Speaker 1>lock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is from a Freudian perspective,</v>

1042
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:23.300
<v Speaker 1>has obvious sexual connotations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

1043
01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>if you look carefully that she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing on a reptile and holding her</v>

1044
01:00:27.321 --> 01:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>child away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a common medieval Christian</v>

1045
01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think of it as divine because</v>

1046
01:00:33.361 --> 01:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>women's spent an awful lot of time doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with their children over the course</v>

1047
01:00:36.331 --> 01:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>of our millions of years of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that's sacred because</v>

1048
01:00:40.081 --> 01:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>our species dependent on that for its</v>
<v Speaker 1>for its survival,</v>

1049
01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>this one's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a medieval image.</v>

1050
01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I love this image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's Mary with the Christ child</v>

1051
01:00:50.251 --> 01:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>and she standing again on a reptile</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory rep top,</v>

1052
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>but in the background you see all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird little shapes.</v>

1053
01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Those are musical instruments and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel space and the medieval artists</v>

1054
01:01:03.211 --> 01:01:08.211
<v Speaker 1>who drew this picture had this</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimation that behind the manifestation</v>

1055
01:01:08.971 --> 01:01:13.971
<v Speaker 1>that something as primary as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>protective maternity of Mary was</v>

1056
01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>something like the music of the spheres</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are a collection of harmonious</v>

1057
01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>patterns and that this figure was</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly emerging out of that</v>

1058
01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>background of harmonious patterns across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the infinite stretches of time itself.</v>

1059
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the sacred image because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents something that human society</v>

1060
01:01:34.591 --> 01:01:39.591
<v Speaker 1>cannot live without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like any society that doesn't regard the</v>

1061
01:01:39.661 --> 01:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Virgin and the Child Who protects the</v>
<v Speaker 1>child from the predatory serpent as a</v>

1062
01:01:43.681 --> 01:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>prime element of sacred reality is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make itself estate.</v>

1063
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say for example,</v>

1064
01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>that that's what's happening to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous populations of eastern Europe</v>

1065
01:01:54.631 --> 01:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>at the moment where their birth rate is</v>
<v Speaker 1>far below replacement.</v>

1066
01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you another image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is called a village or open virgin</v>

1067
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>and it was a common representation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval Europe and it's a weird</v>

1068
01:02:11.581 --> 01:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>representation from a Christian</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective because it kind of reverses</v>

1069
01:02:14.791 --> 01:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>the normal hierarchy of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you have here is Mary,</v>

1070
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.230
<v Speaker 2>she's holding the Christ child when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>statute was closed and then you open her</v>

1071
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.580
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you see inside Mary is God the</v>

1072
01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:31.320
<v Speaker 2>father and God the father is holding</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ in his hands.</v>

1073
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.633
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

1074
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Mary constitutes the superordinate</v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolent feminine.</v>

1075
01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Inside her is the structure of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can think inside nature is the</v>

1076
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>structure of culture and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented in this image by God because</v>

1077
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>he's the ultimate father obviously and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian thinking,</v>

1078
01:02:50.701 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>and then the God figure is holding what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crucified individual.</v>

1079
01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:59.910
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all the people around their kings,</v>

1080
01:02:59.911 --> 01:03:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Queens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commenters are all gazing at that</v>

1081
01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:04.650
<v Speaker 1>central figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course is fundamentally what</v>

1082
01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.580
<v Speaker 1>everyone in western civilization has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been doing for 2000 years.</v>

1083
01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Not knowing why</v>

1084
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>nature gives rise to culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culture gives rise to the suffering</v>

1085
01:03:18.131 --> 01:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1086
01:03:19.841 --> 01:03:22.920
<v Speaker 1>that's true enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true for everyone.</v>

1087
01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>It's true for life at every point in</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1088
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>but there's more to the image of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crucifixion because crucifixion also</v>

1089
01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:35.371
<v Speaker 1>represents voluntary acceptance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and voluntary acceptance of</v>

1090
01:03:36.281 --> 01:03:39.190
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also points to something else</v>

1091
01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>that's of paramount importance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that there's an element of the</v>

1092
01:03:43.511 --> 01:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>human psyche that can die and come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and die and come back.</v>

1093
01:03:47.861 --> 01:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you encounter a catastrophe and you</v>

1094
01:03:52.601 --> 01:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>make order of it and you climb back out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the underworld and your.</v>

1095
01:03:56.770 --> 01:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Your voice through life is punctuated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>trips to the underworld.</v>

1096
01:04:00.041 --> 01:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And so you're somewhere and then you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside that and then you go somewhere</v>

1097
01:04:04.001 --> 01:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>else and then you go outside that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens to people is they</v>

1098
01:04:07.901 --> 01:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>generally identify with where they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

1099
01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but order dissolves and collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it reconstitutes itself.</v>

1100
01:04:15.911 --> 01:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are trying to adapt to the</v>

1101
01:04:18.851 --> 01:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>structure of reality itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of identifying with order,</v>

1102
01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>you would identify with a process that</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed you to transform yourself across</v>

1103
01:04:28.181 --> 01:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>repeated bouts of order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what these sorts of images or</v>

1104
01:04:33.011 --> 01:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>trying to represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1105
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:42.870
<v Speaker 1>let me show you</v>
<v Speaker 1>one final idea.</v>

1106
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Here's a taoist idea that's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Dallas symbol,</v>

1107
01:04:54.511 --> 01:04:56.570
<v Speaker 1>you know the dallas symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already talked to you about it and</v>

1108
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you've all seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos and order,</v>

1109
01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.720
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and feminine,</v>

1110
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:06.500
<v Speaker 1>constantly in interplay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Dow from the Taoist perspective.</v>

1111
01:05:07.621 --> 01:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>And Dow is the source of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea there is that it's the</v>

1112
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.080
<v Speaker 1>constant interplay between chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 1>order that produces the sense of meaning</v>

1113
01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:18.490
<v Speaker 1>and human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>

1114
01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.420
<v Speaker 1>That is what produces the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

1115
01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:25.500
<v Speaker 1>You know that because when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in a compelling operation,</v>

1116
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.210
<v Speaker 1>you're partly ordered and secure and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have one foot out into the unknown and</v>

1117
01:05:30.211 --> 01:05:33.600
<v Speaker 1>the balance is proper and as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence you're engaged in what</v>

1118
01:05:33.601 --> 01:05:35.400
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and then as a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

1119
01:05:35.401 --> 01:05:39.480
<v Speaker 1>you lose your self consciousness and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stay engaged in that sort of</v>

1120
01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:43.110
<v Speaker 1>situation on a continual basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that you find that your life is</v>

1121
01:05:43.111 --> 01:05:46.920
<v Speaker 1>meaningful and rich and that's the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidote to the fact that life is</v>

1122
01:05:46.921 --> 01:05:49.530
<v Speaker 1>bounded and full of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1123
01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Tao means meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also means journey and the center of</v>

1124
01:05:54.661 --> 01:05:59.460
<v Speaker 1>the Tao is the place you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be one foot in chaos and one foot in</v>

1125
01:05:59.461 --> 01:06:04.410
<v Speaker 1>order and that's the best place to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual environment itself.</v>

1126
01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Because the actual environment is better</v>
<v Speaker 1>construed as the constant interplay</v>

1127
01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:12.120
<v Speaker 1>between chaos and order than it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>construed as a collection of material</v>

1128
01:06:12.121 --> 01:06:12.954
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>

1129
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:18.340
<v Speaker 1>And if you adopt the pragmatic view that</v>
<v Speaker 1>points out that there are metta</v>

1130
01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.600
<v Speaker 1>realities above the mirror objects that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we perceive.</v>

1131
01:06:21.601 --> 01:06:25.260
<v Speaker 1>You can also apprehend that our brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually adapted to the Metta</v>

1132
01:06:25.261 --> 01:06:27.840
<v Speaker 1>realities and not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is because our brains are</v>

1133
01:06:27.841 --> 01:06:31.800
<v Speaker 1>like $300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years old and what we've done is</v>

1134
01:06:31.801 --> 01:06:34.200
<v Speaker 1>extracted out those things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant,</v>

1135
01:06:34.201 --> 01:06:38.400
<v Speaker 1>that cross spends of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fans of kinds that are hundreds of</v>

1136
01:06:38.401 --> 01:06:42.330
<v Speaker 1>millions of years in length and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't chairs and tables are</v>

1137
01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:45.450
<v Speaker 1>automobiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There they're metal structures that are</v>

1138
01:06:45.451 --> 01:06:49.860
<v Speaker 1>much more sophisticated than that and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore that at our peril because modern</v>

1139
01:06:49.861 --> 01:06:51.870
<v Speaker 1>people don't believe that meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>

1140
01:06:51.871 --> 01:06:53.910
<v Speaker 1>They think it's EPA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal.</v>

1141
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.960
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing subjective about our</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview when in fact our nervous</v>

1142
01:06:57.961 --> 01:07:02.670
<v Speaker 1>systems are tuned so that life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself in the most</v>

1143
01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.910
<v Speaker 1>meaningful possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you happen to be occupying the</v>

1144
01:07:05.911 --> 01:07:10.911
<v Speaker 1>precise position between chaos and order</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maximizes your security and the</v>

1145
01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:14.130
<v Speaker 1>development of that security across</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1146
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.810
<v Speaker 1>and that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most real thing there is,</v>

1147
01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>and to stay in that position is also to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept voluntarily the necessity for a</v>

1148
01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:29.670
<v Speaker 1>certain degree of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as you extend your capacities by</v>

1149
01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.760
<v Speaker 1>exposing yourself to the optimal level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the unknown,</v>

1150
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.990
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly taking yourself apart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rebuilding yourself,</v>

1151
01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:41.340
<v Speaker 1>and that's what allows you to thrive not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only in the presence of stability,</v>

1152
01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:45.750
<v Speaker 1>but also in a state that consists of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of that stability.</v>

1153
01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Here's a representation for maintenance</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

1154
01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:06.390
<v Speaker 1>These are representations of Horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of evidence that many of</v>

1155
01:08:06.391 --> 01:08:09.510
<v Speaker 1>the ideas we have about Christ or</v>
<v Speaker 1>derivatives of Egyptian ideas,</v>

1156
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.800
<v Speaker 1>most people who point that out</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out in a manner same debt,</v>

1157
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:16.610
<v Speaker 1>devaluing</v>

1158
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 2>the ideas that were derived from ego</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have an a priori motive,</v>

1159
01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.820
<v Speaker 2>which is a destructive motive.</v>

1160
01:08:25.230 --> 01:08:27.510
<v Speaker 1>As mythology progresses across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries,</v>

1161
01:08:27.511 --> 01:08:31.650
<v Speaker 1>it transforms itself and attempts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually encapsulate Rayanne</v>

1162
01:08:31.651 --> 01:08:34.530
<v Speaker 1>capsulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The primary idea is that the human race</v>

1163
01:08:34.531 --> 01:08:38.400
<v Speaker 1>has managed to produce about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of reality itself.</v>

1164
01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.600
<v Speaker 1>There's constant sees across these</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural manifestations because the</v>

1165
01:08:42.601 --> 01:08:44.970
<v Speaker 1>reality too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they route to which they refer,</v>

1166
01:08:44.971 --> 01:08:48.360
<v Speaker 1>is actually reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horace,</v>

1167
01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.650
<v Speaker 1>this is a good lesson and I'll leave you</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this horse,</v>

1168
01:08:52.651 --> 01:08:53.484
<v Speaker 1>is the eye.</v>

1169
01:08:55.550 --> 01:09:00.550
<v Speaker 1>The eye is not the intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The intellect is the thing that forces</v>

1170
01:09:00.681 --> 01:09:05.390
<v Speaker 1>everything into a preexisting structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it crunches reality.</v>

1171
01:09:05.391 --> 01:09:10.100
<v Speaker 1>To do that at warp it and twists it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes people ideological and rigid.</v>

1172
01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:12.440
<v Speaker 1>The eye is something completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1173
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:17.480
<v Speaker 1>The I is the thing that pays attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your attention is automatically</v>

1174
01:09:17.481 --> 01:09:21.800
<v Speaker 1>directed to those elements of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiential field where the most</v>

1175
01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.950
<v Speaker 1>information is manifesting itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

1176
01:09:24.951 --> 01:09:26.720
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking to someone in a bar</v>

1177
01:09:26.721 --> 01:09:30.630
<v Speaker 1>and there's a TV flickering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but look at the TV that</v>

1178
01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.020
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that transformation is what your nervous</v>

1179
01:09:33.021 --> 01:09:37.530
<v Speaker 1>system is attuned to and the theory is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're a follower of horace,</v>

1180
01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:41.510
<v Speaker 1>who is the I and the Vulcan because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Falcons can see and they fly above</v>

1181
01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:43.790
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a follower of horace,</v>

1182
01:09:43.791 --> 01:09:46.420
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you pay attention,</v>

1183
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:47.720
<v Speaker 1>you absorb information.</v>

1184
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:52.750
<v Speaker 1>When you absorb information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you continually transform yourself and</v>

1185
01:09:53.391 --> 01:09:56.030
<v Speaker 1>that keeps you on top of it ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shifting reality.</v>

1186
01:09:56.570 --> 01:10:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Doing that is meaningful and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>stops you from becoming bitter and cruel</v>

1187
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:03.980
<v Speaker 1>because you know life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1188
01:10:03.981 --> 01:10:06.800
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't have an antidote to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that suffering that's real,</v>

1189
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:10.490
<v Speaker 1>then you become resentful about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of experience and then you'll</v>

1190
01:10:10.491 --> 01:10:12.620
<v Speaker 1>do everything you can to take revenge on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1191
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:18.770
<v Speaker 1>And we saw what happened when people did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the 20th century and it would be</v>

1192
01:10:18.771 --> 01:10:23.570
<v Speaker 1>a good thing if people woke up and stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it and as far as I can tell after</v>

1193
01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:26.750
<v Speaker 1>fig trying to figure this out for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years.</v>

1194
01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:32.170
<v Speaker 1>The way that you do that is by paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and transforming yourself when</v>

1195
01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:38.141
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary and stopping the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>of identifying with what you already</v>

1196
01:10:38.391 --> 01:10:41.630
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell cares what you believe you</v>

1197
01:10:41.631 --> 01:10:43.820
<v Speaker 1>should be attending to the things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>

1198
01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.710
<v Speaker 1>which is a much larger space than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you know and then you should be</v>

1199
01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:52.490
<v Speaker 1>construing yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as the inhabitant of a sterile and</v>

1200
01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:57.491
<v Speaker 1>static and already completed structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the thing that lives on the edge</v>

1201
01:10:57.651 --> 01:10:59.810
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's constantly building and</v>

1202
01:10:59.811 --> 01:11:04.280
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding it and then if something</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to your structure,</v>

1203
01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not so relevant because that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are.</v>

1204
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:12.080
<v Speaker 1>You're the thing that can engage in</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations of structure by paying</v>

1205
01:11:12.081 --> 01:11:12.914
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

1206
01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's what these representations</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

1207
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:29.720
<v Speaker 1>These are renaissance pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know they've elevated the entity</v>

1208
01:11:29.721 --> 01:11:33.050
<v Speaker 1>that voluntarily accepts the necessity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of suffering and death,</v>

1209
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:37.490
<v Speaker 1>so that's represented by Christ to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest position in the heavenly</v>

1210
01:11:37.491 --> 01:11:42.491
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that idea means is that what should</v>

1211
01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:51.460
<v Speaker 1>constitute the transcendent value that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sits above all other values</v>

1212
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:58.760
<v Speaker 1>is your capacity to voluntarily accept</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're restricted and painful</v>

1213
01:12:00.301 --> 01:12:05.301
<v Speaker 1>conditions of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To face them and as a consequence of</v>

1214
01:12:05.431 --> 01:12:08.800
<v Speaker 1>facing them immediately transcend them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1215
01:12:08.801 --> 01:12:12.360
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we know from clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology is that if you have someone</v>

1216
01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:13.470
<v Speaker 1>who's afraid</v>

1217
01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:17.540
<v Speaker 1>they avoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do about that?</v>

1218
01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:22.540
<v Speaker 1>You break down the thing they're afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of til you find a small unit that take</v>

1219
01:12:22.541 --> 01:12:25.190
<v Speaker 1>an approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they approach it,</v>

1220
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:29.270
<v Speaker 1>they learned that they can approach it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they're more than they thought</v>

1221
01:12:29.271 --> 01:12:31.640
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they can approach the next</v>

1222
01:12:31.641 --> 01:12:35.300
<v Speaker 1>thing and then the next thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you take a woman who's got agora</v>

1223
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:40.070
<v Speaker 1>phobia who can't get into an elevator</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a week later she can and then she</v>

1224
01:12:40.071 --> 01:12:42.860
<v Speaker 1>goes home and has the fight with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband that she should have had 20</v>

1225
01:12:42.861 --> 01:12:45.440
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that when</v>

1226
01:12:45.441 --> 01:12:47.720
<v Speaker 1>she's exposed to the things that she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of,</v>

1227
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:51.770
<v Speaker 1>instead of running from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she learns that she's the thing that can</v>

1228
01:12:51.771 --> 01:12:55.850
<v Speaker 1>be exposed to things she's afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't learn that things aren't</v>

1229
01:12:55.851 --> 01:13:00.380
<v Speaker 1>frightening and learning the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the thing that can be exposed to</v>

1230
01:13:00.381 --> 01:13:04.040
<v Speaker 1>things that are frightening made sir</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than the frightening things.</v>

1231
01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly possible that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than the things that frightened us.</v>

1232
01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.300
<v Speaker 1>If we weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be here.</v>

1233
01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.120
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't throw these things away</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we understand them and we're in</v>

1234
01:13:30.121 --> 01:13:31.440
<v Speaker 1>danger of doing that now.</v>

1235
01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:37.240
<v Speaker 1>So part of what I've been trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my lectures and my work is to point</v>

1236
01:13:37.241 --> 01:13:42.241
<v Speaker 1>out what our forefathers new to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help modern people understand it and to</v>

1237
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.270
<v Speaker 1>make the case that these things that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of as</v>

1238
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:56.510
<v Speaker 1>non real representations are more real</v>
<v Speaker 1>than anything that we currently</v>

1239
01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.880
<v Speaker 1>comprehend as real.</v>

1240
01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:03.820
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

1241
01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:08.820
<v Speaker 1>consequences of not comprehending them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and living by them as far as I can tell</v>

1242
01:14:10.141 --> 01:14:15.141
<v Speaker 1>is that things deteriorate and they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate to a point where everything</v>

1243
01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:23.221
<v Speaker 1>is intolerable for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be a sub optimal</v>

1244
01:14:23.861 --> 01:14:24.700
<v Speaker 1>destination.</v>

1245
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.473
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1246
01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.570
<v Speaker 1>thanks for the invitation.</v>

1247
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
