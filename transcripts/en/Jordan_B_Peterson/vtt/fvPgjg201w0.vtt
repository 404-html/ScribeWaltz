1
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>So I've been informed about a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things this week that have really been</v>

2
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>bothering me and I thought that I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure what to do about it.</v>

3
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I've been communicating with some of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and colleagues about it,</v>

4
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:23.571
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I thought I'd try to write my</v>

5
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:28.701
<v Speaker 1>thoughts down and then talk about them a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit and see where I got with</v>

6
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:34.011
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've entitled this talk Professor</v>

7
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Against Political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because it's</v>

8
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>blunt and to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm very concerned about what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the universities.</v>

10
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not so bad in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been fortunate,</v>

11
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>very fortunate the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>

12
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>but they're continually things</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

13
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>including in the administration here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the broader political world.</v>

14
00:00:56.731 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>That makes me very nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to attribute that to the fact</v>

15
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>that I know something about the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian authoritarian political</v>

16
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>states develop and I can't help but</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that I'm seeing a fair bit of that</v>

17
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:15.681
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I also wanted to do this</v>

18
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:21.261
<v Speaker 1>because there is a misapprehension that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in academia is politically</v>

19
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's his true very frequently</v>

20
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>among social scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 20 percent of whom identify</v>

21
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>themselves as Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in my estimation,</v>

22
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is no better than identifying as Nazis</v>

23
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>given the murderousness of the Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine and the fact that we know how</v>

24
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>it's turned out when implemented in</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple countries now.</v>

25
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not politically correct.</v>

26
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.723
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you today about why</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this worries me.</v>

28
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>So I got wind of two events this week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.870
<v Speaker 1>one actually dates from last May.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.280
<v Speaker 1>there is a legislation passed or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first reading of legislation in the</v>

31
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Federal House set in Canada about a bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>called [inaudible],</v>

32
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>which was an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an attempt to alter the Canadian bill</v>

33
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>of human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tangled up with another</v>

34
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>organization that operates at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>provincial level in Canada,</v>

35
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>in Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the province I reside in called</v>

36
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>the Ontario Human Rights Commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

37
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell what happens at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Commission is</v>

38
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>rapidly turned into policy in multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>provinces across Canada.</v>

39
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps increasingly at the federal</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

40
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a liberal government in power</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the name of the political party</v>

41
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>in Ontario and now there's liberal</v>
<v Speaker 1>government federally.</v>

42
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously a fair bit of cross</v>

43
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>influence for better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for worse.</v>

44
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Also this week I got wind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto Human Resources</v>

45
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Initiative that also upset me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we could say quite profoundly.</v>

46
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.230
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought I'd talk about all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those and try to see if I could make</v>

47
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:14.231
<v Speaker 1>some sense out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've,</v>

48
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm making this video because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really know what else to do.</v>

49
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to some colleagues and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to some colleagues as I or some,</v>

50
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people inside the university and</v>

51
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:25.411
<v Speaker 1>outside the university that I know and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're upset and worried about this,</v>

52
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>but unclear about what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of this scares me I guess.</v>

53
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>And here's why the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the changes to the law scare me because</v>

54
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.630
<v Speaker 1>cause they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put into</v>

55
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.780
<v Speaker 1>the legal substructure of the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain assumptions about basic human</v>

56
00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:48.440
<v Speaker 1>nature that not only do I believe to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>untrue,</v>

57
00:04:48.441 --> 00:04:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I think there are also dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ideologically motivated.</v>

58
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I also don't think that the reason for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legal changes is the stated reason.</v>

59
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>The Lord scare me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The doctrines behind the law scare me.</v>

60
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there,</v>

61
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 1>when there's a law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a body of thought that's</v>

62
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.710
<v Speaker 1>associated with a body of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations that are associated with</v>

63
00:05:09.711 --> 00:05:11.660
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that flesh out the law.</v>

64
00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Because the law is a pretty bare thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've read,</v>

65
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say extensively because</v>
<v Speaker 1>extensively is a lot,</v>

66
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>but I've read enough about the doctrines</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the laws so that,</v>

67
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>that has also may also makes me very</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous.</v>

68
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Increasingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that these more radical ideas,</v>

69
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that we're going to discuss</v>
<v Speaker 1>are bought in people buy in at the</v>

70
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>administrative level in large</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations,</v>

71
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>corporate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governmental.</v>

72
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.460
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

73
00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:45.461
<v Speaker 1>it as long as the organization is large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's increasing administrative buy</v>

74
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of this seems to me to be driven</v>

75
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:50.520
<v Speaker 1>by human resources departments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

76
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>which I think are generally the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological elements of large</v>

77
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say that because I've actually had</v>

78
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>fairly extensive experience dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>human resources departments.</v>

79
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think her training is very politically</v>

80
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like many disciplines,</v>

81
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.260
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>the people behind the doctrines also</v>
<v Speaker 1>scare me.</v>

83
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I think that generally they're a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad combination of resentful,</v>

84
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>uninformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

85
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough.</v>

86
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Resentful and uninformed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good enough.</v>

87
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think that their aims are</v>

88
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>destructive rather than constructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They claim constructive aims,</v>

89
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 1>but of course everyone claims</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructive aims.</v>

90
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>But the actions that I see undertaken</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be to be driven by resentment</v>

91
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 1>and primarily by resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

92
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 1>and so I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt the validity of the claims.</v>

93
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 1>The claims are always for equality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity and that kind of thing.</v>

94
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>And those words are very easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot harder to put into practice.</v>

95
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>So I'm scared by the people behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrines.</v>

96
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared by the response of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues at the university.</v>

97
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 1>A number of them are unnerved by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>continual move towards political</v>

98
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 1>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm gonna tell you a couple of</v>

99
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 1>responses that I've got recently from</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that I think are quite brave by</v>

100
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

101
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.550
<v Speaker 1>but worried about making a statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting their careers on their line,</v>

102
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 1>worried about being tortured to death by</v>
<v Speaker 1>people online,</v>

103
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>worried about administrative over</v>
<v Speaker 1>response or even administrative response</v>

104
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>worried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

105
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things that I'm seeing at work will</v>

106
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>have to be discussed in a phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

107
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>This is a professor in American</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor.</v>

108
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I asked how this person was feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>about</v>

109
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 1>the position that they held at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

110
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm the person said the thing that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing at work will have to be discussed</v>

111
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>in a phone conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me personally to explain</v>

112
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:58.244
<v Speaker 1>it in an email.</v>

113
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not certain this is the career path</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in anymore.</v>

114
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I actually find myself sensory things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>censoring things that I'd normally say</v>

115
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:09.700
<v Speaker 1>to students and I'm not sure how to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

116
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Self Censorship Censorship leads to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>not truly educating them in a manner</v>

117
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 1>that will let me feel like I've done my</v>
<v Speaker 1>job well.</v>

118
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not as much from the administration</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet as it is from the students.</v>

119
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.040
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that so much at the</v>

120
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The students here are so terrified of</v>

121
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:28.640
<v Speaker 1>the job market and generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so diligent,</v>

122
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:33.641
<v Speaker 1>conscientious that they are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly sidetracked by political</v>

123
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:35.720
<v Speaker 1>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

124
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but that's obviously not my colleague's</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience in,</v>

125
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:41.300
<v Speaker 1>in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in California,</v>

126
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.480
<v Speaker 1>another colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is more local,</v>

127
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.260
<v Speaker 1>said something I thought was very</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>

128
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why this sort of thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so difficult to stand up to,</v>

129
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal consequences of objecting</v>

130
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:59.531
<v Speaker 1>are and this person is referring to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of adverse job effects,</v>

131
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I guess effects on employment and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think tenure would protect people</v>

132
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>against that and I suppose it probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

133
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that people aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily willing to put it to the</v>

134
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:10.884
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

135
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're worried about being</v>

136
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 1>pilloried online by social justice</v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors and,</v>

137
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

138
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.080
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having the reputation savaged and</v>

139
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 1>demolished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

140
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>

141
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a reasonable fear.</v>

142
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Especially given the next part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the effect of my objection on</v>

143
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 1>society will be minuscule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this combination.</v>

144
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:37.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal consequences of jet of</v>

145
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>objecting or potentially huge and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social effects are minuscule.</v>

146
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 1>There'll be no positive effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the thinking goes,</v>

147
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 1>why put yourself and potentially your</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and your financial stability and</v>

148
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:55.320
<v Speaker 1>all of that at risk by speaking out when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences will be will be</v>

149
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 1>minimal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

150
00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to other people outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>academia,</v>

151
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.400
<v Speaker 1>academia writers for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had friends who've made a comment</v>

152
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:06.480
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 1>which they thought was rather innocuous.</v>

154
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.080
<v Speaker 1>That's quoted over and over again in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

155
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in major newspapers as</v>
<v Speaker 1>emblematic of their particular stance</v>

156
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 1>and that shows them in a very harsh</v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

157
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular colleague concluded by</v>

158
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>saying we should have acted 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

159
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel for both of these colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're both excellent educators</v>

161
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're also,</v>

162
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classically liberal people,</v>

163
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

164
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.040
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not you,</v>

165
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't call them conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

166
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 1>you certainly wouldn't call them right</v>
<v Speaker 1>wingers.</v>

167
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Their people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their concerns aren't driven by their</v>

168
00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 1>political ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>

169
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their concerns are driven by their,</v>

170
00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 1>by their continued continual</v>
<v Speaker 1>observations,</v>

171
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.420
<v Speaker 1>increasingly continual observations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are not going in the proper</v>

172
00:11:05.911 --> 00:11:10.050
<v Speaker 1>direction and universities and that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming increasingly difficult for</v>

173
00:11:10.051 --> 00:11:11.260
<v Speaker 1>professors and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

174
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 1>and students for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least have of a particular kind of</v>

175
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 1>political orientation to even have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to say what they think.</v>

176
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

177
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Speaker 1>So that scares me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It scares me when I see decent people</v>

178
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and I think people who are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous than average,</v>

179
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm frightened into submission and</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering altering their career paths</v>

180
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:37.700
<v Speaker 1>because they don't feel that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what they think anymore and they're</v>

181
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.780
<v Speaker 1>afraid of the direction that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities are going.</v>

182
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.730
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's scary.</v>

183
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 1>So then I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a clinical psychologist.</v>

184
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>This is starting to affect my clients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had three clients in the last two</v>

185
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:55.071
<v Speaker 1>years who have been and who have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>driven near the point of insanity.</v>

186
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm by politically correct occurrences</v>
<v Speaker 1>at work.</v>

187
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 1>One of them was a bank employee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What what finally did her in</v>

188
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:11.250
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally was</v>
<v Speaker 1>she sent me a very long email chain</v>

189
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.280
<v Speaker 1>referring to a series of discussions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened in this bank internally</v>

190
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 1>about whether or not the word flip</v>
<v Speaker 1>chart,</v>

191
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>referring to those large pads of paper</v>

192
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 1>that you put up on a stand.</v>

193
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 1>You can flip forward and drawn kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an archaic technology.</v>

194
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:36.541
<v Speaker 1>Now whether or not the word flip chart</v>
<v Speaker 1>was pejorative and racist and the reason</v>

195
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:41.671
<v Speaker 1>for that was that apparently the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>flip can be used pejoratively to refer</v>

196
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 1>to Filipinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was something I didn't even know</v>

197
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.980
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose a Filipino could</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceivably take offense to having a pad</v>

198
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 1>of paper named flip chart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's hard to imagine the</v>

199
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:58.900
<v Speaker 1>circumstances under which that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>arise or at least once.</v>

200
00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

201
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 1>she gave me access to a string of email</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations about that particular</v>

202
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:10.711
<v Speaker 1>topic and the bank did eventually agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop using the term flip chart.</v>

203
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they replaced it with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

204
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.930
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a very,</v>

205
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 1>very sensible person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an immigrant by the way,</v>

206
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:29.010
<v Speaker 1>who couldn't reconcile</v>
<v Speaker 1>her requirement,</v>

207
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her moral requirement to work hard and</v>

208
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:39.781
<v Speaker 1>be productive and be sensible and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious with the fact that people</v>

209
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:45.571
<v Speaker 1>were being called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called on to alter their behavior in</v>

210
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:48.810
<v Speaker 1>ways that were absolutely nonsensical.</v>

211
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.710
<v Speaker 1>And she was from an eastern European</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

212
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 1>And of course for her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was reminiscent of the tactics of</v>

213
00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 1>the worst of the ideologues in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies and eighties and before</v>

214
00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was very,</v>

215
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:02.840
<v Speaker 1>very hard on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

216
00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.120
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was very,</v>

217
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:08.560
<v Speaker 1>very stressed by the situation at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I had another client who worked</v>

218
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:13.210
<v Speaker 1>in an HR department in a major</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational institute and he was always</v>

219
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:18.190
<v Speaker 1>being called on to manifest to support</v>
<v Speaker 1>for various feminist initiatives at the</v>

220
00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>educational institute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wasn't really all that</v>

221
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:27.160
<v Speaker 1>comfortable presenting himself as a pro</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist because he actually wasn't one</v>

222
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:31.330
<v Speaker 1>and you can argue one way or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the propriety of that.</v>

223
00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:34.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's really not my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is,</v>

224
00:14:34.261 --> 00:14:39.070
<v Speaker 1>is that he believed and I think with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars that his job would have been in</v>

225
00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:44.071
<v Speaker 1>jeopardy if he would have let his</v>
<v Speaker 1>objections to the demands of the</v>

226
00:14:45.191 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 1>political environment within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace,</v>

227
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.380
<v Speaker 1>if he would have made those objections</v>
<v Speaker 1>known and it.</v>

228
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 1>And I would say he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

229
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.650
<v Speaker 1>he's a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a little bit more to the right</v>

230
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 1>than most of the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've talked with,</v>

231
00:14:57.531 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 1>but not to any great degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although like many people,</v>

232
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I think he's being driven in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction by the continual radical moves</v>

233
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:08.420
<v Speaker 1>to the left that seemed to be part and</v>
<v Speaker 1>parcel of every organization in,</v>

234
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:10.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

235
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:15.131
<v Speaker 1>in maybe in modern Western society now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other client that I had who</v>

236
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:21.730
<v Speaker 1>was very much troubled by this was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>social worker who was,</v>

237
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.160
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was,</v>

238
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.220
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was an immigrant as well,</v>

239
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:30.250
<v Speaker 1>quite conservative from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was from a conservative culture and</v>

240
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 1>was very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

241
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.060
<v Speaker 1>it had very much difficulty with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>demands,</v>

242
00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she allow a non surgically altered</v>

243
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 1>transsexual men free access to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's shelters and the women's</v>

244
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:45.110
<v Speaker 1>shelters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

245
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:48.530
<v Speaker 1>here are some of the people in them</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously say,</v>

246
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 1>or Muslim women who come from very</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative cultures who really can't</v>

247
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:56.690
<v Speaker 1>even function in a situation where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:57.524
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

249
00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.090
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a male,</v>

250
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:04.510
<v Speaker 1>a biological male has been given access</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what in principle is supposed to be a</v>

251
00:16:04.761 --> 00:16:05.690
<v Speaker 1>woman's shelter.</v>

252
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of many things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bothered her,</v>

253
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.130
<v Speaker 1>but we don't need to get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

254
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:16.970
<v Speaker 1>is that I've had people who've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>driven to seek psychological counseling</v>

255
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:21.320
<v Speaker 1>because of the effect of politically</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct oppression on them in the</v>

256
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:24.140
<v Speaker 1>workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's worrisome.</v>

257
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a whole bunch of things that</v>

258
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.770
<v Speaker 1>make me nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then my own response scares me.</v>

259
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I find this stuff maddening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

260
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't really believe the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolishness that,</v>

261
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.793
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

262
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:45.120
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has accumulated around these rather</v>

263
00:16:45.121 --> 00:16:50.121
<v Speaker 1>contentious Marxist semi Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 1>political issues.</v>

264
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I have,</v>

265
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.440
<v Speaker 1>which I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no respect for,</v>

266
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said already,</v>

267
00:16:56.711 --> 00:17:01.711
<v Speaker 1>I think that Marxism and neo Marxism is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no better than fascism and neo fascism.</v>

268
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the historical evidence for that</v>

269
00:17:04.241 --> 00:17:07.390
<v Speaker 1>is absolutely clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand why we think it's</v>

270
00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:12.391
<v Speaker 1>acceptable for academics and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>followers to call themselves Marxists to</v>

271
00:17:13.271 --> 00:17:14.440
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

272
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.460
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would,</v>

273
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.870
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would not for a second countenance</v>

274
00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:22.720
<v Speaker 1>the same thing from the fascists and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neo fascists.</v>

275
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite side of it is that I'm</v>

276
00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:36.660
<v Speaker 1>nervous about doing this lecture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also become nervous about some of</v>

277
00:17:36.661 --> 00:17:39.780
<v Speaker 1>the things that I'm teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think I'm going to discuss this</v>

278
00:17:39.781 --> 00:17:42.030
<v Speaker 1>a little bit further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little further on in this,</v>

279
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.670
<v Speaker 1>in this discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that some of the things that I</v>

280
00:17:44.671 --> 00:17:48.690
<v Speaker 1>say in my lectures now might be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they might even be,</v>

281
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they might even be sufficient to me</v>

282
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:55.740
<v Speaker 1>to be for me to be brought before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Commission under</v>

283
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 1>their amended hate speech laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that scares me as well.</v>

284
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:02.100
<v Speaker 1>And it scares me that I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it sounds paranoid,</v>

285
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:03.390
<v Speaker 1>but I'm</v>

286
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.500
<v Speaker 1>most of the time in the past when I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been concerned that the,</v>

287
00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.850
<v Speaker 1>that something is going to happen at an</v>
<v Speaker 1>administrative or bureaucratic level at</v>

288
00:18:13.851 --> 00:18:16.060
<v Speaker 1>the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>

289
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's frequently the case that when I'm</v>

290
00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:22.040
<v Speaker 1>worried about something happening that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does actually happen and that it's</v>

291
00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:27.041
<v Speaker 1>not so much worry as an ability to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>high probability outcomes down into the</v>

292
00:18:27.081 --> 00:18:28.190
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

293
00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.150
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if even if the things that I'm</v>

294
00:18:32.151 --> 00:18:37.151
<v Speaker 1>saying are haven't been made illegal or</v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven forbid transformed into suddenly</v>

295
00:18:38.931 --> 00:18:42.890
<v Speaker 1>into hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am nervous that they might be.</v>

296
00:18:42.891 --> 00:18:47.600
<v Speaker 1>And even that's making it more difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to teach because in order for me</v>

297
00:18:47.601 --> 00:18:50.390
<v Speaker 1>to teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say what I think is true.</v>

298
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.920
<v Speaker 1>And I can't do that if I'm afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I have to be afraid of the</v>

299
00:18:54.921 --> 00:18:56.340
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>

300
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.310
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all stopped talking.</v>

301
00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even all,</v>

302
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.880
<v Speaker 1>if you can say one thing or the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of pressure not to say</v>

303
00:19:06.881 --> 00:19:09.520
<v Speaker 1>the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could just as easily say the</v>

304
00:19:09.521 --> 00:19:11.920
<v Speaker 1>second thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as easy to say the second</v>

305
00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:15.670
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not just not bothered with it,</v>

306
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.623
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

307
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.230
<v Speaker 1>the reason I can do that is because if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have something to say and I don't say</v>

308
00:19:20.231 --> 00:19:22.420
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it drives me crazy and so on.</v>

309
00:19:22.421 --> 00:19:27.421
<v Speaker 1>That's not something I'm willing to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not willing to go down that path and</v>

310
00:19:27.491 --> 00:19:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I've already decided that I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to tell people what I think and,</v>

311
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.890
<v Speaker 1>and to tell them what I think to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

312
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.750
<v Speaker 1>even though it's the truth that I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not saying that what I think is</v>

313
00:19:37.751 --> 00:19:39.490
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

314
00:19:39.491 --> 00:19:42.520
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have freedom of speech</v>

315
00:19:42.521 --> 00:19:44.620
<v Speaker 1>rate to sort out what's true so.</v>

316
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.300
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you that it's true that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared about this and I think that's</v>

317
00:19:49.301 --> 00:19:51.040
<v Speaker 1>appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that's appalling.</v>

318
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.180
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is bill.</v>

319
00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:59.181
<v Speaker 1>See 16 in and somebody sent this to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>this week and pointing out what was</v>

320
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:03.360
<v Speaker 1>happening with regards to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental Canadian human rights</v>

321
00:20:03.361 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 1>legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to do a bad job of this</v>

322
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 1>because it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes more time than I have to do</v>

323
00:20:09.691 --> 00:20:14.691
<v Speaker 1>this properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all I can do is tell you my initial</v>

324
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:17.820
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and try to justify them as best</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

325
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:24.740
<v Speaker 1>It would take months to do this lecture</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly and I haven't gotten months to</v>

326
00:20:24.811 --> 00:20:26.700
<v Speaker 1>do it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to have to do it badly.</v>

327
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.540
<v Speaker 1>So here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Bill [inaudible] is an act to amend</v>

328
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:32.580
<v Speaker 1>the Canadian Human Rights Act and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal code.</v>

329
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.430
<v Speaker 1>So these are major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a major amendment because the</v>

330
00:20:35.431 --> 00:20:39.150
<v Speaker 1>human rights act and the criminal code</v>
<v Speaker 1>or major pieces of legislation,</v>

331
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 1>they affect everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the consequences for contravening</v>

332
00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:47.481
<v Speaker 1>them are severe as severe as severe</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences can be short of you know,</v>

333
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.210
<v Speaker 2>of illness and death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are nontrivial pieces of</v>

334
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 2>legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

335
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.980
<v Speaker 2>if you guys aren't in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might wonder why you should care</v>

336
00:20:56.981 --> 00:21:00.310
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's happening in Canada is</v>

337
00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:05.311
<v Speaker 2>happening throughout the West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to concentrate on the local</v>

338
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 2>occurrences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can think,</v>

339
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.030
<v Speaker 2>you can be sure they're emblematic of</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar things happening in your</v>

340
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:13.750
<v Speaker 2>jurisdictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because this is certainly not only a</v>

341
00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:18.751
<v Speaker 2>Canadian problem and in fact I would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some fairly large degree,</v>

342
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Canada has been reasonably free of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially at the university level and</v>

343
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.190
<v Speaker 2>it's almost as if we're importing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessarily.</v>

344
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 2>But okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This enactment amends the Canadian Human</v>

345
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:36.310
<v Speaker 2>Rights Act to add gender identity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender expression to the list of</v>

346
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:39.220
<v Speaker 2>prohibited grounds of discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

347
00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 2>this amendment has only gone through</v>
<v Speaker 2>first reading.</v>

348
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.620
<v Speaker 2>This was back in May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but similar legislation has already been</v>

349
00:21:44.621 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 2>passed in a number of provinces.</v>

350
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Those are the smaller like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like states.</v>

351
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:52.250
<v Speaker 2>They're the smaller subdivisions of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian political system.</v>

352
00:21:52.251 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Speaker 2>So this hasn't been made into law</v>
<v Speaker 2>federally,</v>

353
00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:57.900
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

354
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's likely going to.</v>

355
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:02.650
<v Speaker 2>And it already has at the provincial</v>
<v Speaker 2>level as I said.</v>

356
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>this enactment also amends the criminal</v>

357
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:11.410
<v Speaker 2>code to extend the protection against</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate propaganda set out in that act to</v>

358
00:22:11.411 --> 00:22:15.850
<v Speaker 2>any section of the public that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguished by gender identity or</v>

359
00:22:15.851 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to clearly set out that evidence</v>

360
00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:22.000
<v Speaker 2>that have no fence was motivated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>bias,</v>

361
00:22:22.001 --> 00:22:24.940
<v Speaker 2>prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or hate based on gender identity or</v>

362
00:22:24.941 --> 00:22:28.990
<v Speaker 2>expression constitutes an aggravating</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstance that a court must take into</v>

363
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Speaker 2>consideration when it imposes a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence.</v>

364
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's basically a hate crime,</v>

365
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.630
<v Speaker 2>a modification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you commit a crime,</v>

366
00:22:37.631 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 2>well that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you commit a crime and it's</v>

367
00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:43.150
<v Speaker 2>motivated by bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudice,</v>

368
00:22:43.151 --> 00:22:46.870
<v Speaker 2>or hate based on age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

369
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.700
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnic identity,</v>

370
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.710
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and other things,</v>

371
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:53.080
<v Speaker 2>including now gender identity or</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression,</v>

372
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.750
<v Speaker 2>then that makes the crime worse.</v>

373
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.850
<v Speaker 2>It falls into the category of hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>

374
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:03.180
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what this modification is</v>
<v Speaker 2>intended to produce or to bring about.</v>

375
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.870
<v Speaker 2>So any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any crime that is associated with bias,</v>

376
00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:13.000
<v Speaker 2>prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or hate based on gender identity or</v>

377
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:15.880
<v Speaker 2>expression is now an aggravating</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstance.</v>

378
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:16.923
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

379
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.910
<v Speaker 2>so it's a hate crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I have some real problems with hate</v>

380
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:26.290
<v Speaker 2>speech legislation and the reason I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems with it is that it's not</v>

381
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.920
<v Speaker 2>obvious when speech is motivated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate.</v>

382
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Angry speech can feel like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated by hate,</v>

383
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:40.710
<v Speaker 2>but angry speech is the only kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech in some sense that is indicative</v>

384
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 2>of real disagreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

385
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that all disagreement</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be angry.</v>

386
00:23:45.741 --> 00:23:49.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that if there is real</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreement,</v>

387
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.480
<v Speaker 2>the it's our anger is often the evidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the exam existence of real</v>

388
00:23:55.481 --> 00:23:57.760
<v Speaker 2>disagreement and if there's real</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreement,</v>

389
00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:03.060
<v Speaker 2>angry people have to talk it out because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they don't then well then a bunch of</v>

390
00:24:04.211 --> 00:24:05.350
<v Speaker 2>terrible things happened.</v>

391
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.770
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start losing track of who the angry</v>

392
00:24:08.771 --> 00:24:10.210
<v Speaker 2>people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second,</v>

393
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.870
<v Speaker 2>they don't get to say what's on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind and even listened to themselves.</v>

394
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.230
<v Speaker 2>They don't get to have other people tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>them that they're wrong.</v>

395
00:24:17.231 --> 00:24:21.910
<v Speaker 2>They don't get to modify their</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints because talking is thinking,</v>

396
00:24:21.911 --> 00:24:23.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you start people from talking,</v>

397
00:24:23.681 --> 00:24:26.020
<v Speaker 2>then you stop them from thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really bad thing.</v>

398
00:24:26.021 --> 00:24:27.550
<v Speaker 2>And then if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

399
00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:33.420
<v Speaker 2>if you interpret hate speech too broadly</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you drive the so called haters</v>

400
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.000
<v Speaker 2>underground and then you don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're up to and when people go under</v>

401
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:40.720
<v Speaker 2>ground that isn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's really not good.</v>

402
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.280
<v Speaker 2>You get the rise of all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>underground political movements when</v>

403
00:24:45.281 --> 00:24:47.950
<v Speaker 2>people aren't able to express what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

404
00:24:47.951 --> 00:24:51.280
<v Speaker 2>even though it's unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to know where the haters</v>

405
00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:52.840
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to let them talk.</v>

406
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.990
<v Speaker 2>You know when we even tell two year olds</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are angry,</v>

407
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.570
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well use your words and the reason we</v>

408
00:24:58.571 --> 00:25:02.410
<v Speaker 2>tell two year olds that is because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative to using your words is using</v>

409
00:25:02.411 --> 00:25:05.740
<v Speaker 2>your fists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if we don't let angry people</v>

410
00:25:05.741 --> 00:25:06.820
<v Speaker 2>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the only,</v>

411
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.030
<v Speaker 2>they only have two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two alternatives.</v>

412
00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Well apart from changing their mind and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to change their mind</v>

413
00:25:13.361 --> 00:25:16.210
<v Speaker 2>just if you just shut someone up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't change their mind because</v>

414
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.100
<v Speaker 2>partly the way you change your mind is</v>
<v Speaker 2>by talking and thinking and</v>

415
00:25:21.101 --> 00:25:23.920
<v Speaker 2>communicating with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you shut that avenue or for</v>

416
00:25:23.921 --> 00:25:25.690
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can change their minds.</v>

417
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Well then they either they pull it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get resentful,</v>

418
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one option.</v>

419
00:25:31.421 --> 00:25:34.360
<v Speaker 2>They don't take any action or they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive and violent or they start</v>

420
00:25:34.361 --> 00:25:37.900
<v Speaker 2>agitating for violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

421
00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.960
<v Speaker 2>I can't help but think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

422
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a famous psychoanalyst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick Psychoanalytic Dictum,</v>

423
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.320
<v Speaker 2>if you don't understand the motivation</v>
<v Speaker 2>for something,</v>

424
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:53.540
<v Speaker 2>look at the outcome and in further</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation,</v>

425
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:58.220
<v Speaker 2>well if the outcome of shutting people</v>
<v Speaker 2>up is that they get violent,</v>

426
00:25:58.221 --> 00:26:03.221
<v Speaker 2>then it's hard for me to suppress the</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspicion that it was the incitement of</v>

427
00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:07.070
<v Speaker 2>violence that was at least part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>initial motivation for,</v>

428
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.020
<v Speaker 2>for producing the restriction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I think there's a lot more to it</v>

429
00:26:12.021 --> 00:26:12.854
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

430
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it is a lot of this</v>

431
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.670
<v Speaker 2>desire for people not to ever say</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything upsetting is actually a</v>

432
00:26:20.671 --> 00:26:22.620
<v Speaker 2>consequence of trait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agreeableness,</v>

433
00:26:22.621 --> 00:26:26.520
<v Speaker 2>which is a big five psychological trait</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really agreeable people are</v>

434
00:26:26.521 --> 00:26:29.690
<v Speaker 2>egalitarianism by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also don't like conflict and</v>

435
00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.760
<v Speaker 2>but what that means is they don't like</v>
<v Speaker 2>short term conflict.</v>

436
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like anybody to be upset.</v>

437
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.830
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is sometimes you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be upset in the present to solve</v>

438
00:26:40.831 --> 00:26:43.530
<v Speaker 2>problems in the medium and longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

439
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.630
<v Speaker 2>you can't stop people from talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>upsetting things because as I said,</v>

440
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 2>that's just the same as topping them</v>
<v Speaker 2>from thinking and,</v>

441
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.480
<v Speaker 2>and if they can't think really</v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated things through well then</v>

442
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 2>they don't solve problems and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems manifest themselves in the real</v>

443
00:26:58.141 --> 00:27:00.450
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no joke.</v>

444
00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.660
<v Speaker 2>So there's a recent case of Lionel</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shriver who's a WHO's A.</v>

445
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't talk about her.</v>

446
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.330
<v Speaker 2>You can look her up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to stick to the point here.</v>

447
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.200
<v Speaker 2>So this is also part of bill</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

448
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:23.260
<v Speaker 2>This is modification of section two of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Canadian Human Rights Act purpose.</v>

449
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.760
<v Speaker 2>The purpose of this act is to extend the</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws in Canada to give effect within the</v>

450
00:27:28.761 --> 00:27:31.970
<v Speaker 2>purview of matters coming within the</v>
<v Speaker 2>legislative authority of parliament.</v>

451
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.410
<v Speaker 2>That's Canada's highest governing body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the principle that all individuals</v>

452
00:27:36.411 --> 00:27:40.700
<v Speaker 2>should have an opportunity equal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>other individuals to make for themselves</v>

453
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.880
<v Speaker 2>the lives that they are able and wished</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have and to have their needs</v>

454
00:27:43.881 --> 00:27:46.130
<v Speaker 2>accommodated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent with their duties and</v>

455
00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:51.131
<v Speaker 2>obligations as members of society</v>
<v Speaker 2>without being hindered in or prevented</v>

456
00:27:51.681 --> 00:27:55.550
<v Speaker 2>from doing so by discriminatory</v>
<v Speaker 2>practices based on race,</v>

457
00:27:55.551 --> 00:27:57.080
<v Speaker 2>national,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or ethnic origin.</v>

458
00:27:57.081 --> 00:27:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

459
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.910
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

460
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.970
<v Speaker 2>sexual orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now hypothetically,</v>

461
00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.420
<v Speaker 2>gender identity or expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marital status,</v>

462
00:28:05.421 --> 00:28:08.690
<v Speaker 2>family status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disability or conviction for an offense</v>

463
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.880
<v Speaker 2>for which at pardon has been granted or</v>
<v Speaker 2>in respect of which are record</v>

464
00:28:11.881 --> 00:28:14.090
<v Speaker 2>suspension has been ordered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

465
00:28:14.091 --> 00:28:17.540
<v Speaker 2>so well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's problematic about this?</v>

466
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've outlined some of it in yellow.</v>

467
00:28:19.881 --> 00:28:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't really like the idea of wished</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have the lives that they're able and</v>

468
00:28:24.051 --> 00:28:27.650
<v Speaker 2>wish to have and then to have their</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs accommodated.</v>

469
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.123
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

470
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.370
<v Speaker 2>it's messy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's messy terminology.</v>

471
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy to delineate needs.</v>

472
00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.480
<v Speaker 2>There's an infinite number of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

473
00:28:40.481 --> 00:28:44.380
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to determine whose needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>should take priority.</v>

474
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.570
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why we have a free market</v>

475
00:28:46.571 --> 00:28:49.600
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a free market society so that</v>

476
00:28:49.601 --> 00:28:54.601
<v Speaker 2>people's needs can be voted on in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense by the purchasing power of three</v>

477
00:28:55.001 --> 00:28:58.210
<v Speaker 2>individuals so that nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no central committee,</v>

478
00:28:58.211 --> 00:29:02.170
<v Speaker 2>no governing body has to decide whose</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs should be accommodated.</v>

479
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.100
<v Speaker 2>It's an infinitely complex problem and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't be solved by fit.</v>

480
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not possible and this was happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>in places like this.</v>

481
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.220
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was attempted in places like the</v>

482
00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union were need decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're constantly made by centralized</v>

483
00:29:16.001 --> 00:29:18.820
<v Speaker 2>committees and the consequences was</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely catastrophic.</v>

484
00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Not only was it economically suicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was also murderous,</v>

485
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.590
<v Speaker 2>so the whole idea of having needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>accommodated is a very,</v>

486
00:29:26.591 --> 00:29:27.640
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>

487
00:29:27.641 --> 00:29:30.580
<v Speaker 2>very slippery idea and it sounds good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very,</v>

488
00:29:30.581 --> 00:29:35.581
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous because the question who</v>

489
00:29:36.111 --> 00:29:41.111
<v Speaker 2>decides who's needs are paramount is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crucial question and how's that it's</v>

490
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:47.281
<v Speaker 2>answered is the crucial issue and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can go seriously wrong.</v>

491
00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.010
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

492
00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.580
<v Speaker 2>the inclusion of gender identity or</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>

493
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

494
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.380
<v Speaker 3>we'll discuss that momentarily</v>

495
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:03.810
<v Speaker 2>and there's also modification of section</v>
<v Speaker 2>three for all purposes of this act.</v>

496
00:30:04.011 --> 00:30:06.650
<v Speaker 2>The prohibited grounds of discrimination</v>
<v Speaker 2>or race,</v>

497
00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.360
<v Speaker 2>national ethnic origin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>

498
00:30:08.361 --> 00:30:09.081
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>

499
00:30:09.081 --> 00:30:10.430
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual orientation,</v>

500
00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.460
<v Speaker 2>and then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>newly gender identity or expression,</v>

501
00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.170
<v Speaker 2>marital status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family status.</v>

502
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.820
<v Speaker 2>So this is the criminal code</v>
<v Speaker 2>modification modification of subsection</v>

503
00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:22.511
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

504
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 2>four where they define an identifiable</v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

505
00:30:25.121 --> 00:30:28.390
<v Speaker 2>And this is for the purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 2>determining who fundamentally is</v>

506
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:31.090
<v Speaker 2>uttering hate speech or discriminatory</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

507
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.230
<v Speaker 2>And this includes all the candidates we</v>
<v Speaker 2>already described,</v>

508
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.341
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

509
00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:38.050
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>national ethnic origin,</v>

510
00:30:38.051 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and includes gender identity or</v>

511
00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:41.494
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>

512
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

513
00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.760
<v Speaker 3>well we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll continue to talk about that.</v>

514
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.433
<v Speaker 3>And then</v>

515
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.700
<v Speaker 2>there's modifications of sub paragraph</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

516
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.760
<v Speaker 2>18 to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again with regards to hate crime,</v>

517
00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.460
<v Speaker 2>evidence that the old fence was</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated by bias,</v>

518
00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:02.710
<v Speaker 2>prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or hate based on race,</v>

519
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:04.090
<v Speaker 2>national,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnic origin,</v>

520
00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:04.841
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>

521
00:31:04.841 --> 00:31:07.920
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. Including gender identity or</v>

522
00:31:07.921 --> 00:31:10.860
<v Speaker 2>expression or any other simpler similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>

523
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.920
<v Speaker 2>The old fence was motIvated.</v>

524
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:13.803
<v Speaker 3>Bye.</v>

525
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this sort of legislation has already</v>

526
00:31:16.351 --> 00:31:19.740
<v Speaker 2>come into play and provinces in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alberta,</v>

527
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:21.930
<v Speaker 2>british columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>newfoundland and labrador,</v>

528
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.030
<v Speaker 2>nova scotia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prince edward island and,</v>

529
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.600
<v Speaker 2>and ontario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to concentrate on ontario</v>

530
00:31:27.601 --> 00:31:31.770
<v Speaker 2>because I think a lot of this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>emanating from a small coterie of people</v>

531
00:31:31.771 --> 00:31:34.590
<v Speaker 2>behind the ontario human rights</v>
<v Speaker 2>commission,</v>

532
00:31:34.591 --> 00:31:38.790
<v Speaker 2>which is a particularly pathological</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization in my estimation.</v>

533
00:31:38.791 --> 00:31:42.990
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps the biggest enemy of freedom</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently extent in Canada.</v>

534
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:48.340
<v Speaker 2>And I don't say that lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the reason I think the ontario human</v>

535
00:31:48.441 --> 00:31:52.400
<v Speaker 2>rights commission is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an emblematic institution in this</v>

536
00:31:52.401 --> 00:31:57.401
<v Speaker 2>regard is partly because I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social justice warrior type</v>

537
00:31:58.671 --> 00:32:00.890
<v Speaker 2>activists are overrepresented in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>current</v>

538
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:06.020
<v Speaker 2>provincial government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal or the current liberal</v>

539
00:32:06.021 --> 00:32:08.670
<v Speaker 2>provincial government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't help but shake this,</v>

540
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.160
<v Speaker 2>I can't help but manifest the suspicion</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's partly because our current</v>

541
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:19.630
<v Speaker 2>premier is lesbian in her sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>preference and that in itself doesn't</v>

542
00:32:20.091 --> 00:32:23.510
<v Speaker 2>bother me one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's relevant to the</v>

543
00:32:23.511 --> 00:32:28.100
<v Speaker 2>political discussion except in so far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lbgt community has become</v>

544
00:32:28.101 --> 00:32:33.101
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily good at organizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and has a fairly pronounced</v>

545
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:37.430
<v Speaker 2>and very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very sophisticated radical fringe and</v>

546
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I can't help but see the hand of that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm going to read to you and you</v>

547
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:48.170
<v Speaker 2>could make up your own mind and see if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think the same thing.</v>

548
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 2>So the wording on the ontario human</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights commission with regards to</v>

549
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 2>legislation like bill [inaudible] is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

550
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 2>It's identical to that on the canadian</v>
<v Speaker 2>department of justice.</v>

551
00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:01.070
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've given you the links here.</v>

552
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 2>And so that's another indication to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's tremendous cross talk</v>

553
00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:08.510
<v Speaker 2>between these institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One at the provincial level that's the</v>

554
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 2>ontario one at and one at the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>level because the wording is identical.</v>

555
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.450
<v Speaker 2>So That's the argument for overlap.</v>

556
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.390
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to the lbgt angle on this</v>

557
00:33:21.391 --> 00:33:26.030
<v Speaker 2>is that the wording is identical in many</v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to that that's common generally</v>

558
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:31.040
<v Speaker 2>used by lbgt activists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why I'm putting the</v>

559
00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.630
<v Speaker 2>different organizations together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I said before,</v>

560
00:33:34.631 --> 00:33:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying this is right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what I've been able to sort out.</v>

561
00:33:38.321 --> 00:33:40.330
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what I've been able to puzzle out</v>

562
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.420
<v Speaker 2>and I'm putting it forward as an element</v>
<v Speaker 2>of discussion.</v>

563
00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's some of the definitions that</v>

564
00:33:45.971 --> 00:33:50.350
<v Speaker 2>they use and these are now explicit</v>
<v Speaker 2>categories and implicit presumptions of</v>

565
00:33:50.351 --> 00:33:54.250
<v Speaker 2>our most fundamental legal structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now these have become something.</v>

566
00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.400
<v Speaker 2>These definitions have become something</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than fact.</v>

567
00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:02.350
<v Speaker 2>They become facts that you questioned at</v>
<v Speaker 2>your legal peril.</v>

568
00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.830
<v Speaker 2>So here's the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender identity.</v>

569
00:34:05.831 --> 00:34:09.490
<v Speaker 2>This is directly from the ontario human</v>
<v Speaker 2>resource human rights commission</v>

570
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.550
<v Speaker 2>weBsite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gender identity is each person's</v>

571
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.490
<v Speaker 2>internal and individual experience of</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender.</v>

572
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.690
<v Speaker 2>It is their sense Of being a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man,</v>

573
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.080
<v Speaker 2>both neither or anywhere along the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender spectrum.</v>

574
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd also like to point out that that's</v>

575
00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.830
<v Speaker 2>relatively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThiS is a petty thing to say I suppose,</v>

576
00:34:29.831 --> 00:34:33.760
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that struck me</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the ontario human rights</v>

577
00:34:33.761 --> 00:34:35.680
<v Speaker 2>commission website is that it's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor,</v>

578
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:39.970
<v Speaker 2>very poorly written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this particular sentence is very</v>

579
00:34:39.971 --> 00:34:41.500
<v Speaker 2>poorly written and</v>

580
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.890
<v Speaker 2>policy that's on its way to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed into legislation should not</v>

581
00:34:46.891 --> 00:34:50.220
<v Speaker 2>be poorly written because it means it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been poorly thought through and poorly</v>

582
00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:53.090
<v Speaker 2>specified and it means that the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are doing it,</v>

583
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.280
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being careful and that makes me nervous</v>

584
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.700
<v Speaker 2>and so then there's things in here that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe to be true.</v>

585
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Gender identity is each person's sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being a woman,</v>

586
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.940
<v Speaker 2>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both neither or anywhere along the</v>

587
00:35:08.941 --> 00:35:13.941
<v Speaker 2>gender spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what neither means because</v>

588
00:35:17.741 --> 00:35:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the options are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not a man or a woman,</v>

589
00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:25.780
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious to me how you can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>both because those are by definition</v>

590
00:35:25.781 --> 00:35:30.460
<v Speaker 2>binary categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an idea that there's a gender</v>

591
00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:33.040
<v Speaker 2>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that that's a valid</v>

592
00:35:33.041 --> 00:35:34.900
<v Speaker 2>id.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any evidence for</v>

593
00:35:34.901 --> 00:35:37.500
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Biological sexuality is ancient.</v>

594
00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 2>It's hundreds of millions of years</v>

595
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.940
<v Speaker 4>old and it's binary because there's two</v>
<v Speaker 4>forms of of,</v>

596
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.980
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of biological sex.</v>

597
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course this is predicated on the idea</v>

598
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:51.540
<v Speaker 4>that your gender is somehow independent</v>
<v Speaker 4>from your,</v>

599
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.450
<v Speaker 4>from your biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's a proposition,</v>

600
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:57.330
<v Speaker 4>not a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even if it's true,</v>

601
00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:01.620
<v Speaker 4>it's even if it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if it in some manner was determined</v>

602
00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 4>to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is certainly not determined to be</v>

603
00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 4>true to that degree now and certainly</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to the degree that it should be</v>

604
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 4>instantiated in law at most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an opinion and I think it's an ill</v>

605
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:17.770
<v Speaker 4>informed opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a politiCally motivated to</v>

606
00:36:17.771 --> 00:36:22.771
<v Speaker 4>neil informed opinion and now it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>sculpt the force of law and then there's</v>

607
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:26.190
<v Speaker 4>another modification which is gender</v>
<v Speaker 4>expression,</v>

608
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:28.080
<v Speaker 4>which is something different thAn gender</v>
<v Speaker 4>identity,</v>

609
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:32.370
<v Speaker 4>so I guess there's biological sex and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then on top of that there's gender</v>

610
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 4>identity which is separate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not even correlated that they</v>

611
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:37.830
<v Speaker 4>don't bear any relationship to one</v>
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>

612
00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:40.410
<v Speaker 4>I guess one is choice or it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly clear.</v>

613
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's one of the things I find very</v>

614
00:36:43.981 --> 00:36:48.830
<v Speaker 4>confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that the leftist</v>

615
00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:53.831
<v Speaker 4>activists have made the claim that with</v>
<v Speaker 4>regards to transsexual individuals,</v>

616
00:36:54.141 --> 00:36:58.040
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can Be a man in a woman's body</v>

617
00:36:58.041 --> 00:37:01.700
<v Speaker 4>and that that's a biological reality or</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can be a woman in a man's body</v>

618
00:37:01.701 --> 00:37:06.140
<v Speaker 4>and that's a biologiCal reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so as long as you're</v>

619
00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:13.730
<v Speaker 4>gender identity is opposite to that of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your biological,</v>

620
00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:15.980
<v Speaker 4>cardinal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>biological sexual attributes,</v>

621
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:21.190
<v Speaker 4>then that's biologically determined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if your gender identity is in sync</v>

622
00:37:21.621 --> 00:37:26.621
<v Speaker 4>with your biological attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>theN that's a free floating cultural</v>

623
00:37:26.991 --> 00:37:30.890
<v Speaker 4>construct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless I've got my logic wrong somehow</v>

624
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.580
<v Speaker 4>and I cannot see how both of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>things can possibly be true,</v>

625
00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:39.850
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that coherence is one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the hallmarks of radical politically</v>

626
00:37:40.221 --> 00:37:43.700
<v Speaker 4>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think and you can tell that because</v>

627
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.720
<v Speaker 4>politically correct people like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who have produced this</v>

628
00:37:47.721 --> 00:37:52.480
<v Speaker 4>Legislation and these policies are</v>
<v Speaker 4>capable of saying things like it.</v>

629
00:37:52.481 --> 00:37:55.880
<v Speaker 4>Is there sense meaning each person's by</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way it?</v>

630
00:37:55.881 --> 00:37:57.890
<v Speaker 4>Is there a sense of being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe</v>

631
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:04.450
<v Speaker 4>maybe an individual can decide to be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>plurality as well,</v>

632
00:38:04.451 --> 00:38:09.370
<v Speaker 4>aNd that's why there is being used as</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pronoun in this particular sentence.</v>

633
00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:13.290
<v Speaker 4>Although I think the real reason is is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the person who wrote this can't</v>

634
00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.670
<v Speaker 4>write it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a sense of being a woman,</v>

635
00:38:15.671 --> 00:38:18.100
<v Speaker 4>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both neither or anywhere along the</v>

636
00:38:18.101 --> 00:38:20.290
<v Speaker 4>gender spectrum?</v>
<v Speaker 4>From my perspective,</v>

637
00:38:20.291 --> 00:38:25.000
<v Speaker 4>that Sentence is entirely nonsensical</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now it's law and then okay,</v>

638
00:38:25.001 --> 00:38:27.610
<v Speaker 4>so we've got biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender identity,</v>

639
00:38:27.611 --> 00:38:29.710
<v Speaker 4>and then on toP of that we've got gender</v>
<v Speaker 4>expression,</v>

640
00:38:29.711 --> 00:38:32.050
<v Speaker 4>which I guess is how you Express your</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender identity,</v>

641
00:38:32.051 --> 00:38:35.350
<v Speaker 4>which is separate from your biological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexual orientation.</v>

642
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 4>It's the way people publicly present</v>
<v Speaker 4>their gender.</v>

643
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 4>It is the presentation of gender through</v>
<v Speaker 4>such aspects as dress,</v>

644
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:42.461
<v Speaker 4>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makeup,</v>

645
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:44.860
<v Speaker 4>body language and voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

646
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:49.480
<v Speaker 4>well those are canonical categories now</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it isn't clear to me because of the</v>

647
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:51.700
<v Speaker 4>legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is possible.</v>

648
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.820
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's possible that my</v>
<v Speaker 4>commentary on these definitions is now</v>

649
00:38:57.191 --> 00:39:01.300
<v Speaker 4>illegal and that it's also now</v>
<v Speaker 4>potentially classifiable as hate speech</v>

650
00:39:01.301 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 4>and I would say if that's the case then</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

651
00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.570
<v Speaker 4>well it's the sort of thing I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>question and if sOmeone should be put in</v>

652
00:39:17.571 --> 00:39:20.360
<v Speaker 4>jail for questioning that and that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>questioning that,</v>

653
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.710
<v Speaker 4>then I guess I should be put in jail</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm going to continue to</v>

654
00:39:24.711 --> 00:39:26.600
<v Speaker 4>question it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's nonsensicAl.</v>

655
00:39:26.601 --> 00:39:30.170
<v Speaker 4>I think the formulation is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it has no scientific standing.</v>

656
00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:33.320
<v Speaker 4>I think it's ideologically motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's divisive.</v>

657
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.110
<v Speaker 4>I think it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it causes chaos.</v>

658
00:39:36.111 --> 00:39:39.950
<v Speaker 4>It confuses people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no upside to it and for any,</v>

659
00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:44.540
<v Speaker 4>for every one person that this potential</v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation of legislation is going</v>

660
00:39:44.541 --> 00:39:47.990
<v Speaker 4>to free from oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to definitely confused 100</v>

661
00:39:47.991 --> 00:39:52.991
<v Speaker 4>more</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I say that as I say that as a</v>

662
00:39:53.321 --> 00:39:55.510
<v Speaker 4>clinician with some experience in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter,</v>

663
00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:00.000
<v Speaker 4>more definitions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The code does not define the grounds of</v>

664
00:40:00.001 --> 00:40:04.170
<v Speaker 4>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender expression or sex instead.</v>

665
00:40:04.171 --> 00:40:07.710
<v Speaker 4>the understanding of these and Other</v>
<v Speaker 4>related terms and the implications for</v>

666
00:40:07.711 --> 00:40:10.710
<v Speaker 4>the code.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the ontario human rights code and</v>

667
00:40:10.711 --> 00:40:15.360
<v Speaker 4>ontario human rights commission policies</v>
<v Speaker 4>is evolving from tribunals and court</v>

668
00:40:15.361 --> 00:40:18.180
<v Speaker 4>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Social science research as well as self</v>

669
00:40:18.181 --> 00:40:21.780
<v Speaker 4>identity and common everyday use more</v>
<v Speaker 4>defInitions.</v>

670
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:25.410
<v Speaker 4>Sex is the anatomical classification of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people as male,</v>

671
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.330
<v Speaker 4>female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or intersex,</v>

672
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:28.950
<v Speaker 4>usually assigned at birth.</v>

673
00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:36.110
<v Speaker 4>I should also point out that the closet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a class of intersex is so rare to be</v>

674
00:40:36.111 --> 00:40:41.111
<v Speaker 4>virtually nonexistent and it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonable to make standard policy on</v>

675
00:40:41.661 --> 00:40:45.230
<v Speaker 4>the basis of extreme exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the reason for that is that there</v>

676
00:40:45.231 --> 00:40:48.680
<v Speaker 4>are myriads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>millions of extreme exceptions,</v>

677
00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:53.300
<v Speaker 4>and it's not possible to constitute a</v>
<v Speaker 4>collective society on the basis of</v>

678
00:40:53.301 --> 00:40:57.080
<v Speaker 4>legislation that's designed for for</v>
<v Speaker 4>exceptions.</v>

679
00:40:57.081 --> 00:41:01.940
<v Speaker 4>It can't be done by definition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The laws to the law is fundamentally</v>

680
00:41:01.941 --> 00:41:06.941
<v Speaker 4>there to produce a collective agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

681
00:41:07.921 --> 00:41:11.810
<v Speaker 4>back definitions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once again,</v>

682
00:41:11.811 --> 00:41:15.740
<v Speaker 4>gender identity is each person's</v>
<v Speaker 4>internal and individual experience of</v>

683
00:41:15.741 --> 00:41:18.170
<v Speaker 4>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've already said that a person's</v>

684
00:41:18.171 --> 00:41:23.171
<v Speaker 4>gender identity may be the same or the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same as or different from their birth</v>

685
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:25.320
<v Speaker 4>assigned sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

686
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.213
<v Speaker 4>that's the theory.</v>

687
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:32.930
<v Speaker 4>Gender expression is how a person</v>
<v Speaker 4>publicly expresses a or presents their</v>

688
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:34.910
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've covered that.</v>

689
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.840
<v Speaker 4>There's another addition here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A person's chosen name and pronoun are</v>

690
00:41:38.841 --> 00:41:42.710
<v Speaker 4>also common ways of expressing gender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>others perceive a person's gender</v>

691
00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 4>through those attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

692
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.270
<v Speaker 4>this is also ontario human rights</v>
<v Speaker 4>commission policy.</v>

693
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this is the scenario I've been</v>

694
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:54.290
<v Speaker 4>running through my head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can envision a student or a colleague</v>

695
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:59.530
<v Speaker 4>insisting that I call call them using</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender neutral prOnouns.</v>

696
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:00.920
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zed,</v>

697
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:02.900
<v Speaker 4>h e or z,</v>
<v Speaker 4>h d for you,</v>

698
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:05.360
<v Speaker 4>americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>g or azure?</v>

699
00:42:05.361 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 4>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing that.</v>

700
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's manipulative.</v>

701
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.150
<v Speaker 4>I and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

702
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't recognize anotHer person's right</v>

703
00:42:18.201 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 4>to determine what pronouns I use to</v>
<v Speaker 4>address them.</v>

704
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I won't do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

705
00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:28.690
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that because of these new laws</v>

706
00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.610
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

707
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:35.440
<v Speaker 4>that my decision might be illegal and</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's even a decision of hate,</v>

708
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.160
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that those gendeR neutral</v>

709
00:42:39.161 --> 00:42:43.680
<v Speaker 4>pronouns are politically motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're connected to an entire</v>

710
00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:46.930
<v Speaker 4>underground apparatus of political</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivations,</v>

711
00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:51.280
<v Speaker 4>radical left political motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think uttering those words makes</v>

712
00:42:51.281 --> 00:42:55.870
<v Speaker 4>me a tool of those motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm going to try to be a tool of my</v>

713
00:42:55.871 --> 00:43:00.160
<v Speaker 4>own motivations as Clearly as I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>articulate them and not the mouthpiece</v>

714
00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:02.050
<v Speaker 4>of some murderous ideology.</v>

715
00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.310
<v Speaker 4>A person's gender identity definitions</v>
<v Speaker 4>continued.</v>

716
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.080
<v Speaker 4>A person's gender identity is</v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally different from a not</v>

717
00:43:10.081 --> 00:43:12.450
<v Speaker 4>related to their sexual orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

718
00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:17.520
<v Speaker 4>that's rubbish fundamentally because if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ran a correlation analysis between</v>

719
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:21.720
<v Speaker 4>gender identity and sexual orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the correlation is going to be something</v>

720
00:43:21.721 --> 00:43:25.170
<v Speaker 4>like point nine five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which indicates an almost perfect</v>

721
00:43:25.171 --> 00:43:27.600
<v Speaker 4>correlation for the vast majority of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

722
00:43:27.601 --> 00:43:30.540
<v Speaker 4>Gender identity and sexual orientation</v>
<v Speaker 4>are the same thing,</v>

723
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.840
<v Speaker 4>and so it is not fundamentally different</v>
<v Speaker 4>from and not related to their sexual</v>

724
00:43:36.661 --> 00:43:39.180
<v Speaker 4>orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just a misstatement of fact</v>

725
00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.500
<v Speaker 4>perhaps for a minority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes there are dissociable,</v>

726
00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:48.930
<v Speaker 4>but that that doesn't mean that a gender</v>
<v Speaker 4>identity is fundamentally different from</v>

727
00:43:48.931 --> 00:43:53.460
<v Speaker 4>a not related to sexual orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a complete misstatement of fact.</v>

728
00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:58.210
<v Speaker 4>If there's a correlation of if there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>correlation of any magnitude between two</v>

729
00:43:58.211 --> 00:44:01.000
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then one is related to another and when</v>

730
00:44:01.001 --> 00:44:04.210
<v Speaker 4>the correlation is just about perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then they are fundamentally</v>

731
00:44:04.211 --> 00:44:05.800
<v Speaker 4>related.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

732
00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.610
<v Speaker 4>So that's another policy that's based</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually on a lie,</v>

733
00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.890
<v Speaker 4>a misstatement and untruth.</v>

734
00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:17.220
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so trans or transgender as an umbrella</v>

735
00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:19.380
<v Speaker 4>term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>referring to people with diverse gender</v>

736
00:44:19.381 --> 00:44:22.950
<v Speaker 4>identities and expressions that differ</v>
<v Speaker 4>from stereotypical gender norms.</v>

737
00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:28.320
<v Speaker 4>It includes but is not limited to people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who identify as transgender trans woman,</v>

738
00:44:28.321 --> 00:44:31.050
<v Speaker 4>trans man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>transexual crossdressers or gender,</v>

739
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:34.470
<v Speaker 4>gender variant or gender queer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

740
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:40.050
<v Speaker 4>here's what I think about these terms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the people who use these terms</v>

741
00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:45.090
<v Speaker 4>want everyone to believe that there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>for all the good things that they say</v>

742
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:48.390
<v Speaker 4>they're for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't believe any of that.</v>

743
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that there are for good</v>
<v Speaker 4>things at all.</v>

744
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.370
<v Speaker 4>I think that they use the pretense that</v>
<v Speaker 4>there for good things,</v>

745
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they stand for good things to</v>

746
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 4>continue their nefarious activity and</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the most nefarious elements of</v>

747
00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:06.540
<v Speaker 4>their activity is the use of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideological clubs.</v>

748
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the club basically is,</v>

749
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:11.610
<v Speaker 4>here's the club,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the kind of club that you hit</v>

750
00:45:11.611 --> 00:45:14.970
<v Speaker 4>people with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's a difference in outcome,</v>

751
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:19.290
<v Speaker 4>then it's a consequence of consequence</v>
<v Speaker 4>of racism and bias.</v>

752
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.920
<v Speaker 4>And then if I point out the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I'm a good person.</v>

753
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.700
<v Speaker 4>So my little routine for wandering</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the world,</v>

754
00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:30.210
<v Speaker 4>making sure that I'm a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unlike those other people who aren't</v>

755
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:33.510
<v Speaker 4>good people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that need to be punished and</v>

756
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:34.380
<v Speaker 4>perhaps jailed.</v>

757
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.820
<v Speaker 4>I look for inequalities and wherever I</v>
<v Speaker 4>find them,</v>

758
00:45:38.821 --> 00:45:43.821
<v Speaker 4>I attribute them to racism and so that</v>
<v Speaker 4>means I can spend my whole life doing</v>

759
00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:48.990
<v Speaker 4>nothing but being on the side of good by</v>
<v Speaker 4>ferreting out all the evil that resides</v>

760
00:45:48.991 --> 00:45:51.810
<v Speaker 4>in other people and not in me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't trust people like that.</v>

761
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:56.990
<v Speaker 4>I think the continual generation of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these terms is a consequence of the</v>

762
00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:01.470
<v Speaker 4>desire to make that game continue for as</v>
<v Speaker 4>long as possible,</v>

763
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.250
<v Speaker 4>regardless of the consequences so that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who hold those opinions can</v>

764
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 4>always be morally correct and have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole set of enemies to go after.</v>

765
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:11.460
<v Speaker 4>And that's why the terms keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>multiplying.</v>

766
00:46:11.461 --> 00:46:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Because every time society moves to</v>
<v Speaker 4>become more tolerant,</v>

767
00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:17.700
<v Speaker 4>more liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then that interferes with the game.</v>

768
00:46:17.701 --> 00:46:21.060
<v Speaker 4>Because the game is while we have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>find racist and horrible people.</v>

769
00:46:21.061 --> 00:46:22.680
<v Speaker 4>And so the solution to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

770
00:46:22.681 --> 00:46:26.700
<v Speaker 4>let's just continue to generate</v>
<v Speaker 4>categories more and more categories to</v>

771
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:28.500
<v Speaker 4>demonstrate how unequal people are.</v>

772
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the categories are infinitely</v>

773
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.190
<v Speaker 4>divisible and we'll get to that later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a game that never runs out and if</v>

774
00:46:35.191 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 4>you're a professional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're someone whose profession is to</v>

775
00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:42.150
<v Speaker 4>be politically correct or to be a social</v>
<v Speaker 4>justice warrior,</v>

776
00:46:42.151 --> 00:46:45.000
<v Speaker 4>and that might be an academic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially a marxist one,</v>

777
00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:48.330
<v Speaker 4>and in all sorts of sub disciplines will</v>
<v Speaker 4>also get to that later,</v>

778
00:46:48.331 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 4>like sociology and social work and many</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the social sciences apart from those</v>

779
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:57.771
<v Speaker 4>two and educational psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another major offender in social</v>

780
00:46:58.921 --> 00:47:02.100
<v Speaker 4>psychology and other major offender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you're,</v>

781
00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:07.130
<v Speaker 4>you're publicly subsidized for your damn</v>
<v Speaker 4>viewpoints and if you can continue to</v>

782
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.190
<v Speaker 4>make the case that the world is full of</v>
<v Speaker 4>racists,</v>

783
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:14.970
<v Speaker 4>racists and people possessed by ethnic</v>
<v Speaker 4>hatred,</v>

784
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm persecuting the poor and minorities.</v>

785
00:47:19.651 --> 00:47:22.920
<v Speaker 4>That your shtick lasts forever and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can fully justify your,</v>

786
00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:27.750
<v Speaker 4>your subsidized position as well as</v>
<v Speaker 4>being on the side of right and morality</v>

787
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.920
<v Speaker 4>and making the world better place.</v>

788
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.820
<v Speaker 4>WhAt a good deal for everyone who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>politically correct</v>

789
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.970
<v Speaker 4>definition of discrimination and</v>
<v Speaker 4>harassment.</v>

790
00:47:39.971 --> 00:47:41.530
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are truly terrifying</v>

791
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:46.330
<v Speaker 4>discrimination happens when a person</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences negative treatment or impact</v>

792
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:50.320
<v Speaker 4>intentional or not because of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender identity or gender expression.</v>

793
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:51.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that could be age,</v>

794
00:47:51.611 --> 00:47:52.510
<v Speaker 4>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>race,</v>

795
00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:55.450
<v Speaker 4>etc. Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about that sentence.</v>

796
00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 4>Discrimination happens when a person</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences negative treatment or</v>

797
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:02.140
<v Speaker 4>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

798
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:04.000
<v Speaker 4>So let's say negative impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

799
00:48:04.001 --> 00:48:07.780
<v Speaker 4>so what that means is that if I say</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that makes you feel negative</v>

800
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 4>emotion or maybe even interferes with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your happiness because those are</v>

801
00:48:10.811 --> 00:48:15.280
<v Speaker 4>actually separate things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you've experienced negative impact.</v>

802
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:16.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

803
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.960
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's bad enough because it means that</v>

804
00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:23.620
<v Speaker 4>you get to decide when what I've said is</v>
<v Speaker 4>not appropriate,</v>

805
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:27.520
<v Speaker 4>but the worst part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not so good because you could</v>

806
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:31.450
<v Speaker 4>misunderstand me or maybe what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying is right and you just don't like</v>

807
00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:33.340
<v Speaker 4>it or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole variety of reasons you</v>

808
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:38.341
<v Speaker 4>might get upset about what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the fact that you get upset about</v>

809
00:48:38.641 --> 00:48:40.380
<v Speaker 4>something that's negative impact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

810
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.670
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't necessarily mean that</v>
<v Speaker 4>something bad is how it might even mean</v>

811
00:48:45.671 --> 00:48:47.320
<v Speaker 4>that something's good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good has happened.</v>

812
00:48:47.321 --> 00:48:51.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I've ever learned anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my entire life that wasn't preceded</v>

813
00:48:51.521 --> 00:48:54.880
<v Speaker 4>by some kind of negative impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We always learn things the hard way,</v>

814
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.030
<v Speaker 4>but the worst part of it is the next</v>
<v Speaker 4>phrase,</v>

815
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 4>discrimination happens when a person</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences negative treatment or</v>

816
00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 4>impact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intentional or not.</v>

817
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:05.320
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here,</v>

818
00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.580
<v Speaker 4>think about this.</v>

819
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:10.470
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

820
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:13.380
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have little children and maybe</v>

821
00:49:13.381 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 4>one one runs into the other knox,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knox,</v>

822
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:21.210
<v Speaker 4>even your child down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you set your child up and the first</v>

823
00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:22.530
<v Speaker 4>thing you say is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

824
00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:26.490
<v Speaker 4>barbie didn't mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason you say that is beCause</v>

825
00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.490
<v Speaker 4>we've learned and this is painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>

826
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.830
<v Speaker 4>This is A painful thing that human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings have learned.</v>

827
00:49:31.831 --> 00:49:36.390
<v Speaker 4>It's at the base of our modern legal</v>
<v Speaker 4>systems that intent matters.</v>

828
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.540
<v Speaker 4>It isn't consequences that you judge its</v>
<v Speaker 4>intent.</v>

829
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:42.990
<v Speaker 4>If I accidentally run into you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's way different than if I run into</v>

830
00:49:42.991 --> 00:49:45.030
<v Speaker 4>you on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

831
00:49:45.031 --> 00:49:46.200
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

832
00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.540
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I kill you accidentally,</v>

833
00:49:48.541 --> 00:49:51.660
<v Speaker 4>that's manslaughter at at its worst,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I kill you with intent,</v>

834
00:49:51.661 --> 00:49:52.470
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

835
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:56.820
<v Speaker 4>that's the worst form of homicide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We judge people on intent,</v>

836
00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:01.320
<v Speaker 4>northern consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so this policy is designed to</v>

837
00:50:01.321 --> 00:50:04.440
<v Speaker 4>reverse that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'S now possible that you can didn't</v>

838
00:50:04.441 --> 00:50:08.760
<v Speaker 4>discriminate against someone and violate</v>
<v Speaker 4>the law and and I think maybe even be</v>

839
00:50:08.761 --> 00:50:13.110
<v Speaker 4>persecuted for hate crimes because this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is written in such a messy manner by</v>

840
00:50:13.111 --> 00:50:15.840
<v Speaker 4>doing somethIng accidental or</v>
<v Speaker 4>intentional or not</v>

841
00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:19.900
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's going to judge that?</v>

842
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.550
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can imagine who's going to judge</v>

843
00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The kind of people who would dare to</v>

844
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:24.544
<v Speaker 4>judge that</v>

845
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:29.570
<v Speaker 2>harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harassment is a fOrm of discrimination.</v>

846
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:35.410
<v Speaker 2>It can include sexually explicit or</v>
<v Speaker 2>other inappropriate comments,</v>

847
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.870
<v Speaker 2>not defined questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes,</v>

848
00:50:38.871 --> 00:50:39.561
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling,</v>

849
00:50:39.561 --> 00:50:41.600
<v Speaker 2>images,</v>
<v Speaker 2>email and social media.</v>

850
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.080
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say wHat email and social</v>
<v Speaker 2>media content,</v>

851
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 2>just email and social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is anotheR indication of the</v>

852
00:50:48.051 --> 00:50:50.270
<v Speaker 2>appalling level of literacy behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

853
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:53.030
<v Speaker 2>behind these statements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transphobiC,</v>

854
00:50:53.031 --> 00:50:54.560
<v Speaker 2>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or other bullying,</v>

855
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:58.430
<v Speaker 2>sexual advances touching another</v>
<v Speaker 2>unwelcome and ongoing behavior that</v>

856
00:50:58.431 --> 00:50:59.990
<v Speaker 2>insults demeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harms are threatened.</v>

857
00:50:59.991 --> 00:51:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Some person in some way.</v>

858
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the first thing you might note is</v>

859
00:51:06.201 --> 00:51:09.200
<v Speaker 2>that this has been written to cover the</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadest possible range of</v>

860
00:51:09.201 --> 00:51:11.750
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the exact opposite of what good</v>

861
00:51:11.751 --> 00:51:16.430
<v Speaker 2>legislation does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you combine these discrimination</v>

862
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:21.580
<v Speaker 2>and harassment that the the policies</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically allow for people to like if I,</v>

863
00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:28.070
<v Speaker 2>if I unintentionally negatively impact</v>
<v Speaker 2>you with a joke,</v>

864
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.230
<v Speaker 2>then I'm harassing you and that's well</v>
<v Speaker 2>on its way to being well to violation of</v>

865
00:51:33.231 --> 00:51:36.770
<v Speaker 2>the ontario human rights code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an offense according to the ontario</v>

866
00:51:36.771 --> 00:51:40.310
<v Speaker 2>human rights commission and it's on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to being a hate crime as far as I</v>

867
00:51:40.311 --> 00:51:42.890
<v Speaker 2>can tell with the modifications of</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal legislation.</v>

868
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.200
<v Speaker 2>So and then to cap it all off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they throw this in at the end of the</v>

869
00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:53.180
<v Speaker 2>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other unwelcome and ongoing behavior</v>

870
00:51:53.181 --> 00:51:57.350
<v Speaker 2>that insults demeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harms or threatens a person in some way.</v>

871
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's all pretty scary,</v>

872
00:52:01.321 --> 00:52:06.321
<v Speaker 2>but then there's more of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is the ontario human rights</v>

873
00:52:06.391 --> 00:52:10.200
<v Speaker 2>commission developing policies on</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizational liability.</v>

874
00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:15.620
<v Speaker 2>So listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Organizations are liable for any</v>

875
00:52:15.631 --> 00:52:18.090
<v Speaker 2>discrimination and harassment that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

876
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:22.480
<v Speaker 2>They are also liable for not</v>
<v Speaker 2>accommodating and a trans person needs,</v>

877
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:24.360
<v Speaker 2>unless it would cause undue hardship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

878
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.180
<v Speaker 2>the whole issue of undue hardship is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tricky one because I'm not exactly sure</v>

879
00:52:28.181 --> 00:52:31.810
<v Speaker 2>who adjudicates that in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

880
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.770
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to that later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must deal with complaints,</v>

881
00:52:35.771 --> 00:52:39.160
<v Speaker 2>take steps to prevent problems and</v>
<v Speaker 2>provide a safe welcoming environment for</v>

882
00:52:39.161 --> 00:52:40.240
<v Speaker 2>trans people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

883
00:52:40.241 --> 00:52:41.200
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

884
00:52:41.201 --> 00:52:43.750
<v Speaker 2>old people and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ethnic,</v>

885
00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:48.010
<v Speaker 2>ethnically diverse people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently gendered people and all of</v>

886
00:52:48.011 --> 00:52:52.180
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fine organizations are liable for any</v>

887
00:52:52.181 --> 00:52:54.250
<v Speaker 2>discrimination and harassment that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

888
00:52:54.251 --> 00:52:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that puts a hell of an onus on the</v>

889
00:52:56.531 --> 00:53:00.220
<v Speaker 2>organization because it isn't exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear to me how organizations are going</v>

890
00:53:00.221 --> 00:53:04.960
<v Speaker 2>to monitor all of their people all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time in the organizations.</v>

891
00:53:04.961 --> 00:53:07.720
<v Speaker 2>What if they're using social media</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside the organization?</v>

892
00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:11.020
<v Speaker 2>So organizations are now liable for all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>

893
00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:12.610
<v Speaker 2>So how are you going to police all that?</v>

894
00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:14.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next</v>

895
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:17.940
<v Speaker 2>more on liability</v>

896
00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.350
<v Speaker 2>from the ontario human rights code under</v>
<v Speaker 2>section 46 point three of the code,</v>

897
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Speaker 2>a corporation trade union or</v>
<v Speaker 2>occupational association,</v>

898
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:30.630
<v Speaker 2>unincorporated association or employees</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>

899
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Now listen to this will be held</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for discrimination including</v>

900
00:53:36.211 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 2>acts or omissions committed by employees</v>
<v Speaker 2>or agents in the course of their</v>

901
00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:42.870
<v Speaker 2>employment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is known as vicarious liability.</v>

902
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Responsible parties violate the code.</v>

903
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Now this is where it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where it gets horrible,</v>

904
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I think where they directly or</v>
<v Speaker 2>indirectly,</v>

905
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:56.010
<v Speaker 2>intentionally or unintentionally</v>
<v Speaker 2>infringed the code or rather the</v>

906
00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:58.500
<v Speaker 2>otherwise authorized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>condoned or adopt behavior that is</v>

907
00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:01.560
<v Speaker 2>contrary to the code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is unacceptable to choose to remain</v>

908
00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:04.800
<v Speaker 2>unaware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignore or fail to address potential or</v>

909
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:08.490
<v Speaker 2>actual human rights violations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not a complaint is made,</v>

910
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:13.970
<v Speaker 2>god you couldn't possibly design a</v>
<v Speaker 2>broader definition of liability</v>

911
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:19.970
<v Speaker 2>potential or actual human rights</v>
<v Speaker 2>violations.</v>

912
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not a complaint is made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

913
00:54:22.191 --> 00:54:26.420
<v Speaker 2>so does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that you have vicarious</v>

914
00:54:26.421 --> 00:54:31.421
<v Speaker 2>liability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you fail to address a potential human</v>

915
00:54:34.691 --> 00:54:37.810
<v Speaker 2>rights violation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not a complaint is made.</v>

916
00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.910
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I can say about</v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation that's written in this</v>

917
00:54:45.911 --> 00:54:49.960
<v Speaker 2>manner is that it seems to me to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciously designed to get as many</v>

918
00:54:49.961 --> 00:54:52.540
<v Speaker 2>people in trouble as possible.</v>

919
00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:55.831
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

920
00:54:55.831 --> 00:54:57.910
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's designed to get as many people as</v>

921
00:54:57.911 --> 00:54:59.620
<v Speaker 2>possible in trouble at the same time,</v>

922
00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:08.180
<v Speaker 5>so that brings us to the end of part one</v>
<v Speaker 5>of this talk on political correctness in</v>

923
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:14.300
<v Speaker 5>it described the increasing fear that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>spread by politically correct activism</v>

924
00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.770
<v Speaker 5>throughout large organizations including</v>
<v Speaker 5>academic institutions like the</v>

925
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:24.771
<v Speaker 5>university of toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I also discussed the increasing all</v>

926
00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:29.700
<v Speaker 5>pervasiveness of this viewpoint because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not something that's localized</v>

927
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:34.701
<v Speaker 5>anymore to academic institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's spread beyond them and his is</v>

928
00:55:36.991 --> 00:55:41.991
<v Speaker 5>characteristic of the preoccupations of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a certain kind of administrator at a</v>

929
00:55:44.911 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 5>very large multitude of large</v>
<v Speaker 5>organizations.</v>

930
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:52.120
<v Speaker 5>And I described in detail the canadian</v>
<v Speaker 5>bill [inaudible],</v>

931
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:56.190
<v Speaker 5>which is an attempt to modify the</v>
<v Speaker 5>canadian human rights code and the</v>

932
00:55:56.191 --> 00:56:01.191
<v Speaker 5>criminal code a to make a whole variety</v>
<v Speaker 5>of speech acts and the holding of</v>

933
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:05.040
<v Speaker 5>certain opinions or the articulate</v>
<v Speaker 5>lading of them,</v>

934
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:08.790
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>criminal and maybe even criminal under</v>

935
00:56:08.791 --> 00:56:11.370
<v Speaker 5>the provisions of the hate of hate crime</v>
<v Speaker 5>legislation.</v>

936
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.680
<v Speaker 5>In part two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to give you a more detailed</v>

937
00:56:16.681 --> 00:56:20.970
<v Speaker 5>analysis of the university of toronto's</v>
<v Speaker 5>attempts to transform its hr department</v>

938
00:56:20.971 --> 00:56:25.390
<v Speaker 5>into a politically correct organization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm using the,</v>

939
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:30.570
<v Speaker 5>the goals of the university of toronto</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a cautionary tale about how such</v>

940
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.970
<v Speaker 5>political maneuvers operate at a local</v>
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>

941
00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.880
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the principle that a good story about</v>

942
00:56:39.881 --> 00:56:44.800
<v Speaker 5>something local is a good story about</v>
<v Speaker 5>something with general significance.</v>

943
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:48.010
<v Speaker 5>In part three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to talk about what individuals</v>

944
00:56:48.011 --> 00:56:50.710
<v Speaker 5>can do about these sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you as a citizen,</v>

945
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 5>how you as a citizen might arm yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>intellectually so that you can</v>

946
00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:00.900
<v Speaker 5>articulate a stance against this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>movement if you feel that that's in your</v>

947
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 5>best interests.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks for listening.</v>
